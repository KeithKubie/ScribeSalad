00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.130
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.920
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.640
December 12th, 2016 what's going on? How are you, uh,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.700
I've gotta be a little quiet man. It's only like six 30 in the morning out here,

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.810
but my lovely wife is still sleeping and uh,

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.500
so I'm trying not to wake her up. Um, upstairs can try to be a good boy,

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.340
these folk and weaker, right? I'm still gonna say all the fucked up shit.

8
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:28.740
I always say, I'm just going to say it at a volume that's, you know,

9
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:32.520
a little more palatable thought down, throttled slapping. You know,

10
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:37.521
I woke up this morning by [inaudible] I heard this big fucking booming noise and

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.960
uh, you ever get that feeling like you're like,

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:44.520
did I just dream that or somebody in the house, right?

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.410
And then you immediately start thinking like, all right, I got kitchen knives.

14
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.050
I got a fucking softball bat right next to my bed. And, uh,

15
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.210
but the reality is, you know,

16
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.960
as much as people are want gun control and all of that shit,

17
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.920
I mean that's the first thing you think of. You know, the radio,

18
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:12.670
you know, this should be a fucking thing, right? Where if you can, if you,

19
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.650
if they can fucking test you one God damn time,

20
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.170
so like five fucking questions,

21
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.760
then all of a sudden you never have to go through any sort of fucking, you know,

22
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:28.470
major security at the airport because one time you didn't act like a fucking

23
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:31.230
lunatic and then I guess you're good for the rest of your life.

24
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.610
Why can't just like one time they can't come up with the same type of a test,

25
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:37.470
whatever the fuck they see down at the airport.

26
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
They can't come up with that for fucking regular people, you know,

27
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.081
you know,

28
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:47.670
be perfect just to have a fucking 38 and they let you have a silencer now.

29
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.180
Fuck that. A Glock with the silencer cause you don't want to ruin your ears.

30
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.260
You just want to kill the person that comes in your house. Right. It'd be great.

31
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.690
Be Right there next to your table and the person comes walking in,

32
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:00.680
you know faggy man, are you fucking money? Just reach over to,

33
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.400
to the fucking hit the ground. You put the gun back down.

34
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.610
You just go back to sleep and you know, a couple of hours way back up again.

35
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.230
You like it was, I say your brother lock him up. Oh. Oh,

36
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:17.340
that's right. That's right. Ali. Yeah. While you were sleeping,

37
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.460
some guy broken. Yeah. [inaudible] um,

38
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.420
you want to Wa you want to call the cops? I'll get some a, you know,

39
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:28.380
get the coffee going. You know,

40
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.400
everybody, you know, they tell you don't have a knife or anything like that.

41
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:35.130
You want back, we'll give you distance. But at the end of the day,

42
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.770
you know what I mean? There has to be some sort of test.

43
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.850
They look at you fucking driving record, right? How you did in high school.

44
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:43.820
Jesus. I'd be out the window. I don't know what the fuck.

45
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.800
However the fuck they do it. Okay. And you know, you just get, you get,

46
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.340
you get a glock with the fucking silencer. You don't hurt your ears, you know,

47
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.080
aim center mass or whatever be, it would be a great fucking thing.

48
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.340
I really think it would be a great thing. You know,

49
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.210
as long as you knew what everybody's feet sounded like on the floor in your

50
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.360
house, as long as you knew what you knew, what their walks sounded like,

51
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:11.380
that would be the test right there. All your loved ones in your house,

52
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.890
they would from bare feet to fucking snow shoes.

53
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:18.310
You just had to be like all, that's my son Mikey.

54
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.170
Okay. That's my wife and she's wearing uggs. Right. And you get it all down.

55
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.710
All right, so then you know what the fucking sound is.

56
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.060
I don't know. I'm just saying I had a little fucking iron annoys.

57
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.980
I get a little nervous and I was just like,

58
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.430
what am I Jason Fucking born over here? I'm not, you know,

59
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.050
my wife's been snoring to beat the fucking band now that she's in the third

60
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:46.480
trimester, which is understandable. The kids laying on her fucking lungs. So A,

61
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.300
I have to go upstairs to sleep and I,

62
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:53.260
I had all of this shit went through my fucking head. All right.

63
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.470
Like what if somebody came and downstairs took out my wife and left with no

64
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:01.630
fucking fingerprints? They're gonna fucking blame me.

65
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:03.880
That's the first thing I thought. Not, oh my God,

66
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.590
my pregnant wife was going to be dead.

67
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.980
First thing I thought is I'm going to go to jail for that shit. That's what,

68
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.980
you know, I'm really selfish when I'm in the middle of the night,

69
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:16.250
I'm really groggy. Like, like right now I'm awake. And I'd be like, well, I,

70
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.180
I would be too. I wouldn't give a fuck what they did to me at that point.

71
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.980
I'd be so upset that I lost my wife.

72
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:23.890
But when I'm laying here nice and toasty under the sheets,

73
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:27.100
that's the first thing I thought of. Like, Oh man, I love this bed. That man,

74
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:28.300
I wouldn't have this bed and jail

75
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.030
anyways. Um, we're getting down to a people.

76
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.320
There's only another fucking, uh, 19 days left in

77
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.571
this year to fuck Christmas, by the way.

78
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:47.410
Fuck Christmas right up the old fucking Yahoo. All right.

79
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.640
Fuck that stupid ass fucking holidays for fucking kids.

80
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.080
The level of fucking pressure I have to run around and buy fucking adults

81
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.200
fucking presence. What do you want to shoot? You train. You fucking can't.

82
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.430
I don't have time for this shit. I got too much other stuff to do it.

83
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.350
They needed that that day. Yeah.

84
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.150
<v 0>It's fucking brutal, man. I had one of the worst, one of the worst. Fuck.</v>

86
00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:15.140
I wasn't going to talk about this.

87
00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:18.080
I had one of the worst fucking weeks of my life and this Christmas music in the

88
00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:19.640
background is fucking driving me nuts.

89
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.240
I'm going to gloss over all of this shit because, um,

90
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.530
I've never gotten emotional on the podcast. I do not want to do it now. Uh,

91
00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:27.831
you know,

92
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:32.330
I told you one of my good friends died and went to the memorial service and you

93
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.580
know is too, you know, he's got two kids, 10 years old,

94
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:39.870
went up and spoke at it was the most heart wrenching thing I ever saw.

95
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:41.070
And then Thursday,

96
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.940
I know this is going to be probably devastating to a lot of you guys.

97
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.360
I had to give my dog away. Yes. Oh,

98
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.290
cleo. I had to do it.

99
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.350
I got a baby coming and I'm the Cleo that you hear on the podcast is not the

100
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.240
Cleo that I'm

101
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.460
unfortunately when anybody else comes to the door. And uh, you know,

102
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.270
she tried to attack my parents, my brother in law, my father in law,

103
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.650
all of my friends, she bit,

104
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.290
one of my friends nipped him and was just like, uh, it,

105
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.193
you know,

106
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.780
it was a ticking fucking time bond for seven years with the dog.

107
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.930
I love the dog to death. My wife loves the dog.

108
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.730
It was fucking devastated. It's the most devastating thing I've had to do.

109
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.880
It's just one of those adult decisions where it was like my brain was like,

110
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:39.410
there's no fucking way you can have a baby crawling around that then becomes a

111
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:42.680
toddler and they don't know how to fucking pet a dog.

112
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.820
And then she gets a little older and then has friends over and their parents

113
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:51.500
come over. It was just a, it was a ticking time bomb.

114
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.530
She does not do well adjusting to new things and something horrible was going to

115
00:06:56.631 --> 00:07:00.470
happen and then she was going to get put down so I had to do the responsible

116
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:03.860
thing and a founder a great home.

117
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.390
And this is what kills me is she's totally adjusted now and it's fucking

118
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:12.470
happiest shit and I'm fucking devastated cause she's a fucking dog and within

119
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:16.760
four days, so like, oh is this the new deal? You're the guy now. Alright.

120
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.270
Um, so um,

121
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:21.683
<v 1>okay</v>

122
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.490
<v 0>I'll tell you a quick story dude.</v>

123
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.670
Fucking I had the hand the dog off to my trainer, right?

124
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.500
So the whole morning I don't want to act emotional cause I don't want the dog to

125
00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:35.790
be nervous and uh, so I took her on one last hike,

126
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.730
it was fucking brutal and I'm,

127
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.150
then I was gathering up all his stuff.

128
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.840
I give it all to the trainer and I go to hand off the fucking dog and it's like

129
00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:50.610
I didn't want her to be nervous so I barely even said goodbye.

130
00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:52.410
I was like all right buddy. Okay. See you later.

131
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.810
Cause I didn't want it to be nervous cause I love it so much.

132
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.870
And then I fucking, you know,

133
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.290
you know the trainer takes it and then I went back in the house,

134
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:04.840
went in the bathroom and then fucking cried like a little boy.

135
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.780
It was fucking brutal. Brutal. You know,

136
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:14.320
it's fucking hilarious the way women handle this fucking emotion,

137
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.310
like my wife like sobbed like five or six fucking times,

138
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.370
including the night before. And then they,

139
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:29.630
their ability to fucking move ahead is,

140
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.280
is fucking astounding. Like they can, they can,

141
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.700
no, it's sad deal with it being sad.

142
00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:40.620
They fucking cry it out of them.

143
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.510
And then I'm not saying she's not heartbroken, she's fucking devastated.

144
00:08:45.511 --> 00:08:47.820
But like their ability,

145
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.150
their fucking ability to handle shit like that versus a guy guys fucking denied,

146
00:08:53.341 --> 00:08:56.940
denied, denied and then they hold onto the shit. You know what I mean?

147
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:59.640
Everybody's got that fucking buddy of theirs, you know what I mean?

148
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.570
They're married, they got a couple of kids, but you get like two,

149
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.040
three scotches in 'em. They talk,

150
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.750
start talking about some broad from fucking 25 years ago. It's like, dude,

151
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.900
when are you going to let it go? Cause you know, we were not allowed.

152
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.590
Like when I cried over my dog the whole time I was fighting itself,

153
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:21.880
it was like an eight second cry. [inaudible] done. All right.

154
00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:24.700
Fight it off her. Just keep it right there in your chest.

155
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.860
Keep it fucking right there. And then, you know,

156
00:09:26.861 --> 00:09:28.900
I'm telling you fucking like nine years from now,

157
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.350
be at a fucking Christmas party and have a couple too,

158
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.590
too many fucking zinfandels. And I'll lash out at somebody and they'd be like,

159
00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:37.270
dude, where the fuck did that come from? And it's,

160
00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:40.870
and I'm not even going to know it's going to be because I didn't hug my dog

161
00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:42.370
before. I mean, I definitely, you know,

162
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.400
I did with the days coming up and that type of shit,

163
00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:48.130
but I should've given it one last fucking hug, but I knew I couldn't do it,

164
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.230
you know? Um, so all right, let's pass that.

165
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.060
Let's get past that anyways.

166
00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:57.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

167
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.890
<v 0>So I went to the rams game yesterday. Uh, by the way,</v>

168
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:05.570
I did hit pause to regroup. Brutal,

169
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.480
brutal fucking [inaudible].

170
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.680
And the whole fucking time I got to sit and listen to fucking Christmas music

171
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:15.000
everywhere I go in Florida. You know,

172
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.630
if I had a hammer, I'd hammer. Is that a fucking Christmas song?

173
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.420
It's kind of a fucking psycho song, right? Second adults is, if I had a hammer,

174
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.800
we all know what a hammer is for two. All right? I don't know.

175
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.280
I always get nervous when I hear that first sentence, if I had a hammer. Um,

176
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.300
anyways, so I went to the rams for, um,

177
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.790
the Atlanta Falcons game yesterday.

178
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.460
A buddy of mine had tickets and uh, I was like, dude, I gotta go.

179
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:49.461
Cause I really wanted to see the Los Angeles Rams playing in the La Memorial

180
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.020
Coliseum. I mean, that's where all the greats played from the rams history.

181
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.280
Right. I believe Eric Dickerson played there before he went to, uh,

182
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.630
before they moved down to Anaheim.

183
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.870
Probably the last of the greatest to play there. Uh,

184
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.810
the fearsome foursome, right? Lamar, Lamar, Lundy,

185
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.340
Merlin Olsen, Rosie Greer, Deacon Jones.

186
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.660
Whether that was Roman Gabriel, that was all before my time.

187
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:22.350
Then I came in when it was the fucking quarterback controversy of Pat Hayden,

188
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:26.490
Vince Ferragamo, Wendell Tyler,

189
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.620
right? Jim and Jack Young blood. What was crazy about them as back then,

190
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:34.680
if somebody had the same always, if somebody has the same last name as you,

191
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.660
they put just your first initial and then a period. But it was Jack and Jim.

192
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.560
So they had to write their whole names and said Jack Young blood on the back.

193
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:47.130
It never looked right. It looked fucking weird. Um,

194
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.980
but anyways, um, I went there and, uh, it was the typical,

195
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.350
uh, sporting experience that you,

196
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.270
a lot of times where there's just as many fans, if not more fans,

197
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:05.230
because it's a transience city. It really has nothing to do with La fans.

198
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:09.730
There's just so many people like myself that moved out here, you know,

199
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.490
chasing the old Hollywood dream. Or if people are just fucking sick of, um,

200
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.710
you know, just bad weather. People are just always fucking moving it,

201
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:22.690
by the way, dude, I'm telling you right now, dude,

202
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.560
this fucking real estate bubble out here of them building all of these fucking

203
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.480
luxury apartment buildings.

204
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.760
You know where I fucking go over and play hockey the,

205
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.770
they got this thing of the Pickwick,

206
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:36.430
a hockey thing that's also a bowling alley and a function room.

207
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.860
They fucking knock in that whole thing down,

208
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.950
knocking that whole fucking thing down. Cause they're gonna

209
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.220
have luxury apartments.

210
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:47.260
It's just there's going to be no place to skate out here.

211
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.180
The one that was over in fucking, was it century city or some shit?

212
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.640
Get confused over there. Begins with a c and ain't cut. I don't know what it is.

213
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.720
They fucking, that one's done. Now this one's gone. The only one. That one's,

214
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:01.180
I know there's one down by the airport and there's one over near him,

215
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:05.320
like a near Sherman Oaks Valley Ice Center.

216
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.020
And other than that, uh, I don't know.

217
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.270
I left the fucking go buy some roller blades, right?

218
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.260
Some little fucking short shorts do that stupid thing. You know,

219
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:18.250
we set up the cones and you'd come up to them and turn around backwards, right?

220
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.570
Um, anyways, uh, yeah dude.

221
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:31.900
So they have a, so they had this distinct put up, this fucking one building,

222
00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:36.580
right. And a really impressive building. It's over near Beverly Hills.

223
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:38.920
So I was just like, Hey, you know, let's see what that build is about.

224
00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:43.090
I go on the Internet, right? It's called the 10,000. I'm like, all right,

225
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:44.130
why is it called the 10 dot?

226
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.880
It's called the 10,000 because that's the amount of money,

227
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.700
money you have to pay a month to live there because bare minimum,

228
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.960
how fucking Takis? Like how many times are we going to fucking do this?

229
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.530
You know what I mean? It's like we always act.

230
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.670
There's always like some sort of like trash and everybody fucking loses

231
00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:04.900
everything. And by everybody,

232
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:09.901
I mean the fucking lower 99% gets their fucking asses kicked and then,

233
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.740
you know, give it a couple of years.

234
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.620
Then all of a sudden it just comes right back out around again to the bud.

235
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.850
Fox greed is good dude. How fucking tacky is that?

236
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.390
The name of the building is the minimal.

237
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.730
This is how much you're paying and rent.

238
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.460
Jesus Christ have a little bit of fucking class. Um,

239
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.350
yeah, they're just everywhere. They're putting up luxury apartments.

240
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.050
I don't know where the fuck they going to find all these people to, to,

241
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.860
to fill these things, but I guarantee you, um, they're not going to do it.

242
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:44.380
Like I was thinking of buying a small apartment building out here,

243
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:45.910
but everybody's fucking buying them up.

244
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.260
I can't even afford to fucking get in one or you know, just cause it's stupid.

245
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:54.750
It's like at the height, the fucking market, you know,

246
00:14:54.751 --> 00:14:57.960
I was thinking of buying like a parking garage or some shit. Just a parking lot,

247
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.350
you know? Fuck. Are All these people going to park? You said building,

248
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.730
parking underneath the goddamn things. Yeah, they got it all figured out.

249
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.780
You know, I guess I'll be telling jokes for the rest of my fucking life.

250
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:10.580
I'm trying to have some sort of something,

251
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:14.780
a lemonade stand or something where I get into my older fucking years.

252
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.740
I got some sort of loot coming in that doesn't have to do with me fucking

253
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:22.970
putting on my tap dancing shoes. I don't know. So anyways, I went to the, um,

254
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.100
the, uh,

255
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.240
Los Angeles Rams game yesterday and it was so great to see them play there even

256
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:30.770
though they had a fucking brutal game.

257
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.450
They were down 42 to nothing to Maddie ice and fucking, uh,

258
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.220
uh, fucking the rams and I, I mean the,

259
00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:43.820
the Falcons and evidently their best receiver, whoever the fuck that is,

260
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.940
Julio Jones is some shit. I think I heard that name.

261
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:48.360
I is that a baseball player? I Dunno.

262
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.530
I don't play fantasy sports and I'm too fucking busy to really pay attention as

263
00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:52.364
much as I used to.

264
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.130
He wasn't even playing and they just kicked the shit out of him. You know,

265
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:59.150
it was funny. The rams finally scored a touchdown, right to make it 42 to seven,

266
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:00.740
and they lit the Olympic torch.

267
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.080
I'm sure they just light it late at night,

268
00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:08.840
but it seemed like that's when I first noticed that it was on.

269
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.310
And then they also had a, a, a fumble recovery for a touchdown.

270
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.310
The crowd's going nuts. So whenever that happens live,

271
00:16:16.311 --> 00:16:19.520
the first thing I do is try to pick up a referee to see if I see,

272
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:23.000
you know him going, no, no, no, no, no. It's a dead ball.

273
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:26.600
Or if he say and touchdown. And as the guy was crossing the Golan,

274
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:29.000
you could see the ref was already going. No, no, no.

275
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:30.770
Pointing at the ground saying was, you know,

276
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.930
neither the guy was down or whatever. Right. And the fucking fireworks guy,

277
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.380
the fucking fireworks guy shoots the fireworks off on a touchdown that got

278
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:45.350
called back. It's fucking hilarious because they're not selling out games.

279
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.370
You know, that probably got, I bet that guy got chewed out.

280
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.270
Fucking owner probably came down his camel hair coat. You know,

281
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.350
where the fuck is a God damn fireworks guy. I'm sorry,

282
00:16:57.351 --> 00:17:01.060
Mr Mr fucking owner. I have to shut the fuck up, right?

283
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.940
It's coming out of your pay. It's down there fucking crying. Um,

284
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.260
but it was just such a great stadium. It holds 90,000 people for the life of me.

285
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.120
Can somebody explain to me

286
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.810
why the Los Angeles Rams need a new football stadium?

287
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.780
There's a football stadium, there's two of them.

288
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.010
There's the rose bowl and there's the fucking La Memorial Coliseum.

289
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.900
Why do we have to take more fucking natural resources out of the fucking earth

290
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.120
to build another one of these stupid ass fucking stadiums? How's it?

291
00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:37.700
They get to have luxury boxes and put all the bells and whistles on it,

292
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.120
you know,

293
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.320
so they can attract people who aren't into sports to go to the fucking event.

294
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.310
I love that fucking stadium. I had a great time. I love that.

295
00:17:47.311 --> 00:17:50.520
It's a so called shit hole. I think it's great.

296
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:56.390
Do you know there was 62 steps to get from fucking where I was seating sitting

297
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.900
back up to the main concourse to fucking walk out of the stadium.

298
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.610
It's fucking tremendous. 62 steps, you know,

299
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.020
it makes you drink less. You're burning a bunch of calories,

300
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.320
there's less fat fucks, but now what do they say? Oh, that's a fire hazard.

301
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:14.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

302
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:19.490
<v 0>The inclines to steep and we'll get with fucking was so soft in this fucking</v>

303
00:18:19.491 --> 00:18:20.030
country.

304
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.150
That's why like everybody's trying to get me all freaked out about having a kid

305
00:18:23.151 --> 00:18:24.800
about how difficult it's going to be.

306
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.650
And I'm not saying it's not going to be difficult, but it's like people,

307
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.220
women used to have kids and then they'd fucking die.

308
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.610
And then the fucking guy had to go out,

309
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.910
bury his wife and get behind a team of oxen,

310
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.770
plow some rocky God damn field and then fucking, I don't know, feed the kid,

311
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.310
I don't know goats milk at that point. I have no idea. And somehow we did it.

312
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.713
<v 3>You know,</v>

313
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.530
<v 0>people who have survived plagues,</v>

314
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.680
I can't fucking be in a house with central air conditioning and heat and all of

315
00:18:57.111 --> 00:19:00.170
this shit. I, I, you know, I mean, how much fucking harder is,

316
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:02.241
Oh God,

317
00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:05.900
I wish parents from fucking in the past could come and listen to [inaudible] the

318
00:19:05.901 --> 00:19:10.220
way people fucking whine and go on and on about themselves,

319
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.910
you know, and the way they lecture people who don't have kids do, do, hey,

320
00:19:13.911 --> 00:19:17.720
you have no idea. Oh my God, it's so, shut the fuck up.

321
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.600
These fucking people coming over, you know,

322
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.580
come paddle it over from Cuba on a fucking refrigerator door,

323
00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:28.630
fighting off sharks. You know, you can't hit,

324
00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:30.710
you can't change a couple of diapers. I'm telling you,

325
00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:35.690
people are fucking dead pussies. They're fucking soft. People are fucking soft.

326
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.620
They fucking bitch, Moan and complain. Yes, yes. There's things in life,

327
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.730
you know, I say at this point with all the modern gadgets,

328
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.040
all right, if you have a job,

329
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.940
if you're not worried about money as far as you have enough fucking money to

330
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:52.800
make your rent and all that stuff, I mean,

331
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.750
a kid shouldn't be any more difficult considering the love back that you're

332
00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:59.790
going to get other than, you know,

333
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.320
a major fucking adjustment and something that's inconvenient. But I mean,

334
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.390
come on. It's difficult. Yeah. Compared to the rest of the, compared to what?

335
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.060
Sitting down and playing police station at fucking 38 years of age. Uh,

336
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.800
I might eat these words, but I mean, I'm just comparing it to the fact that,

337
00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:20.950
you know, it's, people used to live in the fucking middle of nowhere.

338
00:20:20.951 --> 00:20:22.600
They'd have like 14 fucking kids.

339
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.870
I can't handle one. I got all the sports packages, right. I mean, what, I mean,

340
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.640
my fucking life's a joke. Literally.

341
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.843
<v 3>Um,</v>

342
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.770
<v 0>anyways, I, I don't know. Well, let's, let's try to stay on top of it.</v>

343
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.510
I have no fucking idea. Um, why they need a new stadium.

344
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.760
It's, it's, uh, you know, I can't talk and type in my,

345
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.153
<v 3>I'm on</v>

346
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:54.700
<v 0>stick with the bill focus. Oh. And he does it. Um, anyway,</v>

347
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:58.270
so we went to the game and uh, I had a great time and uh,

348
00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.770
the fucking Atlanta fans will like chit the amount of shit-talking.

349
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.730
Dude, there was this one guy, this one fucking guy,

350
00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:13.010
he bought those fucking wide receiver gloves, you know,

351
00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.400
where they have the logo with the team and then they cross the hands and they

352
00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:17.930
put their hands up over their heads. You know,

353
00:21:17.931 --> 00:21:20.780
like when like the fucking franchise player scores a touchdown.

354
00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:24.860
He does that and it looks cool. He was doing that at the end of the game,

355
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.970
just holding his hands up, facing facing the fucking,

356
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.190
um, rams fed. I'm telling you, dude, this guy was like 50.

357
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.270
All right. You know, all wired thin,

358
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.560
you know street dude, right? 50 years old.

359
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.980
And he walked out and he was making, doing a selfie video as he walked out,

360
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.660
you know, talk it, all this shit. It's like, dude, you beat the fucking ramps.

361
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.000
I mean, what's fucking relaxed?

362
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.060
You're not beating the giants in at beaten Seattle.

363
00:21:57.061 --> 00:22:00.030
You're not beating the cowboys. You not doing shit this year.

364
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.580
Fucking guy running out like they just want to play a game.

365
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:04.690
I don't know what it is about me,

366
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:09.250
but I fucking hate when the fans from the visiting team take over a stadium.

367
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:12.290
Even if I don't give a fuck about the team, I respect the ram.

368
00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:15.340
So next thing you know, I'm talking all this shit to rams fan.

369
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.910
I mean to falcons fans in the back of my head. I'm like,

370
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:23.470
why are you doing this bill? You don't give a fuck. It's just a rams fans.

371
00:22:23.471 --> 00:22:26.860
They didn't have any big, they weren't coming with the shit. Talk back.

372
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.220
They couldn't. They were down 42 seven, right?

373
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.580
42 14 I think was the final. So at one point,

374
00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:35.230
you know when they went up 42 to nothing,

375
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.910
all these falcon fancy start Chiton a t l a t.

376
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:44.440
L. A. T. L. N. I just started yelling,

377
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.420
you're a hub city. No one goes to Atlanta.

378
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.820
We pass through your city onto our final destination.

379
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.460
Started yelling all this shit about Delta Airlines.

380
00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:03.210
I believe that that's the hub there. Um,

381
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.820
and afterwards I just started thinking, why do I care? Oh.

382
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:10.090
And then I also screamed at the fucking Atlanta's punter.

383
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.290
He fucking punted the ball and this guy had a nice run back and then he'd get,

384
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:16.180
comes off the field. Now granted,

385
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.780
he could have been mad that he kicked it to the wrong guy or you supposed to

386
00:23:19.781 --> 00:23:20.351
kick it away.

387
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:24.520
But he came off the field and he did the double fucking pulling the Chin straps

388
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:28.510
off. And he was like, fuck screaming all this shit.

389
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.830
He was all upset. I fuck it went off on him.

390
00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:34.420
I don't even remember what the fuck I said.

391
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.710
I was just so beside myself that a punter would talk that level of shit.

392
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:41.640
Like just sit the fuck down. Have,

393
00:23:41.641 --> 00:23:45.920
they washed your uniform once this year, fucking dope.

394
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.810
You're closer to sit in the stands than you are actually being on that fucking

395
00:23:50.811 --> 00:23:52.220
do you know what I mean? You don't, it'd be like,

396
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.590
it'd be like if this guy was in the army and he's,

397
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:58.550
he like peels potatoes and he's talking shit cause he cut his finger or

398
00:23:58.551 --> 00:23:59.384
something like that.

399
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.240
And meanwhile he's sitting around a bunch of people that just came back from the

400
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:04.910
front lines. That's how I look at it. I mean, I might be a content,

401
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:09.260
I have no idea. So anyways, when I was sitting there watching the rams game, um,

402
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.850
I mentioned to my buddy that, uh, how there used to be a, uh,

403
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.570
a football stadium. I couldn't remember the name of it.

404
00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:20.630
I first I said the baker bowl and I was like, I think that might be in Philly.

405
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.280
Um, but there was a, there was a stadium for anybody who lives out here in la.

406
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.150
A lot of people, you know, La is really bad about their history.

407
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.400
And um, they had a stadium, uh,

408
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.080
that was down where the farmer's market is. And on Fairfax.

409
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:41.510
And Beverly was actually a baseball stadium there too.

410
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:42.800
I don't know anything about that.

411
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:47.360
But they had a stadium called the Gilmore Stadium and called Gilmore Stadium and

412
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:50.030
they had a couple of NFL, like all star Games there.

413
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:52.040
And then they had like some defunct football league,

414
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.840
like the La bulldogs or some shit played there. I looked,

415
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:59.510
looked it up on Wikipedia, um, early this morning and I couldn't, uh,

416
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.330
couldn't sleep that well. A little heartbroken.

417
00:25:02.331 --> 00:25:04.730
Billy here couldn't sleep last night. And um,

418
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.070
then the baseball field that was next to it, if you ever watched those classic,

419
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.503
um,

420
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:16.530
home run derbies well they have like Al Kayline versus like Mickey Mantle and

421
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:18.650
Shit and you know, they're in La and you're like,

422
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:21.260
where the fuck is that stadium? Um,

423
00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.690
they filmed a lot of it at the stadium right next to it.

424
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:26.990
And right now there's like the cvs lot there where they film like the prices

425
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:30.110
right and shit. And as I was looking that up, I didn't know this.

426
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:34.700
They actually had a Wrigley field in La that looks like a, from the map,

427
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:38.090
it was near or north of Watts, la,

428
00:25:38.091 --> 00:25:41.360
which is south of the 10 and east of the one 10.

429
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.880
And it was built by the same guy that made Wrigley Field in Chicago and Comiskey

430
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.550
field. I'm a fucking nerd. I like looking up that shit.

431
00:25:49.551 --> 00:25:52.070
I looked up shit about the rams. They've won one Superbowl,

432
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.960
they won it in St Louis, obviously 1999 people will remember that.

433
00:25:56.961 --> 00:26:01.961
And they want an NFL title in 1945 when they were still in Cleveland,

434
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:05.180
which is where they started. So, um,

435
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.750
they've never won an NFL title or a fucking Superbowl here in la.

436
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.400
And I gotta tell you after watching them yesterday,

437
00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:15.020
they don't seem like they're that much closer.

438
00:26:15.021 --> 00:26:17.990
Fucking Jeff Fisher taken all kinds of shit,

439
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:24.020
all kinds of shit. Um, they need to fire them.

440
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:26.210
They need to fire his ass. All right, well who do you think,

441
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:29.540
who else is we going to replace them with? You got to have a replacement.

442
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:31.490
I mean, this guy's been in the fucking league forever.

443
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.750
Did take a team to the Superbowl. However, it was fucking 17 years ago.

444
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.310
He did well with Vince Young, you know, but in defense of him,

445
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.620
you know, if you look at the last,

446
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.890
since the Patriots started going to the Superbowl, okay,

447
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:51.390
the Patriots have gone to six fucking Superbowls. Alright.

448
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.820
And then as far as winning patriots have won,

449
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:57.540
four Steelers won two giants. One, two

450
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.280
packers. One. Why me? It's like literally like every fucking decade.

451
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.940
There's like two or three teams that just fucking run the table and the fucking

452
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:09.870
nineties. It was a cowboys won three Broncos. One, two.

453
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.450
There's half the Superbowl's a fucking gone right there.

454
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.600
And you knew the 49 is we're going to get one and they want for the previous

455
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.580
decade. There's just always that Steelers one for in.

456
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.590
Um, let's look at the 80s. The eighties. It was uh,

457
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.430
49 is one for the Raiders one too.

458
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:34.100
That's six gone right there. Giants. One one.

459
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

460
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.940
<v 0>Redskins won one Redskins. One, two. All right,</v>

461
00:27:40.941 --> 00:27:44.300
so that's four, two and two. You got three teams that want eight of the 10,

462
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.990
and then it was the bears and whatever the fuck else I just said.

463
00:27:47.991 --> 00:27:52.730
I can't remember. Um, one, the other one, uh,

464
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.280
wait a minute. Where does it go? It goes

465
00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.980
Raiders 40 niners

466
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.970
Redskins Raiders 40 niners bears,

467
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.400
giants Redskins 49 is 49. Oh,

468
00:28:08.401 --> 00:28:12.120
giants is the other one's giants and bears one one. Alright, I'm sorry,

469
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.490
I'm getting all fucking nerded out here with the, uh,

470
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:17.680
with the fucking sports talk here. Um,

471
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.680
which I'll probably do a little bit more of, but, um,

472
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:23.010
I probably should do some advertising here, but I want to talk to you guys, uh,

473
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.630
about some shit where, um, I told you I've been starting to get, uh,

474
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.850
my fond someone, you know,

475
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.740
I fucked up my backlash this year with the psychotic nerd thing. Hey,

476
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.700
right. I went through all of that shit through that.

477
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:39.060
I found a great crack chiropractor and then a great misuse,

478
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:43.560
which has led me to this other person that I just went to ooze. Um,

479
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.070
you know, a former like Mr Universe, bodybuilder and all that,

480
00:28:48.071 --> 00:28:50.030
and he's a fucking genius. And everything in a,

481
00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.990
I went to go see this guy because a, I fucked up my rotator cuff like years ago,

482
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.050
I've been trying to just fight through it and all that type of shit.

483
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.080
And I finally went to go see this guy and like I came walking in and you know

484
00:29:04.181 --> 00:29:06.970
those body builders, they spend their lives just looking in the mirror,

485
00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:11.230
you know, with fucking clothes on. He just saw all of my shit. It was it.

486
00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.690
He just went like, I, you shoulders are rotated forward. You left.

487
00:29:16.691 --> 00:29:19.690
One is actually closer to your neck than your right one is.

488
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.320
And then he goes and he goes, stand in the mirror. You see that?

489
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:26.050
Did I brush my teeth every fucking twice a day, right? Two,

490
00:29:26.051 --> 00:29:30.100
three times a fucking day. I've never noticed that Mike. Holy Shit, he's right.

491
00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:34.570
Cause it's rotated in and turned ever so slightly.

492
00:29:34.571 --> 00:29:38.320
It's not like it's like fucking three inches, but you really have to look at it.

493
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.160
And then he goes, all right, do me a favor,

494
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.390
turn your head to the left and turn it to the right.

495
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:47.950
And then he just started smiling because he knew what my fucking issue was. Um,

496
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:49.780
whatever you,

497
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:54.780
that neck muscle is Mike chest and my trap muscles are too fucking tight and you

498
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.240
trap easy muscle, whatever it is,

499
00:29:58.241 --> 00:30:00.040
it goes all the way down to the middle of your back.

500
00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:04.390
But mine is super tight up top and my chest is tight.

501
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.680
So it's pulling everything forward and it's making my shoulders go up.

502
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:13.240
Like my shoulders always go up like, so he gave me this fucking stretch.

503
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.020
Um, even if you don't have this fucking problem, I got to tell,

504
00:30:17.021 --> 00:30:22.021
hopefully I can describe it over the podcast here is just stand up straight,

505
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:26.350
right? And then just lift your chest up,

506
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.070
put your shoulders back, put your fucking shoulders back, lift your chest up,

507
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:32.020
like to like you feel like you're trying to make it.

508
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:36.280
Go to the ceiling and then have your hands, your arms.

509
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:41.260
Bring your arms back behind you, palms up and stretch back as far as you can.

510
00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.071
All right.

511
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:45.040
Like you're totally opening up your chest as you bring your arms back and try to

512
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:47.650
hold that for a minute. Um,

513
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.170
it's been a complete game changing now.

514
00:30:50.171 --> 00:30:52.570
So like my shoulders have come down cause I didn't want to my Seuss,

515
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.210
she beat the fuck out of my neck and uh,

516
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.390
my shoulders a fucking down a little bit more.

517
00:30:58.391 --> 00:31:02.950
But like I swear to God what I used to do, like, um, yoga stretches,

518
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.930
like on one side I could totally like, you know, they always bag,

519
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.250
reach around and grab your arm or whatever that Yoga Shit,

520
00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:12.850
I could totally do it on one side, could not do it on the other side.

521
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:16.090
And I'm for my whole life, like I've had this fucking problem,

522
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:19.010
like one shoulder being higher than the other forever. You know,

523
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.130
when some nurse when I was in high school goes, Oh,

524
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:25.000
you got a little bit of scoliosis. Yeah, your spine is a little curved and blah,

525
00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:28.130
blah blah blah blah. And like, and this fucking who's,

526
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.970
I don't know the fuck she was. I was just like, yeah, that's the problem.

527
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.710
And it wasn't. So I talked to this guy who was just going like, oh yeah,

528
00:31:35.711 --> 00:31:39.850
he goes, I'll have you fucking straightened out in like a month or something.

529
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.691
And uh,

530
00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:45.280
so he gave me these exercises to strengthen up the lower part of the trapezius

531
00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:47.140
or whatever. And for the first time in my life,

532
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:51.760
I'm going to actually be able to sit up straight just naturally. And um,

533
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.130
it, the amount of shit that it is affected,

534
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.750
it's given me back problems like playing drums and stuff like I forever,

535
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:02.650
and having to like a just shit and wondering why when like I sit down,

536
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.670
like why I have to bring the snare higher than I should have to bring it,

537
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.540
you know? And everybody else would just sit down and be, no,

538
00:32:11.541 --> 00:32:12.480
it seems pretty normal to me.

539
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:17.330
I had no fucking idea what the deal was and evidently I was all crooked, up top.

540
00:32:17.331 --> 00:32:18.570
So, um,

541
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.450
I gotta tell you that's something that I've learned this year when the biggest

542
00:32:21.451 --> 00:32:22.380
things I've learned this year,

543
00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.093
<v 4>um,</v>

544
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.960
<v 0>is like how medicine,</v>

545
00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.870
if you go to a shoulder doctor, he's just gonna fucking look at your shoulder.

546
00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.180
You know what I mean? You got to get back dark.

547
00:32:35.181 --> 00:32:37.430
He's just looking at your fucking back. But you go to these,

548
00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:38.900
these messsage and people like that,

549
00:32:38.901 --> 00:32:42.770
they how the whole fucking body works and they understand like, oh,

550
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:44.150
this is pulled out of alignment.

551
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:50.620
It always comes down to balance where it's like these muscles are too tight and

552
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:53.000
the eye muscles on the other side a two weeks.

553
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:55.520
So this is either pulling this forward or pulling this back,

554
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.730
which is causing you to compensate when you walk. And that's like,

555
00:32:58.731 --> 00:32:59.900
you literally have a problem with you,

556
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.210
your left foot because of your right shoulder.

557
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:06.050
It's fucking amazing if you get a good one. All right.

558
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.770
You go to some rugged Robin tug place. She's still gonna have a crooked back,

559
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:13.640
but oh, you're going to walk out with a smile on your face. Sorry.

560
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.110
Um, all right. I know. I haven't been this too funny. All right,

561
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:21.470
I'm going through a lot of shit here. All right, let me, let me read the, um,

562
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.950
let me read the, uh, the advertising here for this week. Okay. Oh Jesus.

563
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:32.780
Here we go. Dollar Shave Club. Everybody. Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing,

564
00:33:32.781 --> 00:33:36.440
affordable raises right to your door every month.

565
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:38.090
So you can get a great shave,

566
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.420
but raises aren't the only thing you need in the bathroom.

567
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.950
What about all the shower stuff? Turns out dollar Shave Club.

568
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:48.710
Thought of that too. You know what the reality is? All you need is shampoo,

569
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.620
shampoo, still soap. If you want to show itself a shampoo,

570
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.400
all these different types of fucking, you know, why did you try,

571
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:59.630
did you pay it back in the day? You sat in a fucking tub? You know,

572
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:06.110
they, they didn't have any soap that they, and like kill a fucking,

573
00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:07.280
go to some shit. I don't know.

574
00:34:07.281 --> 00:34:09.620
I don't know how to turn the grease and just a bar of soap.

575
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.660
How often would you do? I don't fucking know. You jumped in a river, a,

576
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:18.560
they just came out with a new line of shower products, shampoo and body wash,

577
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.460
shampoo and body wash called the wanderer.

578
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.040
I love this champion body wash in one. Perfect.

579
00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:27.230
The fragrances are unlike anything on the market.

580
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:31.220
They're subtle and actually smell like real natural ingredients.

581
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.970
There are a lot of body washes out there. They make you smell like a teenager.

582
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.940
Um, why don't know what a teenager smells like.

583
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:41.810
And I think that's a good thing that keeps me off. A lot of watch lists, lists,

584
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:42.840
lists. Uh,

585
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:47.210
this mint and Cedar Wood bodywash is amazing and makes you smell incredible.

586
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:52.430

Everybody. You know what?

631
00:37:31.241 --> 00:37:35.860
I saw some middle aged white lady with the Wu Tang clan Christmas sweater.

632
00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:38.200
I think that sets the bar.

633
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:43.360
It was the classic Christmas sweater pattern with the Wu Tang w on the front and

634
00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:44.860
it was black and yellow, right?

635
00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.580
Didn't they used to say killer bees or some shit like that? I don't know.

636
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.960
All right. Tipsy elves.

637
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:52.690
Everyone needs an ugly Christmas sweater this time of year.

Tipsy elves. Here we go. What do they got?

645
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:19.960
Oh, Jesus Christ. Those things are fucking hideous.

646
00:38:19.961 --> 00:38:23.560
They got Jesus Christ like as a baby,

647
00:38:23.561 --> 00:38:28.250
but he still has the beard and one of those things. What are those things?

648
00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.560
You know, you carry a baby and around Front Satchel,

649
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:37.120
you know they got Santa Claus on a Unicorn. Yeah, this is ugly as shit.

650
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:38.740
Men's Christmas suits.

651
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.610
I guess that's if you want to get on TV at a sporting event,

652
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.310
um, oh my God, dude, I can't even fucking read.

653
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.490
What does it say? Belt digger.

654
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.700
I thought it said the n word. That's what I first thought it's on.

655
00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.700
And then I thought I'd said Gold digger. And you know what?

656
00:39:01.701 --> 00:39:04.130
Why don't I get off this site? Uh, you miss,

657
00:39:04.131 --> 00:39:07.670
you drink a birthday boy and it's got Jesus Christ.

658
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.450
Alright? You know what these people went.

672
00:39:58.671 --> 00:40:02.180
No one's going to get upset, right? Anyways,

673
00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.320
I've been hanging with my wife, you know, barely doing any standup,

674
00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:08.600
just sitting there waiting for the kid to come and a poor thing.

675
00:40:08.601 --> 00:40:11.870
She's all really uncomfortable. She's at the point, she's been such a trooper.

676
00:40:11.871 --> 00:40:14.840
She's at the point now, she's just like this, get this kid out of me. Right?

677
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:20.330
And, uh, last night was the first time I saw kick through this fucking kick.

678
00:40:20.331 --> 00:40:23.970
Like, uh, I do these exercises, you know,

679
00:40:23.971 --> 00:40:28.971
I have to help me do these exercises that she can try to stay Limba and I just

680
00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:33.400
saw like, it was literally like, it was like a foot just fucking kicked aside.

681
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:37.670
It was just like, it's insane. It's insane that there's a God damn kid in there.

682
00:40:37.671 --> 00:40:41.390
It's the most amazing fucking thing. And also like, yeah, just say to your wife,

683
00:40:41.391 --> 00:40:44.030
like, I, there's no way for them to convey it to you. It's like,

684
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.180
what is it like to have a person in you

685
00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:53.780
living inside of you? It's like, can you watch alien now and just be like,

686
00:40:53.781 --> 00:40:56.630
I get it. I totally fucking get it. Um,

687
00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:01.550
so anyways, uh, I hung out with her one night,

688
00:41:01.551 --> 00:41:05.570
right? And we watch Rudolph the red nose reindeer.

689
00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.450
Then we watched a frosty the snowman as much as I could watch,

690
00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:16.330
you know, I don't get into frosty the snowman. It's too fucking it.

691
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.470
That one just gives me anxiety.

692
00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.880
You watch Rudolph the red nose reindeer and it's slightly about racism and

693
00:41:22.881 --> 00:41:24.530
acceptance, you know what I mean?

694
00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:28.340
His own dad is ashamed of them and then he tells him to fuck off.

695
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.370
And then there's all the misfit toys. There's something going on there.

696
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.320
There's like this about racism and special needs kids. I don't really,

697
00:41:36.321 --> 00:41:40.640
there's just so many fucking other things going on that it's really fucking sad.

698
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.810
And you watch it and it's 50 years old and you realize so much as it changed.

699
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.080
And then if you go right into frosty the fucking snowman,

700
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.740
and then here's this adult that's going to get on a fucking Choo Choo train with

701
00:41:51.741 --> 00:41:55.370
some little girl, she doesn't tell her parents she's fucking leave leaving.

702
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:59.450
And then there's the fucking stress that it's gonna melt. I was just like,

703
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:01.520
you know what? You got to shut that. I can't handle this. Right.

704
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:05.290
I can't fucking handle this. This given me too much anxiety. Right. And, uh,

705
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.360
so then we switched over and we watched a little bit of Mary Poppins,

706
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.310
which I haven't seen in a long time, but I get all of those movies confused.

707
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.870
You know, the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious that,

708
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:22.520
that one Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. It's always some fucking old guy,

709
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.290
rich guy whose wife died and now the new hot piece of ass comes in and she shows

710
00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:29.270
them how to fucking loosen up. You know what I mean?

711
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:33.860
That role has now been taken over by African-Americans, right?

712
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.210
They come in and they teach the uptight white dude how to fucking, I dunno,

713
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.000
do the electric slide. I never watched those fucking movies, you know?

714
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.570
But back in the day, it was a, it was a new fucking like chicken,

715
00:42:44.571 --> 00:42:49.280
the guy's life. But this one, he was like married, but it was Dick Van Dyke.

716
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.120
You know, I sing in gym gym or a chimp, Chaminade, chimp,

717
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:57.830
chem-e Cho ro. They'll lifer of, of a fucking sweeper.

718
00:42:57.831 --> 00:43:01.610
That's what I want to do, right? They, they're all fucking happy as hell.

719
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.420
You know, completely romancing blue collar work.

720
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.200
Like rich people are all fucking miserable.

721
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.230
And these people who are just going to die at 39 fucking miner's lung or somehow

722
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.320
dancing around up on the roofs, you know, covered in fucking [inaudible].

723
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.750
And I got through as much as that as I could get through. And uh, you know,

724
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:23.540
I bought a Christmas tree and I did all the dishes.

725
00:43:23.541 --> 00:43:27.370
I watched all of that shit and like, you know what,

726
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.510
the next morning I was going to the rams game.

727
00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:34.540
So everything that I did in the last 24 hours is just completely wiped up.

728
00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:39.320
It's fucking unbelievable. But that's how it works, man.

729
00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:44.120
That's how it fucking works. Um, so anyways, um, oh,

730
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:47.330
here's something that I did not mention as, uh,

731
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.760
this is something you have to do as a man,

732
00:43:49.761 --> 00:43:51.860
especially if you have a wife and a family.

733
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.520
You got to get life insurance and I'm doing it this fucking week. I just,

734
00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:59.960
you know, lost another friend who didn't fucking have it. And uh, you just,

735
00:43:59.961 --> 00:44:01.490
you have to fucking do it guys.

736
00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:03.680
We don't like dealing with our fucking mortality.

737
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.540
I know you've watched enough for the first 48 that you literally given your wife

738
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:12.470
a motivation to fucking take you out. You know what I mean? Um,

739
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.030
but she gotta do it. You gotta fucking do it. So I'm doing that this week.

740
00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:21.410
It's been a brutal fucking week. Uh, this week I learned about loss,

741
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.800
you know, like I didn't already have enough fucking examples.

742
00:44:24.801 --> 00:44:29.180
I got the old fucking right there, Fred this week. Um, anyways,

743
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:33.270
plowing ahead. Um, how about the fucking giants?

744
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.170
I'm fucking amazing at the New York football giants every fucking year.

745
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:38.310
I've been saying it all year.

746
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.310
Eli Manning is bored in September and October and then, oh wait,

747
00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:45.150
we gotta fucking win some games here. He just,

748
00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:48.570
the guy just comes to fucking life. They beat the fucking cowboys again.

749
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.030
They got this amazing fucking defense. This is,

750
00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.250
this is what I'm so jealous of as a patriots fan.

751
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.840
I don't fucking get how I was first for going. Like,

752
00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:04.970
why do we always have to get rid of our guys that are getting becoming stars

753
00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.810
this year? Chandler Jones, we got rid of and a, what's his face?

754
00:45:08.811 --> 00:45:11.690
We sent over to the fucking browns, you know,

755
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.310
always for the same shit of fucking second round draft pick. You know,

756
00:45:16.311 --> 00:45:18.200
we got rid of channel Jones and uh, when,

757
00:45:18.201 --> 00:45:21.590
what's the other fucking guy's name from fucking Florida University? Whatever.

758
00:45:21.591 --> 00:45:25.040
I, I'm s the guys, I'm so fucking busy with my wife right now.

759
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.520
I don't even know who the fuck's who right now, but it's just like,

760
00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:32.560
what I hate about the fucking patriots speaking of balance is we have all our

761
00:45:32.721 --> 00:45:34.850
money on the offensive side of the ball.

762
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:39.830
All our stars are on the offensive fucking side and we're forever getting rid of

763
00:45:39.831 --> 00:45:41.240
these fucking cornerbacks.

764
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:45.260
Why won't we pay a fucking quarterback all the way back to Thailand,

765
00:45:45.261 --> 00:45:49.310
lawyer Malloy. We just constantly get rid of those fucking guys.

766
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.920
You know, you watch, we're going to,

767
00:45:51.921 --> 00:45:56.030
we'll get rid of that fucking kid who pygmy that pick in the fucking super bowl

768
00:45:56.150 --> 00:46:00.640
in Seattle, but fucking get rid of him when he wants a contract. I don't,

769
00:46:00.641 --> 00:46:05.580
I don't fucking get it. Bronx paid. Brady's paid.

770
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.480
I mad at magic. Edelman's going to get paid if he's not paid already.

771
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.610
And then nobody on the other side of the fucking ball it seems like whenever

772
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.481
they, whenever they do,

773
00:46:15.481 --> 00:46:20.100
whenever they fuck defense wins fucking championships and we fucking are forever

774
00:46:20.101 --> 00:46:21.720
doing this. You watch tonight,

775
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.160
how many points is Tom Brady going to have to put up on the fucking scoreboard

776
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:30.240
to beat the ravens who always have a good defense? I fucking love the ravens.

777
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.530
I love the giants. I love the Steelers. I love those fucking teams that just,

778
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.720
they always have a great fucking defense.

779
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.540
What kills me about the giants is they got this fucking killer defense and they

780
00:46:42.541 --> 00:46:47.340
still have Eli. They got fucking, what's his face there? Who you know,

781
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:50.340
Jesus Christ. What a fucking diva. He is evil. He's not on the field.

782
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:52.980
He's got to be like, you know, trying to get the crowd going.

783
00:46:52.981 --> 00:46:57.200
Like they're not into the game. I fucking hate that shit. You know del Becca,

784
00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.970
it's like we get it. We get it. You're a superstar.

785
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.390
It's not enough that you'd had a one headed 90 yard fucking catch.

786
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.770
Now you gotta be sitting there fucking up on the Goddamn say at stands doing the

787
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:09.960
y YMCA dance with the fucking crowd.

788
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.480
Literally like the defense is out there shutting down the Dallas cowboys and the

789
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:16.800
fucking cameras on you.

790
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.190
Cause you fucking do with Christmas carols with the fucking front section.

791
00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:23.190
That drives me up the wall. Right? They got him, they got,

792
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:27.580
they still have enough money for that fucking do crews. It's, it's,

793
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.560
it's amazing.

794
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.560
But somehow bill Belicheck trades these fucking guys and gets like three or four

795
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:39.970
second round draft picks, then eventually mature into these stars.

796
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.970
And then we went and title and then it's like,

797
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.970
then they want their money and then we fucking get rid of them again.

798
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:51.010
So believe in it. Not as much as the Patriots are,

799
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:51.873
you know,

800
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:56.110
looked upon as a number one or number two seed maybe behind the Raiders.

801
00:47:56.111 --> 00:48:00.280
I Dunno, I haven't watched the last couple of weeks. I know the Broncos lost,

802
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.980
um, I don't know how it fucking works,

803
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:05.260
but you got to think that we're one of the favorites,

804
00:48:05.261 --> 00:48:09.370
right to go to yet another fucking super bowl. But, um,

805
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.480
this is actually a rebuilding year for us. That's how great bill Belicheck is.

806
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.220
But, um, I think we're, the Patriots lose tonight unless we split,

807
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.480
we got to put up like, I would say like 38 points,

808
00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:24.130
cause Joe Flacco is no fucking slouch. Um,

809
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.340
I dunno, I just don't have any fucking faith in it.

810
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.610
And I don't think that the Patriots' defense stinks.

811
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.420
I just think every fucking year they're good guys, you know, one or two guys,

812
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.230
it seems good seal fucking evil. Um,

813
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:39.790
you know what the Patriots are really good at.

814
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:44.470
We're really good at finding that fucking white dude who for no fucking reason

815
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:49.120
is fucking really fast. The Westwell course, right?

816
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:53.800
The elements, the am and Dole is, we, that's what the fuck we are good at. And,

817
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:54.640
um,

818
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.550
the giants are great at finding fucking those guys that are built like our, our,

819
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:03.490
as fast as a linebacker, but for some, some, somehow our,

820
00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:07.510
the size of a defensive end, they get all of those fucking guys,

821
00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:11.650
they spot them a mile away. Somehow we can't find them, you know?

822
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:17.640
And I think the Ravens in the, uh, Steelers, they, they,

823
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:22.210
they're really good at just getting those hall of fame fucking defensive backs

824
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:27.010
in linebackers. Ed reads, Ray Lewis, fucking Steelers,

825
00:49:27.011 --> 00:49:30.820
you can name like 50 Goddamn fucking people right from the fucking steel curtain

826
00:49:30.821 --> 00:49:34.900
all the way up to a Paula Malo. They just stayed that enough. They just,

827
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:39.220
they're just fucking good at it. So, um, having said that,

828
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:41.680
I've been also watching my Bruins. Um,

829
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.390
I'm still trying to see where, where we're working towards.

830
00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:51.700
When we sent the entire Stanley Cup winning team gave, you know,

831
00:49:51.701 --> 00:49:56.701
over the course of two and a half seasons sent every significant player from

832
00:49:57.461 --> 00:50:00.550
those teams out the door except for Ciara and uh,

833
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:05.170
Marshawn and Burgi. I don't know.

834
00:50:05.171 --> 00:50:07.930
I don't see where a year and a half end of this shit. I don't,

835
00:50:07.931 --> 00:50:09.540
we're still a fucking eighth seed.

836
00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.310
This is right where we were last year and I swear to God,

837
00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:17.530
if they make our coach take the fall for this, all right, we better keep him.

838
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:22.030
And at the end we feel if we think that this doesn't work out all right.

839
00:50:22.031 --> 00:50:25.450
You definitely keep a closed Julian. You definitely keep Cam Neely,

840
00:50:25.451 --> 00:50:29.450
but a Michael Connell's gotta fucking go. Cause he's the guy on me.

841
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.170
As far as I know. He's the guy that fucking did all of this. I don't know.

842
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.510
But you know what? The fucking Bruins never want to pay anybody

843
00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:42.050
and fucking believable do Pasternak has 18 fucking goals, right?

844
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.470
I watched some of the Toronto game yesterday. I know we lost three to one.

845
00:50:45.471 --> 00:50:50.390
I don't know who scored. I missed that part. And uh, he's got 18 fucking goes.

846
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:53.660
He imagine if Sagan was there, we would have, we been had two fucking lines.

847
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:57.560
At least we admit we fucked up when we got rid of say can but whatever.

848
00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.740
But you know something the Celtics are looking go to Al Horford is the fucking

849
00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:04.550
real deal and I think he's a fucking leader. I think he's got,

850
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:09.230
he's like a fucking superstar and he's not a fucking headcase.

851
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:13.340
I'm loving that guy. You know, we've got Isaiah Thomas, we got a point guard,

852
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.700
we got a guy down low who actually can fucking pass the ball.

853
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.910
Please brought the ball up the court as much as everybody's freaking out about

854
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.580
what are the Greek freak there? The bucks is a bunch of guys.

855
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:25.100
Six foot 11 could do that. I'm a fucking Lebron James.

856
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.190
He's been doing everything that that guy does just because he doesn't play the

857
00:51:28.191 --> 00:51:31.790
point guard position. Everybody's fucking freaking out. But that guy is amazing.

858
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:35.660
All right. But uh, I dunno,

859
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:41.060
I'm loving what Danny h is doing and uh, I think that we're one guy away.

860
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.620
I don't know much about who,

861
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.880
whoever that middle guy is between your number one and your number five to power

862
00:51:46.881 --> 00:51:49.070
forward. I don't know what the fuck we need a two with three.

863
00:51:49.071 --> 00:51:53.240
I Dunno what the fuck it is. But uh, if we could just have another guy bench,

864
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.390
we play great fucking defense. I don't know.

865
00:51:56.391 --> 00:51:58.460
I benches a little suspect of right.

866
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:03.050
Kelly Olynyk comes in and that other fucking guy who can't, I swear to God, I,

867
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:07.860
I think I could literally beat this guy taken foul shots. He's one of them.

868
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.900
He's the one like was it smart? The guy with the fucking blonde hair? Um,

869
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.770
anyway, so let's, uh,

870
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.230
let's get to some of the questions here for this fucking week here.

871
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:20.130
I to wrap this up too, cause the people putting the at the punch lists,

872
00:52:20.131 --> 00:52:23.510
guys are coming back to put the finishing touches on the kitchen. Oh by the way,

873
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.060
you know, this is free advertising

874
00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:31.880
and a Campfire Cook trop top grill. You gotta get one dude.

875
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:36.290
I got one in my backyard. My wife was fight me on that thing. I finally,

876
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.120
I shut her the F up.

877
00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:43.070
I went out and I made she steak and cheese is one of her favorite fucking

878
00:52:43.071 --> 00:52:45.830
sandwiches. I went out there, I went on the Internet,

879
00:52:45.831 --> 00:52:47.420
I looked for a simple fucking recipe.

880
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:51.920
All I did to season the meat was a little wishy shire sauce and some salt.

881
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:55.550
That was it, right? I had white American cheese.

882
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:58.610
My wife isn't into peppers and onions. I was like, fine.

883
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.200
I saute the little bit of mushrooms.

884
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:05.360
I these fresh French rolls to fucking game over,

885
00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:11.540
game over. She ate that thing. She didn't have time to say how great it was.

886
00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:15.800
She just fucking Wolf that thing down. And I was really sitting there like,

887
00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:18.650
you know, I need the approval. I'm like, was it good? You're Joyce. She's like,

888
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.920
how about the fact that I ate it in a minute and I couldn't even talk because my

889
00:53:24.141 --> 00:53:28.590
mouth was full. So that's how good it was as fucking site. I haven't even done,

890
00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:32.490
I haven't even, you can do Rubens on that fucking thing.

891
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.710
You can make the whole grand samp slam breakfast, Hash Browns, pancakes, Bacon,

892
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.950
the whole fucking get the bacon going. Slide the bacon over.

893
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:44.640
You put the Hash browns in that fucking grease. Go Fuck Yourself.

894
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.950
Jason Law had already gave it the nickname because I'm bringing it to the Rome

895
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:53.070
Rosebowl. He calls it the game changer and uh,

896
00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.920
he's going to be making Reuben's that day. Like he's literally,

897
00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:00.780
Jay law had his is a fucking ridiculous Cooke.

898
00:54:00.781 --> 00:54:04.350
He's unbelievable, right? He's so excited about that thing.

899
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.650
He like dropped his voice like three octaves.

900
00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:11.710
I sent him a picture, he was saying, I go, dude,

901
00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.410
you guys see what I got for the tail Kay tailgate this year. He goes,

902
00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.930
I really do what you get. What'd you get? And I show it to him.

903
00:54:16.931 --> 00:54:19.630
He was just like, dude, dude,

904
00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:24.310
you got to cook top dude. That's fucking limitless. Hey,

905
00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.910
you can do Brata, you can do Ruben, she can do breakfast or anything.

906
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.190
Just fucking rattle and all. I just started laughing. He goes, that thing,

907
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:34.240
that thing is a game changer. It's literally a fucking game changer. Um,

908
00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.420
he was ah, I can't even tell you the ideas that he,

909
00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.070
cause he told me I should put out my own one.

910
00:54:39.071 --> 00:54:41.570
He had all these fucking great ideas, but I don't want anybody to steal it.

911
00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:45.760
I probably won't put it out anyways, but, um, so, um,

912
00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:47.693
<v 3>okay.</v>

913
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:50.890
<v 0>Ah, steak and cheese isn't, oh, on the, forget about on the Diet, by the way.</v>

914
00:54:50.891 --> 00:54:55.150
I've done a cardio everyday this month. All right. 11 days in,

915
00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.010
I got day 12 here. I'm telling you,

916
00:54:57.550 --> 00:55:01.210
go through the holidays just to a fucking half hour cardio every fucking day.

917
00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:06.470
All right. And you pick your spots. We eat like a fucking more on eight,

918
00:55:06.471 --> 00:55:11.350
like a more on yesterday, and then today you get right back on it, you know? Um,

919
00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:14.350
and that way you start the year, you know, you're not a fat fuck.

920
00:55:14.351 --> 00:55:15.910
You don't get that extra 10 to 15.

921
00:55:15.911 --> 00:55:18.610
You don't want to deal with that shit or you know, or whatever.

922
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.520
Don't listen to me all listening. Okay, here we go.

923
00:55:21.521 --> 00:55:25.180
Let's get to the emails for this week. Um, alright mom.

924
00:55:25.181 --> 00:55:29.560
Worried about me traveling dear Billy scrotum head.

925
00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:34.180
I didn't know what that's just fucking mean for me and say my girlfriend and I

926
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:38.110
have been dating for five years now and finally decided to travel abroad

927
00:55:38.111 --> 00:55:42.400
together. You'd taken your broad abroad. Um,

928
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:46.720
she is a seasoned traveler, but I have yet to have traveled internationally.

929
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:50.380
Well, that's great. She knows what she's doing. Just follow her lead. Uh,

930
00:55:50.381 --> 00:55:55.250
we recently person purchased tickets to Greece to pop my cherry, uh,

931
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:59.050
sell slash celebrate her birthday. Um,

932
00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.630
well that's great. Uh,

933
00:56:01.631 --> 00:56:05.230
I just told my mom about the trip and a few days later received a text from her

934
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:09.100
very worried about traveling to Greece slash out of the country.

935
00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:12.070
I'm 27 years old, uh,

936
00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:15.850
mom and scared of me getting a, you left out some words here, buddy.

937
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.800
My mom is scared of me getting killed due to the country's current state and

938
00:56:20.801 --> 00:56:24.700
terrorists. My mom took a few days research, all the negative things,

939
00:56:24.701 --> 00:56:26.680
unemployment, bankruptcy, et Cetera,

940
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.650
about Greece to try to dissuade me from going, well,

941
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:34.630
if she looked up the fucking, is it Santa Maria Santa Rally with the fucking,

942
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:36.190
that's Frank Senegalese, the comedian.

943
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.790
What's that fucking beautiful place you can stay? It's all, every,

944
00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.520
all the buildings are white. It's right on the Mediterranean Sea.

945
00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:46.390
If she looked that up, she'd be fine. Listen,

946
00:56:46.391 --> 00:56:49.120
if you live in America and you just sit in your, in your,

947
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:51.340
if you're going to listen to the international news,

948
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:53.590
they're not going to talk to you about great shit.

949
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:57.220
You gotta watch the travel channel. If they're going to show the news,

950
00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.230
all you're going to hear is bad shit.

951
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:03.460
That's like everybody in everybody in England thinks everybody like over here

952
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:07.960
weighs 400 pounds and owns 15 guns and you walk down the street,

953
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.030
have with them on your hip. You know what I mean?

954
00:57:10.031 --> 00:57:14.350
I see just as many fat fucks in, in fucking Great Britain. Maybe not as much,

955
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:18.310
but there's a lot of fish and chip eating fucking rotten teeth,

956
00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:24.530
dirty, dirty white people out there. Um, but that's all I,

957
00:57:24.531 --> 00:57:27.220
that's all you're going to know. Tell her to put on the travel channel.

958
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:31.030
Send her a couple of fucking links. All right. Anyways, he goes,

959
00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:32.860
I understand that she's worried about her son,

960
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.300
but I'm also aware that she lives in a shell and she has never traveled abroad.

961
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:41.230
Um, after hearing on the podcast that you have been to Greece recently. No,

962
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:42.370
I haven't. I want to go there.

963
00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:44.860
I went to Italy recently by a question for you is,

964
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.770
do you think an average Joe first time, parentheses,

965
00:57:48.771 --> 00:57:53.230
nervous travel like myself will feel safe? Any words to put me at ease?

966
00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:55.210
I would love to hear what you have to say.

967
00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:58.150
Good or bad as this will help in my decision to,

968
00:57:58.151 --> 00:58:00.970
the greatest fucking thing is you're going, um,

969
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.400
with your girlfriend and she's a seasoned traveler.

970
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:07.090
She'll know what the fuck to do. So just follow her lead.

971
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:12.250
But I would encourage you to step out of your shell, learn a couple of phrases.

972
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:17.590
The locals love when you make an attempt to speak their language, even in Paris,

973
00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:18.610
as much as they get shit,

974
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.760
if you're really fucking trying and you're showing respect for their culture and

975
00:58:24.911 --> 00:58:28.360
you're on your best behavior. That's another thing too. When you travel abroad,

976
00:58:28.361 --> 00:58:31.950
you're on your best behavior. Unlike all these fucking Europeans.

977
00:58:31.951 --> 00:58:35.680
So many of them that come over here and they literally start trashing America to

978
00:58:35.681 --> 00:58:39.910
you in the United States of America. It's like Jesus Christ.

979
00:58:39.911 --> 00:58:42.730
What the fuck is wrong with you? You know what I mean?

980
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:45.100
Like as much as I was just teasing, when I go over there,

981
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:48.520
I'm on my best fucking behavior. All right? I go on stage,

982
00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:50.140
I'll tease him a little bit, but in general,

983
00:58:50.141 --> 00:58:52.180
I talk about what a great fucking time I'm having there.

984
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:57.340
You can easily pick apart any fucking place that you go to. Um,

985
00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:03.730
so anyways, I would learn a couple of phrases. Um, too, you're going to eat,

986
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.520
you're going to have food over there like you've never had here before.

987
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:08.290
You're going to see things you've never had.

988
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.460
You have to swim in the Mediterranean Sea. It is fucking life changing.

989
00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:14.800
And Dude, I'm telling you right now,

990
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:16.540
if you have any sort of stress in your life,

991
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:21.470
if you stay along the Mediterranean from Spain all the way over to like,

992
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.830
you can't fucking Miss, you know,

993
00:59:24.831 --> 00:59:29.831
just all I would say is just watch out for pickpockets.

994
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.100
Okay. Those gypsies are,

995
00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.740
are the fucking bill Belichick and Tom Brady's of pickpocketing. I mean they,

996
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:40.880
it is a fucking art form. They're so good at it. You almost won't be mad. Like,

997
00:59:40.881 --> 00:59:42.890
how the fuck did they do that? All right.

998
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:46.310
So that's the biggest thing that I would worry about.

999
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.400
And especially watch your wife with their big stupid fucking purses and they're

1000
00:59:51.471 --> 00:59:56.240
all excited and they're fucking looking around. This is what you do. All right?

1001
00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.080
You make a copy of the passport. Okay.

1002
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:05.330
Copy you fucking passport and you fucking keep you, you know,

1003
01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.100
have it in the safe at the fucking hotel. All right? Keep it at the hotel.

1004
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:13.190
I take my chances with some cleaning lady taking your passport.

1005
01:00:13.191 --> 01:00:17.180
She ain't going to fucking do that. Right. You have a copy of that. All right.

1006
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:18.380
Um,

1007
01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:23.380
I would definitely wear some sort of fucking like pants that have zippers on

1008
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:29.360
them that you can zip that shit shut and when a bunch of people start coming up

1009
01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:33.380
to you crowding you, be it on the subway or anything like that,

1010
01:00:33.381 --> 01:00:37.370
you put your hand on your fucking wallet, you have it right there.

1011
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:41.180
I wouldn't had, don't have any fucking thing of value whatsoever.

1012
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:42.260
And I'm telling you right now,

1013
01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:45.440
this is probably making you fucking nervous or whatever. This is just,

1014
01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.850
this is just, you know, misdemeanor stealing shit,

1015
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.580
but we'll make your life fucking miserable because you're going to have your

1016
01:00:52.581 --> 01:00:55.880
credit cards and all that type of shit and your money and all of that.

1017
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:57.410
It's just, you know,

1018
01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.980
pickpockets is the only fucking thing that I ran into when I was over there.

1019
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:03.920
That's the only thing you have to worry about and just really,

1020
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:08.950
really be super fucking hyper fucking aware when you're walking up to um,

1021
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.820
whatever the fuck tourist teeth and what are they going over there?

1022
01:01:13.821 --> 01:01:17.030
They have the ruins, all of that shit. You know, you're going to go any,

1023
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.420
any of that type of stuff. Like in Paris, if you go up to the Eiffel Tower,

1024
01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:24.860
you have your hands on your shit. And when people come walking up to you,

1025
01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:30.590
I'm speaking in English. Just literally just fucking go.

1026
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.370
No Loblaw no are blown. Just fucking, and if they keep coming at you, just say,

1027
01:01:34.371 --> 01:01:37.400
get the fuck away from me. I'm telling you right now,

1028
01:01:37.401 --> 01:01:39.110
if you just tell him to get the fuck away from you,

1029
01:01:39.111 --> 01:01:42.050
any of those fucking broads coming up to you, they want to, you know,

1030
01:01:42.051 --> 01:01:43.790
you're at the Eiffel Tower, the Eiffel Tower.

1031
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:45.770
What are you gonna you stand in line, you go on the Eiffel Tower,

1032
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:46.760
get the fuck away from me.

1033
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.540
They're coming up there to steal from you and watch out for their kids.

1034
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:55.550
That's the only fucking thing. Cause they are fucking tremendous at it. Um,

1035
01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:58.550
that's all that. Anytime you walk out of there, and I would also,

1036
01:01:58.551 --> 01:02:03.020
the next advice I'd give you is I'm like,

1037
01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:04.940
just bring Carey on.

1038
01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.380
I didn't even say that to your wife to just bring your girlfriend. Just bring,

1039
01:02:09.381 --> 01:02:10.214
carry on.

1040
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:13.250
You're going to wear the same fucking tee shirt and shorts basically every

1041
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.160
goddamn day. No one's going to give a fuck. You're on vacation,

1042
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:21.270
flip flops and all of that type of shit. Okay. All I can say is just like,

1043
01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:25.830
you know, under pack and if you want to buy, um,

1044
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.380
if you want to buy like some touristy shit, you know, I love, I love magnets.

1045
01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:32.520
I love those patches,

1046
01:02:32.521 --> 01:02:36.000
those flags that you're going to sew onto a coat or some shit. You know,

1047
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:38.510
you have the memories, you have the pictures, you would,

1048
01:02:38.511 --> 01:02:41.400
what are you gonna you don't need to go out and buy some wooden shoes and a big

1049
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.810
beer Stein. If you want to buy some shit like that, ship it back. Do that.

1050
01:02:45.811 --> 01:02:47.160
Just go there and have a good time.

1051
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.320
Watch your fucking valuables when you're around.

1052
01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.290
Fucking if you're on the subway and if you're near anything touristy other than

1053
01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:55.470
that, have a great fucking time. Chill out.

1054
01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.150
Eat the best fucking food you ever gonna fucking have and swim in the

1055
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.730
Mediterranean Sea and you'll have those memories for your whole fucking life.

1056
01:03:02.731 --> 01:03:06.510
It's the greatest fucking thing and I feel bad for your mom that she's never

1057
01:03:06.511 --> 01:03:09.690
traveled outside of the country because it's a great thing. All right. Clingy,

1058
01:03:09.691 --> 01:03:14.100
girlfriend, clingy girlfriend, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

1059
01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:18.150
Hey Bill, as you may have read from the title of this email,

1060
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:20.520
I am dealing with a clingy girlfriend.

1061
01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:24.480
We've been dating for three months now and pretty much have only known each

1062
01:03:24.481 --> 01:03:25.314
other,

1063
01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:29.130
but we've been dating for three months now and pretty much I've only known each

1064
01:03:29.131 --> 01:03:31.980
other for three months now, so it's a pretty new relationship. Okay,

1065
01:03:31.981 --> 01:03:34.020
so I get it. You didn't work with her gradually.

1066
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.260
Work up the balls you saw and you said, bitch, you come with me.

1067
01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:40.410
And she was like, oh my God, he's so direct. Anyways,

1068
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:42.240
as I've gotten deeper in the relationship,

1069
01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:46.260
I've started to notice more and more red flags. I'll tell you this right now.

1070
01:03:46.261 --> 01:03:50.440
If you start noticing more and more red flags, three months in, I'm are.

1071
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:55.200
I already have my finger on the fucking eject button personally this far into

1072
01:03:55.201 --> 01:03:59.490
your email. Okay. For, for example, a,

1073
01:03:59.491 --> 01:04:01.260
she gets mad and starts crying.

1074
01:04:01.261 --> 01:04:05.550
If I want to go to the gym by myself and not bring her up, fuck this, uh,

1075
01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:09.420
over, over, over, over,

1076
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.800
<v 1>okay.</v>

1077
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.120
<v 0>Fucking over. Or if I don't reply to her texts within five minutes,</v>

1078
01:04:15.121 --> 01:04:19.230
she calls me and asks me why I haven't answered. She's even already said,

1079
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:23.010
I love you to me. And actually set it back when we were having sex,

1080
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.960
accidentally said, I love you.

1081
01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:29.040
Only a guy can say that and now she says it back to me all the time and I

1082
01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:33.750
haven't and I have to say it back because I don't want to break her heart and

1083
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:37.110
tell her that I don't feel the same way. Well, you already have.

1084
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:41.490
You already have. All right, just give her a three month broken heart.

1085
01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:46.620
Get out to get out. I've even tried to break up with her like a week ago.

1086
01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:48.330
Get Out, get out.

1087
01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:52.530
And she started to have a breakdown saying how much she needed me and how she

1088
01:04:52.531 --> 01:04:54.570
can't live with that. Get Out,

1089
01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:01.770
get out, get out of here. So I told her, yeah,

1090
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:04.620
we could just stay together because I felt that. All right dude,

1091
01:05:04.621 --> 01:05:07.650
you've basically already broken up with her. [inaudible] she goes,

1092
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:12.510
she also just randomly flat out said that she can see us together forever.

1093
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.180
I don't know why I'm noticing all these things now,

1094
01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:19.450
but I'm only 19 years of age. Well there you go dude. To be honest,

1095
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:22.570
I still [inaudible] sorry.

1096
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.610
The fuck is going off my throat here. Screen too much to say. And to be honest,

1097
01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:30.490
I still want to live the bachelor lifestyle and not be in a relationship with,

1098
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.140
you know, all the answers to your question.

1099
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:36.970
Try all the different fish in the sea. Sorry if I sound Douchey,

1100
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:40.810
but I just really need help here, but I don't know what to do. Thanks bill.

1101
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:42.880
And come back to, I'm not going to say the name of the state.

1102
01:05:42.881 --> 01:05:46.750
This chick's such a psycho. Um, yeah dude. Uh, this is what I would do.

1103
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:49.690
<v 3>Um,</v>

1104
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:51.670
<v 0>and I'm taking this from Al Madrigal,</v>

1105
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:56.950
the Great Al Madrigal who no one knows how to en shit like him.

1106
01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:02.140
Um, if you listen to any of our live ATC podcast,

1107
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:06.640
he worked in his family business and at your age 19 he was already,

1108
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.980
he was the hatchet man. He fired adults and he told me one time,

1109
01:06:11.981 --> 01:06:14.110
the best way to get out of a relationship, okay,

1110
01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:15.790
if this is for everybody to do this,

1111
01:06:15.791 --> 01:06:20.140
you have a woman in your life and you have to break up with there are going to

1112
01:06:20.141 --> 01:06:22.660
drag you through the shit. Okay?

1113
01:06:22.661 --> 01:06:27.040
If you want to expedite the deep planning process,

1114
01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.353
<v 3>um,</v>

1115
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.390
<v 0>if she has anything over your apartment, get it all together, put it in a box.</v>

1116
01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:39.970
Call her, say we need to talk. You show up with the box. You handed the box.

1117
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:42.200
You tell her it's fucking over,

1118
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:43.670
<v 3>okay.</v>

1119
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:47.060
<v 0>Right? You let her cry. You fucking leave. Now,</v>

1120
01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:49.010
if she has keys to your place,

1121
01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:54.770
you don't even need to ask for him back. You already have changed the locks.

1122
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:58.730
If she offers to give you the keys back, you take them,

1123
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.620
but you never offer the information that you have changed. The fucking locks.

1124
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:07.610
It's out. It's over. It's done. Dude. Rip This bandaid off.

1125
01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.780
That's your fucking Christmas gift and anybody out there right now,

1126
01:07:11.781 --> 01:07:14.780
male or female, if you're in a relationship, you don't want to be in. Fuck it.

1127
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:18.110
Do it. Do It fucking tonight. Get you boxed together.

1128
01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:22.670
Change your fucking logs and the shit. Your Christmas gift.

1129
01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:26.390
Don't go to another fucking family event.

1130
01:07:26.391 --> 01:07:28.580
Someone else's family that you don't want to fucking be with.

1131
01:07:28.581 --> 01:07:33.550
You owe it to yourself. Get the fuck out of it. Alright, messy girlfriend. Uh,

1132
01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.790
hey Billy. Oh,

1133
01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:38.750
I live with my girlfriend for the past few years and I've tried and failed

1134
01:07:38.751 --> 01:07:43.190
repeatedly, repeatedly to get her to tidy up after herself.

1135
01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:47.330
She lives like a borderline slub with piles of her shit everywhere,

1136
01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.700
on most available surfaces.

1137
01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.870
Instead of putting stuff away after herself should just leave it out for days.

1138
01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.950
Most days I'll come back from work and the bed will be piled high with clothes

1139
01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:01.280
and the dump contents of handbags, et cetera.

1140
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:06.470
In the in the evening, very underrated Zepplin song. By the way,

1141
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.560
this will be off. This will often, uh,

1142
01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:13.670
just get moved to the Sofa and then in the morning moved back to the bed.

1143
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:16.640
Every cover in drawer is piled full of shit.

1144
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:19.400
I have a couple of small spaces for my belongings.

1145
01:08:19.401 --> 01:08:23.750
Everywhere else is full of clothes she hasn't worn from months, parentheses,

1146
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:28.180
question mark years dozens of handbags purchase. She doesn't person,

1147
01:08:28.181 --> 01:08:31.160
she doesn't use bits of paper cards. She keeps,

1148
01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:35.240
she's keeping for who knows what dozens of beauty products she get the picture.

1149
01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.500
I do try to keep things tidy at best I can for my own sanity,

1150
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.360
but it'd be nice to have not,

1151
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:45.800
not to have to nag her every so often to just tidy up after s after self.

1152
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:46.951
I keep I,

1153
01:08:46.951 --> 01:08:51.680
if I kept pissing on the toilet seat and she kept telling me how annoying it

1154
01:08:51.681 --> 01:08:54.620
was, I think she'd be right in thinking what the,

1155
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.120
what the Hell is wrong with this dude?

1156
01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.530
Surely tidying up after yourself is about respect for the other person or people

1157
01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:04.190
you live with. I know the whole accept me for who I am,

1158
01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:09.080
bullshit and all and all of that. But come on, I was wondering what your,

1159
01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:13.920
you are the, the lovely Nias um, Leno's thoughts on this are,

1160
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:18.860
um, um, well I'll tell you this too. Uh,

1161
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:21.160
that's not gonna get any better. And she sounded,

1162
01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:24.110
you got a small time hoarder on your lot, on your hands here.

1163
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:27.380
Forget about if you get married and have kids. Um,

1164
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.360
so you gotta you gotta ask yourself right now,

1165
01:09:29.361 --> 01:09:31.760
are you going to marry this person if you're not,

1166
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:36.680
pack up your own box and get the fuck out of there and already have an apartment

1167
01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:39.920
ready to go. By the way, you pack up your box,

1168
01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:44.000
you bring this shit over to the fucking apartment while she's at work.

1169
01:09:44.001 --> 01:09:46.520
Then you call her, you say, listen, we need to talk.

1170
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:51.300
And then you get the fuck outta there. You say,

1171
01:09:51.301 --> 01:09:52.200
I'm going for a drive.

1172
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:55.860
You drive over to new apartment and then you call her up from a pay phone and

1173
01:09:55.861 --> 01:09:58.980
you say, by the way, when I said I was going for a drive,

1174
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.750
what I really should've said was, I just moved out. Uh, good luck to you. And,

1175
01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:07.560
uh, you know, let's, let's try and win in Chicago. You hang up,

1176
01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:11.100
you go the Robert Kennedy, they're right. It's fucking over. Um,

1177
01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:13.680
I can tell you right now, dude, I couldn't tolerate that.

1178
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:17.720
I couldn't tolerate living with the fucking slob. There's no,

1179
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:22.530
I fucking hated that when I lived, when I had guy roommates, I was,

1180
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.640
I never understood that.

1181
01:10:23.641 --> 01:10:27.550
Like how guys thought it was funny to have like fucking pizza boxes and all this

1182
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:30.270
like live in like a fucking animal. It's like, guys, we live here.

1183
01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.850
It's fucking gross. Um,

1184
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.880
so you have to decide if you love this person enough to accept this part of them

1185
01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:43.260
or you have to, or maybe you throw down an ultimatum. Like,

1186
01:10:43.261 --> 01:10:47.040
if there's no fucking way I'm living my life like this,

1187
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.870
this is completely unacceptable.

1188
01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:53.790
You have way too much shit you need to throw out. At least 70% of your shit.

1189
01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:59.450
Okay. And if she gives you a rough time and just say, listen, you eat,

1190
01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:02.280
eat it. That shit is going out the door or I am.

1191
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:09.510
Are you saying that you're choosing that over me? Yes.

1192
01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.870
Yes. Cause I'm telling you right now, I am not going to be happy.

1193
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:18.150
Are you telling me that you love your fucking bags more than you love me?

1194
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:21.570
Just turn that stupid psych psychology shit right back on them.

1195
01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.980
Get it the fuck Outta here. It gets the fuck out.

1196
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.000
Or I get the fuck out. And then you put on some Christmas music ever.

1197
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:34.560
Holly Jolly Christmas, right? All right, here we go. Next one,

1198
01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:37.740
three stooges. I love Mr Burger. I was wondering who your favorite,

1199
01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:41.280
who's your favorite stooge? I know most people are curly fans,

1200
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:45.540
but I've always been a shrimp fan. Any who have a good day. Um,

1201
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:48.510
Shimp is unbelievably underrated.

1202
01:11:48.511 --> 01:11:53.100
The fact that he had to follow Curley and Curley was in bad health slash I think

1203
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:55.950
might've died during his tenure. Um,

1204
01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:01.320
I love chimp. Uh, but curlier curly is the best.

1205
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.990
But Larry Larry's under fucking rated too.

1206
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.650
Larry's fucking hilarious. And Mo was the bully.

1207
01:12:07.651 --> 01:12:10.650
I could never get into demote cause I had an older brother that was just like

1208
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:11.850
dad fucking asshole.

1209
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.990
I used to love it every once in a while when moe would lose one of those little

1210
01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:19.770
slap battles. But, um, I loved all of them. And people always say, you know,

1211
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:22.770
you're either a stooges fan or you like the Marx brothers.

1212
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:25.800
I fucking hated the Marx brothers. I thought they were boring as shit.

1213
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:31.020
I bet if I got a phone now that I'm older, maybe I'd enjoy it more. But, um,

1214
01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:35.220
I dunno. I just thought it was clever shit.

1215
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.730
We're three stooges was just fucking, it was hilarious.

1216
01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:42.690
They were just beating the fuck out of each other. And the, I dunno,

1217
01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.340
it's clever as a joke is,

1218
01:12:44.341 --> 01:12:48.420
is there anything funnier than seeing somebody walking into a fucking window of

1219
01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:49.950
falling down a flight of stairs?

1220
01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:54.010
There's nothing funnier than watching somebody hurt themselves. Um,

1221
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:58.410
I don't know. Maybe I'm just, maybe I'm just not smart enough. Uh,

1222
01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.210
you know what? I should look at the mark spreads it before he trash them.

1223
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:04.680
I will tell you that one guy could fucking play the harp like nobody, Huh?

1224
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.830
Alright. MVT they have atlas, very little advertising.

1225
01:13:07.831 --> 01:13:11.100

Hope you guys enjoyed it. It's been a brutal week for me. Um, you know,

1263
01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.800
I'm very happy that we were able to find a new poem from my dog.

1264
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:31.270
They've already sent us texts and pictures and she's totally fine and is,

you know, I'm glad that we didn't have to, you know, I was,

1266
01:15:35.891 --> 01:15:40.630
there was no fucking way any that that dog was not going to continue on living.

1267
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:45.790
Uh, she's had an amazing life. She's lived like three different books. And,

1268
01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:50.800
um, me and my wife are happy to be where we do seven and a half years with her.

1269
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:54.700
And, um, I love her to death. I'm going to miss her like hell,

1270
01:15:54.701 --> 01:15:58.330
but I had to do it because, you know,

1271
01:15:58.870 --> 01:16:02.260
the alternative was going to be something horrible and I did not want to have to

1272
01:16:02.261 --> 01:16:06.540
fucking live through that. Um, but I am devastated and um,

1273
01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.870
I would appreciate it if you don't send me any fucking insensitive tweets about
