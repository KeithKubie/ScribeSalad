Now remember that when we look at a mass on an inclined plane or a hill,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we break its weight into perpendicular and parallel components.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This parallel component is mg sin α.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's the force that's kind of bringing the car down the hill,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that would tend to bring the car down the hill.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But we want the car to go up the hill.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is the force that we have to combat, that we have to oppose.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, the slick way to solve this problem is to say that power is equal to force times velocity.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That's an equation that Jonathan showed you in one of the previous problem sets.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Well, our force is just mg sin α, and our velocity is 25 km/h.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If we plug in m of 2000, g of 10, α of 10 degrees, and a velocity of 25--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we need to convert that to m/s.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We're going to use this value of 6.94 m/s.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I get a power of 24100 W.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If you had a different solution, you should go to the forums and share it with your classmates.
