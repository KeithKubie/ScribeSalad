00:00:07.147 --> 00:00:09.941
What you're looking at
isn't some weird x-ray.

00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:13.959
It's actually a baby yellow tang surgeonfish
at two months old.

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.236
And you thought your childhood
was awkward.

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:18.695
But here is the same fish as an adult,

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:22.438
a beautiful inhabitant of the
Indian and Pacific Oceans' coral reefs

00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:26.245
and one of the most popular captive fish
for salt water aquariums.

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:31.489
Of the 27,000 known fish species,
over a quarter live on coral reefs

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.539
that make up less than 1%
of the Earth's surface.

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.532
But prior to settling down in this
diverse tropical environment,

00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:42.830
baby coral reef fish face the difficult
process of growing up on their own,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.053
undergoing drastic changes,
and the journey of a lifetime

00:00:46.053 --> 00:00:48.306
before they find that reef to call home.

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:50.735
The life cycle for most of these fish

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:54.437
begins when their parents spew
sperm and eggs into the water column.

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:59.145
This can happen daily, seasonally,
or yearly depending on the species,

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:02.514
generally following lunar or
seasonal tidal patterns.

00:01:02.514 --> 00:01:06.252
Left to their fate, the fertilized eggs
drift with the currents,

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:09.430
and millions of baby larvae
hatch into the world.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.313
When they first emerge,
the larvae are tiny and vulnerable.

00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:16.140
Some don't even have gills yet
and must absorb oxygen

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.785
directly from the water
through their tissue-thin skin.

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:22.963
They may float in the water column
anywhere from minutes to months,

00:01:22.963 --> 00:01:26.521
sometimes drifting thousands of miles
across vast oceans,

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:29.196
far from the reefs where they were born.

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:32.041
Along the way, they must
successfully avoid predators,

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:37.009
obtain food, and ride the right currents
to find their way to a suitable adult habitat,

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.615
which might as well be a needle
in vast haystack of ocean.

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:42.822
So, how did they accomplish this feat?

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:47.827
Until recently, marine biologists thought of
larval fish as largely passive drifters,

00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:51.137
dispersed by ocean currents
to distant locales.

00:01:51.137 --> 00:01:54.225
But in the last 20 years, 
new research has suggested

00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:57.048
that larvae may not be
as helpless as they seem,

00:01:57.048 --> 00:01:59.800
and are capable of taking
their fate in their own fins

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.727
to maximize their chances of survival.

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:06.157
The larvae of many species are
unexpectedly strong swimmers,

00:02:06.157 --> 00:02:10.278
and can move vertically in the water column
to place themselves in different water masses

00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:13.057
and preferentially ride certain currents.

00:02:13.057 --> 00:02:17.162
These fish may be choosing the best routes
to their eventual homes.

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:19.057
When searching for these homes,

00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:23.555
evidence suggests that larvae navigate
via a complex suite of sensory systems,

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:26.427
detecting both sound and smell.

00:02:26.427 --> 00:02:30.619
Odor, in particular, allows larvae to
distinguish between different environments,

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.578
even adjacent reefs,

00:02:32.578 --> 00:02:35.747
helping guide them toward their
preferred adult habitats.

00:02:35.747 --> 00:02:40.179
Many will head for far-flung locales
miles away from their birth place.

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:42.748
But some will use smell
and other sensory cues

00:02:42.748 --> 00:02:45.374
to navigate back to the reefs
where they were born,

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:48.612
even if they remain in the
larval stage for months.

00:02:48.612 --> 00:02:52.079
So, what happens when larvae
do find a suitable coral reef?

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.563
Do they risk it all in one jump
from the water column,

00:02:54.563 --> 00:02:57.616
hoping to land in exactly
the right spot to settle down

00:02:57.616 --> 00:02:59.842
and metamorphose into adults?

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:01.272
Not exactly.

00:03:01.272 --> 00:03:04.467
Instead, larvae appear to have
more of a bungee system.

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:08.331
Larvae will drop down in the water column
to check out a reef below.

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:10.955
If conditions aren't right,
they can jump back up

00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:13.358
into higher water masses and ride on,

00:03:13.358 --> 00:03:16.536
chancing that the next reef
they find will be a better fit.

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:19.200
But this is the point
where our knowledge ends.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.525
We don't know the geographic movements
of individual larva for most species.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:27.449
Nor do we know which exact environmental
cues and behaviors they use

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.383
to navigate to the reefs
they will call home.

00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:32.193
But we do know that these tiny trekkers

00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:34.500
are more than the fragile
and helpless creatures

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.984
science once believed them to be.

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:40.364
The secret lives of baby fish 
remain largely mysterious to us,

00:03:40.364 --> 00:03:43.202
unknown adventures waiting to be told.
