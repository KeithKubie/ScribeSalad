1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.140
We've been going through the generations of organic chemistry from Lavoie Zaa to

2
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:12.250
put Salesian gay loot sock to the Dumas Leebee can volar.

3
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:17.251
And last time we got to Cooper and began with [inaudible] talking about their

4
00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:21.940
discovery of our invention,
really a valence,
the t in particular,

5
00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:25.240
the Tetra Valence and the self linking of carbon.

6
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.010
But the other thing that calculates most noted for is the structure of benzene.

7
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.390
And we started looking at that a little bit last time with his sausage diagrams

8
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:37.060
for,
for drawing a structure.

9
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.510
And this time we'll go on in more detail with that idea in the determination of

10
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:46.720
actual position and add in molecules,

11
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:48.730
the positions of atoms and molecules.

12
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.650
And this is largely due to students of calculus.

13
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:58.210
So the next generation Ville help them Kerner who was both in Germany and in

14
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:01.720
Italy as you'll see.
And uh,
you know,

15
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:06.520
Honda's Hendrick has spent off from the Netherlands and also Albert Ladenburg

16
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:11.380
from Germany.
And we'll even have a little message of your own.
Uh,
whoops.

17
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:14.890
What happened here?
Oh good.
Okay.

18
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.390
Well we won't send,

19
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.960
but we presumably we'll launch again here and get back.

20
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.450
I think I saved it.

21
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.153
<v 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.440
and there were no,

23
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.950
uh,
where are we here?

24
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.563
UPS wrong one.

25
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.913
Awesome.

26
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.230
<v 0>If we're lucky.
This is it.</v>

27
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.220
<v 1>That's still loading.</v>

28
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.830
<v 0>There we go.
Okay.
So we Kerner Fan Toff,</v>

29
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.720
Loddon Borg and EAP Kohler who uh,

30
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.690
uh,
uh,
is your,
uh,

31
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.930
<v 1>great,</v>

32
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.620
<v 0>great,
great grandfather academically.
Okay.</v>

33
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:42.840
So Benzine and molecular structure.

34
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.770
This is the simplest of the so called aromatic compounds.
Actually.

35
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.100
Obviously the name comes from the smell that it has an aroma,

36
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.040
but it was generalized from benzene,

37
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:57.780
which benzene was discovered in 1825 by Farah Day,

38
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.600
who isolate is what called bike carburete of hydrogen,

39
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.770
which was c two h according to his formula.

40
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:10.450
But actually it's c six h six cause he had the carbon doubled and it's six times

41
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.120
what he thought it was.
And he got it from gas oil,

42
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:17.110
which is a byproduct quite a bit.
You get a gallon or they did at least then,

43
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.460
I don't know what happens nowadays.

44
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.320
Permit for making a thousand cubic feet of the oil.
That was an illuminating oil,

45
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.620
uh,
or illuminating gas.
Pardon me?

46
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.400
So in 1833 Mitsui [inaudible] named the compound benzene instead of Bicarb,

47
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.610
you're out of hydrogen.
And the origin of the name is interesting.

48
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.540
It came from Gum Benza,
one via benzoic acid.

49
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:45.541
So you knock the CEO to somehow off of Benzoic acid and you get gum and you get

50
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:48.040
a what Mitchell is called benzene.

51
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.870
Now Gum Benzo in itself has an interesting etymology because it came originally

52
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.550
from Lou Bon Jovi,
which I'm told is Arabic,
meaning Frankincense,

53
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:00.070
that's lube on and jolly is from Java.

54
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:02.740
So it came from the Southeast Asia.

55
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.210
But when the French saw this name,
they assumed that Lou was like La,
la,

56
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.640
la,
la,
and so on articles.

57
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.170
So they knocked it off so it became Bon Jovi,

58
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.850
which doesn't mean anything in Arabic,

59
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:20.110
but that then became benzoin and then benzene.
Okay.

60
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.470
The French in 1841 named the the the alcohol version of seed faith unique

61
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.090
because it's an acidic and we'll see you why shortly.
Uh,

62
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.100
we call it funnel and we call c six h five fennel and abbreviate it,

63
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:39.460
Ph for fennel or fee.
That Greek letter for fennel.

64
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.720
And it comes from [inaudible],

65
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.770
which means to bring light because of its association with illuminating gas.

66
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.301
Okay.

67
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:54.301
So we know that calculate a structure for benzene is hexagonal even though he,

68
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:58.210
uh,
he wrote it with that sausage thing originally.

69
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.890
And now why?
On what basis did he think it was hexagonal?
Well,

70
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:05.710
this is the paper where he proposed it's hexagonal,

71
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.640
and I'll show you all the evidence he gave in his arguments for its being a

72
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:14.560
hexagon,
first,
all aromatic compounds.
So for example,

73
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.090
Benzaldehyde as well as benzene and so on,
even the simplest,

74
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.240
are significantly richer in carbon than analogous compounds from the class of

75
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:27.340
fatty substances.
Okay?
So it's rich in carbon.

76
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:29.380
That's the first evidence that it's a hexagon.

77
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.600
The second is that aromatic compounds as per fatty compounds.

78
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.000
There are numerous homologous substances.

79
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.360
That is those whose composition differ by an integral number of ch two groups.

80
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.810
So if you,
if you replace a hydrogen by a methyl group,

81
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.080
you add ch two,
right?

82
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:53.740
Or if you put a ch two into a CC bond,
it,

83
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.250
it becomes a little bit longer a homologues.

84
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.350
So there are homologous substances in the aromatic series.

85
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.690
The third line of evidence was the simplest aromatic compounds contain at least

86
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:08.300
six carbon atoms.
Okay.

87
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.830
And the fourth line of evidence is all reaction products from aromatics

88
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:17.831
substances show a certain families similarity constituting the group of aromatic

89
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.970
compounds.
More vigorous reaction can remove part of the carbon,

90
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.720
but the major product contains at least six carbon atoms and decomposition stops

91
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:32.210
at this point,
unless there's complete destruction of the organic group,

92
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.410
for example,
burning it.

93
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.100
<v 1>And that's it.</v>

94
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.790
<v 0>Those are the four lines of evidence.
So would you conclude from that?</v>

95
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:45.290
That benzine is a hexagon,
it's quite a stretch.

96
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.600
So was this just a wild guess based on the idea that carbon should be tetra

97
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:54.200
Vaillant and even in a sense that doesn't help much because there was a question

98
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:56.540
of what you do with that last valence of carbon.
Right?

99
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.130
So he did have some support for this,

100
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:04.940
but he didn't cite it in the paper.
He didn't publish it until later.

101
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.650
It had to do with counting isomers.
Okay.

102
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.840
So remember this was the formula he drew in 1865 of chloro benzene.

103
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.760
But in the next year when he started trying actually to say that it was a

104
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:22.160
hexagon,
he drew a hexagon.

105
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.040
He didn't try to use his sausages at this point,

106
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.990
and he contrasted it with what you'd get with a triangle of carbons with a

107
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:34.730
carbon in the middle of each edge.
Okay?
So he labels the,

108
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.560
the vertices,
the carbon atoms,
a,
B,
c,
d,
e,
F and counts isomers.

109
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.000
And this is his table of that count.
So Mano Bromo Benzine,

110
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:48.470
there's only one form,
right?
Obviously,
if it were a chain of six carbons,

111
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:51.680
you could have it on the end or the carbon that was next to the end of the

112
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:55.340
carbon.
Next to that,
right?
So there'd be isomers.
But in fact,

113
00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.290
only one was known of Mano Brahma.
Now,
how Bout Die Bromo Benzene?

114
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.890
It turns out that their three modifications,
he says Ab,

115
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.960
AC and ady.
How about a

116
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.410
[inaudible] would be next.

117
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:16.820
Nearest neighbors like AC and a f would be like a B.
Okay.

118
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:21.340
So three modifications that's consistent with its being,
uh,
with it's being,
um,

119
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.590
a hexagon.
Now how about dry?
Try?
Try.

120
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.130
How about tried Romo Benzene?
There are three drive modify Cotsen and,

121
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.440
okay.
ABC.
So all successive right?
Or skip one.

122
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.840
How about if you skip to,
how about a B?

123
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:46.360
E
should we have that one?

124
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

125
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.280
<v 0>How about Abe?
Kate,
what do you say?</v>

126
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.770
Should we count a B?
He is another one.

127
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.120
Steve,
what do you say?

128
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.430
<v 1>Why not?
Cause I asked.</v>

129
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.590
<v 0>Yeah,
but I wonder if you agree.
Maybe he's wrong.</v>

130
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.510
There's precedent for people being wrong.

131
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.520
<v 1>Okay,
Sam.</v>

132
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.770
<v 0>Right?
Because if you count the other way,
be a,
he is the same as Abd,</v>

133
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.060
right?
You'd go two in a row and then skip one.
Just go the other way around.

134
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.710
Okay.
Cause it shouldn't make a difference which way you go around.
Okay.

135
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.440
Or there would be ace,
right where you skip every time,

136
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:50.310
but there's only one way of doing that.
Okay.
So three modifications.

137
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:52.200
And if you go to four or five,
six,

138
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:55.530
it's the same thing except hydrogens are what you count instead of bromines.

139
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.233
Okay.

140
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.440
So that was consistent with experimental observation of how many isomers there

141
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:06.441
were of these mono di and tri substituted benzenes.

142
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.010
Yes.
Kevin,

143
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.810
<v 1>what was he using to observe?</v>

144
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.800
<v 0>So how would he know they were different?</v>

145
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.090
That there were three different substances?
Suppose he had them,

146
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.930
he had to prepare them.
Of course,
maybe they were not preferable.
Right?

147
00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:26.630
In which case you'd have an account that was too low.

148
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.300
But how would you know you had three different things?

149
00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:33.680
How could you tell things were different?
Yup.
Boiling point.

150
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.260
Melting point.
Color maybe.

151
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.170
Although these aren't colored a density,

152
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.160
some physical property you have to measure,
right?

153
00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:46.700
The analysis obviously is going to be the same cause they're isomers.

154
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.420
But you have to,
and of course if you're not very good at measuring things,

155
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.950
you might get a melting point between two samples that differs by two degrees.

156
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.280
You guys are experienced in lab.
Does that mean they're different?

157
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:05.000
What he say Wilson,
your experiences that it doesn't tell they're different.

158
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.190
Okay.
So it's not,
it's not trivial.
You have to be a good experimentalists.

159
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.220
You have to be able to prepare them and you have to be able to tell when things

160
00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:15.050
are the same and when they're different.
But if you do,

161
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:16.370
then you can count isomers.

162
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.550
But you have to bear this in the back of your mind that you might be making a

163
00:11:19.551 --> 00:11:23.000
mistake because of your experimental observations.
Okay.
Now,

164
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:26.120
how about if it were a triangle?
Right?

165
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.790
Then if you had a Mano Bromo Benzene,

166
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:31.850
you could have the Bromo either at a or at B,

167
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.510
although it's conceivable you couldn't prepare one of them or one of them would

168
00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:39.770
be reactive for some reason.
Okay.
And if you had to,

169
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.590
you could have a B or a C or B,

170
00:11:44.591 --> 00:11:47.120
d or a d,

171
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.330
there'd be four modifications instead of three,

172
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.150
assuming you could prepare them all.
Right?

173
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.190
And then you can go on to the tribe Romo and see there would be six.
Okay.

174
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:01.570
So by counting isomers you could get information about the structure.

175
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.690
Okay.
In fact,
the paper that I xerox this from,
uh,

176
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.370
had written in an old brown ink,
the letters from the bottom,

177
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:17.200
u,
k,
e k,
e l going around the ring for a,
B,
c,

178
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:18.034
d,
e,

179
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.370
F and w written next to these things was names for the compounds,

180
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:26.740
elew,
Keck and so on.

181
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.300
Eka Luke echolalic for the order of these things.
You see what's funny,

182
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.330
right?
No Echo lack,
they said was Arabic for hexagon.

183
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.010
That's what was written in the book.

184
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.760
So you got humorous in all ages.
Okay.

185
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:48.850
Now let's try a applying the idea of ice,

186
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.390
her account to see if we can distinguish among doers,

187
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:55.240
models of benzine that I showed you.
Uh,

188
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.450
so first there's the one up top and center,

189
00:12:58.451 --> 00:13:02.860
which is what we call the calculate structure of benzene.
Okay?
Single Bond,

190
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:07.420
double bond.
Single Bond,
double bond.
How many isomers.
Okay.
Uh,

191
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.450
how many mano substituted isomers if you put just one bromine in and that we're

192
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:17.350
this,
if that were the structure are faithful representation of the arrangement.

193
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.420
How many different ones could you get?
Yeah,
just one.
Okay.

194
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:26.230
All the hydrogens are in that sense equivalent.
Okay.

195
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:31.120
How about if they're die?
How many could you get?
There's one,

196
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:33.370
two,
three,
four,
five.

197
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.940
<v 1>Right?
So are they all different</v>

198
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.020
cage,
what do you say?

199
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.160
<v 0>You say the purple and the red are the same.
And anything else?</v>

200
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.800
The two blues are the same.
Uh,
now does everybody agree with that?

201
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.743
Sherwin?

202
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.823
<v 1>Perfect.</v>

203
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.490
<v 0>Aha.
The red one is across the square and the the,</v>

204
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.910
the purple one is across just a single bond,
right?

205
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:14.040
So those are different if this model is faithful in that respect.
Okay.

206
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:14.831
So,

207
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:18.780
but we should take that one out because that one goes across both the square and

208
00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:23.780
a single bond.
Oh,
that's somebody else.
Okay.

209
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.620
Okay.
Now,
so there'd be four die substituted isomers if,

210
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.510
if it were that and calculate found three right now.

211
00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:35.360
How about if it were this structure,
how many mannose,

212
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.900
if you replace just one hydrogen,
how many different hydrogens,
Elizabeth?

213
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.260
Six.
They're all different,
right?

214
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.830
So there'll be six Banos how many dies?
Well,
let's count them.

215
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.720
So we'll start from the top left.
There would be those sets of dies,

216
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:55.490
the ones connected by those arrows,

217
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.910
and then we could start from the top are probably five of those.

218
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:04.040
Then we can start from that one and there'd be four and three and two additional

219
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:07.310
ones and one from that.
That hasn't been counted before.

220
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.910
So we'd have 15 die substituted isomers right now,

221
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:13.741
how about if a,

222
00:15:13.741 --> 00:15:18.290
these notice for these two that in both cases it's Aa,
BB,

223
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:22.550
a in the bottom one,
it's turned on its side,
but the same relationship,

224
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:27.320
the symmetry of it,
right?
Everybody see that?
Okay,

225
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:31.670
so these will have the same number of isomers even though their structures are

226
00:15:31.671 --> 00:15:35.540
obviously different,
but the same number of isomers.
So,
uh,

227
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.980
there'll be two mono substituted isomers either an a or a B,

228
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.450
and now we've got the dyes to figure out and that turns out there'll be six.

229
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:48.320
I'll let you do that yourself.
Okay,
so two six there.

230
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.710
Now how about if it were this,
which is a,

231
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.740
a BB cc because it doesn't have as much symmetry and the redwoods don't have as

232
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:59.750
much symmetry as the blue ones,
although they're the same as one another.

233
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.380
So it turns out they're three Banos a or B or c and there nine dies.

234
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:08.090
And you can work those out if you want to.
Okay.

235
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.170
So you can't distinguish among the red ones or between the blue ones,

236
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.970
but you can distinguish a black one from a aqua one from a blue,
from a red.
Okay?

237
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:17.451
So again,

238
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:21.320
you can get information about structure by counting isomers if you're good

239
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:24.440
enough and you can prepare them and you can tell them apart.

240
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.300
Okay,
now here's the problem for you to do for Monday.

241
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:34.100
And you can work in groups if you want to,
but take that this is a,

242
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.870
a planer and two dimensional,
right?
But in truth,

243
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:41.450
because carbons or tetrahedral,

244
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:47.000
when they formed for four single bonds,
the others are not planer,

245
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.260
right?

246
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.940
And I've drawn here how each of them would look in three dimensions with some

247
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:56.840
things,
the wedges coming out toward you and other things,

248
00:16:56.841 --> 00:17:00.560
the dotted ones going back into the page,
right?

249
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.710
So if you consider these in three dimensions,

250
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.510
how many isomers can you get?
Right?

251
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.810
That's the question.
Mano and die substituted.

252
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:16.811
Isomers will you be able to distinguish these if there are three dimensional and

253
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.850
uh,
that one,
remember it's called dewar benzene.

254
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.900
And the one that's not included was prison main or what's called Loddon Borg.

255
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.450
Benzine.
Remember I said we'd talk about Loddon Bork?
He's coming up.

256
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.580
So that's another possibility.
A three-dimensional symmetrical prism,
right?

257
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:38.000
Which obviously do or couldn't make with his models because they would,

258
00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:41.300
unless he distorted and bent them.
Right?
Okay.

259
00:17:41.301 --> 00:17:45.170
So the question is how many motto and die substituted isomers can you get from

260
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:47.000
these if they're three dimensional.

261
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.170
So you guys can get together and talk that over and tell me on Monday.

262
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.293
<v 1>Okay,</v>

263
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.850
<v 0>now there's another way to get a to infer structure.</v>

264
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.010
And that's from synthesis.

265
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.700
So calculate in 1867 reported that three acetone molecules shown on the left

266
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:13.110
there you see the c double bond o and two methyls attached to each central

267
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:17.610
carbon.
So three of those come together at a,
at be,

268
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:19.500
at sea,
losing water.

269
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:21.483
<v 1>All right?</v>

270
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.980
<v 0>And they form the double bonds on the right.</v>

271
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.130
So if that's the way the stuff forms,
then the carb,

272
00:18:31.131 --> 00:18:36.131
the three carbons in this compound called Masuda Lien should be on every other

273
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.570
carbon of the ring,
right?

274
00:18:38.571 --> 00:18:41.690
Because of the way it was put together by losing waters between them.

275
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.700
So that's another way of figuring out where something is by synthesis.

276
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:53.290
Notice incidentally that there are little dots in the middle of some of these

277
00:18:54.951 --> 00:18:58.370
bonds.
Why do you think those dots are there?

278
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:12.180
I think it's because this is a picture of a real model that was made with wire

279
00:19:12.941 --> 00:19:16.420
coming out of balls and that was the thing that screwed them together.

280
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.163
<v 1>Right?</v>

281
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.220
<v 0>Dewar had sent to calculate when he wanted to come work with him.</v>

282
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.570
A set of these brass strip models,
so this is,

283
00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:32.260
I think is is his version from brass strip models.

284
00:19:32.261 --> 00:19:35.860
Notice the funny bonds between the carbon and the oxygen,
the double bonds,

285
00:19:35.861 --> 00:19:36.700
those triangles.

286
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.420
Those are made of stiff wire that comes straight out and then were fastened

287
00:19:40.421 --> 00:19:43.080
together at an angle.
Okay.

288
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:47.410
Here's a picture actually of the model that calculate used in his lectures to

289
00:19:47.411 --> 00:19:52.120
show benzene and you can see that the carbon is tetrahedral.

290
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.590
<v 1>Okay.
Yes.</v>

291
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.290
<v 0>Yeah.
That,
that he made up in 1890 this is long after this.</v>

292
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.260
It's conceivable that he had such a dream,

293
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.850
but it was a story told for amusement.
Okay.

294
00:20:10.851 --> 00:20:14.270
So here he is at the time he did this in 1865 in Ghent,

295
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:19.430
and he was surrounded with some,
uh,
hot shots.
Kerner,

296
00:20:19.431 --> 00:20:22.670
for example,
uh,
who was a young man,

297
00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:27.620
he acted as calculated secretary at this time as well as a lab worker and

298
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.910
suffered from rheumatism.
He came from central Germany,
uh,

299
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:36.470
and which is a very sort of damp place,
a lot of the time and cloudy.

300
00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:39.440
And so it wasn't good for his rheumatism,
nor was getting to in Belgium.

301
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.030
So on his doctor's advice,
he went to Sunny Palermo in Sicily.

302
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.050
Uh,
so is down there on the northwest coast of Sicily.

303
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.460
And Cecily is a very interesting place in history.

304
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.030
It was liberated in 1860,
just before this time,

305
00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:02.140
after 2,700 years of occupation by successive cultures.

306
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.550
Okay.
Uh,
and the most recent one was,

307
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.100
was Garibaldi who came down,
uh,
with his,
uh,
uh,

308
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.010
his,
uh,

309
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.780
red shirts in 1860 to free Sicily from the borbons,

310
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:19.570
from the Spanish crown.
Okay.

311
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.080
And condit sorrow came along and established this laboratory in Palermo,

312
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.630
uh,
in 1860,

313
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.990
he helped both Garibaldi and the late [inaudible] God dro and gay loose sock.

314
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.750
Both of these were revolutionaries,

315
00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:40.600
although in different different senses.

316
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.420
Garabaldi was revolutionary politically and avid.

317
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.940
God Rowe was revolutionary about knowing the atomic weight and molecular weight

318
00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:53.650
of compounds through gas density,
but in his way,

319
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:56.110
Cannizzaro was a cautious person.

320
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:01.530
This is what he said when he spoke in London in 1872 on chemistry teaching.

321
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.450
He said,
above all,

322
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:09.451
we should take care that the pupils do not form to themselves any mechanical or

323
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:14.440
geometrical conception of the cause and effects of the quantum valence that is

324
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:16.360
the valence of Adams.

325
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.490
They must frequently be reminded that chemical facts neither approve nor

326
00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:25.150
disprove anything relating to size,

327
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:29.060
form continuity,
distance,
relative disposition,
et Cetera,

328
00:22:29.061 --> 00:22:34.061
et cetera of the Adams that is don't use these arguments for this purpose of

329
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:37.150
finding where things were.
Atoms are in molecules.

330
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.250
This is just a fancy that will appeal to students,
but isn't anything real.

331
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.850
This was a very cautious,
conservative point of view,

332
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:48.550
but it was shared by all the leaders in chemistry.

333
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:54.040
If we are sometimes obliged to speak of the relative position of atoms and the

334
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:57.760
molecules,
and even to give graphic representation to these positions,

335
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.440
we must hasten to remark that these figures are nothing but artifices of the

336
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:06.910
mind intended to represent to the site that which in reality,

337
00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:11.170
we perceive only through the veil of transformations.

338
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.520
So it's only through reactions that you try to infer something about this.

339
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.690
It's not something real,

340
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.980
but that we do not really know what it is that corresponds to that,

341
00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:22.150
which we call position,

342
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.920
either in space or in the mutual action of different portions of matter.

343
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:32.590
But he was one of the leaders,
right?
The followers,
the students were more,

344
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.390
didn't take this right?

345
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.780
So Kerner who had just come down for his health and joined condit sorrow in 1869

346
00:23:42.011 --> 00:23:46.550
he came down,
he came down to 1866 I think,

347
00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:47.384
or seven.

348
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:53.140
He wrote a paper called facts serving to determine chemical position in aromatic

349
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:56.510
substances.
Right.

350
00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:00.620
So a completely different point of view from what Cannizzaro advocated three

351
00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:03.950
years later,
right.
To determine position.

352
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.060
And the re Cannizzaro to be fair to him was saying that you have to be different

353
00:24:08.061 --> 00:24:09.470
in what you teach and what you do.

354
00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:12.710
Research on teaching should be things you really know for sure.

355
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.760
And research should be things where you're trying to push the push back,

356
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:20.600
the frontier.
But any current erode in this paper in 1869,

357
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:26.050
the dogma of the impossibility of determining the atomic constitution of

358
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:27.314
substances,

359
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:32.450
which until recently was advocated with such fervor by the most able chemists

360
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.470
is,
is beginning to be abandoned and forgotten.

361
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:40.760
And one can predict that the day is not far in the future when a sufficient

362
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:45.761
collection of facts will permit determination of the internal architecture of

363
00:24:45.831 --> 00:24:46.790
molecules.

364
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:51.770
A series of experiments directed towards such a goal is the object of this
paper,

365
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:57.440
right?
So that's what he's trying to do.
If he came along,
um,
uh,

366
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.930
50 years later,
what would he have used

367
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:07.880
to find the position of atoms and molecules?
X-Ray.
Right?

368
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:12.881
But he's using only reactions and counting isomers right.

369
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.050
So only the properties of things and elemental composition.
Okay.

370
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.320
Facts will permit determination of the internal architecture.

371
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:26.321
So this was a really new idea and the paper when it was published was introduced

372
00:25:28.521 --> 00:25:33.440
and warmly endorsed by Cannizzaro who went on to say later that the,

373
00:25:33.441 --> 00:25:36.710
that you shouldn't be teaching this to students,
but it is a good thing to study.

374
00:25:36.711 --> 00:25:41.270
Okay,
so current had,
there's a thing called the Kerner proof,

375
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:45.710
which indeed he proved,
uh,
but it's not what he did in 1869.

376
00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:47.000
But this is very interesting.

377
00:25:47.001 --> 00:25:51.590
So you have among die substituted isomers you have these possibilities.

378
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.510
Okay.
Now how could you tell which is which?

379
00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.710
Suppose you had three bottles.
One has black,
one red,
one blue,

380
00:26:00.711 --> 00:26:03.860
but they're not colored.
They're just white crystals.
How can you,

381
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.520
or liquids maybe in this case,
how could you tell which one is which?

382
00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.920
How could you put a label on the bottle?

383
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.630
What you could label them just with names,
call them something like Ortho,

384
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:18.260
Meta and para,
which doesn't mean anything,
right?

385
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.050
But how do you know which structure they have?

386
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:29.720
Corey
can't hear very well.
Oh,

387
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.660
that differences in melting point will show they're different.

388
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.420
But how do you know which one will have the lowest melting point?

389
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:38.750
You have to have some theory about melting point as a function of structure,

390
00:26:38.751 --> 00:26:43.260
which didn't exist or do you have such a theory?
Uh,

391
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.400
polarity but,
but,
but notice to be,
uh,
yeah.
Uh,

392
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.320
one of them would be non polar,

393
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.930
but people weren't measuring polarity at this time.

394
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:56.250
So that was out of the question.
Okay,
here's how current or did it,

395
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.880
he added a third identical substance substituent and counted the isomers.

396
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.080
So suppose you start with the black one,

397
00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.120
you add a third one down to the right or down at the bottom or,

398
00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:13.770
uh,
and that's all because if you added down to the left,

399
00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:17.760
it would be the same as down to the bottom.
And if you added over to the right,

400
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.620
it would be same as down to the,

401
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.780
over to the left to be the same as down to the right.

402
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.860
Everybody see that you can only get two isomers starting from there.

403
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.070
If you start from the red one,
you can get either of those.

404
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.740
Can you get anything else
from the red one,

405
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.310
Andrew?
Yeah,
down to the left will be a different one.

406
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:42.900
So you'll get three from that one.

407
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:45.660
And how about if you start with the blue one and put a third one in?

408
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.120
Maria,
what do you say?

409
00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.260
If you start with the blue one and put a third blue substituent in.

410
00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.840
Speak up a little.
Uh,
right.

411
00:28:01.841 --> 00:28:02.890
You can get the one in the middle.

412
00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:12.280
Yeah.
Nothing else,
right?
The only one.
Only one possibility there.
Okay,

413
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.370
so one we'll give one one,
we'll give to one.
We'll give three.

414
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.120
Suppose it into all the reactions work,
right?

415
00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:23.860
So what establishes the identity not only of the dye substituted but only also

416
00:28:23.861 --> 00:28:27.580
have the tri substituted isomers one comes from one of the original bottles.

417
00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:31.900
One comes from two and one comes from three.
So you know it pretty clever.

418
00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.070
And these were called [inaudible].

419
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.810
These are called now Ortho Meta and pair up.

420
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.110
But those aren't the names that,
that uh,
that Kerner used

421
00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.270
or more properly,
they are the names that he used,

422
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.350
but not to name the way we do it.
Now.
If anybody,
he had the right to name him,

423
00:28:54.351 --> 00:28:58.220
but he didn't get it because he was off in left field down in Palermo and the

424
00:28:58.221 --> 00:29:01.650
people up in Germany who are influential were the ones that finally named them.

425
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.790
Uh,
but notice that this argument is holds if benzene,

426
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.350
benzene is a hexagon,

427
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.390
but if it were a pentagonal pyramid or some other geometric structure,

428
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.870
then this argument wouldn't work at all.
Right?

429
00:29:17.871 --> 00:29:21.530
So you have first to know that all the positions are equivalent and benzene,

430
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.920
that it's not like some of those doers structures we were just looking at.

431
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.720
So how can you do that?

432
00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:31.040
This was proven in this paper in 1869 by Kerner,

433
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.080
the paper was published in Palermo,
in the journal,
the decency,

434
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.640
not rally at economic aid,
the Pell Eramo,

435
00:29:37.641 --> 00:29:40.880
which is the Journal of Natural Science and economics of Polera.

436
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.580
It's a beautiful big journal with big wide margins on the pages and so on.

437
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.360
But it had no circulation,
whatever the people in Germany years later,

438
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:54.040
we're still trying to prove this,
what he proved.
Okay,

439
00:29:54.041 --> 00:29:58.600
now here's a question.
Are the four valence as of carbon equivalent that is,

440
00:29:58.601 --> 00:30:02.470
are they all the same or might want to have them be a sh,
a thick bond,

441
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:06.040
say different from the other three.
Right?

442
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.550
Or might it even be that that two of the bonds are different,

443
00:30:09.551 --> 00:30:14.500
one's long or one of them's curly.
They might all four be different.

444
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:19.980
Can you think of any evidence to say that the bonds in methane are equivalent?

445
00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.130
How could you prove this?
Alison,
you gotta do

446
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.910
what technique is current or using,
pardon me?

447
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:36.160
Counting isomers so what do you expect if you have four different bonds and

448
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:41.070
carbon,
right?
How many isomers would you get if there were four different,

449
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.240
oh,
you could have a chlorine on the fat bond.
The long bond,

450
00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:48.280
the curly bond or the normal bond.
There'd be four.

451
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:52.180
Isomers if you could make them all and they didn't did or convert,

452
00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:58.090
right?
So there's only one,
uh,
methyl chloride.

453
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.130
Nobody's found a second methyl chloride.

454
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.500
So does that prove that they're all equivalent?

455
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.653
<v 1>Okay.</v>

456
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.470
<v 0>Yeah.
Pardon me?
Yeah.</v>

457
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.280
<v 1>Oh,
sounds good.
They can attach more than one.</v>

458
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.180
They know that they all sort of,
they will work.

459
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.740
<v 0>Okay.
That doesn't prove it alone because maybe there's only one that can be</v>

460
00:31:20.741 --> 00:31:24.260
substituted.
Right.
That is of the one,

461
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.160
if it have the structure on the right with four different bonds,

462
00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:29.620
maybe you could make only one motto substituted one.

463
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.380
How many die substitute to ones could you make them?

464
00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.360
Well,
the,
the,
if the first one went in one place,

465
00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:38.920
the second one could go any of three.

466
00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:41.950
So you'd still say get three die substituted.

467
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.150
Unless you could only make one of those,
then there would only be two.

468
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:51.100
So it doesn't really prove it the way a mathematician would like things proven,

469
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.610
but it's a plausibility at least.
Okay.
Okay.

470
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.760
But it turns out that that,
uh,

471
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:02.350
so the evidence is there's only one isomer known,
but it's not really proof.

472
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.560
Now current or in order to make a real proof had to make some assumptions.

473
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:13.300
And these,
he stated in 1867 two years before the paper we're talking about,

474
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.850
and the first is direct replacement.

475
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:20.740
And he wrote if one grants that in simple transformation,

476
00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:25.270
the new substitute substituent assumes the position or the element displaced.

477
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.830
So you can take a substituent often put a new one there but it will go in the

478
00:32:29.831 --> 00:32:33.610
same place that the old one came off.
Everything doesn't rearrange.

479
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:37.750
You need that in order to make arguments like he wants to make.
Right.

480
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:42.200
And in fact that's often true.
It's certainly logically parsimonious.

481
00:32:42.201 --> 00:32:45.260
It's the simplest assumption you could make and it usually is true,

482
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.580
but there are Orain rearrangements that do sometimes occur and we'll talk about

483
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:52.610
those later on.
But anyhow,
he,
for his argument,

484
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:54.320
you have to assume direct replacement.

485
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.190
And the second assumption is that experimental distinguishability,

486
00:32:58.191 --> 00:32:59.480
which we've been talking about,

487
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.770
most of the demonstrations are based on establishing the identity or difference

488
00:33:03.771 --> 00:33:06.230
of several substances at the same composition,

489
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.420
but it obtained by different reactions.

490
00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:11.930
So you have to be confident that you can tell when things are the same.

491
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.420
And when there are different,
we've just,
we're talking about that.

492
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.260
But currently was in an especially good position to do this because he was

493
00:33:18.261 --> 00:33:20.540
really skilled in the lab.
In fact,

494
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:23.960
he got a silver medal at a Paris exposition,

495
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:27.890
one of these international exposition for his collection of beautiful crystals

496
00:33:27.891 --> 00:33:31.400
that he had lovingly prepared and they had different shapes and so on.

497
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:36.320
That's one way you can tell things apart.
And in fact,
this bottle here,
uh,

498
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.500
says,
uh,
up at the top,
I don't think you can read it,
but it says laboratory.

499
00:33:41.501 --> 00:33:42.020
Oh,

500
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:47.020
Dki Mika Organica and it says aussied AC Sally Sealy Eco.

501
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:54.470
So what is it?
Salycilic acid.
This is Kerner sample,

502
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.540
right of salycilic acid.
And here's his,

503
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.300
here are his beautiful crystals of two,

504
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:07.301
six [inaudible] three Bromo Tallinn you can't see them so well.

505
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.480
Well,
you can see that there's still beautiful crystal,
right?

506
00:34:11.481 --> 00:34:15.380
So those are some of his prize crystals.
And here you can.

507
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.470
So crystals are the best way to tell them there pictures of those things that

508
00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:23.690
were occurring.
Hers.
Okay,

509
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:27.830
now here's his proof based on those assumptions.
Okay.

510
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:32.831
So there are three known isomers of Hydroxy Car boxell benzene.

511
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.950
So you don't know anything about the structure.

512
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:38.870
All you know is u of c six h four.

513
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.920
You originally at c six h six but one of the H's has been replaced by Oah and

514
00:34:42.921 --> 00:34:44.980
another age by Coh.

515
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:49.250
And the names of these things are salycilic acid,
which I just showed you.

516
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.080
Hydroxy benzoic acid and para hydroxy benzoic acid.

517
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.730
The names don't mean anything,

518
00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.660
but those are just what the bottles are called right now.

519
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.800
You want to use the existence of at least three.
You don't,

520
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.760
there might be 18 for all you know,
die substituted ones.

521
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:09.243
All right?

522
00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.010
But you know there are at least three is three and you can do experiments with

523
00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:17.090
them.
So these are the experiments.
First you treat it with hcl and heat it up.

524
00:35:17.091 --> 00:35:21.620
This was done by grave in 1866 and it loses the coh.

525
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:24.920
Remember we talked about how you could take benzoic acid,

526
00:35:24.921 --> 00:35:29.330
take the coh off and have benzene here.
It's done.
Take the coh off,

527
00:35:29.331 --> 00:35:32.840
but you're left with still the Oah and that compound,
as we mentioned before,

528
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:34.670
is called funnel,
right?

529
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:40.110
But you can do the same trick with para benzoic acid and you get the same

530
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.980
funnel,
not a different one.
What does that tell you?

531
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.530
It tells you that the difference between salycilic acid in para hydroxy benzoic

532
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:53.040
acid is not where the Oah is,

533
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.600
right?
They have to have the same position or the Ooh because,

534
00:35:57.601 --> 00:36:00.450
or at least equivalent ones because you get the same funnel out.

535
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.960
And it was found also by gravy that you could convert hydroxy benzoic acid to

536
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.030
methyl Anna safe.

537
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:11.370
That's the Oah becomes o c h three and so same for the acid.

538
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.930
And then you can convert it to an acidic acid taking the ch three off on the

539
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:18.420
acid group from the ester.
That is to say,

540
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:23.890
and you can convert funnel by way of Bromo Anna Soul Kerner,

541
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:24.990
I believe did this.

542
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.090
And then by with sodium and co two to get the same monistic acid.

543
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.170
Right?

544
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:36.170
So the o position has to be the same in hydroxy benzoic acid is it was in salah

545
00:36:37.001 --> 00:36:39.000
silicon para hydroxy.
Right?

546
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.830
So the conclusion is the difference among the three isomers that are known

547
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.820
salycilic hydroxy benzoic acid,

548
00:36:44.821 --> 00:36:48.510
para hydroxy benzoate is not where the oil is.

549
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:53.880
Since the ohs survives in identical compounds.
So if for example,

550
00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:58.140
it couldn't be like these three isomers of doers,
a structure here,

551
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.520
suppose that we're one of the acids and that were another one and that we're the

552
00:37:02.521 --> 00:37:07.380
third.
Then when you took the coh off,
you'd have three different Oah compounds.

553
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.170
Everybody with me,
you see that?

554
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.250
So the difference among these three,
whatever it is that makes them different,

555
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:19.140
can't be where the Oah is because you can remove the coh and they're all the

556
00:37:19.141 --> 00:37:22.380
same.
Okay.
For,
that's the first step.

557
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:27.770
And the conclusion is the sites occupied by Oah are either identical or

558
00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.760
[inaudible] or equivalent.
Here's what's equivalent.

559
00:37:32.761 --> 00:37:36.760
So suppose they could be this.
There's O,
h,
c,
O,
h,
c,
did I?
Yeah,
here.

560
00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:41.740
So you could have that.
Ooh,
that o h and that,
no,
there,
there,

561
00:37:41.741 --> 00:37:45.870
it's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm messing this up.
There's one,

562
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.560
one,
two,
three.

563
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.870
The ohs in those are not the same position once the top right,
the others,

564
00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.550
the top left,
but they're equivalent.
Right?
Once you got it,

565
00:37:56.551 --> 00:38:00.180
you could flop it over and they're the same as one another.
Okay.

566
00:38:00.181 --> 00:38:01.920
So we know at least that much.

567
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.010
So let's call the Oah position,
which is either the same or exactly equivalent,

568
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.140
call it Omega just for an Ame.

569
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:15.470
So always is in the position of h Omega that we know in all three compounds.

570
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.760
Can you guess what you do next?

571
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.520
Next?
Yeah,

572
00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.053
<v 1>probably,</v>

573
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:35.080
<v 0>ah,
take the Oah off and leave the COO h.
Right.</v>

574
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:39.460
And that's possible too.
You can treat it with phosphorous,
Penta chloride,

575
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:44.440
which converts Oah to cl.
And then with sodium and water,

576
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:46.990
which takes the chlorine off and leaves hydrogen.

577
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.920
So you get benzoic acid and what do you do next?

578
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.610
Do it to one of the other compounds right there.

579
00:38:55.611 --> 00:39:00.200
And you get the same benzoic acid or you do it here.

580
00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.500
And I think Kerner is the guy who did that,
although I can't,

581
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.080
I haven't found a paper to that effect.
But anyhow,

582
00:39:06.081 --> 00:39:09.230
he says that you get the same benzoic acid.
So what does that prove?

583
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:17.150
So the coh positions are not fundamentally different in the three compounds.

584
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:22.690
So the Oah positions are equivalent and also the coh positions are equivalent.

585
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.890
How can then then be different?

586
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.200
The three compounds because they're clearly different.

587
00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.180
It must be their relative positions that are different.
Okay.

588
00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:38.970
The the three isomers do not differ because of the absolute position of the Coh.

589
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:45.050
So the three sites of Coh are equivalent and we can name them x and Y and z.

590
00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.790
None of them can be exactly the same because if they were exactly the same,

591
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.570
then the those hydroxy benzoic acid,

592
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.870
two of them at least would have been the same.
If the Coh is,

593
00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.590
cause we know the ohs where the same.
Okay.
So for example,

594
00:40:01.591 --> 00:40:06.591
it could be this way in doers Benzie you could have that position for x that for

595
00:40:07.231 --> 00:40:11.220
why that fuzzy and they're all different with respect to omega.

596
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

597
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.910
<v 0>The Omega is,
we'll all be the same.
So that that would be a possibility.</v>

598
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:24.710
Possible structure according to this,
in this particular case,

599
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.720
Omega would be the same as x,

600
00:40:26.721 --> 00:40:31.721
Y andZ as a site for a single substituent if it were this structure.

601
00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.690
So Rpa,
a chemist had made a compound,

602
00:40:38.691 --> 00:40:40.160
which he called Nitro Antillean,

603
00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:44.090
which was benzine that had Nh two and n o two in it.

604
00:40:44.091 --> 00:40:48.860
And it was known by transformations.
The NH two was Omega,

605
00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.120
that position,
Ooh,
Omega and the n o two was in why that is.

606
00:40:53.121 --> 00:40:58.100
You could interconvert groups and make it into one of those known hydroxy

607
00:40:58.101 --> 00:41:02.870
benzoic acid.
So you knew it was Omega and why.
Okay,

608
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.960
now you do a transfer and it's related to that particular hydroxy benzoic acid.

609
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:11.563
Okay.

610
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:16.220
Now you replaced the Nh two by br and we'll talk about these next semester.

611
00:41:16.221 --> 00:41:21.221
What particular reactions did that and then you change an Otu to Nh two and then

612
00:41:23.451 --> 00:41:25.850
you replace the Nh two by chlorine.

613
00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.510
So now you've got benzene with bromine.

614
00:41:29.511 --> 00:41:34.310
That must be in the Omega position because it replaced the first Nh and then

615
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:35.600
chlorine is in why?

616
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:40.610
Because substituted for the second Nh two which came from the n o two which was

617
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:41.444
in why.

618
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.633
<v 1>Okay,</v>

619
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.330
<v 0>so it's Omega and why can you see what he's going to do next?</v>

620
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.823
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

621
00:41:55.580 --> 00:42:00.580
<v 0>he replaces the Nh two by cl and then changes that o two to Nh two and then</v>

622
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:03.200
replaces it by br.
Why?

623
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:11.000
So now he's prepared a compound,
which clearly has chlorine in the position,

624
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:13.850
Omega and bromine.
And the position.
Why

625
00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.870
I see pursing of browse and so on.
Is everybody clear?

626
00:42:21.871 --> 00:42:24.400
So he is prepared to come from the same compounds.

627
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.870
Could prepared a bromide chloride,
right?

628
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.850
One of them is Omega Bromide,
uh,
uh,

629
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:35.790
why chloride and the other has them exchange.
And what do you think he observed?

630
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:38.340
They're the same.

631
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:42.710
What does that show?

632
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.640
It shows that Omega is the same as why?
Because our while,

633
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.870
otherwise these be different.
When you put different atoms in,

634
00:42:51.871 --> 00:42:55.320
I'm assuming you have the experimental technique to tell when things are

635
00:42:55.321 --> 00:43:00.240
different.
Okay.
So now,
so it couldn't be,
for example,

636
00:43:00.241 --> 00:43:04.920
a pentagonal pyramid,
which one had bromine and why?
And the other head,

637
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.630
chlorine and chlorine.
And why the other head chlorine in Omega and bromine.

638
00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:11.550
And why it couldn't be that those would be different.

639
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:13.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

640
00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:18.310
<v 0>So there must be at least four equivalent substitute positions.</v>

641
00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:23.530
Omega why x,
Y,
and Z.
Okay.

642
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.490
And that would be consistent with that structure we showed before this one.

643
00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.080
So it could be that doesn't have to be a hexagon.

644
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:34.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

645
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:36.020
<v 0>Now here's the next step.</v>

646
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.580
So you start with a compound that's known to be in the meadow series.

647
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:43.580
It's got o,
h n Omega and Nitro,

648
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:48.790
n o two he wrote a z o two in x and you have another one that has again,

649
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:54.940
Ooh and the position Omega but bromine in x instead of Nitro,
right?

650
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.590
And now you start doing substitutions.

651
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.630
I remember he used Metta differently from the way we do.
Okay,

652
00:44:02.631 --> 00:44:03.930
so first he put in a burrow,

653
00:44:03.931 --> 00:44:08.931
mean someplace and then a nitro some place and got Bromo Nitro Mehta,

654
00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.800
nitro funnel.
Okay.
You added the Bromo on the nitro group.

655
00:44:12.801 --> 00:44:17.801
So you know that's the benzene core with h two with a nitro someplace with a

656
00:44:17.941 --> 00:44:21.450
Bromo someplace.
Those are the ones you just put in.
But the era,

657
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.580
others are still where they were.
Oh h is in Omega and Nitro is in,

658
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.680
is in x position.
All right?

659
00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.730
And now you go to the other compound and put in two nights groups.

660
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.510
So you don't know where those two nitro groups are.
But you know,

661
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:40.470
Omega is that Oha is in Omega and bromine is in X.

662
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:45.580
Everybody see what you've done now and you know what he observed?

663
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.130
Those two compounds are identical.

664
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.850
Can you see what conclusion you get from that?

665
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.930
These are identical,
right?

666
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:06.290
But one of them has bromine in x and the other has nitro in x.

667
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.160
How can they be identical?

668
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:17.310
There must be a second exposition.
That's equipment.

669
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.290
There must be two positions that are equivalent right now.

670
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:25.030
Could any of those positions be ones we already know?
Could it be omega?

671
00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.760
Well,
we already know Omega x,
Y,
and z are the same,
right?

672
00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.710
Could this new x be one of those?
Could it be omega?

673
00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.490
No,
because we already got omega,
so it can't be omega.

674
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:43.420
Could it be y or z?
No,

675
00:45:43.421 --> 00:45:46.810
because those would have started from a different compound in the first place if

676
00:45:46.811 --> 00:45:51.220
it were Y or Z.
Right?
You know that this is in x.
It's not.

677
00:45:51.221 --> 00:45:54.190
Why not z?
Right?
So there must be a second x.

678
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:57.630
All right,
we'll call it x prime.

679
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.520
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

680
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.430
<v 0>There must be two positions,
x and x prime.
None up.</v>

681
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.570
They're not equivalent to x or Y,
or they're not equivalent to x or y.

682
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.380
They're not the same as x or y or Z or Omega.
It's a new one.

683
00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:14.500
Okay.
So that's what they are.

684
00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:20.020
So there must be at least five equivalent positions now that would be consistent

685
00:46:20.021 --> 00:46:24.270
with that Pentagonal Pyramid,
right?

686
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.510
All the five around the base of it,
or at five equivalent positions.

687
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:32.511
But you can't get three different dye substituted ones among those positions.

688
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.030
Right?
So it couldn't be that.

689
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:42.080
So none of doers models work with this.

690
00:46:42.081 --> 00:46:44.660
Although the perfect hexagon will work a perfect one,

691
00:46:44.661 --> 00:46:49.661
not alternating single and double bonds and the equal lateral triangular prism,

692
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.990
the Loddon Borg,
benzene,
we'll also work.
So as I said,

693
00:46:53.991 --> 00:46:58.490
that it would work with either of those,
except that the one on the right,
uh,

694
00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.670
doesn't give the right number of dice substituted isomers.

695
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:07.090
Now Kerner zone argument that the six position is equivalent was faulty because

696
00:47:07.131 --> 00:47:11.900
it hinged in a subtle way on assuming that the benzene was huck hexagonal before

697
00:47:11.901 --> 00:47:15.800
you proved it was,
it wasn't obvious,
but it's true if you look at it carefully.

698
00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:21.140
But it is possible using group theory to construct a logically rigorous argument

699
00:47:21.141 --> 00:47:24.680
on the basis of his evidence is last step of his argument was wrong,

700
00:47:24.681 --> 00:47:26.660
but his evidence was adequate to prove it.

701
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.750
So he was right in his that this proved it and he was right in his conclusion

702
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.550
that all the positions are equivalent.

703
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:38.170
So he deserves enormous credit for formulating the logic of the first true

704
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:41.200
structural proof,
not just one of these plausibility things.

705
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:45.820
Like there's only one motto substituted methane,

706
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:49.300
Chloro Methane.
Therefore all the positions are equivalent.
Right.

707
00:47:49.301 --> 00:47:52.660
That's just plausibility.
But this is a real rigorous proof.

708
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:59.460
Now how many isomers do you think there are of c two h four B r two

709
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:05.630
think about it.
Ethane with two bromines.
How many isomers

710
00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.700
so pardon me,
somebody guest

711
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.890
John.
Great.
And how would you get three?

712
00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:25.010
Oh No,
no double bond.
There are six things on it.
So forget that one.
Yep.

713
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:29.330
If we're double bonds,
you'd be right.
But there are no,
they'll want Corey.

714
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:34.010
And what would you call them?
How would you distinguish them or describe them?

715
00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.270
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

716
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:41.110
<v 0>oh good.</v>

717
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:45.400
So you could have two bromines on one carbon or one bromine on each carbon.

718
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.180
So there should be two isomers.
Now in that same journal,

719
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:52.390
the same volume at the same journal in 1869 in Palermo,

720
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:57.391
a guy named Paterno said the three isomers of Dye Bromo Ethane,

721
00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.520
supposedly they actually exist,

722
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.020
can easily be explained without assuming any difference among the four valence

723
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:09.010
as of carbon.
You don't need curly bonds,
long bonds and stuff like that.

724
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:12.880
And here's how he explained it with this pictures,
right?

725
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:16.570
So both on the left,
most I have two on the same Adam,

726
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.410
the other two have one on each atom,
and how are they different?

727
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.810
One on each carbon atom.
But how do they differ

728
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:28.150
in the phase of rotation around the carbon carbon single bond?

729
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:32.110
Right?
And at the bottom he says,

730
00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:36.610
or actually notice there's a little black thing in the middle.

731
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.540
What do you think it is,

732
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:46.120
Dana?
What do you think?
Right?

733
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:50.330

right?

735
00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:59.150

it is superfluous to say that this is only a way of representing the facts and

738
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:11.090
that all these ideas need to be tested experimentally.
So we'll see next time.

739
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:13.520
What kind of reception this received.
