00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.920
In this lesson, you'll use Salesforce to quickly visualize your data using

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.119
charts, reports and dashboards. Sam and Andy are going to help you with that.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.050
&gt;&gt; So, it seems like if you're a music festival manager, there

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.440
are a ton of opportunities for visually conveying information to other people.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.650
&gt;&gt; Totally. I mean, with all of the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.680
different things that you're tracking, maybe you want to track

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.170
things that are over time, or maybe you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.760
want to track just the distribution of a specific thing.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.570
&gt;&gt; Like VIP

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.720
tickets versus general admission, or money over time, or something like that.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.920
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and just like whenever

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.860
you're charting anything, there are different types

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.130
of charts that you might want to use in order to display that information.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.210
&gt;&gt; Or, maybe we just want to create reports on it.
