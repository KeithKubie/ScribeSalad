00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.340
We are a practical species, and when we think
of love, it is normal to focus on the sort

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.030
that goes places, that is mutual, that leads
people to form couples and perhaps one day

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:24.119
households. But the more peculiar reality
is that the greatest share of humanity’s

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.731
love stories have unfolded in a directionless
form in the recesses of the mind of only one

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:36.890
party. It seems that we are – in aggregate
at least – committed first and foremost

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.950
to the unrequited version of love. At any point, millions

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.350
of love stories are quietly being spun by
one person while the object of their adoration

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.710
goes about their business blithely unconcerned.
Someone watches someone else on a train, casts

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.010
surreptitious glances at a delegate at a conference;
carefully notes a fellow shopper’s manner

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.870
in a grocery store – and the earth spins
on undisturbed. Unrequited lovers are easy

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.170
to dismiss as not far from pathetic. If we
were better designed and a little saner, we

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.490
would of course never develop feelings for
people who were not prepared to develop them

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.390
for us – nor squander our days on desires
without logical or practical outcome. Related

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.380
image But, looked at more benevolently, there
is something hugely salutary and noble about

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.180
our capacity to entertain tender daydreams.
It is a feat to be able to detonate powerful

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.560
longings without causing any inconvenience
to other people. The ability to daydream is a significant

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.580
human achievement. Rather than wishing that
we stop doing so, we should be worried by

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.650
what might happen to us if we couldn’t daydream,
if we were faced with the choice of either

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.130
accepting reality in all its barrenness or
else of barging into the lives of others with

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.349
unwanted desires. Daydreaming is a vital and
artful safety valve, mediating between resignation

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:16.029
on the one hand and uncontained effusions
on the other. Along the way, unrequited love

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:20.950
provides us with an occasion to exercise our
aptitudes for optimism in a highly salutary

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.719
way. After a few decades on the earth, it
is only too easy to start to hate our fellow

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:32.930
humans for their mediocrity, selfishness and
idiocy. But with our beloved in mind, we can,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.859
for once, give free reign to a boundless generosity
that a god or the parent of a newborn might

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:46.250
deploy. We can tell ourselves that we have
found an angel, an exalted being, on the basis

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.540
of nothing more than how wise their green
eyes look or how delicately they open their

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.769
yogurt for lunch. Our verdicts are a delusional
exaggeration, but – given how much grounds

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.319
there is to despair at the human experiment
– perhaps a noble and forgivable one as

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.650
well. Related image It’s the privilege of
unrequited love never to have to encounter

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.069
the disappointment that follows from contact
with reality. We are not after accurate knowledge

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.799
of what it would be like to coexist with this
person. We don’t really want to know how

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.900
they might behave in the midst of a crisis
at work or over a holiday with their parents.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.040
We’ve been through enough such trials – and
the results aren’t edifying. Of course they

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:40.409
would, after a 
time in our arms, prove less than ideal and

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:46.669
a little more like everyone else we know.
We may be denied intimacy, but we are granted

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:53.379
access to something arguably far nicer: boundless
hope. We can attach to the form and figure

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.260
of the person we desire everything we so want
to be true about human beings. The beloved

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.739
becomes the repository of every desire: for
a particular kind of intelligence, wit, temperament

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:12.049
and outlook. The older we get, the more unrequited
love brings us back into contact with a passion

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.090
and hope that feels like an essential relief,
like finding out that we can still run – or

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.960
giggle. In meditating on our beloved, we’re
not getting to know a real person; we are

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.530
gaining an insight into our ideals. One day,
perhaps in the not too distant future, we’ll

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.180
be surrounded by a thought police that will
look inside our minds at will and ruthlessly

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.150
condemn for us for all the phantasmagoria
that goes on in them. But for the moment at

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.979
least, we can have any thought we like with
impunity: we and the beloved can go on holiday

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.009
to Portugal, can have four adorable children
together, can dance in the town square all

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.620
night – and the armed guards will never
know. Image result for le rayon vert It is

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.530
hard to share with most acquaintances quite
what we are going through. But those who do

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.479
understand become the targets of particular
gratitude. A true friend will indulge our

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.620
folly and be generous to our melodramas. They
will avoid the easy task of censoring and

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.090
upbraiding us. They will have enough of an
impression of our basic mental health to shepherd

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:28.599
us only gently back to melancholic sanity.
Episodes of unrequited love force us to develop

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:35.960
a sense of humour about ourselves. It is impossible
to think too well of who we are in their aftermath.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.400
Unrequited love edges us inevitably towards
a basic humility. We are at last confirmed

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.039
as truly ridiculous. With any luck, no one
gets hurt, it is just that, for a time, the

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:56.090
world seems a bit more wondrous, more exciting
and more blessed than usual. A natural impulse

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.159
is to try to convert our longings into something
more sensible, either to start a proper love

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:07.639
affair or else to dismiss our dreams as too
silly to nurture. Maybe we should do neither,

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.539
but rather let the unrequited love exist on
its own, neither fully grown up nor wholly

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:21.150
damnable, neither deeply horrible nor quite
sane. It is just the mind, a very complicated

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:27.389
machine, constrained by the narrowness of
existence, turning its wheels, tantalised

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:33.139
by a vision of happiness and sensing, quite
rightly and quite hopelessly, that there could

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:38.040
have been so much more to life than there
ever will be.
