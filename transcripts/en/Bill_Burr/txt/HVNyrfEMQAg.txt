Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, July 18th, 2016 what's going on? How are you? Um, I hope you're good. I hope things are well. Has everything okay with you in the family?

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       anyways, this is the last a week of I'm writing for emphasis for family. You know, we got a table read today and then tomorrow we punch up, you know, fix whatever jokes didn't work at the table read. And then on a Wednesday we were, we record it and then, uh, then I get my wife back. I'm so fucking excited. I'm so fucking excited to have this, um, behind me all this frigging work. And um, I'm very excited for you guys to see this sync. Granted, it's animation so it'll come out sometime fucking 20, 36 or something. Um, I dunno. Well that's how it works. That's, that's how the process works. But I know the big thing is actually writing the scripts and we're finishing it, uh, tomorrow after the punch up and then I'm done. I literally, I have the same giddiness I used to have. Remember like the second week of June with just even the fucking nerds didn't give a fuck anymore. Right. They weren't cleaning that glasses. They were just showing up. They didn't give a fuck. Right. It teachers would dress and casual. Everyone just was yet it's over. It's over. Let's get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       You know, it's unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       I don't get, you know, that's, that's why I like sometimes when I look at homeless people because everybody just wants to get the fuck out and nobody, you know, you still want to work and every once in a while you look at like these fucking bombs. And I don't mean like people like try something tragic happened to them. You know what I mean? I Dunno. Like some sinkholes swallowed up their fucking home and then they didn't have sinkhole insurance and now they're fucking, you know, sleeping at a bus station. I don't mean those people. I mean the bumps, the old school Hobos, the guys out there riding the fucking railroads, right. Let's stick with the handkerchief around. It went a little peanut butter and fluff another sandwich inside of it. Those guys go, they got to figure it out.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:17       They always feel how I feel right now. You know why? Because they never have to go to work. It's always over. It's always over. And then, you know, what do you do? You go to a new town, you wash some dishes. Next thing you know, you know you're eating beans over a fire outside, you know, eat and with the knife or some shit, you know. Does that one how they used to do it or is that just what the actors used to do in those old movies? Trying to make an interesting choice. I'm going to eat with my knife. Maybe that'll make me the next John Wayne. Um, yeah, they have it fucking figured out. You never done that. You never just walked down the street in the middle of the day, in the middle of your fucking stressful day. You're coming back from lunch wondering mentally, how the fuck am I going to get through next four, four and a half fucking hours. He is walked by and you see some homeless guy just fucking just napping, laying on a park bench or aren't even on the sidewalk and just so fucking sprawled out and just in such a deep level of sleep. It yet actually looks appealing for half a second. You know, I'd love to interview one of those people and just be like, who won the Superbowl this year? Just to see how out of the loop they are slash how big are sports? You know, do you know who tiger woods is? Do you know what happened to them?

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       You know, are you aware that we're at war right now still? Where were you when it started? Were you behind the desk? We in normal, you know, do you have a soup? Did you sit there and laugh at jokes that you didn't think were funny, but just doing it to try to get to the next level fucking cubicles that what you did. At what point did you just decide, fuck this. I want to take a nap when I want to nap. Can you imagine if you were allowed to nap whenever you wanted to nap? How much better the world would be? You could just be at work and just be like, Eh, you know what? I'm got to go lay it out for about fucking 20 minutes. Just go over and curl up in a fucking ball and that'll be it. You know what I'm trying to say people's, I'm very excited.

Speaker 2:          00:04:27       As much as I enjoy writing these fucking things, it's just great. Dead A, you know, I'm looking at my dog right now, just fucking chilling out. Just fucking laying there. She's laying there. She's she, I don't even know why. She's tired. Fucking tired from all you got damn sleep and I'm jealousy. You cleo, CLIA, nothing. She knows I'm talking about her, but she doesn't give a shit. She's fucking tapped out. She's laying on the rug. There's a little bit of Sun spilling in from the window and she picked the sunny warm part of the rug and that is it. That's all the fuck she needs. You know? No upward mobility. She's not working on her next fucking season of a, you know, fucking the real pit bulls of the greater Los Angeles area. She doesn't give a fuck. She's got nothing on her agenda every day.

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       It's fucking tremendous. Maybe that's why their lives are only 10 to 15 years, you know, they just get to live like the all, you know, cause when you look at your whole life, if you're lucky, you get 10 to 15 years total of just bliss. And the rest of it, you know, it was just dealing with some cotton, with coffee breath telling you you didn't have enough, you didn't bring the right fucking forms. You got to go back home and go get something else and stand in line again. That's, that's what the rest of your life is like. But if you're lucky, 10 to 15 fucking years of it, you know, you get to live like my dog right now, taking a nap on the sunny part of the rug. By the way, there's so much shit going on right now, like on the Internet, on the inner web that I just don't understand. What is the big fucking deal. You know, that whole George Bush dancing thing, I looked that up thinking he was going to be just an absolute fucking lunatic. Like, oh no, stop, stop. You're making all white dudes look bad. Everybody already knows we can't dance. It wasn't bad at all. You look like he was in a good mood.

Speaker 3:          00:06:21       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:21       You know his fucking energy. It's like I get that fucking energy. He, he showing up. He's a patriotic son of a bitch. That's his jam. You know, we sways a little bit and you know what's great too is in his head, he's laughing at Obama. Like, go on. I ha you still have to do that job, George Bush. It's on summer vacation and the fucking look he has on his face says the same. Look, I have all I got to get through. I just gotta get through fucking, uh, basically tomorrow. Get through the, the next rewrite and then that's it. And of course, you know the be a zillion punch ups and editing sessions, but like the fucking daily grind is a, it's done. That's where George Bush is at right now. You know, he fucking launched the missiles. All right? Bunch of fucking people died. He's mentally past it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:13       He bought his pieces of land down in South America that sit on aquifers. You know? Who knows? Maybe he goes out and he gets a fucking 12 pack. I don't know. He just looked like a really fucking happy guy. Since when does a president have to know how to fucking dance? He does it. Oh, his fucking job is to get on TV and scare the shit out. Scare the shit out of you about whatever. The fucking people above them who want to make money on something. You know, we got to get these people. We gotta get those people. We gotta get some people. There's some people out there to come and get you going to get you these people. Malley's playing pool lock. You Lino whack. You sitting there on your couch. It's like, how the fuck do they not like me? They don't even know me. I haven't interacted with these cuts. You know who has, you have their Fucko. What did you and your friends do to Piss them off? You know what I mean? You went out and you pissed off another fucking country. Now you're trying to make it seem like they're out [inaudible] coming after me. They're coming after you. You con they're never gonna get to you. You know why? Because you have security and I don't, you know, I'm just fucking sitting here sitting here with a Mug of fucking t.

Speaker 3:          00:08:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       That would be great. Collectively if the world did that, you know, in the world leaders, right? All of them, they wanted to start a war. It'd be like eight people and those who all the people, little fucker, you know, the infidels and all that. Everybody just, all regular people just sat there. I released that. What's going on? Well listen dude, if you got a beef with them, why don't you go fucking settle it? Cause I've never talked to those people and then that's it. Then we watch it on pay per view, you know, slap fights, world leader, slap fights, you know, and it doesn't solve anything other than, than we just get to enjoy complete fucking sociopathic money, power hungry. Fucking psychos. Just slapping each other in the face. You know? Didn't we just get to sit in the crowd eating popcorn going? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:12       Oh, oh. Watching them slapping each other.

Speaker 2:          00:09:20       That's his, as you know, something, if we were really civilized, that's as far as it would go. You know, we just sit there and watch, you know, Obama have a slap fight with the al Qaeda guy or a fucking isis guy and then that would be it. And there'd be nobody underneath any of them. I wouldn't even be Obama. It would be the fucking, the corporate cuts who make all the fucking money off the misery. I'm sorry. People just that, that you know, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:09:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:47       I hate how they always act like the world is going crazy. The world is not going crazy. You just keep showing the crazy shit. It's like these fucking lunatics said [inaudible] who drove the fucking truck into the people? It's like, why? Why did that guy do that? People never did shit like that, at least to to the, to the, when I was growing up, people did not do shit like that, at least as far as the, the sheer amount of these fucking incidents now. And I really think it's because, I think it's the news coverage. They wanted their last act on earth. They want people to then be like inside the crazy mind of Jill blow, he, he was born in there, they get to do his whole fucking backstory. I think that that's what they're going for. So obviously when something like that happens, you got to report on it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:35       But I don't think, I don't want to know the person's name. I don't want no fucking thing. But they should die completely fucking anonymous. And I think if they maybe, why don't we try that? You know, instead of, you know, the people who get fucking killed, maybe they talk about him for fucking, you know, once or whatever. But the person who fucking kills everybody, you know, they get their own little fucking half hour, hour long special. You know, as news people sit there with their brow furrowed, you know, disturbing, disturbing Malema Blahblahblahblahblah and they fucking talk about it for 24 hours and they make a zillion dollars in advertising. Oh, I'm a fucking cynical con today. Absolutely. But by the way, that Bush dancing thing was, that was not bad at all. He looked like he was, he was in a great mood. And you know what? Good for him. Good for him. That fucking dope guy say he's it dope. I can't really say he's a Dopa guy. You guys bilingual, right? You've got to have some sort of brains in there. You smart enough to realize he didn't belong at Yale, so he fucking drowned it in a 12 pack every 20 minutes. I mean, I, I relate to the guy. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:11:46       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:46       Anyways. Oh, by the way, if one more person fucking tweets me about that stupid suspension, the Tom Brady Think d, the sheer amount of people that don't even understand that at that has nothing to do.

Speaker 3:          00:12:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:00       You know, like all of a sudden it was proven that easy. He is a Chichi cheater. Now, that's not what that was about. The first one that was the, did he cheat? And that went to a court of law and was laughed out of court. The second one, all that was was the NFL. They changed their argument. They go, we're a corporation. He's our employee. Do we have the right to suspend him? And the court was like, yes, you do. And then they came back and they said, hey Tom, remember that fucking trial we had with no fucking evidence whatsoever? That kind of evidence that gets laughed out of court. Well, we're going to uphold it so you're suspended. So that's basically what happens.

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       I just don't, I don't know people here. What the fuck they want to hear. All right. Um, all freckles has been working out all freckles. He's been working out. I told you I was up to one 86 and fucking change, uh, stepped on the scale this week, one 82 and change telling the first week he can always drop three to four, because it's such a shock to your system of like, holy fuck, we're doing this now. If you just start eating healthy, working out, right? You stop beating around five or six o'clock and just crush waters and you don't eat again until late the next morning. You know, I'm telling you, you can drop three to four now. Now I'm in my second week of this shit, so I want to get down to one 79 and then the week after that one 76. So I'm in the mid one seventies when I go over to Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       So I represent my fucking country properly. Okay? All those European cons, they want nothing more than for me to go over there and be some fat. Fuck, you know, who doesn't know what's going on in the world. That's what they want. So what you do is, is you show up in shape, right? You go on Wikipedia, you Google their fucking city, right? You find out what's going on and then you just pretend you read, you sit there with your flat stomach and you pretend like you've read. That's what you do. And you know what? It irritates him. I'm fucking with you anyway. So I'm down to one 82 and uh, one 79 next week, the big seven, I got to see that man, that second number's gotta be a seven. It can't, I refuse to be an eight or higher ever. Uh, I just can't fucking do it. Although having said that at my age, how slow my metabolism is and how much I like to fucking eat and drink and all of that shit, I could easily, I could hit two bills. Like if I really,

Speaker 3:          00:14:33       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:14:33       like just shut it all down as far as moving around, you know, I just stopped doing shows and I just sat here like my dog, I swear to God, dude, I could be 200 pounds by the beginning of October. Easy.

Speaker 3:          00:14:47       Right?

Speaker 2:          00:14:48       That's not even fucking trying without even fucking trying. If I just ate what the fuck I wanted to eat, oh my God. Is there a worse site than a fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:00       Five, nine and three quarter 210 pound redheaded male. And that's not something that you want to see. And I don't mean muscle, I just mean coming at you looking like, you know, I work at dairy queen and I'm constantly taking advantage of my employee discount. Nobody wants to see that. Right? It's not a man looking like my legs. My pasty fat fucking legs as white is to soft serve vanilla ice cream that I have every 20 minutes. So anyways, I'm going to get down to 'em once 79 next week. Um, I just been fucking hitting the God damn elliptical and a dude. My sciatica is just completely fucking gone. Uh, I'm going for not, I'm getting massage every fucking week, right. That deep tissue. Just somebody beats the shit out of you and I'm getting all of this stuff. All of these fucking wall is crap that was in my legs from all of these years.

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       flying on planes, playing pickup hockey with no hockey stuff. You know, they tell you guys that shit. No, I don't think I did. Yeah, I had another fucking massage and this lady had an elbow jam so far into the back of my leg, my hamstring. I was like having memories of every time I fucked up my leg, she hit a spot and I'd be like, and then I'd be like, Oh yeah, that was the time I played pickup hockey and all I had was gloves, a helmet and a stick. And I was playing defense. Right. And I'm skating full speed, you know, cause we have the puck and all of a sudden they steal it and they tried to fucking turn around and go back the other way. Dude. And I caught an edge who's getting hurt? I suck at skating and could barely go backwards and I fucking shot up in the air and landed on my left side ass cheek all the way down to my thigh.

Speaker 2:          00:16:55       I landed so hard, I didn't even hit my head and I still saw stars. And uh, that was one of those things where I didn't even try to get up. I just sat there for a second, just waiting for everything to settle afterwards and then fucking, I got up fast enough before everybody came over and said, dude, you are right. You are right. You don't want to be that guy. And I just fucking like, you know, skated over the bench, one leg working. I was just like, Eh, hey, oh hey, all the way over. And I just sat down and like, I, you know, you know, pick up hockey, people skate over and they pointed at you. I shook off like three, three times and I, and before I went back out there and the bruise was so deep, it didn't show up for like three days.

Speaker 2:          00:17:43       Like three days later I was on the road and I'm showering and you know, I, I s I thought I saw like a bunch of grease on the back of my leg. I'm like, what the fuck did I sit on? And then I saw it was a Bruce. It literally looked like somebody just took a bat and hit me right across the back of my left leg. And, um, you know, Evan, this is kind of what I learned. I thought like when the bruise went away, then you were all fine. Uh, but evidently that's not the deal. Um, the reason why it takes that long, I guess for it to come to the surface is because it's so fucking, whatever you hit was so fucking deep into the muscle. It took that long for a, I forget the person explained it to me, a bunch of busted capillaries or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:18:25       And then when they go to heels, sometimes they confuse to something else. I don't know, fuse to a nerve or some shit. I have no idea. I don't remember. I don't pretend to remember, but all I know is um, a bunch of shit like that happened slash you know, flying on planes and sitting on my fucking ass and writers' rooms and that's what's going to happen. But what I love is, you know, all these people who have back problems with telling me that all, dude, you're going to have this for the rest of your life and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I mean, I didn't fly helicopter for like fucking three months during this cause when I sat down, my feet went numb and I can't have my fucking feet going numb when I'm trying to touch the pedals. There. Um, but no, I, if you find, if you find a fucking, a real miss Seuss of fucking incredible one, they could figure out what the fuck's wrong with you. And even beyond a chiropractor, they beat the fuck out of you and they loosen everything up and then everything relaxes and you go back to being normal. At least that's what the fuck happened with me at. Uh, I flew for the first time Wednesday. I was tremendous. That was tremendous. I got, oh Jesus Christ. Look at that. Is that this? Is that a fucking raven?

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       Hey. Hey. Get all the chin. Get out of here.

Speaker 2:          00:19:44       Jesus Christ. How old am I that I had a yell that long in a bird before it left back in the day. I stepped on a stick in the fucking thing took off. What does that mean? Was that a crow or a fucking raven? All right. We got to look this shit up here. Some fucking ancient medieval history shit for you, Raven. Uh, what did you say here? Raven. I'm Super Raven's superstition. All right, little. What do we got here? What do we got here? Ravens? Symbolism. Ravens. Symbolism. Myths of the Raven symbolisms and lore. Learn about the lore of ravens Burt. I know that's what I'm here for. All right. The Raven often has a bad press for being a carrion, a carry and burn. I know what that means. C, A. R. R. I. O. N. It is ultimately associated with death. Tremendous. Finally getting fucking healthy. Now I'm going to die and consequently considered a bad Omand by many or a forewarning of war.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       Jesus. Nia is gonna yell at me. But there is much more to this egg, egg, dramatic and intelligent bird than death, darkness and destruction. Raven is a trickster or protector, a teacher, and a bringer of great magic. I would love to see the person who wrote this, like what they would dress like. I just pictured them in like a fucking Toga with the leaves. You know the hats they'd have leaves on the side. It's like if you had a full head of leaf hair and then you went bald and just fucking wrapped around you. Um, learn all about the raven and it's Laura here. Well, that's what the fuck. I'm here for your comments.

Speaker 4:          00:21:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:25       All right. So Raven is not only the largest member of the crow family. Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker 4:          00:21:30       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       it's the big brother, but the largest perching bird in the world. I thought they all perched the others who lay down an extremely intelligent bird. The Raven was once extremely common, but persecution now finds it only in remotes areas such as cliffs, mountains, and moon and more moons and Moore's. It's amazing the amount of English words. I already know what they are, Morris. I thought those were Africans. I just, I don't fucking, I don't, I evidently was a crow cause I don't have any of those things. There's no clip. There's no mountain. I have a porch. The adult is completely black with a shaggy thre. I don't care. What the fuck does it mean? Ravens are extremely intelligent in some cases, can even learn to talk. All right. That wasn't a fucking raven. I was just yelling at it. Hey, hey. Would've been like, what?

Speaker 4:          00:22:25       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       That would've freaked me out. I'd be like, Oh, you know, I was just wondering. I wonder if you'd leave. There'll be cool. The wolf and the Raven are often mentioned together in mythology, lore, and scripture in nature. The wolf and the raven have an important relationship. Wolves use ravens as an Ariel Ariel spotters for possible sources of food as well as using them to alert them of danger ahead. The Raven also gains from this relationship with the wolf being carrying birds. I'm so sick of reading that fucking word. What does it mean? C A. R. R. I. O. O. N. You know it's funny, the amount of people that are listening to this right now and they feel superior to me cause they know what this word means. Yeah. And what does that getting? Is that going to buy you a sandwich today? Did the king flush of dead animals?

Speaker 4:          00:23:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:12       Okay. So that's what it needs. All right, so it's like a fucking, it's like one of those birds of vulture birds with the fucking red head. No fucking feathers. I know why they don't have feathers on their heads because they're always eaten at dead carcasses. And they don't want the maggots to get in there. So they do whatever fucking bacteria and shit gets on their head, just gets burned off by the sun. Although I can't tell you. I look like a raven after what? Not a raven of. I look like a fucking vulture. If I go to the beach, big fucking redhead, you know, and I eat dead meat too. Right? Ham. That's a dead pig. Jesus Christ. This is an incredible article. All right. The Raven also gains from its relationship at the, okay. Obviously if the wolf fucking kill something, what? Jesus Christ. I don't think I can find two more boring animals on the planet than those two fuckers.

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       I think they deserve each other. They probably both in bed by eight every night. Um, alright, let me, let me do a couple of fucking reads here. You got a lot of advertising. We didn't have any on fucking Thursday, so I gotta make up for 'em. I gotta make up for this shit here. All right. Hey, uh, hey, I'm no, no, no. That's a read actually here. I need the advertising. Where the fuck is he advertising? All right. Hey Bill, he's grips. Strength. Ah, you fucking jerk off. You did the same one twice. Is He really going to be one of these days? All right. Hang on a second people. I apologize. Hang on.

Speaker 4:          00:24:42       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       content reads. There we go. Our all. Here we go. Track or everybody. Smart cars, smart phones, smart homes. Technology has made everything wicked smart. But losing your stuff, make smart people feel really stupid. Kid Tracker makes lose things. A thing of the past tracker is a coin size device that locates misplaced keys, wallets, bag, computers, anything in seconds. Just pair of tracker to your smartphone. Attach it to anything and it finds the precise location with the tap of a button. It's that easy. Lose your phone, press the button on tracker and your phone rings even when it's on silent.

All right, there's three left and I'm going to read those later. Let's get back to the fucking podcast. Here I am sweating. Roche didn't bake in boy. Um, you don't actually checked in. I checked in on the world of baseball. I have not looked at all my fucking Boston red socks, if I can call them that. Or a game out behind the Baltimore Orioles and were in between two dirty birds, Orioles and Blue Jays, right? Yankees are in fourth Tampa Bay's bringing up the fucking rear. Here's what's interesting to me in first place. You got Cleveland. All right, you got Baltimore. They have not won a world series since 1983 you got the Cleveland Indians. They haven't won since like fucking was in 1948 or something.

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       Texas has never won. You got the Washington senators, they're in first place. They used to be the expos. They never want, they should've won in 94 but the fucking strikes fucking cutoff the whole season. The Chicago cubs, they haven't won since 1907 and then the San Francisco giants who've won every other year, this decade. All right, look, you have to fucking Los Angeles Dodgers and only game and half out. I have no fucking clue because they're not on my cable service because they had some fucking [inaudible] fight with somebody. It's just the worst. So this is pretty cool. Man, what a great year for baseball, you know, all right. If I had to, if I could see Baltimore, Cleveland or Texas, I would pick Cleveland. If I could see Washington cubs or San Francisco, you got to go with the cubs, right? No, there foofy fucking fans taking their shirts off at the fucking games.

Speaker 2:          00:32:14       They don't give a shit. Right? So if it was Cleveland versus the cubs, you know, I gotta go with Cleveland. They just wanted an NBA title. Let's see them get the fucking, you know, the monkey off their back with baseball. And I would root for the cubs. But I just don't think that people care enough. Every time I say may out it up all good. It's just too fucking happy there. And I also blame, I really feel like because they do that stupid shit and the seventh inning, that's why the fucking, uh, you know, the Yankees play, why MCA? And that's why the red sox play that fucking horrific sweet. Caroline. The cubs started it. And because you created that, and I have to, anytime I see a red sox game and I have to watch a woman put her head on the shoulder of a boyfriend during the seventh things stretch is everybody sings that horrifically creepy fucking song.

Speaker 2:          00:33:10       You know, I kind of hope the cubs go another a hundred and fucking six years. 100. They're up to 108 years. You know what I mean? Not even the Phillies went that long. The biggest losers and professionals and they always want lost more fucking games than those cons. Um, and they went, almost done. They went from like 1880 to 1980 or like 1882 to 1980. Let me see. Chicago cubs, Chicago cubs, last world. Look at that. Comes right up. 1907 I'm sorry, 1908 would you look at that? So it's been a hundred and fucking eight years.

Speaker 1:          00:33:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:52       They should keep it going at that point. You know what I mean? You just, you just be who you are. Right. Plus the fucking white sox one. One. I don't understand cities that have two fucking teams. I just don't get it. And one of the team wins it and you don't go to the parade. It's like it's, it represents your city.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       well dude, fuck ribs. You mean how many fucking teams do unique New York City? Evidently in order to remain successful for as much shit as New York City talks, they need two football teams, two baseball teams, two Paskett ball teams and two hockey teams. Fucking unbelievable. I Dunno if you come from a real city like Boston, you just need four and a fucking socket team and they'll all went championships. If you know what the fuck you doing, you don't have to hedge your bets. Doubled down in every fucking sport telling you,

Speaker 2:          00:34:50       you know, it's really making, my day is Rappaport. It's just been lately. The guys just teach us, won't fucking leave me alone. He was all, he was another one guy all excited about the Tom Brady fucking, I was like, Michael, I agree with the suspension. Uh, corporations should be allowed to suspend an employee even if it is complete horseshit. He, I just don't, he's a giants fan. They fucking own the patriots in the Superbowl. Why can't he just be happy with that? You know what it is about New York fans is when they look at Boston fans, they don't see the misery anymore. You know, we can talk shit. It's fucking great and they don't know how to handle it. They want us to be miserable again and we're not. And it's driving them nuts in like the misery that Rapoport has that I'm not miserable. That's the kind of people that these New York sports feds are.

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       That's why they got to get all of these fucking teams. They're like a fucking a, they're like Walmart. They're trying to fucking, you know, have so many locations. They put everybody else out of fucking business. It's just, it's not going to happen. It's not going to fucking happen. All right, so why don't, why don't you get three teams in every sport then? Maybe you could run the table in 10 years. You fucking cons. All right. Um, ah, God. Who would ever thought as a Boston sports fan, I could just sit here and laugh at New York sports friends. I never thought that that was going to happen. You know, here I am all fucking happy.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       Ah, fuck. What am I up to? 36 minutes. Okay, here we go. Here we go. All right. Hey, let's do some reads here. Hey Billy, grip strength. I'm one of your listeners wrote in last week, uh, wrote in last week to ask about his hairy girlfriend. I'm not sure what he ended up telling her or if he sent you an update. But unfortunately I've had experience with this on a couple of occasions. Now for those of you who didn't listen the other day, this guy was dating this Brazilian woman, you know, so you know, she's fucking smoking hot, but you know, she just had a little issue. She had a little bit of fern, her fucking arms and uh, with a tramp stamp would go, you know, the tattoo could get lost in the weeds, if you know what I mean. So he wanted to tell her to fucking wax a little bit cause you know, I mean Jesus Christ, you know, doing it doggystyle and she's got like a fucking Afro just above a booty crack. I mean, yeah. I mean what, what, what's going on with that?

Speaker 2:          00:37:21       So, but how do you tell somebody that, I mean, women can tell guys that in a second. Like you should wax your back. I don't know. Yeah, just grosses me out. And you're like, all right, if that's what it takes to have you keep fucking me. Right. You can't tell these ladies anything. You know, honey, I love you to death, but your back reminds me of Gabe Kaplan. Um, I had an experience with this on a couple of occasions. Um, under no circumstance. Um, should you ever tell her she's Harry? I was dating an Indian broad for awhile and she had excessive hair growth on her forearms, lower back, feet and toes. But worst of all, nose hair, let that he said, imagined. Let that image sink in is what you wanted to say. Ah, this chick was super cool and very attractive, but the hair situation was bothering me so I broke up with her at her place, but made the mistake of telling her why. Oh God, dude, why would you do that? Let it be known. This was a bad idea. Well, no, dude, if you just told her, you know, there was a way you don't. Obviously, if you fucking listen, I'm breaking up with you. I think you're a sweetheart, but physically I can't deal with all of your hair. Yeah, that's going to devastate her anyways.

Speaker 4:          00:38:46       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:46       Long story short, she flipped her shit and threw plates, silverware, pots, et Cetera at me while screaming and crying. So I left. When I came back later for my shit, she had thrown bleach on some of my clothes and stapled condoms to the wall. You could say things got hairy, lol. Why do women just get to just destroy men's property all of the fucking time? You don't like if the cops show up and she's throwing all your shit up, they do a swayed.com calm down. I start, just get in the car. Just get away from her sister. She calms down. It's destruction of property. There's like a zillion youtube videos of, of women just destroying their guys' cars. I don't understand it. I really think men should start prosecuting them. Them them for this shit. We always just go like, hey, yeah, dude, she fucking flipped out. Whatever. I can get another flat screen. Just get her away from me. I'm all in all he said, um, if the listener hasn't told this lady about his displeasure of her hair, I highly recommend he doesn't. What do you fucking told her? You should, should've just said, listen, if that's the fucking reason you were going to break up with her, you should not have brought it up.

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       What did you say? Yeah. Listen. How? Yeah, we, uh, we got to talk.

Speaker 4:          00:40:09       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:40:10       this isn't working for me. Wow. Yeah. I'm just not happy. Well, what is it? Did I do something? I said something. I said, well, what's the problem? You're too hairy. You have hairy toes. You have hair above your ass and it's coming out of your nose. And I just, you know, you, you just reminded me of John Matousek and I just, you know, it's turned to me like why would you do that to somebody that what you did sir, was fucking mean. Um, on once one, pardon me, actually.

Speaker 4:          00:40:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:40:46       Respects the fact that you actually communicate you and even was fucking mean is you're going to get what you want in life. If you, if you just don't give a fuck about other people's feelings to that level, you're never going to end up trapped in a fucking relationship. So it's good that you do that, but in the future, surf, you're going to broke at break up with something, some something. Somebody because of something physical. You know it. Keep that to yourself. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:41:11       Cause who's kidding who? Dude, that's not the only reason why you broke up with her. You know, if you gotta fucking tell her she was too fucking hairy, if you still liked her, why don't you just say, listen, can you do me a fucking favor? You got hairy toes. Can we start off with that? Jesus Christ. I'd say I'm dating a fucking cave woman. It's 2016 have you watched any porno in your life? All right. On a side note, he said, you mentioned your home gym and current workouts, but I've never heard you talk about dead lifts. Do you plan on doing them and if you already do, what type of progress are you making? Thanks to go flog yourself. What is a dead lift? Is that the one where you fucking bend over at the waist and pull it up or is that the one where you fucking Yak? Like you're in the Olympics and you lift it up over your head? Um, both of those look like something I shouldn't be doing at my age. All right. Videos deadlift.

Speaker 4:          00:42:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       All right. Five common mistakes. The dead lift. All right, here we go.

Speaker 4:          00:42:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:18       Oh Jesus. What is this for? That's still, that's the one. The old blowout your back one? No. Have you use proper form? Does the lifter have an Instagram? His hips should be the first things that move. There's a lot of vital information missing from this hips. Hip wide stance, hands just outside the hip. Full grip of the bar. Shoulders slightly in front of the bar. Lumbar curve maintained. So add shoe back. Yeah. Dude, I'm going to give a big fuck that to that exercise unless you can tell me what the hell it does to me other than increase my chances of blowing out my back. Um, I just kind of what for legs? I go hiking and I do, I do body weight exercises, you know, the same way I do grip strength stuff. I'm really into just being able to move my fucking body. I don't need to pick up a car. Like I'm grabbing it by its bumper and try to use my fucking proper form. But um, who knows? You know what? I'll, I'll look those up. You know, I'm sure I'm going to get a big fucking lecture on [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          00:43:23       Oh my goodness. You don't do dead lifts. You might as well not be. We're good at it up.

Speaker 2:          00:43:27       All right. A deer, a bald ass. Billy Gunn, uh, regarding your caller. Who needs advice on getting his girlfriend his shave off body here. Okay, here we go. I would like to tell, tell him to be careful what he wishes for. I had a girlfriend with really hairy arms and because of it she had very low self esteem. Once we got to college, her friends took her to a beauty salon and she had her arm hair waxed. Shortly after she re she started to receive a lot of new male attention and pretty soon had little time from me. Shortly after she told me she needed to talk though. Jesus. Yeah, she moved up in the draft. She had a good combine. Um, she told me she didn't want to limit her options in college. Good for her. He goes, I was devastated. I told her that since I found her attracted, when nobody else did that, that should count for something.

Speaker 2:          00:44:24       Um, she replied with, we all make mistakes and walked out. Jesus. Anyways, consider your moves carefully before doing something brash. Thanks for the subpar podcast. It go fuck yourself. P S take it easy on guys writing to you for solutions. They are obviously at rock bottom if they are willing to take advice from a dyslexic freckled, Qantas. Jason is this guy took two shots at me. MMM, MMM MMM wow. Yeah. That's fucking brutal. And that's, once again, that is something where where it went, it was going the other way. Women would be like, that's brutal. But then if they read this same fucking story and as much as they dumped you, she dumped you when you accepted her for who you were,

Speaker 6:          00:45:13       they would all be like, Woo. That's right. You go girl, you go get what the fuck you want

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       life. Um, dude, that's kind of fucking funny. I mean, does that fuck with your self esteem at all? I think it did. I think that's why you gave me shit. Not once, but twice at the end of it. I think you got a little bit of anger, which I would've had angered too. Jesus Christ. Do you know what's funny about that is like she, if she keeps fucking doing it and enough time goes by the next guy who dates or is going to have no idea that that's part of her fucking genetics. And then he's going to have a little hairy baby and be like, where the fuck did this come from? She be like, Oh, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:46:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:46:05       Fucking baby coming out looking like Robin Williams arms. Remember his fucking furry arms rest his soul. Um, oh my God, that's fucking everything. Anything happens to a guy just, it just ends up being funny. I Dunno what it is. Everything that happens to a woman is tragic, but just when shit happens to guys, it's fucking funny. What are you gonna do? You know what you're going to do buddy? You go to the fucking gym, right? You go to the gym and just go, you know, just start hitting at a tip non shit way Outta your fucking league. You know, do it. Do it for yourself, Ben. She's reaching for the fucking stars. So should you take that as an inspiration and a, you know, God help the next fucking guy. She gets with Jesus fucking Christ. And then, you know, some the whole time she walks this earth, she has to live with that secret. You know, cause I'll tell you, there's no fucking way she's telling the next guy that that's what's going on. If that held her back right. And you, you know, when she walks around and hangs out with all these other fucking beautiful women now in her beautiful people circle and they have like fucking no hair on their arms, there's going to be something in the back of her head. You know, at one day she'll have too many white zinfandels and she'll just say to her, fucking boyfriend,

Speaker 6:          00:47:19       you're a good guy. You

Speaker 2:          00:47:21       maybe she won't. Maybe she won't. Then some day they have the hairy baby, the OAH beef, the dreaded hairy baby. I can't come into work today. Oh, it's a matter a, my wife gave birth to a heavy baby. Yeah, dude, it's fucking ridiculous. I thought it was a, I thought it was a little gorilla.

Speaker 3:          00:47:43       Oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47:44       Turns out she had fucking hair all over. She just got waxed. All right, dear red, red Sonia. I don't know what that means. I hope I said Sonjia. S O n. J a. Um, should I look that one up? I mean, if it's an insult, I got to see what it is I want to share on the laugh. Other than the fact I can't pronounce it or know what it is. Red Sonja, what is red? Sonya Red Sonja in 1985 is a vengeful woman sets out to achieve a magic orb with an er. I got to see images of this.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       Jesus Christ. He's fucking smoking hot. Um, I don't know what that means, but anyways, dear red, Sonya, um, her, the email from the guy with the Harry Brazilian girls is another one.

Speaker 1:          00:48:31       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:32       This is another one. There's a lot of hairy ladies. Um, I have a suggestion for the other guys in similar situations.

Speaker 1:          00:48:42       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:43       have bill burr address it for you. Listen to the podcast over the speakers when your girl is home. That way, you'll plant a seed in her brain and hopefully get her to shave with Anne Wax without even addressing it yourself. Oh, so play that fucking part of the podcast when they're around a, you know what? Women are way more complex than that. That's a fucking decent idea. And uh, cause what's going to happen, she'll, if she's self conscious about that, if the light goes off, she's going to be like, that's first. She'll be like, that's stupid, Eh, that guy shouldn't have blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then about a half hour, that bullshit, you'll finally come around to saying like, do you think there's like, I know I'm a little more hairier than most girls. Does it bother you? It's still gonna come back to you. If women were that fucking easy to deal with emotionally, we wouldn't die eight years before them.

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       There's no fucking way it would be that easy. Like they're just going to listen to the podcast and they just going to click and be like, oh wow, maybe I should wax. I'm going to do that and not have a fucking four hour un meeting with my fucking boyfriend. Um, anyways, he said, I've done the same thing in the past with great success. Okay, maybe I'm wrong. Wait a minute. Wait A, here's the replay going over to the replay booth. A I happened to listen to an app episode. He said, I happened in quotes to listen to an episode about lip hair when we were driving. Three days later, mustache was gone. Try it. It just might work. Holy Shit. All right, well fuck it. Give it a shot. I stand corrected. I Apologize Sir. I apologize. Apologize. Jesus Christ. I just pictured the, uh, the referee coming back saying no goal, but he actually came back and said the goal was aloud.

Speaker 2:          00:50:35       You lost sight of the puck and the mustache still left. It's incredible. Alright. All the best from Sweden. Okay. What am I up to here? 50 fucking minutes. Alright. Okay. Career crossroads. Hey Billy, fuck face. I liked that guy. He just, he didn't try to be creative. He just went right for it. I am a 17 year old high school senior, going to into college, studying pre law. And ever since I was young I wanted to go into the military. My father owns a medical compliance company and his promised me a job after college. Should I get a law degree? However, he was re a Jesus Christ. You know what? I just realized I've got to do something. Hang on. I gotta start this. Fuck. I got to hit pause and I got to start this fucking question over again. I gotta unlock the door here.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       Hang on. All right, I'm back. I didn't need to unlock the door. She had her keys. For some reason I didn't think she had her keys. Um, and she needed the lovely Nia is going to come on hopefully in a minute and dress the fucking, the growing controversy of the hairy girlfriend. How do you tell her? All right. So here we go. Hey Billy. Hey Billy. Fuck face. Uh, I am a 17 year old high school senior, going into college, studying prelaw. And ever since I was young I wanted to go into the military. Um, my father owns a medical compliance company, has promised me a job after college. Should I get a law degree? Why would you get a law degree and then working in a medical compliance company or medical? I thought I was thinking like they supplied like appliances, like he was selling like fucking dental drills and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:52:08       However, he has recently talked about selling the company and retiring as he is nearing 70 and not getting any younger. My question is this, after I finished college, should I enlist in the military something that I've wanted as long as I can remember or should I stick with the safer option? Never choose safe taking over my father's business slash securing a safe lifelong career. Now do that. That is a recipe for what if, um, fuck that dude. You're young. You don't have any kids. Just risk, risk, risk, risk, risk. I'm not saying fucking jump off a bridge here. I'm just saying, yeah, go big. You go big when you're young. You know she never go out with me. Fucking ask her out. Who gives a fuck? Right? Oh my God, I can't, I can't try to do that. That's a one in a zillion chance.

Speaker 2:          00:53:00       Just go fucking do it. Listen to how I read out loud how fucking horrific I am, and I've been tremendously successful telling shit jokes now if I can do it, believe me, anybody can do it. And you can too. If that's what you want to do, you should definitely do it. Um, anyways, he said, I'm worried that during my absence in the military, there's a strong possibility my father will say it and sell the business. I'm at a loss because on one hand, I don't want to sit at a desk 10 years from now thinking about what could have been a great experience in the military. But on the other hand, I don't want to lose a job at my, at my fathers and be stuck at a soul sucking law firm for 30 years in a tiny cubicle working to make someone else's dream come true.

Speaker 2:          00:53:46       I'm really at a crossroads here and I don't want to make the wrong choice that could potentially fuck me over big time. Uh, what would you do if you were my shoes? Thank you. And Go fuck yourself. Uh, I would go into the military. I'd finished your law degree. That's what you want to do. I would go into the military, join the branch that you wanted to. I would fucking crush it in the military and then when I come out, I would be such, you know, I would attack being a lawyer at the same, the same attitude. Why do you feel like you're going to be stuck in a tiny, tiny cubicle? Why wouldn't you move up and become partner? You need to dream bigger dreams. Dude. This whole thing of like, you know, the only way you're going to be successful in the business world as if you take a job for your dad.

Speaker 2:          00:54:27       Fuck that dude. If you go the other route, you become a self made man. And when you become a self made man, you get a belief and a confidence in yourself and um, you don't worry. Like you're 17, you're already, you're already worrying. Fuck that. You got your whole life ahead of you. I would go out and do everything that you want to do. And then one day, all 20 years goes by and all of a sudden you're like, Holy Shit, I work for myself. I'm making great money. I can go to the movies whenever I want to. I can take a vacation. You know, I could talk shit on a podcast. Like it just completely opens the world, opens up for you. But you know, if you'd go the safe route, you know, there's that, there's that does that fucking knowing that haunting voice in the back of the head.

Speaker 2:          00:55:16       What if I did this? What if I did that? He starts sleeping at night. All right. All right. All right. Fucking thrashing and Shit. Um, I think you're going to do great in the military and I think you'd do great as a lawyer. And that's what you should be thinking. You know, that's it. And you're gonna meet some fucking beautiful woman and she, you get married or whatever, whatever the fuck is you want to do. Just think positive thoughts and uh, surround yourself with people that feel that way. And if you have a friend that sees you start to do well and you feel them starting to become negative, address it. And if they don't fucking clean up their shit, you cut them out of your life cause those people will bring you down. Stay here at the townie bar with the old football jacket on.

A little bonus, like five minute thing here. This could go south very easily, but we'll see what happens. Hang on, let me hit plus. Right? The lovely knee.

Speaker 9:          01:02:20       Everybody. Hi, how are you? I'm great, thanks. Okay, let's get right down to it. Okay. All right. This guy, he's dating this woman. She thinks she's beautiful, but she's Harry this thing again. Well, yeah, but I never, you never talked to about, we never got a females advice on this. I thought we did. You talked about it. Yeah, I remember I said like either like he sort of gets something wags, then they go together and it's funny or he just like gets over it. You said that on the podcast or did we talk about that on our own? Not on the podcast. And you got all mad at me cause I was like, if she's not, what do you have against talking into the mic? I don't know. You just sit there and go like I know people tweeted me the last time was like I can't hear you.

Speaker 9:          01:03:08       So I, you've told me just to the Mike, just have it follow your, your, your mouth. Okay. But because the thing is I feel like if a microphone is anywhere near me, it's going to microphone my voice. So amplify. Wow. It's very rare that someone makes me look like the smart one. Microphone. My voice. So, um, well what you have to know is with microphones, each one of them they have, there's ones that are designed to pick up three 60. There's ones that are like, these ones are like directly on. Okay. So that fits directly on that. The reason for that is if there's other background noise that you don't want to pick that up. There's other microphones designed where you want to hear the whole room. These are directly on, so you've got to speak into it, but this is not what we're talking about.

Speaker 9:          01:03:58       Okay. Sorry. All right, so somebody, somebody got this and she's got like a like hair on her lower back. Yeah. Like right with a tramp stamp would be like, she could have a tramp stamp and he wouldn't know cause it's, there's a, the whole thicket of hair under that. Yeah. I thought we talked about this. I thought you stopped saying that. Okay. I understand that you think that we talked about it. Neither one of us can remember if we did it on the podcast and this is just bonus time anyways, so refresh our listeners. Well, my dating a woman, she's got a fucking Afro right above her butt crack. What do you say something wrong with an Afro? Um, a on your head. A booboo. I think you have some answer though. God Damn, this is just, this is just a tough one. How long has he been dating this person?

Speaker 9:          01:04:47       It can he be like, so what's with your little furry back over here? You're like my little Chia pet in a cute way. Like, can he say it in a cute way? How do you say that in a cute way. I Dunno. Like say, Oh, you're my little Chia pet back here. No. Um, you know what? Maybe he could just sort of like, this is gonna sound really fucking weird, but maybe the sort of like stroke it or whatever the thing is. She'll probably be like, oh God no, don't touch that. I know there's like hair back there. It's so like weird. I hate it. And he can go, why don't you get it wax? And she might be like, I don't know. Like I'm embarrassed. I'll go with you. I'll walk something with you. How about that? I'll wax something. You ask something and then boom, I have an idea to what, how about when you know she's wearing like a sexy shirt so it doesn't quite reach down to her pants when she goes to get up off the probably doesn't wear shirts like that. When she goes to get up off the couch. You just reach up and grab her a little backhand. Go back down here.

Speaker 9:          01:05:51       What did you sign on her stomach? At the beach and he starts braiding it for her. I know it's bad, it's bad. It's cause your questionable situation. Well this one guy was saying he was dating this woman, she had like even hairy feet. She had like hairy toes. Shit happens man. I know, but what the fuck N***a you gotta handle that? I mean ideally yes you would handle that in a perfect world, in a perfect world. But you know, I had girlfriends for years who had a little like just like the little shade of a mustache and they just never, it just never really occurred to them to wax it until like recently. And I remember I had a friend, I saw her I hadn't seen in awhile and she was like, do you notice anything different? And she kept turning her face in a certain way and I was like, yeah, you get your upper lip wax.

Speaker 9:          01:06:34       I was like, yes. Yeah. She was like, I finally did it. She was like, I don't know. I was always just intimidated to go into the place. And she's like, but I'm so glad I did. So I have to, is that what it is? Yeah. People are self conscious and you think you'll go in there and you'll get judgement by the waxing person, but the waxing person has waxed, you know Chewbacca down there so they don't care. That's their job. So it could be that she's just like a little embarrassed to go to a place and have it taken off because who wants to say, oh, I have to go get my back wax today before you don't have to say that you just walked down and you go, Hey, can you wax my back? You don't even have to whisper it. I know you don't.

Speaker 9:          01:07:13       So, oh no. But if you go there to other people, see you getting your back wax? No, no, no, no. You're in a private room. Oh, whenever you get any kind of waxing service, it's not like Steve Ferrell Clarkson. Exactly. Yeah. So you are going to private things. So he just has to do it in a cute, you know what, this one asshole did what? He goes, I suggest you don't tell the woman that she's hairy. He told the woman, he broke up with her and said the reason why he was doing it was because she was so hairy is that's not the way this do. Isn't that the meanest thing you've ever fucking mean his thing ever. Are you that shallow? Because that's something that's easily fixable. Are you that fucking shallow that you break up with someone? It's like cause your hair your back. Like what a fucking ass hole back feet knows a lot of coming out of the nose and then the arms.

Speaker 9:          01:08:01       That's just, that's unnecessary. It to to say that after the fact if you love somebody, even if you don't, even if you don't love somebody, you don't do that to somebody. Yeah. No that's not, that's not okay. But then show, since she fucking, he came, she started throwing plates and he fucking left and they came back. She had dumped bleach on his clothes and stapled some condoms to the fucking wall. The usual destruction of property that for some reason do use validated. Do you have? I have never actually noticed you have back here yet but I mean back here yet like cause I go that something has and all the, I've actually never not turned around. Now I don't have back here. Let me say, well Jesus Christ near your fucking sleep next to me every goddamn day. I just never thought to look for that.

Speaker 9:          01:08:46       Now I don't have back here. There is a very fine little area in the lower back tramp stamp area. Not a lot. You can barely see it cause your hair so fair. But like no, no, no. You have a very small like yeah that got nothing back there. There's nothing back there. I mean there's more on your chest than on the your lower back. Very small amount. But the thing is, I feel like in 10 years that shit could get a little thin. In 10 years I'm going to be close to 60 I mean I'd still have you accident. What? In 10 years? What? Where my white fucking back here against my white back. Cause it bothers you when I wear a fucking half shirts. I mean, what, what are we doing at that point? That's a fair way to look at my lower back.

Speaker 9:          01:09:36       Let's just do, let's just, no, you don't. No, you don't know. Okay. You don't, well I'm, I'm, yeah, I try to keep very familiar with your lower back. You don't, Oh yeah, you don't, you're not a hairy person so, but if I was hairy back there, would you say something to me? Nudge when I broke up with you? What's so you would have broken up over cause I want to take in the time to fall in love with you. If you walking around looking like fucking Burt Reynolds and playgirl. Okay. Oh, I see a Photoshop coming. Oh my God. That man. No, that man, wait, shout out to the MM Photoshop on sweater. Oh my God, Dude. That one with me standing in front of the fountain. I fucking, dude, we were in the writer's room when I saw that and I fucking laughed so hard. Yeah. Like one of the other riders was going like, what?

Speaker 9:          01:10:33       What? And I showed it to him and everyone was going like, oh my God, that's so mean. I go, that's fucking hilarious. And then I love the picture of you that they found it was, yeah, it was like when you were going out to some event. So you look at the heat premiere. Yeah, that's what that picture was. I was trying to be like, fucking, you know, modest about it. I didn't want to sit there and say, you were in a movie premier. I said you had some big event. You always gotta just be standing there. You always have to fucking drop the Hollywood shit. Don't Juliet on taxi premiere for the cinematic film. The heat where my husband had two lines. You had more than two lines. Oh, if you sneezed in that movie, you missed me.

Actually I'm a better one for that, ma'am. Photoshop. All right, so wait, where's my phone? Because I wrote it down. Remember you said the name of a movie and it was once again, how you have just sort of clues from the movie and I don't remember the titles. All right, so I'm going to find it because it was definitely one of your classic ones. And we're not going to say what the movie is. We're just going to have the m Photoshop.

Speaker 3:          01:11:47       Okay,

Speaker 9:          01:11:47       wait, let me see if I can find it. Mark it up, put it on Twitter and then everyone will be able to guess, hopefully. All right, so you called this movie. I'm going to kill you on Wall Street. They're fuck, oh, I'm going to kill you on Wall Street. They're Fucko. So that's, that's it. That was a movie. That's a movie. So people are gonna try to guess what it is. Mm, Photoshop is going to it. It's funny. Days later, movie poster. Days later. You reading that? It now sounds like somebody else says it, said it, and it's a terrible clue. That's not even close. It's sort of close. They'll figure it out. All right, well,

Speaker 3:          01:12:27       okay,
