00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.440
Few things in childhood are more traumatising
than waking up one morning to find your beloved

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.260
pet fish, Michael Scofield, floating upside
down in his tank (true story); his tiny fishy

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.049
light cruelly extinguished before his time.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.830
But why do they float upside down when they
decide it’s time to take a ride on the porcelain

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.830
express?

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.410
The answer to this question has a lot to do
with how they maintain proper buoyancy when

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.420
they’re alive.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.230
As you may or may not know, most fish are
in possession of an organ commonly known as

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.700
a “swim bladder”.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.329
This organ can be filled or emptied of air
by a fish at will via its gills, allowing

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.129
them to either float higher, sink lower or
stay suspended at about the same depth, not

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.339
unlike a Buoyancy Compensator (BC) used by
scuba-divers.

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.719
Although swim bladders are critical to a fish’s
ability to float, sink or hover without expending

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.269
much energy, they have the unfortunate side
effect of making them rather unstable.

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.480
To explain, research has shown that the relative
position of a fish’s “centre of buoyancy”

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.630
is, amongst fish with swim bladders, almost
universal located below their centre of mass

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.300
near their stomach, making them quite prone
to hydrostatic rolling which is just a fancy

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.480
way of saying it makes them more likely to
go belly up.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.240
This is why fish can often be seen flapping
their fins, even when they’re not moving

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.430
and in perfectly still water.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.870
This is also why when fish become ill or injured,
they will sometimes begin swimming on their

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.740
side or even upside down; they simply lose
the ability to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.730
and the more buoyant part of their body will
try to float to the surface.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.170
When fish ultimately die, of course, they
lose all ability to stop themselves rolling

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.730
over and the buoyancy of the swim bladder
takes over.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.430
It should also be noted that fish don’t
necessarily always float when they die.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.000
For example, if a fish dies with little to
no air in its swim bladder, the act of dying

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.550
doesn’t magically make this bladder expand
to increase buoyancy.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.670
In these cases, the fish will often sink,
at which point decomposition will begin.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.890
That said, the decomposition process can sometimes
result in enough gas being produced and trapped

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.840
inside the fish to cause it to float to the
surface.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.510
So in short, fish float upside when they die
because many of them are top heavy and posses

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.370
and organ in their lower region that is filled
with air.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.640
While it’s entirely within the realm of
possibility for a goldfish to live for 3 decades,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.651
this is, rather sadly, almost never the case.

00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:27.560
Although, given that goldfish are extremely
intelligent fish, contrary to popular belief,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.010
and people often just put them in a little
glass bowl with no real way for them to entertain

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.290
themselves or be mentally stimulated, perhaps
not living for three decades in such an environment

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.620
is preferable.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.610
Swim bladders are by no means a universal
trait all fish share.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.950
For instance, neither sharks nor rays possess
the organ, the latter due to their mostly

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.340
bottom dwelling nature.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.040
Sharks do have a large liver that is filled
with a lighter-than-water oil, making them

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.860
naturally somewhat more buoyant than they’d
otherwise be.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.810
Not having a swim bladder is also an advantage
for sharks in that swim bladders can rupture

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.099
if the fish ascends too quickly, which is
probably another reason sharks, which rely

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:28.310
on moving quickly to hunt and survive, didn’t
evolve to have

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.690
them or evolved away the trait.
