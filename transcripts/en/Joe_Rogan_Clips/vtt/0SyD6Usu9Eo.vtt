00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.950
The Joe Rogan experience,
you know,
you know those storage wars shows,

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.830
I guess some of them may fake.
Yeah,
they do.
They set them up.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.360
They load up the storage and they ought to believe we found a world war two

4
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:16.710
helmet.
It's Elvis.
His underwear was unbelievable.
Yeah,
they used to be real.

5
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:19.850
Actually a few of them were very real and then they got caught online.

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.920
A bunch of people online,
we're calling them out being like,
this is bullshit.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.270
This is fake.
I saw them setting it up like they got,
they got caught,
but that's,

8
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:31.630
they're going to do that.
They should find magic in there and say he's fine.

9
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.390
He's definitely shit storage wars where they,

10
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:37.670
they go in there and they find a Leprechaun.

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.100
[inaudible] makes one huge disappear.
Yeah.

12
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:44.670
One person disappears and they have a genie in a lamp and it's gotta be worth

13
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.270
treating me like I'm really stupid.
Have you ever watched the show ghost hunters?

14
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.440
Do you know who are ghost adventures?
Do you know this guy dude,
Zach bag.

15
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:55.620
Is Zak Bagans?
Do you know this guy?
I do not know him personally.

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.930
He makes me laugh so fucking hard because they've done like nine seasons now.

17
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.480
I don't even know how many of the things I found any ghost.
Come on,
man.

18
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.340
They have all this great technology now that's approved that he believes in

19
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:12.630
ghosts.
Here's the best part.
Okay.
He is all in,
right.

20
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.150
Which I love anybody that's all in whatever they're doing to have to be.

21
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.190
The host does all his adventure,

22
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.220
but also now he's super self aware of their popularity and of his character

23
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.560
caricature of himself.
So he does it now on purpose.

24
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.870
He took off his shirt when episode and he goes,

25
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.470
you want to fucking fight me ghost?
Let's fucking go dude.
Toe Up,

26
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.480
throw a fucking punch.
You're like,

27
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.120
he's aware of his character that is this broey ghost fist fighter.

28
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.160
This dude is Brenton shop.
Shabu shop sign episode.
Looking at him.

29
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.310
He looks like he just got along time.
Shane car would sparring sessions.
Yeah,

30
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:54.210
he's still in the fight and he's still out of it.
And is it Zach with the beard?

31
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:57.570
No.
No,
Zack is that dude right there.
Right.
So Zack,
where's,
um,

32
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.820
ed hardy type of shirts,
right?
He wears these loud,
ridiculous,

33
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.620
he battered shirts,
but he's,

34
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.790
you got to see it doing more newer episodes to do something from like 2009 to
18.

35
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.600
You'll see what he looks like now.
He's gotten way more fucking jacked.
His hair,

36
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.320
his hair is all flaked up.
You know,
he's gotten like more tan around and shit.

37
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.360
He's become,
do you think this becomes super self aware?

38
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.070
Did he believes in ghosts?
No,

39
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:25.860
I think he's just self aware of the product he's created really,

40
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.230
that he understands now that's a challenge.

41
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.730
I see the next whiskey ginger podcast,
you,
me and Zack,
Zack,
Zack.

42
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.410
That's him right there.
Right?
Like now he's like Holly,

43
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.250
he looks like a Hollywood guy.
Like he's got these big black frame glasses.
Funny.

44
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.740
Like you can't,
he can't look any better.
You know,

45
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.190
you're not allowing him to have better style when Hollywood,
you're so,

46
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:49.140
Chicago's fucking good as fucking Hollywood.
This spiky hair.

47
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.090
He went in Hollywood the fall.
I'll tell you.

48
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:53.440
That's the one thing I know I won't do is uh,

49
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.530
I'll never get to a place when I'll be wearing clothes where I used to make fun

50
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:00.520
of them like that.
Like I remember going,

51
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.690
sky's wearing a fucking $900 tee shirt.

52
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.580
I know now I can't do that.
Like I,
I can't,
I can't get,

53
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.280
I can't do that now cause I used to shit on it so much.
Yeah.

54
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:15.460
You have to mind by the rules of your own [inaudible].

55
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.330
If I pushed it out there for so long,
let's say he's got a nice hats him.
Yeah,

56
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:19.951
it looks good.
Right?

57
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:23.500
Has had Jamie's that your buddy and say the most recent photo I could find
Jamie.

58
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.990
That's,
do I zoom in real quick?
I thought you were trying to say something.

59
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.660
Is he handsome fellow?
Cute Guy.
Jamie,

60
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:31.270
I want you to grow your facial hair just like that.
You really think,

61
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.550
do you really think he doesn't believe in ghosts?

62
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.530
I think he does not believe in ghosts.
I think he,

63
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:39.320
I think he loves the paranormal,
right?
He loves the idea of the paranormal.

64
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.590
I think he loves the idea of forces at nature happening molecules,

65
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:48.130
energies around us,
all influencing the way we act.
Sure.

66
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.930
I don't think he believes in actual apparitions or what do they call them?
S uh,

67
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.260
uh,
spirits on his EVP.
We felt the spirit,

68
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.050
they'll do this thing where they'll see a little orb or a light.

69
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.010
This happens all the time with cameras when you switch to night vision and not

70
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.030
these little flecks of dusk kind of reflect light off the lenses.
And he'll go,

71
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.600
it's an orb.
And they'll,
you know,
watch it float through the lens and he's,

72
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.280
he is obsessed about these orbs.

73
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:16.300
They enter the orb and he does this voiceover shit.
You got lots of fucking jail.

74
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.740
I get hired.
I watch it.
It's maybe one of my favorite things.
What's Jamie?

75
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.090
You're a photographer.
What's the,
um,

76
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.290
scientific explanation for those little balls that show up in photographs?

77
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:28.870
What is it?
I don't have the knowledge for that,

78
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:31.750
but it can be explained lots of different ways.
It's mostly,

79
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:36.751
it probably like a light flare of some kind to sprouts cause there's just like

80
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.600
close.
But believer you stammered through that.
So bad.
Just continued.

81
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.040
I'm terrible fucking jobs sound like tography science.

82
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.980
But like in this lens here there's like five different pieces of glass.

83
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.500
So there's just at whatever angle you're holding it,

84
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:54.490
depending on where the light source is coming from,
it might create an artifact,

85
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:55.490
which would be a little circle.

86
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.340
So if you're dealing with a really nice camera like that one,

87
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.900
but what about like with one of them bullshit w w one of those zip in a shoot

88
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:09.730
ones.
Then they're using
it,
but that that's like less.

89
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.690
Uh,
there's why there would be some on that is probably because it's less,

90
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.810
it's less good.
It's,
it's has less,
not the right word,

91
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:21.400
but a less technology in there.
I don't know.
I can't explain it honestly.

92
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.720
Trines we should Google it because orb lovers right now are freaking out.

93
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.520
Oh my God.
There are angels

94
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.460
gift.
Anytime it or passes near a human,

95
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.930
he'll go watch chose reaction as the orb goes behind his head.
Yeah.

96
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:41.730
And your change your eyes,
the eyes will change.
It was amazing.

97
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.960
Don't believe in fucking ghosts.
I believe in every,

98
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:47.150
you don't believe in guns all in with everything.
Fuck that foot back.

99
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.090
Scatter to fuck up.
What's that?
Here you go.
Back scatter back scatter.

100
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.070
The artifact can result from the backscatter or retro reflection of light from

101
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.850
airborne solid particles such as dust or part of that I solid or liquid
droplets,

102
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.960
especially rain or mist can also be caused by foreign material within the

103
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:06.794
camera's Lens.

104
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.630
So these dots are blurred images of dust particles am night Shama Lama Ding Dong

105
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:16.631
should make a movie in that movie and it should be called back scanner.

106
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.580
Call him that anymore.
That's really rude.
Is it though?

107
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.210
It's kind of funny and it's Shama Milan.
That's his fucking name.

108
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.190
Mama [inaudible] you turn on and you started it.
You fucking put it on me.

109
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.090
What are you racist?
What's wrong with you man?
He makes them good goddamn movies.

110
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:35.810
The guy,
he takes some crazy risks.
But uh,
I love the sixth sense.

111
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.740
That was a great fuck.
Come on.
Every,
I love the village.
People didn't like that.

112
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:41.810
I didn't see a,
I thought the village,
the end of it,
I was like,
well,

113
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:44.750
what about planes?
Like they,
they,
they don't,

114
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.800
they don't show any planes going over how big it would have to be to avoid all

115
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:52.380
the planes.
Well,
they have to be a shepherd point.
Fuck them.
Nobody.

116
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.760
Places where no planes promote because they made it out to the road and then

117
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:59.870
instantly the guy to the road and people are like,
hey car.
Like what car?
Woo.

118
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.080
18 hundreds that like Saint Louis is like right there.

119
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.770
You know what I liked though?
Ghost.
No Devil.
The one was in the elevator.

120
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.280
That was a good one.
Yeah,
that was good.
Those good?
That's good.
Well,

121
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:12.440
he takes chances.
He takes a shower like.
