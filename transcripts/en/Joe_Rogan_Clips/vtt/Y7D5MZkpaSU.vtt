WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.440
The Joe Rogan experience.
I do this thing actually though,
which I think is nice.

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:05.820
I'm going to say this,
this is not,

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.900
because I'm obviously I'm doing a tour at the moment here in the us,

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:13.500
but I'm going to come out of this us too on the 75th anniversary of d day and I

5
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:16.980
fly to call and normally you're doing a standup tour.
Yeah,

6
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.460
big [inaudible] up to her,
the whole of America.
Are you doing any dates in La at?

7
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:24.990
Yeah,
I'm at the Dolby theater full on the 26th to 29th of June.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.330
Okay.
The Adobe,
that was the Codec with you want to come out it also?
Yeah,

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.620
if I'm 26 I'll look at it later.
Don't worry.
Yeah,

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.380
it's all on Eddie's dot com and but I go to,
I go to Normandy,

11
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:40.140
the 70th anniversary of d day and I do,

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.560
and they fought the battle of Normandy in German of the on one side and then

13
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.910
French and English on the other side.

14
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.590
And so I do three shows and Jerome Fisher at 50 minutes in German and then I do

15
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.060
50 minutes in English.

16
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:55.110
And then 15 minutes in French and then we have a buffet and everyone hangs out

17
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.150
and meet everyone and we all the German speakers,
the French and English,

18
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:03.750
because I heard that you're doing that is incredible that you're doing stand up

19
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.840
in multiple languages.
Yeah.
That's how long did it take you to learn that?
Well,

20
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.750
I did school.
I did French at School for eight years.

21
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.570
I did Germans who for two years.
So,
um,
it is,

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.720
but it was partly a sort of low level political thing.

23
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:19.200
I just thought if I'm an English guy going to France and doing it in French,

24
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:22.320
then maybe a French cake go,
well fuck man,
I'm going to do it in English.
Right.

25
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.380
And now the germs digging each.
The Russians are doing English,
the Spanish,

26
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.090
everyone's going to English because you can do a,

27
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.110
you have a Hollywood would career potentially or be on television and English.

28
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.620
Um,
you can also tour the world in English.
Now you can use it as a,

29
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.710
as a bridging language.
We were talking about Google translate.

30
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.380
I know French kids,
French kid,
my friend.
Yes.

31
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:44.670
Seen Belews has performed in Helsinki,
in Finland and finish.

32
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.380
Kids have been watching in the second language,

33
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:49.200
they'd been watching in English and listening in English and he's been

34
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:51.240
performing a French guide,
performing an English show.

35
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:55.590
They met and laughed in a second language,
which I think is an amazing thing.

36
00:01:55.591 --> 00:02:00.060
But now you could tour the world that way.
So this is day.
But anyway,

37
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.020
so I'm going to get a dome and the,
and the,
it's a commemoration of uh,

38
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.490
that the battle happened at 75 years ago and it's a celebration that now we

39
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:10.710
don't go to war in those three languages anymore.

40
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.610
And you have different 50 minutes force French,
different 50,

41
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.840
exactly the same uh,
ideas.
Uh,

42
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.540
but the words are all obviously either German or French.

43
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.860
I'll give you an example.
I had,
um,
I said,
Caesar,

44
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.650
I've told about Julius Caesar.
I said it,

45
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:32.020
did he ever think that one day he would end up as a salad?
Okay.

46
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.510
Cause he always wore like guys,

47
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.050
he's now site and a French says that escalate Jamey imagination.
Did He,

48
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:39.660
one day imagine [inaudible] on salad.

49
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.970
One day he would finish up as a salad and German says that Hatay Yeager,
Dax,

50
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.010
did he ever think [inaudible] Mallett he one time as [inaudible] ended Verda as

51
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:52.290
salon salad and that would have,
so you've got the verb right at the end,

52
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.510
but they still laugh at the same place,

53
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:59.511
but maybe about half second later split second later as salad salad end up have.

54
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.620
So you have to really have a deep understanding of how to structure the

55
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.820
sentences.
It's just practice really,
you know,
anything in life.
Um,

56
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.460
you could do,
if you were taking that of here you speak,

57
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:10.780
he didn't speak any animals or anything.

58
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.010
So if they took you and suddenly for some reason you were had to be in any other

59
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.010
cup.
Thailand,
say say somebody dropped a big block of heroin into,

60
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.010
I think just as a test,

61
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.520
as a social experiment and they filled this all and use Hays is smuggling.

62
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.960
So you have to go to a Thai prison.
Uh,
this is kind of extreme example.
Anyone.

63
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.360
And then you'd,
you'd be learning within one month,

64
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.590
you'd have basic sentences going,

65
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.980
anyone who goes to prison to kind of have sure whether,
you know,

66
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.710
if you work in a restaurant you want anyway you worked with,

67
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.570
no one's given you any English coming in.

68
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.960
You just have to pick up the words and our survival instincts would pick them up

69
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.970
and then you might have a strong accent,
but you'd be,
we,
you,
me,
everyone,

70
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:51.070
we can do that.
So I just again,
use the auto,

71
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.100
I can set up this artificial scenario of I have to do this.

72
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.410
So I had to learn French.
So I started before I did this show,

73
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.430
there's Vonda bacio which the German title,
um,
meaning wonderful.

74
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.900
And I started it in French.
So I jumped because I improvised to,
to work.

75
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.030
I don't write anything.
I just go on and go,
hey,

76
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.150
check is what's going on with chickens,
chickens,
chicken with a gun.
Dangerous.

77
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:14.380
You don't write your act?
No,

78
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:19.000
I just improvised it and I sort of workshop it endlessly until it gets it.
Oh,

79
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:20.810
that's good.
And then you memorize it.
Uh,

80
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.020
well I know it because I said it last time kind of thing.

81
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.260
So in French I was just going [inaudible] and pull it Donald Trump's LMM shows

82
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.080
and compare things you record and listen to that record every show and never

83
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:35.680
listened to them.
Ah,
you record on your phone or do you have no snow?

84
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.260
So we have a professional setup,

85
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.210
so we're sometimes not with the laughter mixed in.

86
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.530
I've just been listening back to the German shows in Berlin and the laughter is

87
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.760
fairly low in the mix.
So I'm saying this Jackson Guy,
if anyone laughing at,
oh,

88
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:50.290
so it's just from the microphone.
Yeah,

89
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:53.080
there's a feed there but they had another one but they had it mixed low.

90
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:55.450
But yeah,
you just need to have a second microphone on the audience.

91
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:59.860
I just bring that mix up or maybe bring it right out.
So it's incredibly funny.

92
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.730
But I just found doing it in another language,
it's a positive thing.

93
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:07.060
It sends out a nice message.
It's hands across the water.
Can we learn from,

94
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:09.190
you can use them from us and the comedies.

95
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.390
I do sort of Pythonesque multipath and type surreal comedy.

96
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.170
And so I just need to find that audience in France that already is in Germany,

97
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:19.840
that audience in Thailand as that,
you know,

98
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.190
I've played Kathmandu and met a kids from Katmandu in New York on the streets.

99
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.310
He said that you can meet him.
I said,
yeah.
What are you,
where are you from?

100
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.350
I'm from Katmandu.
Wow.
Katmandu a kid on Katmandu.
Well you didn't hear as well.

101
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:36.040
I'm doing,
I'm a student.
But your English is good.
Yeah,
it's pretty good.
Yeah.

102
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.510
Well,
can I do a Gig in Katmandu anything?
I think you do again,
Kevin.
I do.
Yeah.

103
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.390
So I said okay.
That was in 2010 took me seven years.

104
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:48.390
I got the 2017 how was it?
It was good.
Unfortunately the local Lester,

105
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.240
the locals,
they'd had these couple of earthquakes,
which you know,

106
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:53.290
you tend to think,
oh,
everyone has earthquakes,

107
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.130
but know that they hadn't had them for ages and something that had to be bad.

108
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.170
So they were getting over that.
So I was mainly aid workers,

109
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.850
unfortunately as I can go back.
But no,

110
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:08.120
it was a nice set up.
But I played,
you know,
I went all through,
uh,

111
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.560
in Tokyo and I played in,
uh,

112
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.000
Hong Kong and in Shanghai and had all the guys from,
uh,

113
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.853
cause you have the,

114
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.010
the people from the communist party come along to check you out.

115
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.940
So I'm not going specifically in on certain things.
But anyway,
you know,

116
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.740
my stuff is all delivered from the comedy.
What?
The Communist Party,
you know,

117
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:30.710
the Communist Party.
Yeah.
You know,
cause it's Shanghai,

118
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.200
China Hamadie party.
No comments,
but just me mangling my words.

119
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.450
Oh,
so they come and check you out and make sure you're not violating anything.

120
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.700
Yes.
You sit in there is,
you're not supposed to go.
Yeah,
whatever.
I don't know.

121
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:47.080
I just,
I want to do the cake.
So,
but,
but it wasn't like I was going to change it.

122
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.960
I have weird stuff about Gandalf talking to two butterflies and,

123
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.070
and talking about my ancient kings like Henry the eighth and,

124
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.680
and William the conqueror and stuff.
So they probably,

125
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.460
apparently they stayed who stay.
They'd normally disappear after a while,

126
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.840
but anyway,
so it's,
uh,
it's good to get out.
You know,
you said,
as you said,

127
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.410
play the world sees a,
to see a travel broadens the mind.
Yeah.

128
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:14.030
I don't play very many play.
I played in Australia and England.

129
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:18.830
I've done gigs and Stockholm and Northern Ireland and Dublin,

130
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.520
a few other places in Europe,
but most of the time when I go on vacation,

131
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:26.060
I just go on vacation and just go to experience it.
Just to have fun.
