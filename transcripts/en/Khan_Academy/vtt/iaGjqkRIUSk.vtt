00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.180
- [Instructor] We are used
to thinking about markets

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.630
for goods and services,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.120
and demand and supply
of goods and services,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.920
and what we're gonna do in
this video is broaden our sense

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.250
of what a market could be for

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.910
by thinking about the
market for loanable funds.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.810
Now, this might seem like
a very technical term,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.520
loanable funds, but it
literally just means funds

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.180
that people are supplying to
be lent out to other people

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.190
and funds that people are demanding

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.660
that they want to borrow.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.210
And so, one way to
think about this market,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.060
the suppliers in the
loanable funds market,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.750
these are the savers.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.390
So, when you go and save
some money, maybe at a bank,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.380
that bank will then lend
that money to someone else

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.630
and because the bank is getting
interest from that person,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.710
they can also afford to
pay you some interest,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.200
so you get a return.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.040
It doesn't always have
to be through a bank,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.330
but that tends to be typical.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.910
It will go through some
type of intermediary.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.420
Similarly, who are the demanders

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.150
or where's the demand coming from?

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.330
I don't know if demanders is a real word,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.770
but I'll just write it down.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.860
So, where is the demand coming from?

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.920
Well, that is coming from the borrowers

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.990
who are interested in,
maybe, making an investment,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.760
maybe some type of business opportunity

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.930
is available to them.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.050
And as I mentioned, this isn't a market

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.080
where the suppliers and the demanders,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.450
or the savers and the borrowers,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.580
necessarily directly
interact with each other.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.090
Every now and then you might get a loan

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.970
from your sister-in-law
or from your parents,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.760
but oftentimes, usually,
it's going through some type

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.490
of institution, some type
of financial institution,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.270
usually banks, where the savers
put their money in a bank

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.040
hoping, not just for save keeping,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.330
but really to get a return on their money.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.830
In order to provide a
return to those savers,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.550
the bank will then lend
it out to borrowers

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.400
and charge interest to them.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.440
And to appreciate this in the way

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.420
that we've looked at markets before,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.630
I can set up two axes

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.020
and in any market that
we've looked at before,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.090
the horizontal axis, this is the quantity,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.400
and so here, we're
talking about the quantity

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.100
of loanable funds,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.840
loanable

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.340
funds.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.830
And then on the vertical axis,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.160
we normally think about the price

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.520
for the good or service,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.450
but when we're dealing
with loanable funds,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.950
the price is the interest rate.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.730
And if we want to know the real price,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.550
we should be talking about
the real interest rate.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.210
Real

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.080
interest

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.490
rate.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.010
And so, let's think about
each of these scenarios.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.430
Let's think about the savers

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.760
who are really the suppliers
in the loanable funds market.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.970
When real interest rates are lower,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.040
if real interest rates are low,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.860
they don't wanna really
supply a lot of quantity.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.600
They're not getting,
not a lot of motivation

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.750
to be a supplier, to
save in that situation.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.800
But if real interest rates are high,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.640
well, then they might say,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.660
I'm more likely to save and I
wanna make my funds available

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.000
for loaning out to other people

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.900
'cause I get this great interest rate,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.860
especially when it's a real interest rate.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.660
So, we could view it
as something like this.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.660
This we could call our
supply of loanable funds

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.320
and you could imagine
what the demand curve

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.060
for loanable funds looks like.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.040
When real interest rates are high,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.260
people say, hey, you know,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.840
there aren't that many
business opportunities

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.000
that could justify borrowing
at that high of a rate,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.980
so there wouldn't be much
quantity that is demanded.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.130
But as the real interest rates,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.310
or if the real interest rates
are lower, as they get lower,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.160
then the quantity demanded of
loanable funds will be higher.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.300
So, this is our demand for loanable funds

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.220
and like we've seen in the past,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.970
you're going to have an
equilibrium quantity and price,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.260
where price, in this situation,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.030
is your real interest rate

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.110
and so that's going to
happen where these intersect.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.460
This is our equilibrium quantity

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.230
and this is our equilibrium
real interest rate.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.820
Now, let's think about
what would happen if one

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.270
or both of these curves
were to shift somehow.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.700
And there's a couple of ways,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.750
let's start with the
demand for loanable funds.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.030
There's a couple of ways that the demand

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.410
for loanable funds curve could shift.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.330
Maybe all of a sudden people
see new business opportunities.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.190
Astroid mining is becoming a thing

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.340
and so people wanna
borrow money to get robots

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.620
and send them out into space

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.340
so they can mine asteroids
for platinum or something.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.230
Well, what would happen?

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.290
Pause this video and think about that.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.700
Well, then at any given
real interest rate,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.440
there's gonna be a
higher quantity demanded.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.010
So, in that situation, our demand

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.980
for loanable funds would
shift to the right.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.150
It would look something like this.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.710
So, this is demand for loanable funds,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.910
I'll call it sub two.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.840
Sometimes you'll see
something like a prime there,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.820
but I'll call it sub two.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.120
So, it has shifted to the right

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.350
because of new business opportunities.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.360
Another common reason why that might shift

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.960
to the right is if maybe the government

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.310
is doing a lot more borrowing.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.120
Remember, this is an
aggregate market here.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.320
So, the government, when it borrows money

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.780
to fuel its spending, that also,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.760
it has to go into the
loanable funds market

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.320
and so, increased government borrowing

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.250
would also shift this to the right.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.500
And if the opposite happened,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.750
if people thought there were
fewer business opportunities

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.580
or if the government
started to borrow less,

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.150
well, that would shift things to the left.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.000
But let's just think
about what would happen.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.870
If R is the current
equilibrium interest rate,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.940
if that just stayed where it is,

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.380
well, then you're going to have a shortage

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.880
of loanable funds, where the
suppliers would be willing

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.800
to supply this quantity
while the borrowers are going

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.900
to want this quantity here
at that real interest rate.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.780
And so what you're going to have happen is

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.300
you're gonna get to a
new equilibrium point.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.370
The real interest rate is
going to go up to this point,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.120
let's call that our new
equilibrium real interest rate,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.843
and our quantity is going
to go up as well, so Q1.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.250
In order to convince more suppliers

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.020
to part with their money,
not part with their money,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.540
or at least make their
money available for lending,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.200
well, the interest rate's
going to have to go up

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.860
and we get to that point right there.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.810
Similarly, you could
have shifts in the supply

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.820
of loanable funds.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.210
Let's say, for example,
the savings rate changes

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.043
for some reason.

00:06:10.043 --> 00:06:13.800
There's a big marketing
campaign from the government

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.730
or in education or in schools that say,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.310
hey, we need to save more for a rainy day.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.470
You need to save more for our retirement.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.860
Well, then the supply of loanable funds,

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.180
if everyone saves more at
any given real interest rate,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.680
well, then the supply
for loanable funds curve

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.050
could shift to the right,

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.040
and if the opposite happened,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.610
of course it would shift to the left.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.780
Supply of loanable funds two,

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.200
and then what would happen?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.500
Well, if we were at this
point right over here,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.400
all of a sudden we are in a situation

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.610
where there's a surplus of loanable funds.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.940
At this interest rate, people are willing

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.240
to supply way more loanable funds

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.930
than people are demanding,

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.680
so then the price of the loanable funds,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.590
which is the real interest
rate, will go down.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.740
It will go down to this
new equilibrium point,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.430
and so here, this, we
could call this R sub three

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.620
would be our new real interest rate,

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.250
equilibrium real interest rate,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.240
and this would be our
new equilibrium quantity.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.110
Actually, let me call this
R sub two right over here.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.830
So, I will leave you there.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.400
The big takeaway is
that loanable funds kind

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.000
of operate the way the market
for almost anything would

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.030
with the difference being that the price

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.030
is no longer just a dollar amount,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.400
it is an interest rate

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.380
and since we wanna factor out inflation,

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.163
it is a real interest rate.
