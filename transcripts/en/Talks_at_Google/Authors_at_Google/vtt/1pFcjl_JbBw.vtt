[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:08.660
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I'd like to
introduce Karen Page and Andrew

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.531
Dornenburg to talk today.

00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:14.030
We're going to talk a little
bit about their new book, which

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.890
is in front of me,
"Kitchen Creativity,"

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.670
but this is also
their 11th book.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.960
And I've been using your
books for multiple years

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.900
as inspiration from when I
was first cooking but also

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.366
now to help provide inspiration
to our chefs in our units

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.490
around the world at Google.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.240
So thank you, first, for being
here and making time to see us.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.277
It's a true pleasure.

00:00:34.277 --> 00:00:36.110
But a little bit about
our authors before we

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.920
dive into the book.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.917
And we would like to make
this kind of a conversation.

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:42.500
So if you have
questions that come up,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.800
typically we'll leave
them to the end.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.600
But if there's
something that you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.240
have a tidbit you really want
to get out there, please let us

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.739
know.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.350
We love to make
this a conversation.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.870
And we're going to
do a quick interview,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.100
and then we're going
to break into what

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.150
we do at Kitchen Sync, which
is our teaching kitchen.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.630
We're going to do some cooking,
and Chef Dede and the team

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.060
are going to put together
a delicious treat.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.450
And you will get to sample it.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.650
So that's always a plus.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.670
So a little bit
about our authors.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.400
So for Karen, on my right
here-- after skipping a grade,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.530
Karen received her
letter of admissions

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.530
to Northwestern
University at age 16.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.100
The first--

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.330
KAREN PAGE: Oh, god, you're not
going to do the whole thing.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.410
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: No,
not the whole thing.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.880
KAREN PAGE: My life
story is flashing by--

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.260
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
I know, right?

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.170
KAREN PAGE: --before my eyes.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.211
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: But
you were the first person

00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:23.000
to attend college, self-financed
your education with seven

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.620
academic scholarships.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.816
Super cool.

00:01:25.816 --> 00:01:27.440
You ran your own
birthday cake delivery

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.849
business-- love to hear
more about that later on.

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:31.265
You were awarded
a BA in economics

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:33.350
and certified in
the women's studies

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.600
from Northwestern
University in '83.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.570
Named one of six honorable
mentions in "Glamour's" Top

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.850
10 College Women
competition and featured

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.920
on the cover of "Newsweek."

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.030
As well, you were invited to the
White House twice back in '86.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.880
You also earned an MBA from
Harvard Business School.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.110
Northwestern named you, in '93,
one of the university's 100

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.610
leading professional alumni.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.490
Congratulations.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.740
KAREN PAGE: Council of 100.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.997
Go Wildcats.

00:01:59.997 --> 00:02:01.580
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
An avid meditator.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.960
You both like to run--

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.120
interesting to hear that.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.900
And you live in New York
City with your husband

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.816
to your right, Andrew.

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:07.620
So welcome, Karen.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.350
It's great to have you here.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.960
And Mr. Andrew grew up
in the Bay Area here.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.690
Great to see another
Bay Area individual.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.460
And you kind of transitioned
from farmland to suburbs.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.190
So your family's background and
backyard had a lot of trees.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.630
You were obviously
into gardening,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.382
and it led you into
the culinary world,

00:02:27.382 --> 00:02:29.090
where you started
cooking at a young age.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.062
And you were mentioned
as first cooking

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:33.520
at McDonald's in
your early years--

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.980
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Absolutely.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.020
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: --as
well as one of the few--

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.811
like Jeff Bezos and
others have also worked

00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:40.260
at McDonald's, and doing quite
well now from McDonald's.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.927
Congratulations.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.134
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Thank you.

00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:43.190
KAREN PAGE: Good to know.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.050
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Everyone
has their start somewhere.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.600
That's awesome.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.670
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Absolutely.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.230
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Three
days out of high school,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.760
you became a firefighter.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.100
So obviously with the
amazing devastation

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.010
in Northern California
with the fires lately,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.470
it's great to see that you were
putting in your dues early on.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.040
But at the same time, you
found that after a while,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.872
firefighting was--

00:03:01.872 --> 00:03:03.830
even though it was your
best day of putting out

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.410
fires and cooking for
the team, your best days

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.400
ahead were really
getting into the kitchen.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.800
So you became a chef.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.880
You worked in some amazingly
talented restaurants,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.380
worked under some top chefs.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.240
And then after deciding
to leave the kitchen--

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.860
I see you worked with
Lydia Shire for a while--

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.080
decided to leave
the kitchen and then

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.999
ended up putting together
some amazing books

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.790
that we're going to
talk about in a moment.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.130
You also earned your
somm certificate--

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.690
interesting tidbit--

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.190
and--

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.980
KAREN PAGE: Actually,
we both did.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.370
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Yes.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.970
KAREN PAGE: Yes.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.510
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
At the same time?

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.170
ANDREW DORNENBURG: No.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.220
KAREN PAGE: Different times.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.960
But I think it's an
important part of anybody's

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.879
culinary education--

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.170
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Absolutely.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.292
Absolutely.

00:03:42.292 --> 00:03:43.250
KAREN PAGE: Worthwhile.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.350
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: And
then interesting piece

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.715
as well is you followed your--

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:48.490
was it your grandmother's
love for photography?

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.830
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Indeed.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.410
My grandmother actually had a
dark room, which you probably

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.060
have no idea what it
is, but it was a place

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.101
where you developed film.

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.080
But you probably have no
idea what that is either.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.274
There was a time where
that happened, yes.

00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:00.190
So I followed that up.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.550
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: And so
you did all the photographs

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.940
for the book.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.160
Is that correct?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.360
KAREN PAGE: Yes.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.070
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
Yes, for this one.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.850
KAREN PAGE: For this one
and "Veg Flavor Bible" also.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.183
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Yeah, great.

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:08.207
So multi-talented
individuals here in the room.

00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:09.290
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Indeed.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.840
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So
it's my distinct pleasure

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.114
and total excitement--

00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:14.030
I can't say it enough.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.821
We talked and had coffee
for the last hour,

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.050
and how excited I was
to see you guys here.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.513
Please welcome our authors.

00:04:19.513 --> 00:04:22.477
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:24.886
KAREN PAGE: Well, I can't--

00:04:24.886 --> 00:04:27.010
I have to interject by
saying, first of all, Scott,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.840
thank you for that
amazing introduction.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.423
I was worried we
were going to be here

00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:33.300
for hours if you're starting out
at age 16, but that was lovely.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.050
But the reason that
we're here is actually

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.280
because of this man.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.610
And I haven't had the pleasure
of meeting him in person

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.090
before, but we have
been in email touch

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.670
and in virtual
touch ever since he

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.730
gave this wonderful interview
to this national magazine

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.410
where he mentioned
one of our books

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.340
is his favorite book, which
we actually got to see today,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.180
which was thrilling.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.471
I think it's bound together--
what were you describing?

00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:04.677
With butcher string and kind
of falling apart a little bit.

00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:06.260
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
This is priceless.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.220
So if anyone tries to take
this from me, good luck.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.380
This is the first edition
"Culinary Artistry,"

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.119
and it is in the same condition
as it was 17 years ago

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.910
when you signed it.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.010
It was literally signed in 2000.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.670
And it was a book that
I used for inspiration

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.710
on a day-to-day level
when I was writing menus.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.300
And we're going
to talk about how

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.810
chefs gain their inspiration and
how culinarians and even home

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.960
chefs, home cooks,
gain their inspiration.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.100
And there's such a
variety of techniques

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.230
in becoming creative.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.680
But this book is
something that's

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.760
very near and dear to me.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.380
And when I brought
it out to Andrew

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.060
when he was dining
at our restaurant,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.810
I humbly said, it's getting
used, as you can see,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.380
because the binding's
falling off.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.020
So my only feedback
for the publisher

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.460
is stronger binding,
because the butcher's twine

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.600
is not quite working.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.430
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Or duct
tape included in the future.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.210
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Yeah, exactly.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.160
KAREN PAGE: But when you
talk about inspiration,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.743
part of our inspiration
for being here

00:05:55.743 --> 00:05:57.880
is really Scott and
the amazing reputation

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.880
that Google has for
its culinary program.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.770
And to know that
you've been here for--

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.910
how many years now?

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:04.410
12?

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.493
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Yeah,
going on 12 years, yeah.

00:06:06.493 --> 00:06:09.340
KAREN PAGE: --that you
have helped to have it--

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.640
raise it to really
a world-class level.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.290
When you started
out, there was just,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.240
I think, a handful of cafes.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.330
And now, you know, there
they are all over the world.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.690
But for those of us who have
never eaten at Google before--

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.820
this is a first--

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.350
to know that it is legendary in
terms of the choices available,

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.500
the quality of the food.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.250
And now, being here at
this wonderful new location

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.520
that we understand just
opened a matter of weeks ago,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.550
really, it's
something that gets us

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.070
on a plane from New York City
to come out to the Bay Area

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.250
to see what it's all about.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.070
And the fact that if we had
any role, the most minute role

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.260
in being an inspiration
to you, then we're

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.192
thrilled to be able to
be here and to be here

00:06:52.192 --> 00:06:53.900
with all the Googlers
for the first time.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.210
So thank you for having us.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.397
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I often
talk about your books.

00:06:57.397 --> 00:06:59.480
Obviously, this has just
been released a week ago.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.910
So many of you probably
haven't gotten it yet.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.110
You're flipping through it.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.350
But a lot of your books
follow that same theme,

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.430
which is to really unlock the
creativity and the potential

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.097
in chefs' minds.

00:07:09.097 --> 00:07:11.346
And again, whether it's a
professional chef or whether

00:07:11.346 --> 00:07:12.460
it's chefs at home.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.000
And what I've found that these
books are so amazing at is--

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.070
I always say it's
hard to plan to be

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.939
creative on a specific day.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.480
You can book the time in your
calendar and say, on Wednesday,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.740
I'm going to write a menu.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.990
But you know, you don't feel
well, the weather's bad,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.739
something comes up in
the news, and you're

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:29.350
just-- you're not feeling it.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.740
Tell me how this book is
helping chefs and individuals

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.730
kind of overcome that.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.690
There's a lot of
great pieces in here.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.650
But maybe unpack a little bit
of some of the initial thoughts

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.250
that you'd put into this
book to help chefs and home

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.920
chefs really kind of
get that creative edge

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.252
and bring their best forward.

00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:46.960
KAREN PAGE: Sure.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.080
Well, I think it's true
that for any of us who

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.390
cook, whether it's at
home or professionally,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.060
you're always looking
for inspiration.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.040
And there's a lot of
sameness, otherwise, that

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.320
takes place when you're
making the same thing day in

00:07:59.320 --> 00:07:59.970
and day out.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.460
So if you can learn to bring
creativity to your cooking,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.770
it's going to add that
much more enjoyment to you,

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.990
to everybody that you're
cooking for and with.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.700
But beyond that, it's
really a matter of--

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.680
creativity is the
most important skill

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.150
that we can possibly have.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.340
And so if you can learn
the skill of creativity

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.280
from the world's best chefs,
what better way to learn it?

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.210
We had done research
on the fact that CEOs

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.960
are saying that the number one
skill for success in leadership

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.400
and in business is creativity.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.480
It's not integrity.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.289
It's not global thinking,
which is a little interesting.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.940
But the fact that
it's creativity

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.730
makes it a subject
that's worth studying.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.860
And so we also realize that
only one in four people surveyed

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.480
say that they think that they're
at their creative potential.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.200
So to the extent that we
can become more creative,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.490
it's something we can
apply to our daily lives.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.640
It's something we can
apply in the kitchen.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.760
And so what we did with
"Kitchen Creativity" is we

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.430
wanted to create the ultimate
culinary brainstorming tool.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.216
So if you want to
be more creative,

00:09:02.216 --> 00:09:04.090
what are some of the
things that you can use,

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.590
some of the best practices that
are used by the world's best

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.500
chefs to become more creative.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.050
And really, we map
out the process

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.250
of creativity, which I know
we're going to get into.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.930
But both in a general way, in
terms of culinarily coming up

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.460
with a new dish, trying
to take old dishes

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.050
and make them new again.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.930
But then also from just a
best practices standpoint,

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.740
how do you let your
creativity flow?

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.680
And we've got some advice from
some of the leading creativity

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.000
experts in the world talking
about how to make that happen.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.650
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Yeah,
so don't downplay that.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.826
I think one of the things that
got me excited about "Culinary

00:09:40.826 --> 00:09:42.450
Artistry" when I
looked at it years ago

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.110
was the pedigree of chefs
you have in your back pocket.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.080
I'm interested to
hear how you informed

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.210
some of the initial
relationships with these chefs.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.290
You're talking about
every top chef out there.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.610
Whether it's Danko, Ripert,
Danny Meyers, restaurateur,

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.180
you've got amazing chefs
that are taking their time

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.700
to share some of their
most intimate secrets

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.080
on what's made them successful.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.010
And I don't take that lightly,
and none of our chefs at Google

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.560
that do such an amazing
job in bringing the food

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.605
program to life here do either.

00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:13.980
These are the
inspirational chefs

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.260
that they look to aspire to be.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.760
What were some of the initial--

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.750
how did that happen?

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.750
What was that first chef
that you were like, oh,

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.574
my god, if I could
just get this one to--

00:10:22.574 --> 00:10:23.490
how did that go about?

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.630
KAREN PAGE: Well, you
know, when we started out,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.070
we'd never written
a book before.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.140
And so how do you get
the world's best chefs

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.780
to talk to you?

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.696
We didn't really know.

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:31.620
But the ace in our
hole was that Andrew

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.110
was working as a
professional chef in Boston,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.300
and he was working with
Chris Schlesinger and Lydia

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.091
Shire, who at the time
were two of the best

00:10:38.091 --> 00:10:40.470
chefs in the country, who
happened to be in Boston.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.060
And so having-- starting
out with the two of them,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.336
and then he went on to work
with Anne Rosenzweig at Arcadia

00:10:46.336 --> 00:10:47.691
in New York City.

00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:49.690
And once we had the three
of them in our pocket,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.940
we could kind of go to people.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.380
Because there was
three big names

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.660
that they knew us
personally that

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.880
had some belief that we
could actually write a book.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.296
And so they thought, well, if
Lydia's in, and Chris is in,

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:01.150
and Anne's in, then I'm in, too.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.150
So from there, we went
to other top chefs

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.800
in Boston and New York.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.860
Then we were doing the research
on weekends and evenings.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.822
We would travel to San Francisco
and knock on Gary Danko's door.

00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:13.280
Actually, you had also worked
with Madeleine at that point.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.170
ANDREW DORNENBURG: I worked
with Madeleine Kamman

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.640
up at the School for American
Chefs at Beringer Vineyards.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.090
And so we met Gary Danko.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.410
We met other chefs
through her, too.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.495
But the key is Karen
writes a great letter.

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:26.370
That's how you do it.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.200
She goes, well, we've just
interviewed these other people.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.180
Would you like to be
included in our new book?

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.846
And even though they didn't know
us, they knew the other people.

00:11:32.846 --> 00:11:35.550
And it's like-- and also,
asking for 15 minutes.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.080
We only need 15, 20 minutes.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.990
And that always, almost
always, turned into an hour.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.270
And I'll never forget we
interviewed Chef Barbara

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.110
Tropp, a legendary restaurateur
and chef, China Moon

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.060
Cafe in San Francisco.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.980
And at the end-- we talked for
almost an hour and a half--

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.580
she goes, I've never had
a conversation like this.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.650
And we're like, neither have we.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.560
And then she's like, try not
to edit my words too much.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.521
We're like, you
went to Princeton.

00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:01.020
You're good.

00:12:03.584 --> 00:12:06.062
KAREN PAGE: PhD in
Chinese poetics.

00:12:06.062 --> 00:12:07.450
She spoke in poetry.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.300
Just an amazing woman,
founder of the Women Chefs

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.980
and Restaurateurs
Association that we

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.410
talked about was near and
dear to Dede and myself,

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.000
as a former board
member of that.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.280
So I think once you
kind of get started,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.610
then it is easier to
get the ball rolling.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.430
And that's true of any
aspect of creativity.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.900
The Goethe quote, it's like,
whatever you can imagine--

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.040
and I won't get the words
right, but you know, be bold.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.870
Take action.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.330
And then it really
has a magic to it

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.590
that really starts to unfold.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.660
So once you take action
in a certain direction--

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.625
we talk in the book-- there's
an A to Z section of the book,

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:41.500
the back of the book.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.060
That is laid out
like "Flavor Bible,"

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.601
if any of you are
familiar with that,

00:12:44.601 --> 00:12:46.810
where it's a three-column
format, A to Z.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:47.950
But instead of flavors--

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.500
we have apples to zucchini
in "The Flavor Bible"--

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.452
we have every other topic under
the sun, from architecture to--

00:12:55.452 --> 00:12:57.160
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
"Alice in Wonderland."

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:57.985
KAREN PAGE: "Alice
in Wonderland."

00:12:57.985 --> 00:12:59.610
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
And there's actually

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.110
a restaurant based on "Alice
in Wonderland," the book.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.260
And we actually
finish up with yoga.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.150
Rick Bayless of the Frontera
Grill and Topolobampo,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.400
the restaurant of the year
and the James Beard Award--

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.281
he's been doing
yoga for 20 years.

00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:13.780
And this is what's
fun about knowing

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.821
these people for so long.

00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:17.950
It's like, hey, Rick, would you
mind doing a yoga pose for us?

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.380
So he's in a chef's jacket.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.421
And he just pops up on the
counter and does yoga for us.

00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:23.170
And so it's like--

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:23.665
KAREN PAGE: He's amazing.

00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:24.220
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
He's like, sure.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.150
KAREN PAGE: For as long
as we've known him--

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.566
because we interviewed Rick
Bayless for all of our books--

00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:30.220
we had never seen him do
this amazing pose before.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.830
But you know, anyone as
multi-talented as Rick,

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.930
who has been doing yoga for
20 years, it's pretty awesome.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.310
So what an inspiration
to talk to chefs.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.094
And again, you know,
when you're talking

00:13:41.094 --> 00:13:43.510
to chefs for your 11th book
as opposed to your first book,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.060
it's a whole different
ballgame, because you built up

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.520
a certain level of
knowledge and trust.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.280
And so we're talking to people
about what inspires them,

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.580
and they went a little,
you know, rogue with us.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.050
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
They went there.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.216
KAREN PAGE: They went there.

00:13:55.216 --> 00:13:57.410
And they could tell
us quite honestly,

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.200
you know, I look
at my ingredients.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.460
I talk to my ingredients.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.650
And so I'll take an
apple, and I'll put it

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.219
in the center of the table.

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:06.010
And I'll have a
conversation with the apple

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.509
and say, OK, apple, what
are we going to do today?

00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:10.300
You've done some
interesting things before,

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.716
but what are we
going to do today?

00:14:11.716 --> 00:14:14.170
And there is this
level of intuition.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.540
You could call it
mediumship, channeling,

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.120
whatever you want to call
it, that takes place.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.440
And we're talking about the most
respected chefs in the country.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.090
So Jose Andres, based
in Washington, DC,

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.380
will talk to his ingredients.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.088
He said, if you talk
to your ingredients,

00:14:28.088 --> 00:14:29.770
they will always
tell you a story.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.440
You just have to have your
ears open to hear that story.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.200
Ghaya Oliveira, who just won
the James Beard Award this year,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.639
is the best outstanding pastry
chef in the United States.

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:40.930
She's the one who puts the
apple on the parchment paper

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.055
in the center of Restaurant
Daniel in New York City

00:14:43.055 --> 00:14:45.340
and says, talk to me, apple.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.880
Phillip Foss from EL
Ideas in Chicago--

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.880
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Yeah.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.270
Phillip Foss, he's great.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.900
This is a very
fascinating restaurant.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.120
It's in a loft way out
in the middle of nowhere.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.830
They say take a car.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.200
You know, don't take
public transportation.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.350
But he will say, the
ingredient is my child.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.530
And I want my child to
succeed and be happy.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.200
And it's up to me to
care for the child

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.285
and make sure it's
physically, emotionally,

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:13.240
and mentally, and
spiritually happy.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.670
So he treats his ingredients
like they're children

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.040
and raises them and, again,
has that conversation.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.030
And he has the craziest
menu I think I've ever seen.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.370
He will do a menu
based on the '80s.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.270
He will produce a dish and
play a certain piece of music

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.657
that it's inspired by.

00:15:29.657 --> 00:15:31.240
KAREN PAGE: Madonna's
"Like A Virgin,"

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.400
he's got a little
dish to go with that.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.520
He'll serve "cocaine,"
which is basically

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.302
a lime and coconut powder on
a mirror with a razor blade,

00:15:40.302 --> 00:15:41.760
at his Michelin-starred
restaurant.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.210
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I think
our chefs are getting inspired.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.690
I hear them giggling.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.940
KAREN PAGE: He's out there.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.981
But he's got a Michelin
star, and he's respected.

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:48.970
He's so celebrated.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.680
And so, you know,
there are chefs out

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.030
there who are creative.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.350
They're pushing the envelope.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.450
And they're doing a lot of
things that are a lot of fun.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.866
And you might not serve exactly
the same things in a home,

00:15:57.866 --> 00:16:01.270
but you can be inspired
by the thought process.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:05.320
He does a dish of Frosties
and french fries, which

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.710
was inspired by his daughters.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.224
Was a single dad for a
while and raising his kids,

00:16:09.224 --> 00:16:11.140
and the babysitter took
them to Wendy's, where

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.000
they learned to dip their--
did anybody do that?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.240
Dip their french
fries in the Frosty?

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.770
ANDREW DORNENBURG: I'd
never heard of that, yeah.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.210
KAREN PAGE: Did you ever
have it in a Michelin starred

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:16.709
restaurant?

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:18.910
If you go to EL
Ideas in Chicago,

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.680
you can taste it there.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.560
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So what
I love about these books,

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.870
again, is that it caters
to a variety of audiences.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.661
You've got people that
are cooking at home.

00:16:27.661 --> 00:16:29.697
You've got people that
are beginning to cook

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:30.530
or learning to cook.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.650
Or you've got people that have
been cooking for many years.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.030
What I love about
this, in essence,

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.946
is that it's very similar
to our program here.

00:16:35.946 --> 00:16:38.452
We're really trying to enable
people to pick up skills

00:16:38.452 --> 00:16:39.660
and give them the confidence.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.620
And when you dive
into the book, you're

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.120
going to see that
the quotes in here

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.670
are not only from some of
the biggest and baddest names

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.040
out there, but they're the
really great tidbits that

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.020
really help unpack
what they're thinking

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.320
and their thought process.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.260
So let's think-- let's talk
a little bit about the book.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.593
So the book is very interesting.

00:16:54.593 --> 00:16:56.600
This is a book of no recipes.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.590
This is a book--

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.220
and thank you, because there's
a lot of recipes out there--

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.490
but it's really around
a few different aspects.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.050
So you start the
book around mastery.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.675
And so there's a
section on that, which

00:17:06.675 --> 00:17:08.467
I'd love to talk about briefly.

00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:10.300
And then section two
is more around alchemy,

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.464
the transformation stage.

00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:13.130
And then number three
is around, really,

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.332
that creativity aspect, which
obviously is the bulk of it.

00:17:16.332 --> 00:17:18.290
Can you talk about the
three different sections

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.810
briefly so we can kind of
get an understanding of why

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.060
you went that direction?

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.230
And then we'll bring
in some examples.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.120
KAREN PAGE: Sure.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.387
Well, we start out with
mastery, because, as Picasso

00:17:28.387 --> 00:17:30.470
lets us know, you can't
break the rules unless you

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.680
know what the rules are.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.800
So you start out by
understanding the rules.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.780
And the way to do that
is really to learn

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.110
to think like a chef, shop like
a chef, and season like a chef.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.880
And so in terms of
thinking like a chef,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.960
we have done lots of
research on the leading books

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.166
that chefs everywhere
say that you

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:49.040
should have in your
culinary library at home.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.630
And we've narrowed it
down to the 20 top books.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.469
And if you read these
books, if you really

00:17:53.469 --> 00:17:55.010
absorb that information,
you're going

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.625
to know what the
best chefs know.

00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:58.250
And that will give
you a starting point

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.180
in terms of knowledge.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.912
In terms of skill,
you want to learn to--

00:18:01.912 --> 00:18:04.370
well, actually, one other thing
that's important with chefs

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.140
is the shopping aspect.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.800
This shopping is a
skill that if you

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.290
aren't willing to invest in
the same level of ingredients

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.090
that the best chefs
work with, you're not

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.860
going to have the same results.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.630
Sometimes the hardest
part is figuring

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.520
out-- where do you buy it?

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.714
And chefs have already
done that hard work for you

00:18:21.714 --> 00:18:23.630
to find the very best
of the best ingredients.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.030
We have a list of the
purveyors that provide chefs

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:29.656
with some of the hard to find
ingredients, spices, herbs,

00:18:29.656 --> 00:18:30.155
seasonings.

00:18:30.155 --> 00:18:32.130
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
Lots of grains, too.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:32.430
KAREN PAGE: Yes.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.596
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Yeah,
lots of grains and flowers.

00:18:34.596 --> 00:18:36.820
They all want their
polenta milled

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.050
a certain way or their
flour milled a certain way.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.610
KAREN PAGE: So we've got a guide
to where to shop like a chef.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.560
And then in terms of
seasoning like a chef,

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.140
that's really what we were
talking about in "Culinary

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.790
Artistry" so many years ago.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.499
When we banished chefs
to a desert island

00:18:51.499 --> 00:18:53.956
and asked them to bring only
10 ingredients that they would

00:18:53.956 --> 00:18:55.520
cook with for the
rest of their life,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.170
the number one
ingredient was salt.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.650
And salt is really
the master technique.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.150
All the chefs in the room are
nodding their heads like, yes,

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.490
of course.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.860
But to learn to add sodium to
a dish in a way that enhances

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.570
flavor without necessarily
adding flavor, which

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.470
we get into in the
alchemy stage of things,

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:16.670
but it gets a little
more complicated.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.170
Above and beyond
"The Flavor Bible,"

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.330
we talk about different
elements of salt. So not

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.370
just which salt do
different chefs use--

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:28.249
some use sea salt. Some use
mined salt. Some use pink salt.

00:19:28.249 --> 00:19:30.290
There are different salts
for different purposes.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.290
And thinking more
specifically about the salt

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.110
you use, adding not only
sodium, but in some cases umami

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.520
through a salty ingredient,
or other ingredients

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.970
that are complex, that will add
more than one taste at once.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.070
If you learn how
to work with them,

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.700
it can really
elevate your cooking.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.490
We talked to one chef the
other night in New York City.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.206
We did an event.

00:19:51.206 --> 00:19:52.580
And he was talking
about the fact

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.120
that he actually
ran out of salt,

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.150
which was the first
chef I've ever heard--

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.484
but it happens.

00:19:57.484 --> 00:19:58.150
We're all human.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.730
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I've
never heard that before.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.180
ANDREW DORNENBURG: That's the
exact reaction everybody had.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:00.910
KAREN PAGE: I think
it was at home.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.534
Maybe he wouldn't run out of it
at the restaurant, but at home.

00:20:03.534 --> 00:20:05.350
But he opened up his
refrigerator at home,

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.558
and he had feta cheese there.

00:20:06.558 --> 00:20:09.290
So he took the liquid from
the feta, which is salty,

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.930
and he used that as sort
of a liquid salt, ad hoc.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.722
And you know, it's just
one of those things

00:20:13.722 --> 00:20:15.180
that it's like,
well, of course you

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.370
could use salty ingredients.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.810
It doesn't have to be salt.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.240
And I think part of what
"Kitchen Creativity" is all

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.294
about is how can you open your
mind to thinking not about

00:20:23.294 --> 00:20:24.710
specific ingredients,
but thinking

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.840
about concepts that
you're adding to a dish

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.360
and to use it and really
extrapolate from there.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.110
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: It's
interesting to think

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.970
through the whole aspect
of just seasoning,

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.860
because people think, oh, you
just add salt, and it's done.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.777
Well, there's types of
salt. There's layering,

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:37.276
when to add the
salt, when to add it

00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:38.990
in the beginning and
the end of cooking.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.448
And these are the tips that
are within the book that really

00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:43.250
help a good chef
become a great chef,

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.666
and a great chef become an
excellent chef, whether, again,

00:20:45.666 --> 00:20:47.900
you're a home chef or not.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.240
So the first stage is mastery.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.060
And you made it very clear
that-- and all the chefs

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.550
said this in the book-- that
to be able to master anything,

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.310
it's a lot of practice.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.351
It's a lot of discipline.

00:20:57.351 --> 00:20:58.760
It's a lot of time.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.530
And once you
understand the rules,

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.697
then you can attempt
to break the rules.

00:21:02.697 --> 00:21:05.030
And then I think it kind of
takes you to that next step.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.510
So talk to them about
the next section,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.468
which is around that
transformation and alchemy

00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:09.570
stage.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.360
KAREN PAGE: Well,
that's the stage

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.360
that we've really been
writing about and talking

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.170
about for years now under
the guise of "Culinary

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.060
Artistry," "The Flavor
Bible," and "What to

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.200
Drink with What You Eat."

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.990
So alchemy is really about, how
do you take something common

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.120
and turn it into
something precious?

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.800
And what we mean by
that is that there

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.340
is a benefit in the culinary
world that one plus one

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.362
doesn't just equal two.

00:21:29.362 --> 00:21:31.070
There are instances
in which one plus one

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.330
can equal three or more.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.830
And what we have dedicated
our research to over the years

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.932
is trying to identify what is
the lock that you can put--

00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:42.140
the key that you can put
into the lock to really turn

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.230
it to unlock the deliciousness
of particular ingredients,

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.870
whether they're herbs or
spices or other seasonings

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.250
for specific ingredients.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.840
And this is what led us
both to sommelier school

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.350
is realizing that if you've
got a perfect plate of food

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.895
in front of you, and you've got
the wrong wine in your glass,

00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:02.270
when you have the two together--
which you inevitably do,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.744
because you eat and drink
together-- it's going to clash.

00:22:04.744 --> 00:22:05.910
It's going to ruin the food.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:09.570
So we became committed to
studying wine and earning

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.760
our sommelier
certificates, because it

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.340
was so important to--

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.590
it was an important
way to master flavor.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.870
And that was the
best means that we

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.880
had to be able to
train our palates

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.780
and to learn more about, well,
what was the secret to matching

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:25.990
the best wines with food.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.380
And so we also interviewed
dozens of the best sommeliers

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.570
all across the
country, including

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.810
at some of the top restaurants
and people that you're

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.450
well acquainted with, and
really compiled that into "What

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.400
to Drink With What
You Eat," which

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.160
is the ultimate food
and wine pairing guide,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.600
because you can
look up the food.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.990
It will tell you what wine
or beer, spirits, cocktails,

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.530
water, coffee, tea, et cetera
to drink with it to enhance

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.952
the flavor of that food.

00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:53.160
Vice versa, if you're starting
with a bottle of wine,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.618
you're starting
with a beer, you're

00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:56.640
starting with something
else, what food can you

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.460
serve with it to best
enhance what's in the bottle

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.750
or what's in the glass?

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.270
And so when you bring all
of those elements together,

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.880
that's really what we're talking
about in terms of alchemy.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.370
If you master some of
the principles of-- what

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.060
are the key flavor pairings?

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.384
What are the key--

00:23:11.384 --> 00:23:12.800
some of those
standard-- you know,

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.520
sancerre and oysters or
pinot noir and salmon.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.410
If you master some
of those, it gets

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.840
you so close to the ballpark
that you could actually

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.727
be only an OK chef with
a modicum of talent.

00:23:24.727 --> 00:23:26.310
But if you understand
those principles

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.080
and can apply them
in the kitchen,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.230
it's going to make you
shine to a whole new level.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.230
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Yeah.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.820
And we always talk about--

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.600
think about what's in the
glass as a sauce, also.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.880
And again, you know,
a really easy way

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.280
to do that, a quick tool
is if it grows together,

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.484
it goes together.

00:23:42.484 --> 00:23:44.400
So if you're in Italy,
and you're making pasta

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.000
from Northern Italy, see what
they drink in Northern Italy.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.340
If you're in the Bay Area,
and you're grilling a steak,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.905
well, gosh, grab
a bottle of zin.

00:23:52.905 --> 00:23:54.780
You know, they're right
there in Napa Valley.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.071
They're all next to each other.

00:23:56.071 --> 00:23:57.660
There's a natural synergy.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.070
But also, I think
it's also fun--

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.320
and just to wrap this
part up a little bit--

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.890
is that it's not just wine.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.914
You can have a lemon
soda with a salad,

00:24:06.914 --> 00:24:09.080
and that could almost be
your dressing on the salad.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.610
So you think outside--

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.310
just think of the
classic pairings,

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:15.120
and we all know that
you can actually drink

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.770
white wine with many things.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.050
You can actually drink
red wine with fish now.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:19.930
It's OK.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.270
Pinot noir and salmon.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:25.440
So think of all the beverages
with what you can bring in.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.590
And again, that's going to
change a lot of your meals

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.900
just by having the
proper beverage.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.480
You know?

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.212
That's the three there.

00:24:33.212 --> 00:24:35.670
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I think
you hit on a lot of key points,

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.700
and it goes much deeper than
just the actual dishes itself.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.890
It goes to what's being
paired, your surroundings,

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.410
and it creates that
experience that if any of you

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.230
think about your most
epic food experience

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.480
you've ever had-- it could
be a hot dog at a ballpark,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.390
it could be at a Michelin
star restaurant--

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.470
there's different things
that all came together.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.800
And a great culinarian
makes that look so easy.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.430
And a lot of these
tips are in the book.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.870
And so it's super exciting.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.400
There's a great
quote in the book,

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.640
and it starts off by saying
to not copy other chefs.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.990
But to be able to get
inspired, I and many others

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.614
feel that copying is actually
the gateway to get into.

00:25:13.614 --> 00:25:14.530
Can you speak to that?

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:15.880
Because it's kind
of a contradiction,

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.130
but it actually
makes total sense.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.546
KAREN PAGE: Yes,
well, that's sort

00:25:18.546 --> 00:25:21.900
of the hook in the
beginning of the book

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.150
is talking about-- we want
to teach you creativity.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:25.800
What's the definition
of creativity?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.350
It's not copying, coming
up with something that's

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.580
new and useful and surprising.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.800
And yet by
definition, how do you

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.570
get to that point of
being able to do it?

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:37.550
You need to learn the rules.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.675
How do you learn the rules?

00:25:38.675 --> 00:25:39.420
You copy.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.460
So that's the push me, pull you.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.354
And I think that
that is a lesson that

00:25:44.354 --> 00:25:46.770
comes through time and time
again in the book in that it's

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.100
never one or the other.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.920
It's never hot versus cold.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.165
It's both.

00:25:52.165 --> 00:25:53.790
In the back of the
book under Y, you'll

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.920
find "yes, and" being
one of the key rules

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.960
that you need to
master for creativity.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.660
And it's the first
rule of improvisation.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.030
If you've ever done any
improvisational acting,

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.090
you know that if someone
says something like, OK,

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:07.590
here's the premise
of this scene.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.537
I'm going to walk in, and I
dropped the book on the floor.

00:26:10.537 --> 00:26:12.870
You don't say, oh, no, no,
no, you didn't drop the book.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.820
You have to say, yes,
you dropped the book,

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.449
and that was the book
that I was on the waitlist

00:26:17.449 --> 00:26:18.240
for at the library.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.270
It's like, yes, and
that was the book

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:24.720
that my ex-boyfriend
actually wrote.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.150
And you add onto the story.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.850
So you always add on to
it, because you never

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.330
want to break that chain.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.470
So the key that you can take
from the improvisational rules

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.020
and to apply in the kitchen
is no matter what happens,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.940
you trust that it's
there to serve you,

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.220
and it's for a reason.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.720
And what we tell people
is it kind of goes--

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.910
if you look in the
beginning of the book,

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.030
there's a list of
different classic dishes

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.710
and what their origins were.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.120
And a lot of times,
they came from mistakes.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.850
So there was something
that went wrong.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.910
The burrito gets knocked
into the deep fat fryer.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.290
Hey, chimichangas.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.180
Or the ravioli gets knocked
into the deep fat fryer.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.280
Hey, toasted ravioli
turns into a thing.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.150
People love it.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.250
So things are never really
mistakes if you pay attention

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:08.750
to it.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.190
And so at Craftsman and
Wolves in San Francisco,

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.560
the intern undercooks the
egg that you asked her

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.880
to hard boil.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.710
It's soft boiled.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.800
It oozes out.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.430
Wait a second.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.434
That's kind of cool.

00:27:19.434 --> 00:27:21.100
And you find out that
people love things

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.270
that ooze out of other things.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.650
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: You
just let all the secrets out

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:24.800
of our mistakes.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.100
Thanks, Karen.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.220
KAREN PAGE: There
are no mistakes.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:28.920
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: It's
a really good point.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.330
I think Ferran Adria talks
in the book about the fact

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.960
that if you're
unique, and if you're

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.460
doing something innovative that
no one else has done before,

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.760
and you're not
copying, then no one

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.510
can really judge it
against anything else.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.900
And I think that's a good point.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.330
But you cannot go that
direction unless you've got

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.550
the understanding of the
technique and the mastery

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:46.187
to begin with.

00:27:46.187 --> 00:27:48.520
And obviously, Ferran is one
of the most acclaimed chefs

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.440
out there, and so he can
easily pull that off.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.856
But I think it's
a great testament

00:27:51.856 --> 00:27:54.340
to get inspired by seeing
what other people do,

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.810
have conversations.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.057
Whatever your inspiration
is to document it.

00:27:58.057 --> 00:27:59.890
And you have a lot of
great tips in the book

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.010
around, how do you capture
that moment of creativity?

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.510
It's about always
being positive.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.470
It's about surrounding
yourself with others

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.450
on great conversations.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:08.741
It's about writing things down.

00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:11.080
And you know, most
chefs, great chefs,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.580
have either a pocketbook--

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:12.850
KAREN PAGE: A notebook.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:13.300
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: --a pen--

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:13.640
notebook, yeah.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.470
KAREN PAGE: The
pen behind the ear.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.340
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Or
right by the bedside.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.230
Because when you wake
up, sometimes you've

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:18.746
had this amazing thought or--

00:28:18.746 --> 00:28:19.870
for me, it's if I exercise.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.104
It's like I get that a-ha
moment of that would work.

00:28:22.104 --> 00:28:24.020
And then, you know, you
have to write it down.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.560
And it's about all these great
little tips that sometimes

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.770
are not revolutionary.

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.620
It's just, yes, this
makes total sense.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.880
Let's do this more often.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.005
And you can take that
outside the kitchen, as well.

00:28:33.005 --> 00:28:34.379
KAREN PAGE: Yes,
and that was one

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:36.517
of the benefits of being
able to do book number 11

00:28:36.517 --> 00:28:38.350
is because chefs were
really upfront with us

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.750
about their creative
process involving,

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.380
in a lot of cases,
personal reflection time.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.190
So whether that was
through journaling

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.720
or through meditation--
we found out

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.011
that a lot of the chefs we've
been talking to for years

00:28:49.011 --> 00:28:51.080
were very deep meditators.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.080
Talked with Eric Ripert
of Le Bernardin, which

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.820
is on the world's
50 best restaurants

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.480
list, about his Tibetan
Buddhist meditation practice

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.450
that he credits as a
source of his creativity.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.600
Mario Batali studied
TM after being

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.850
recommended to it by Jerry
Seinfeld, of all people.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.230
And so he studied through
the David Lynch Foundation.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:15.130
And other chefs are big
meditators, yoga doers,

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.570
martial artists, runners.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.070
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
A lot of runners.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.903
KAREN PAGE: For those
of us who are runners,

00:29:19.903 --> 00:29:21.640
like Andrew and
I run marathons--

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.280
when you're doing 26.2 miles,
you know, it's all mental.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.475
It's not physical anymore.

00:29:26.475 --> 00:29:28.350
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: It's
a grueling business.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.790
It's very, very-- you
bring out all your senses

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:31.810
when you're cooking.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.644
How many people here
love to cook at home?

00:29:33.644 --> 00:29:34.560
KAREN PAGE: All right.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:34.720
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Yay.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.250
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Everyone here.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:35.750
KAREN PAGE: Our kind of peeps.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.350
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: You're
going to be so more inspired now

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.160
with this book.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.912
But it brings out all of it.

00:29:39.912 --> 00:29:40.870
And it's very draining.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.730
It's very emotionally draining,
sometimes more than even

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.896
physically draining, depending
on what you're doing.

00:29:44.896 --> 00:29:46.480
And I think that
whatever you need

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.106
to do to create that balance is
going to keep you at your best

00:29:49.106 --> 00:29:50.980
so that you can be at
your best consistently.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.080
Because, you know, we're
human, and if we're not

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.905
feeling creative, that
speaks in the food.

00:29:55.905 --> 00:29:56.530
You can see it.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:57.420
You can smell it.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.240
You can taste it.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.590
Or you can't, right?

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.820
KAREN PAGE: And [INAUDIBLE]
calls that the aura of a dish.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.680
That the most important
aspect of the dish

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.430
is that connection
between the dish itself

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.020
and the person who's eating it.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.760
And she believes it's love.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.236
That you can actually taste
it if there's soul in a dish,

00:30:12.236 --> 00:30:14.110
if there's love in a
dish, or if there's not.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.330
If a dish falls flat, she
knows that people just

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.339
aren't cooking with everything
that they can bring to a dish.

00:30:19.339 --> 00:30:20.380
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Sure.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.000
So we're going to do
a transition here.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.458
And speaking of
bringing everything

00:30:23.458 --> 00:30:26.590
that we can to a dish, we're
going to do a little fun here

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:27.800
with Chef Dede and the team.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.860
So we're in the
Kitchen Sync teaching

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.300
kitchen at Google in Sunnyvale.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.527
And the team here is going
to talk through-- we're

00:30:33.527 --> 00:30:35.110
going to move the
chairs out-- they're

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.720
going to talk through kind of
how they look at inspiration

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.450
when they create meals and
recipes for our Googlers

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:41.920
as they teach them to cook.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.339
And we'll be kind of
narrating back and forth

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:45.880
and asking her all
sorts of questions

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.389
and seeing how it comes to life.

00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:48.430
But I'm excited for this.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.739
So, Chef Dede, welcome.

00:30:49.739 --> 00:30:51.030
DEDE SAMPSON: Thank you, Scott.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.988
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Let
me get out of your way.

00:30:52.988 --> 00:30:54.764
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:55.732 --> 00:30:58.160
All right.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.810
So tell the audience here, and
obviously our virtual audience,

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.312
a little bit about what you
do and what Kitchen Sync is.

00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:08.770
For the folks in the audience,
they probably understand it,

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.990
but you're delivering
cooking classes to Googlers.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.740
DEDE SAMPSON: Yes.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.330
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Sometimes families.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.350
DEDE SAMPSON:
Sometimes families.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:16.970
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: And
you're teaching people

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.178
on a variety spectrum,
whether they know how to cook,

00:31:19.178 --> 00:31:21.140
they're comfortable
cooking, or not at all.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.890
DEDE SAMPSON: Yep.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.130
Sometimes we have people that
cook six, seven nights a week.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.830
Sometimes they're just
getting into the kitchen,

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.140
and they want some basic
knife skills and basic cooking

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:30.720
techniques.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.800
So we have a full
culinary program,

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.090
single-subject classes--

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:39.490
could be food literacy
based, skill building.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.350
We do a core culinary
program, lots of team events,

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.964
guest chefs, so usually
two classes a day or more.

00:31:47.964 --> 00:31:50.380
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: You do
have the coolest job on campus.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.496
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:51.496 --> 00:31:53.995
DEDE SAMPSON: Yeah, I get to
live in this amazing space each

00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:54.500
and every day.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.850
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: And you're
in a brand new teaching kitchen

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:56.060
here.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.480
So I'm going to move that
chair out of your way.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.140
And why don't you just
talk a little about--

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.860
I know I have kind of an
understanding of what you're

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.318
looking through here, but I
was talking to Karen and Andrew

00:32:03.318 --> 00:32:05.660
earlier about what I
call the chef's arsenal.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.050
And the chef's arsenal,
for many chefs, is--

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.560
especially in the older
days when we were trained--

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.830
you've got sugar, you've
got salt, you've got fat,

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.980
whatever that fat might be.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.854
And those are the three
things that typically

00:32:15.854 --> 00:32:17.420
dominate and deliver flavor.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.010
And we still use
those, but we use

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.840
them a lot more thoughtfully.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.020
We have a very
intentional outlook

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.877
on the food program at Google.

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:27.835
And while we want to
deliver on deliciousness--

00:32:27.835 --> 00:32:29.450
and I love the fact
that you said that,

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:30.890
and that it's in
the book-- while we

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.265
want to deliver
on deliciousness,

00:32:32.265 --> 00:32:33.740
we can do this in
thoughtful ways.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.210
And so you're going to
talk through your dish

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.040
today, and kind of
how you're doing that

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.310
with the Google twist,
and talk through

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.340
some of the ingredients that are
your modern-day arsenal, that

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.400
are still delivering on the
attributes of sweet, sugar,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.690
salty, and fat, but you're
doing them in a thoughtful way.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.280
DEDE SAMPSON: Yeah,
so one of things

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.190
I think about when I'm
building out a dish,

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.630
start with seasonality.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.090
I think that's really important.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.800
And thinking about
the dish today,

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.800
I just was thinking about
all these amazing fall

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.610
squashes that are
coming into the market.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:07.850
So we roasted up some
butternut squash.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:12.030
We have some delicata
squash roasted as well.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:16.100
And then thinking
about other ingredients

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.140
that would go well with this
dish, so some nice kale,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.630
mushrooms-- and not only
mushrooms, roasted mushrooms.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.850
So some roasted
shiitake mushrooms

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:32.742
really get into super tasty,
salty, umami for sure.

00:33:32.742 --> 00:33:35.200
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So you're
talking about roasting a lot.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.470
And for those who can't see
the ingredients up close,

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.420
you're developing a
heightened sense of the flavor

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.982
by the caramelization of the
natural sugars in the squash.

00:33:43.982 --> 00:33:45.940
And the mushrooms-- you're
extracting the water

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.050
to get more flavor.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.970
And so you're really
delivering on flavor.

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:51.460
And most of this, if not all
of it, is all plant based,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.260
and so you're highlighting
the seasonality

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.844
as we're heading into fall.

00:33:54.844 --> 00:33:56.260
We have some of
the squashes here,

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.634
but you've got some staples
that are always on our menus.

00:33:58.634 --> 00:34:01.360
Whether it's the quinoa or the
mushrooms and things like that.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.359
DEDE SAMPSON: Roasted
shallots as well, so yeah.

00:34:03.359 --> 00:34:07.810
Really nice, plant-based dish,
one of the things we also

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.010
drive in Kitchen Sync as well.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.040
And then, yeah, thinking about--

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.590
you could take this
set of ingredients,

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.230
and then I think
about, OK, how am I

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.830
going to build flavor with
a sauce or the dressing

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.960
or the sparkling water
and the wine, right?

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:29.330
So today I wanted to take a kind
of a trip in a map to Thailand

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.580
and use some Thai ingredients.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.719
KAREN PAGE: Oh, excellent.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:36.219
DEDE SAMPSON: So things
like fish sauce, right?

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:40.405
Salty, umami, it's that layer
of salt that's not just salt.

00:34:40.405 --> 00:34:42.280
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
Caramelization, too, a lot

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.110
of flavor in there.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.659
DEDE SAMPSON: Soy sauce.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:51.040
Another, you know, fermented
sauces, fermented flavors,

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.530
really rich in umami.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:56.227
Palm sugar, little bit of
sweet, but also just not--

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:57.060
KAREN PAGE: Balance?

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.630
DEDE SAMPSON: Yeah, right.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.590
Kind of caramely, vanilla-y,
not just that plain white sugar

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.510
thing happening out there.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:10.500
Fresh ginger, or classically,
for Thai, galangal root.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.970
Thai chilis, a little
bit of that heat

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:14.750
and that sensory that you want.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:15.840
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
I'm already hungry.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.631
KAREN PAGE: I know.

00:35:16.631 --> 00:35:17.260
I am, too.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.340
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I'm
going to pause you right now,

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.250
because you've delivered on
so many attributes that are

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.660
so important to any great meal.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.269
And obviously,
within our guidance

00:35:24.269 --> 00:35:25.810
that we provide to
our chefs, we have

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.100
a saying called flavor rules.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:27.860
Flavor rules.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.549
It has to be there,
or why bother?

00:35:30.549 --> 00:35:31.090
Just go home.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.030
Pack it up.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.437
But there's also
rules of flavor.

00:35:33.437 --> 00:35:35.020
And what Dede's
talked about is you've

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.394
got amazing flavors here.

00:35:36.394 --> 00:35:37.810
And they happen
to be plant-based,

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:38.893
but they don't have to be.

00:35:38.893 --> 00:35:41.670
You've got umami, that sixth
sense of that meatiness

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.180
through mushrooms, soy sauce.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.130
You've got the spice
through ginger.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.091
You've got spice through
sriracha or chili.

00:35:47.091 --> 00:35:49.090
You've got the herbaceousness
from the cilantro.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:50.777
You've got the
crunch from the nuts.

00:35:50.777 --> 00:35:52.360
You've got all these
different aspects

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.570
that for a dish to
truly be craveable,

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.440
for you to want
one more bite, you

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.300
need to get all of
these elements together.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.850
And what Dede is going to do
now is to pull these together

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:04.570
in a way that is going
to want the diner

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.022
to go back for that next bite.

00:36:06.022 --> 00:36:07.480
And as our focus
here-- where we're

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.420
trying to help our users make
better choices with food,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.160
because the food here
is something that

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.260
is plentiful and
bountiful-- it's

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.640
easy to make wrong decisions.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.570
And our job is to make it easier
for you to make better choices

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.520
and to enjoy what you have.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.520
Because a lot of times
users come to us and say,

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.853
this is the highlight of my day.

00:36:24.853 --> 00:36:26.170
Lunch was, like, the highlight.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.250
So it should be--

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:27.590
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Way to go.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.240
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
--an amazing experience.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.574
ANDREW DORNENBURG: That's great.

00:36:29.574 --> 00:36:30.823
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Hopefully.

00:36:30.823 --> 00:36:31.644
No one's saying no.

00:36:31.644 --> 00:36:33.260
KAREN PAGE: Look at
the smiles out there.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:33.730
Yeah.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:34.720
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So,
Dede, why don't you dive in.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.790
And if the audience
has questions,

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.780
you guys can chime in while Dede
starts putting this together.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.650
KAREN PAGE: You picked some of
my favorite complements to--

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.740
I love this combination
of squash and mushrooms,

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.880
the earthiness balancing
the sweetness of the squash.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.930
I think it's still
seasonal, and yet there's

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.120
a real complementary
nature to that.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.140
ANDREW DORNENBURG: And
actually, the other thing I like

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.650
is the fact of the nuts.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.760
The nuts will crunch, but also
it's protein and it's fat.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.635
So when you were talking
about fat being such--

00:37:03.635 --> 00:37:05.220
playing a role--
and it still does.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.170
And fat is actually soon
to be considered a flavor.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.450
But that's a good way to
make the dish even healthier

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.070
as opposed to, like,
a creamy dressing

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.030
or something like that.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.720
You can get it all there.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.220
So you're actually
getting two for one.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.765
Actually, a little
bit of umami, too.

00:37:16.765 --> 00:37:18.550
That's a really key thing.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.810
And who doesn't
like crunchy nuts?

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:21.820
DEDE SAMPSON: Walnut.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.940
You know how we were
talking about earlier

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.315
that kind of stealing,
that taking advice?

00:37:26.315 --> 00:37:28.690
I did check out the book, of
course, before you got here,

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:30.940
and I saw the mushroom advice.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.760
And I was like, right, I got
to put the mushrooms in there.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.359
So thank you.

00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:36.400
KAREN PAGE: There you go.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.530
You've obviously read
well and paid attention.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.980
And of course, quinoa, with
its high protein content--

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.570
I always feel virtuous
when I have it.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.710
I love the texture.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.220
It's more of a textural thing
for me, I think, than flavor.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.310
But I love the earthiness
of it, the knowing

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.110
that I'm doing something
good for my body.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:54.800
Yes.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.500
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So there's
a beautiful array of colors.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.000
For those that are up
here, you can smell it.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.880
And it's a cold dish.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.670
So imagine if some
of these were heated,

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.460
and you could easily add the
warm mushrooms or warm squash.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.410
And temperature
plays a lot into what

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:09.940
we do as we're creating dishes,
because you eat with your eyes

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.440
first.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.080
But even before that is
if you walk into any cafe

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.231
or restaurant, the first
thing you generally get

00:38:15.231 --> 00:38:17.230
is a smell of something,
and hopefully something

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.780
that's not overpowering
like cologne or perfume--

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.370
which is why chefs don't wear--

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.337
yeah, that's beautiful-- which
is why chefs don't wear that.

00:38:24.337 --> 00:38:25.420
KAREN PAGE: So refreshing.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.961
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
One of the things

00:38:26.961 --> 00:38:28.600
that I'd love Dede
to speak to is

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.240
the disciplines within
the program at Google

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.410
about really practicing
your recipes.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.160
This is something that
you've made before.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.375
It's not something that
you see on "Top Chef"

00:38:37.375 --> 00:38:40.000
where you get five ingredients,
and you put something together,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.520
and it's perfect day one.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.410
And the reason I mention
that-- and I love the TV

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.900
shows that have really
brought the popularity of food

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.430
and getting people excited.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.535
But at times I think there
is a challenge out there

00:38:51.535 --> 00:38:53.410
that a lot of people
think that just throwing

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:55.750
ingredients together is
the way it is for chefs.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.920
And that's not the case.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.990
They spend so much time
testing and training

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.640
and retesting and retooling.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.110
And what we call
a signature recipe

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.181
might take us weeks, months,
or years to get to a point.

00:39:05.181 --> 00:39:07.180
And talk a little bit
about your thought process

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.590
and how you got this,
because I know you just

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.506
didn't go in the
refrigerator and be like, ah,

00:39:10.506 --> 00:39:11.770
that looks like fun today.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.061
You had some thought with this.

00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:16.359
So give us some insights as
you're compiling this, please.

00:39:16.359 --> 00:39:17.650
DEDE SAMPSON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:23.220
So like I said, back to
seasonality, deliciousness,

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.560
craveability, you
know, super important.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.540
And so going back to roasting
the butternut squash,

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.962
thinking about the fish sauce,
all those fermented things--

00:39:35.962 --> 00:39:37.420
I'm actually
surprised I didn't put

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.580
miso paste on this, because
I'm obsessed with miso paste

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.470
right now.

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.870
KAREN PAGE: It's always better
with miso or often better

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:44.680
with miso.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.940
Great, magic ingredient.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.565
DEDE SAMPSON: So I'll
put a bit of miso

00:39:47.565 --> 00:39:51.535
into a salad dressing or,
you know, adding into a dish.

00:39:51.535 --> 00:39:54.160
KAREN PAGE: And I love what you
said about roasting the squash,

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.790
because again, every ingredient
also has a key that unlocks it

00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:58.780
in terms of technique.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.560
You don't boil it.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.440
You don't steam it.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.160
You roast it to get
the ultimate flavor.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.040
DEDE SAMPSON: Yeah, great point.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.719
You know, adding in the crunch
with some of the red bell

00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:10.510
peppers and also a
little bit of sweetness.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:12.340
We roasted the
shallots, as well.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:12.540
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Really
concentrated flavor.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.540
DEDE SAMPSON: Another tip
I stole from the book.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.790
KAREN PAGE: Excellent.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:18.210
DEDE SAMPSON: And then, you
know, we balance taste, right?

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:21.489
The sweet, the sour, the salty,
the bitter, and the umami.

00:40:21.489 --> 00:40:23.530
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: It's
like chef's favorite two

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.170
words-- needs salt. I
think even in the book.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.810
You joke that chefs can look at
a dish and say, it needs salt.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:30.640
And 9 times out of
10, they're right.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.649
So you're about to
put this together,

00:40:32.649 --> 00:40:34.690
and obviously the team
is-- and right now Jared's

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:36.607
tasting to make sure
that the salt is spot on.

00:40:36.607 --> 00:40:38.064
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
But that's good.

00:40:38.064 --> 00:40:39.850
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
But it's so key.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.211
How many people here
have cooked at home,

00:40:42.211 --> 00:40:43.960
and there's always
some-- there's that one

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.520
little element missing, right?

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.050
It could be salt.
It could be acid.

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:48.400
It could be that balance.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.800
And that's the
fun in the kitchen

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.010
is to come up with what is that
perfect balance that you're

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:54.550
looking for.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:57.340
And what Dede's got here
is a perfect opportunity

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.080
to deliver on an
amazing deliciousness,

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.760
because you've got
all that going on.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.560
But with Thai food
specifically, it's

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.494
either really good or
really wrong, right?

00:41:04.494 --> 00:41:06.160
Because if you're too
high on the sugar,

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.110
if you're too high on the spice,
it just throws the balance off.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.235
And so what she's doing
now is she's going through,

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:15.240
and she's looking for
those specific balances

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.240
and incorporating
the ingredients.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.760
How is it tasting?

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.495
JARED: It's good.

00:41:19.495 --> 00:41:21.620
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Do you
need Dede to check that?

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.065
You sound kind of confident.

00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:25.690
KAREN PAGE: I think
with the sweetness,

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.270
you know, sweetness
gets a bad rap

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.020
that you don't want
to eat too much sugar,

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.090
which I think is true,
but also sometimes

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:34.300
all you need is a little bit of
sugar to be a flavor enhancer.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.270
And you get-- and there's that
peak aspect of when you're

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.940
looking how to season
where you learn,

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.945
OK, it's enhancing flavor,
enhancing, enhancing, oops,

00:41:42.945 --> 00:41:44.410
it starts dulling flavor.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:45.869
And so if you add
too much sugar,

00:41:45.869 --> 00:41:46.910
it will dull the flavors.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:48.493
So you kind of have
to work on getting

00:41:48.493 --> 00:41:51.430
to the peak of that apex
as it's still going up

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:53.074
and then before it
starts going down.

00:41:53.074 --> 00:41:55.740
And I think that's just a matter
of trial and error, repetition,

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:56.780
as you said before--

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.760
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
Personal taste.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.710
KAREN PAGE: Personal
taste, in some instances.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.890
Yeah.

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:00.630
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
And that's a challenge.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.130
Personal taste, obviously,
with hundreds of thousands

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.460
of Googlers running around--

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.420
our approach on
that is to create

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.040
food that is
approachable for everyone

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.151
but personalizable
for everyone as well.

00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:13.150
And so a lot of the times,
we'll leave garnishes

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.650
on the side purposely
so that people

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:18.610
could add their element of
acidity, spice, et cetera.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.380
And I find myself doing
that more and more

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:23.290
when I cook at home, because
everyone has different tastes.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.517
So question for both of you.

00:42:24.517 --> 00:42:26.350
If you had three
ingredients that are always

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.000
in your refrigerator
that you would rely on

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.834
for instant flavor--

00:42:28.834 --> 00:42:30.208
KAREN PAGE: I love
that question.

00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:31.490
And it always changes, right?

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.430
Miso is absolutely one of the--

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:33.980
ANDREW DORNENBURG: And it
changes during the season, too.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.660
KAREN PAGE: We
have to have miso--

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.530
well, champagne.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:36.590
I don't know about
that ingredient,

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.520
but you just always
need champagne on hand.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:38.970
DEDE SAMPSON:
We're in alignment.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:39.850
KAREN PAGE: Is
that an ingredient?

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:40.710
DEDE SAMPSON:
We're in alignment.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:41.320
KAREN PAGE: Right, right.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.090
DEDE SAMPSON: Champagne
is very important.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.060
KAREN PAGE: I'm
getting that sense.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.881
ANDREW DORNENBURG: It is
always in the refrigerator.

00:42:44.881 --> 00:42:46.030
KAREN PAGE: What else?

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.810
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
Parmesan cheese.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:47.680
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Yes.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.679
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Parmesan
is a real workhorse.

00:42:49.679 --> 00:42:51.940
KAREN PAGE: Actually, we
ate vegan for two months.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.010
And we found that it
was really hard to live

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.010
without Parmesan cheese.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.360
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Yeah, why would you

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.190
want to do that, right?

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.690
KAREN PAGE: Yeah.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:57.190
ANDREW DORNENBURG: Yeah.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.440
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: All right.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.016
Miso, Parmesan, so I'm
picking up two umami things.

00:43:01.016 --> 00:43:02.890
ANDREW DORNENBURG: And
then, actually, not in

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.650
the refrigerator, but on the--

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:08.470
next to the stove is always
a wide variety of vinegars.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:12.970
Champagne, sherry, balsamic,
white balsamic, dark balsamic.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.640
And what's cool about
vinegar is I think this is--

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.380
if you want to be
more creative tonight,

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.650
buy a different bottle of
vinegar, make your same salad,

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:22.780
and do one with balsamic
vinegar tonight,

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.700
one with a squeeze
of lemon tomorrow,

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.900
and one with champagne
vinegar the next day.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.400
You'll have three
completely different salads.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.580
And also, vinegars have
different degrees of acidity,

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:33.260
too.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.470
So champagne vinegar
is very soft.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:36.900
Lemon's relatively soft.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.740
So we always have
a lot of vinegar.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.726
So it's basically salt, sour--

00:43:40.726 --> 00:43:42.350
KAREN PAGE: Actually,
and Saison sauce.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:44.016
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
Oh, and Saison sauce.

00:43:44.016 --> 00:43:45.210
Joshua Skenes' Saison.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:48.220
We got a little bottle
of that after we left.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:48.840
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: How
many people are feeling

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.025
inspired to cook tonight?

00:43:50.025 --> 00:43:51.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:53.020
KAREN PAGE: You
know, the thing is

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.020
that if you have those
key ingredients, whatever

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.030
they are-- and I think it
changes from week to week,

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.363
because we don't like having
the same thing every night.

00:43:59.363 --> 00:44:01.050
So some nights, it's
like, OK, we better

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:04.047
have rice and
beans and avocados,

00:44:04.047 --> 00:44:05.880
because that'll get us
in the Mexican realm.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.660
We want to have a
good salsa on hand,

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:13.590
either a fresh pico de gallo
or a great jarred salsa.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:16.560
And just be able to throw those
elements together very quickly

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.260
so that you can eat in a
different country every night

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.350
of the week if you've
got-- or every week you

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.340
can sort of shake it up if you
want to use some leftovers.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.085
But when we're in a pasta mood,
we want to have pasta on hand.

00:44:28.085 --> 00:44:29.310
We'll have pesto.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:33.360
We love the combination of
pasta, pesto, white beans.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.240
You know, it's one of
those 10, 15 minute meals

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.490
that you boil up the pasta--

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.670
sometimes even authors
who write about food

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.010
don't want to be
that ambitious to do

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.989
a recipe that takes an hour.

00:44:45.989 --> 00:44:47.030
You just want something--

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:48.321
OK, I want something delicious.

00:44:48.321 --> 00:44:49.500
I want it in 15 minutes.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.110
The combination of the pesto
and white bean and pasta

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:52.960
is a staple.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.335
And then we throw
in some greens,

00:44:54.335 --> 00:44:56.600
because you want to have some
nutritional value in there.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.230
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
Actually, spinach

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.025
is a huge workhorse
in our kitchen.

00:44:59.025 --> 00:45:00.900
Because with spinach,
it can go into a pasta.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.830
It can go into a salad.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:02.715
KAREN PAGE: It could
go into a curry.

00:45:02.715 --> 00:45:03.470
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
And it's so funny.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.219
Because when I was
looking at this, really

00:45:05.219 --> 00:45:07.640
what made this dish
special is the fact

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.100
you decided to take
it to Thailand.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.600
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
It smells great.

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.930
ANDREW DORNENBURG: But if I
looked at these ingredients--

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.345
KAREN PAGE: Beautiful.

00:45:13.345 --> 00:45:15.720
ANDREW DORNENBURG: --I could
easily turn this into chili,

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.220
you know?

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.090
It's like, this would
be my chili at home--

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.550
squash, greens, mushrooms.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.590
KAREN PAGE: Beans.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:22.530
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
Yeah, beans, and you

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:23.860
can go to a completely
different place.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.066
So the question we'll use
at night is like, well,

00:45:26.066 --> 00:45:27.940
what country do I feel
like being in tonight?

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.835
And sometimes it's a split.

00:45:29.835 --> 00:45:32.210
Because one of us is researching
one thing, and one of us

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:33.210
is researching the other thing.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:34.705
It's like, well, we
have to have couscous,

00:45:34.705 --> 00:45:36.450
because I've been reading
about Moroccan food all day.

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.010
It's like, couscous?

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:38.176
Why would you want couscous?

00:45:38.176 --> 00:45:40.650
You need noodles tonight.

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:44.179
So that's just an easy
question to ask yourself.

00:45:44.179 --> 00:45:45.970
It's like, what country
do I want to be in?

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:47.310
And then it's like, OK,
then you go in and grab

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:48.477
everything you have at home.

00:45:48.477 --> 00:45:49.726
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Super fun.

00:45:49.726 --> 00:45:50.460
Super fun.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.800
So Dede is plating the
demonstration plate up.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.770
And the team behind you is
going to plate up the samples.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.470
What I'd like to do now is to
open it up to any questions

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.139
that we might have while the
authors are here and finishing

00:46:01.139 --> 00:46:01.680
the plate up.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.450
And then we'll have
a quick sampling,

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.400
and then we'll do a
book signing after that.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.816
So if there are
initial questions,

00:46:06.816 --> 00:46:08.190
just start raising your hands.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:10.410
If not, I'll just keep
gabbing, because I don't

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:11.770
have this opportunity often.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:12.469
Yes?

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:13.966
AUDIENCE: My question is--

00:46:13.966 --> 00:46:17.459
it seems quite a
beautiful, nice, big book.

00:46:17.459 --> 00:46:21.770
So any suggestions of-- should
we just start at the beginning

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:24.505
and go through the end, or are
there parts where you're like,

00:46:24.505 --> 00:46:26.930
it's OK to kind of flip over--

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:28.710
KAREN PAGE: It's
totally meant to be--

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:29.230
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
It is designed--

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:30.040
KAREN PAGE:
--flipping through it.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.989
You flip through A
to Z. Anything that

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:34.030
catches your attention,
it catches your attention

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.630
for a reason.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.310
I think flipping through
it is the absolute best

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:37.185
way to read the book.

00:46:37.185 --> 00:46:38.544
You can read it chronologically.

00:46:38.544 --> 00:46:40.210
It's laid out in a
chronological manner.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:41.420
But you don't have to.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.900
I would say, pick it up
whenever you need inspiration,

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.080
and we wrote it to be
there for when you do.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.580
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
So the question,

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:51.227
just repeat it for the
audience that are on video is,

00:46:51.227 --> 00:46:52.810
is there a starting
point in the book?

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.295
And I think you
captured it great--

00:46:54.295 --> 00:46:56.170
there could be, but
there doesn't have to be.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.495
And I think that that would be
the same for many of the books

00:46:58.495 --> 00:46:59.078
that you have.

00:46:59.078 --> 00:47:01.462
Is I literally was in
"Culinary Artistry"

00:47:01.462 --> 00:47:03.920
just a few days ago, not because
of the fact you were here,

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.225
but I had some questions
just around ingredients

00:47:06.225 --> 00:47:08.570
that I needed to write for
a menu for the Montana then.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.340
And I needed a
little inspiration.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.238
And I was not feeling
creative at the moment.

00:47:12.238 --> 00:47:13.552
I'm like, help me, Karen.

00:47:13.552 --> 00:47:14.870
Help me, Andrew.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:17.120
And so you can definitely
use those books any time

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:17.662
as resources.

00:47:17.662 --> 00:47:19.203
And I think what
you're going to find

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:21.790
in this one is you can do that
even more so, because there's

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:26.320
so much good stuff in here with
all the chef tips, the quotes.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.640
Amazing.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.737
Additional questions
from the audience?

00:47:30.737 --> 00:47:32.570
In the front, and then
we'll go to the back.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:32.890
Yes.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:34.056
AUDIENCE: Question for Dede.

00:47:34.056 --> 00:47:35.940
How did you season the
roasted vegetables?

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.840
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: How did you
season the roasted vegetables?

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.690
DEDE SAMPSON: Yeah,
just a little bit

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:40.270
of olive oil, and
salt and pepper.

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:41.500
So it's really simple.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:47.430
That way you could really
take this base dish here

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:48.710
in a variety of directions.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:52.510
So if I was feeling more
Mediterranean today,

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:56.536
I could have done lemons
and feta or Parmesan and--

00:47:56.536 --> 00:47:57.880
or some champagne vinegar.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.220
Maybe some basil.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.160
So keeping your sort of--

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.550
my core road map simple--

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.510
plus we have leftovers.

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:08.590
Today is Thai.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.644
Tomorrow can be Mediterranean.

00:48:10.644 --> 00:48:11.935
And it's like a whole new dish.

00:48:11.935 --> 00:48:14.170
KAREN PAGE: That's how we season
at home for the exact reasons.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:15.760
You want the
flexibility if you want

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.920
to be in a different
country the next day.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.690
If you season it
upfront with something

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.120
that's very identifiable
with a specific cuisine,

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:22.810
you're going to
have-- you're going

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:25.290
to stay in that country the
next day and the next day

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:25.580
until you use it up.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:26.960
ANDREW DORNENBURG: But the other
thing we do at home-- sorry--

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.580
is we never call it leftovers.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:30.332
We call it encores.

00:48:30.332 --> 00:48:31.290
We're having an encore.

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.020
It's like, oh, we are?

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:33.520
Yeah.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.204
You just sell it a
little bit, you know?

00:48:35.204 --> 00:48:35.745
But I think--

00:48:35.745 --> 00:48:36.800
DEDE SAMPSON:
Planned-overs, right?

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.290
Planned-overs.

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:37.600
KAREN PAGE: Planned-overs.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.265
ANDREW DORNENBURG:
Planned-overs.

00:48:38.265 --> 00:48:38.710
DEDE SAMPSON: Yeah.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:39.820
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
What's really interesting,

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.141
and to add your question, is--

00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:42.640
I know what you're
getting at, which

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.412
is what do I need to do
to get to that end result?

00:48:45.412 --> 00:48:46.870
And you know, you
could use butter.

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:47.930
You could use oil.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.000
It doesn't really
matter at this point.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.680
You obviously chose oil
because it's neutral

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.850
and it's a little lighter fat.

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:54.266
But what you've done really
well in this is the technique.

00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:56.050
You've found a way to
dice these in a way

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.130
that they're a consistent size.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.390
So they're going to cook evenly.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.130
You found a way to brown
them off so that they still

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.421
have texture and caramelization,
but they're not mushy,

00:49:02.421 --> 00:49:03.340
nor are they crunchy.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.506
These are the things that
make or break a great meal

00:49:05.506 --> 00:49:08.290
and take a little bit of
time to think through.

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:09.976
But nice job on that.

00:49:09.976 --> 00:49:11.350
There was a question
in the back.

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:12.520
And we're going to
repeat the question

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.603
just so we can get it on--

00:49:13.603 --> 00:49:15.960
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
how you approach--

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.470
ANDREW DORNENBURG: So what's
the entire process like?

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.060
KAREN PAGE: What's the
entire process when it comes

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.590
to the research for our books?

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.450
And this one in particular--

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.940
for this book, we
had both a bottom-up

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.280
and a top-down approach,
where the bottom-up approach

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.480
was basically talking to
chefs about what they felt

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.030
was important to know about
their creative process,

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.320
about how they cooked.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.300
And all of them have
different specialties.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.020
Some of them have different
countries that they specialize

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.710
or different techniques that
they specialize in, something

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:46.990
that roots their cuisine and
makes it different from anyone

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.770
else's.

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:50.350
And so we wanted to
understand, from talking

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:54.580
to Kyle Connaughton, a single
thread about his influences

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:58.660
in working in Japan and
that Japanese sensibility

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:03.220
that he brings to his food in
conjunction to the crazy stuff

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.580
that he's doing with
Heston Blumenthal

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.690
and that he'd learned at El
Bulli, working at El Bulli.

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:12.464
So he sort of brings
it all together

00:50:12.464 --> 00:50:13.630
in a really interesting way.

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.680
Other people like Rick Bayless
from Frontera Grill in Chicago

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.360
is much more specialized
in Mexican cuisine.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.130
And so we wanted to
really understand that

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:22.060
by talking to Rick.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.550
We talked to his
chef de cuisine.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.920
And we really wanted to
understand their approach

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.360
to thinking about things.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.520
And the beautiful
thing about it is

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:34.600
that when you talk to people who
are the best at what they do,

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.880
they've been doing it, in
some cases, for decades.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.110
And that creativity is
reflected in an evolution

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:43.090
that their cuisine goes through,
the evolution of their thought

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.650
process, where they're
designing a new menu

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:48.160
and had brainstormed
a list of adjectives

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.320
that best described
certain dishes.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.860
So they organize their menu
not by appetizer, entree,

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.750
and dessert, but
by characteristic.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.890
So it shows the level of thought
process that they put into it.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.610
They also use inspiration
by different paintings

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:05.570
and different works of
art in their restaurant.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.260
They will come up with dishes
that are a reflection of that.

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:12.880
So the research is extensive
in terms of speaking to chefs.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.990
We also do extensive research
on restaurant reviews,

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:19.060
trying to understand
their restaurants

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:21.590
from a local
critic's perspective.

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:22.760
We review their cookbooks.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.980
We review their menus.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:29.780
And then we kind of put it
all together and kind of

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.960
bring it all together.

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:35.060
We also studied
creativity from the point

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.120
of view of various
experts on creativity.

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.985
So we spoke to experts like
Michael Gelb, the author

00:51:39.985 --> 00:51:41.360
of "How to Think
Like Leonardo da

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.920
Vinci," and "The
Art of Connection"

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:49.147
on how do you really bring
those elements of creativity?

00:51:49.147 --> 00:51:51.230
What are the things that
we should be looking for?

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:54.530
And he has identified some
of the key genius thinking

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.210
attributes of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:58.910
We saw them in the world's
most creative chefs.

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:02.690
And so I think through that
opportunity of really bringing

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.910
the two together,
we saw how chefs

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:07.070
were the perfect
exemplars of some

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:10.070
of the best creativity that's
going on in the world today.

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:12.860
And to really take a look
at their best practices

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.660
and really try to
translate that for anyone,

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.980
whether it's a professional
chef or a home cook,

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:22.160
to help you to be more
creative when you least feel

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.271
the inspiration to be creative.

00:52:24.271 --> 00:52:25.520
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Excellent.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.370
So we have one or
two more questions.

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.620
So one thing that I'm
taking away from this,

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.830
and I'm hoping you are
as well, is the thought

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.940
and intentionality,
depending on whoever

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:37.430
you are that's creating
something, is immense.

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:39.960
And when you are preparing
your next meal or when

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:40.960
you're at a restaurant--

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.650
I would say when you're
preparing your own meal

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:44.108
or someone else is
cooking for you,

00:52:44.108 --> 00:52:46.280
specifically at home,
turn off the TV.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.780
You know, turn off
the distractions.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:51.410
And take a few minutes to really
be mindful of the experience

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:53.000
that someone else
has prepared for you

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.110
or that you've
prepared for yourself.

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.820
And the reason I mention
that-- and this is in the book

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:56.630
as well--

00:52:56.630 --> 00:53:00.200
is music and other
distractions can either enhance

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.170
or completely detract
from the experience.

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:05.600
And knowing the
thought that went

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.360
into just something
as simple as a salad,

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.020
and it's just not
a simple dish--

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.394
and it was delicious,
by the way.

00:53:11.394 --> 00:53:12.370
That roasted mushroom?

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:12.680
DEDE SAMPSON: Right?

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.180
Yes.

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.270
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: That
was like the winning hook

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:18.860
there that got me to go for
the next bite was the mushroom.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.882
But think about that as
you're creating things.

00:53:20.882 --> 00:53:22.340
And have a conversation
with people

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.615
when you're cooking
for them, because this

00:53:23.615 --> 00:53:24.750
is what it's all about.

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.583
And the reason I mention
turning down the TV

00:53:26.583 --> 00:53:29.130
is it's so easy just to be
mindless and just, you know,

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:30.347
it's not dining anymore.

00:53:30.347 --> 00:53:31.430
It's just kind of feeding.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:32.860
And we all do that at times.

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.840
But thank you for all the
work that you've done here.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.400
Was there another
couple questions

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.260
before we line up
for signatures?

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.137
Yes.

00:53:40.137 --> 00:53:41.512
AUDIENCE: Holidays
are coming up,

00:53:41.512 --> 00:53:44.893
and we have some big,
very traditional meals.

00:53:44.893 --> 00:53:47.308
Do you have any advice for
how to inject creativity

00:53:47.308 --> 00:53:48.760
into those occasions?

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.080
KAREN PAGE: Great question.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.900
You know, a lot of times
it's very personal.

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.360
The holidays are times that
we typically get together

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.610
with family or
friends, loved ones,

00:53:57.610 --> 00:54:00.350
and there's a lot of childhood
memories that are involved.

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:02.500
Andrew and I, our families
had different stuffings

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.499
when we were growing up.

00:54:03.499 --> 00:54:06.460
So now we have a multiple
stuffing celebration

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.050
this time of year.

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:10.572
But a lot of times, you
know, there's a sacredness.

00:54:10.572 --> 00:54:11.530
You don't always want--

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:13.840
creativity isn't
always a good thing.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.100
Daniel Ballou says if
you're making steak frites,

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:17.260
you let it be steak frites.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:19.620
You don't want to get
too creative with that.

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.320
Sometimes there is sacred
cows or sacred turkeys

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.261
when it comes to
Thanksgiving that you

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:26.260
don't want to mess with.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.926
If you want to have
a happy Thanksgiving

00:54:27.926 --> 00:54:30.010
and have it be as
peaceful and calm around

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:31.420
the table as possible,
you don't want to mess

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:32.670
with people's favorite dishes.

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:34.270
But there are times
that you can take

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.120
what the essence
of Thanksgiving is,

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:41.640
and if you can deconstruct, what
is it that's important to you?

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.060
Well, I want to have a
pumpkin dessert on the table.

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:45.810
It doesn't have
to be pumpkin pie.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:46.940
And then you can
start playing with it.

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:48.440
OK, am I going to
do a pumpkin tart?

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.680
Am I going to do
a pumpkin ravioli?

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.390
Am I going to make
it a side dish?

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:53.660
You know, how am I
going to play with that?

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:55.660
Am I going to come up
with a pumpkin cocktail?

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.400
So you can have--
you know, there's

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:03.130
a place in New York City where
we had a turkey sandwich that

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:06.260
was served with a bag
of sweet potato chips

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.482
and a cranberry fizzy drink.

00:55:09.482 --> 00:55:11.440
And you realize all the
flavors of Thanksgiving

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.023
are right there, but they're in
a completely different format.

00:55:14.023 --> 00:55:14.954
If you can take the--

00:55:14.954 --> 00:55:16.870
figure it out, you know,
do the deconstruction

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:20.130
of what are the flavors
that mean Christmas to you

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.900
or Hanukkah to you or
Thanksgiving to you

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.010
and narrow them down.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:26.051
And it's like, OK, well,
I have to have stuffing,

00:55:26.051 --> 00:55:28.710
or I have to have gravy,
or whatever your thing is--

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:29.210
sorry?

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:30.130
DEDE SAMPSON: Or champagne.

00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:31.480
KAREN PAGE: Well,
always champagne.

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.270
Always champagne.

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:33.040
Right.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.290
So you can play with that.

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:37.824
We have an exercise in the
beginning of stage three

00:55:37.824 --> 00:55:40.240
in the book where we ask you
to think about what your five

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.575
favorite childhood dishes
were and to really analyze

00:55:43.575 --> 00:55:45.200
the information that's
packed in there,

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.741
because we think
that all of you know

00:55:46.741 --> 00:55:48.190
more than you think you know.

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:50.440
And it's all packed in your
favorite childhood dishes.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.840
So if you take a minute and
just sort of make a mental note,

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.381
it's like, oh, yeah, my mom's
blank or my grandmother's blank

00:55:55.381 --> 00:55:58.390
or my father's blank when
he pulled up the grill

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:00.320
and made this for me
when I was growing up.

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.130
Figure out what those dishes
were and then think about what

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:04.940
made the dish special to you.

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.550
So for me, it was
caramel apples.

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:09.109
And you'll see a caramel apple
example of different dishes

00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:10.900
you can make with the
combination of apple,

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:15.250
caramel, and nuts that are other
than a whole apple on a stick.

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:16.700
So we've got a salad example.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.945
We've got a cocktail
example, different desserts,

00:56:19.945 --> 00:56:22.570
you know, an upscale
dessert example, using

00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:24.280
that same set of
flavor affinities,

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.990
or flavor chords,
as we called them,

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:27.200
but in a whole different way.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.770
And if you take that simple
example and you apply it

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:31.480
to whatever your
favorite flavors are,

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:36.670
whether it's tomato,
basil, and Parmesan cheese,

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:40.430
or something completely
different-- garlic, ginger,

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.560
and soy sauce--

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.440
you can take that set
of compatible flavors

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.410
and apply it to a whole
host of different dishes.

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:50.350
And that will get your
creativity going very quickly.

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:54.030
ANDREW DORNENBURG: I would
just add one more thing.

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:56.800
We'll use Thanksgiving,
because that's a biggie.

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.140
When you make your cranberry
sauce, take half of it

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.340
and make it a different way.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:03.310
So have the one that's going
to make everyone happy--

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:05.416
it's Thanksgiving,
for God's sake--

00:57:05.416 --> 00:57:07.540
but maybe take another one
and look up cranberries.

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:08.710
Think about cranberries
like, you know,

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:10.293
I think I'll pop
some ginger in there,

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:13.630
or maybe a little turmeric
or a little orange zest.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.840
And that might not be
your family's typical one,

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.680
but then you'll
have something new.

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.010
And we went vegetarian
five years ago.

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:22.510
And we were invited
to Thanksgiving.

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:23.200
So guess what?

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.210
I learned how to make
mushroom gravy that year.

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.030
And now going on
five years, I'm still

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.610
working on mushroom gravy,
mushroom gravy, mushroom gravy.

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:31.660
So again, just add--

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.840
you know, have the
classic thing that,

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.560
again, makes everyone
happy, but then

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.060
just throw in a
couple extra dishes.

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.280
And, like what's two extra
dishes at Thanksgiving,

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.020
you know?

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:43.130
You sort of point it
out, like, this is new.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:44.669
And that's also a
fun way to do it,

00:57:44.669 --> 00:57:46.210
because also, it'll
give you a chance

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:48.079
to sort of chill out
around Thanksgiving,

00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:48.870
make something new.

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:50.950
You're already in
the kitchen anyway.

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:52.391
But just do half.

00:57:52.391 --> 00:57:53.640
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Excellent.

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.610
Well, I know we're at time.

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.860
I know there's more questions.

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.430
What I'd like to do is
first give both of you

00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:58.970
a huge round of
applause for coming.

00:57:58.970 --> 00:57:59.570
Thank you.

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.070
KAREN PAGE: Thank
you for having us.

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:03.820
[APPLAUSE]
