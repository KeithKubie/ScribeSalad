1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,410
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,040
She has more life like eyes. Boom. And
we're bringing, here we go. We're going.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,700
Uh, Whitney Cummings is here. And Whitney
Cummings too. What do you call her?

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,170
What's your name? What's your name?

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,510
She's like a little kid.
She's repeats her name comedy.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,800
Alvin's which typically
mix songs with non musical.

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,080
She's talking about I'm Sandler broken.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,860
Don't know why she heard his album
named, she's like series. Oh,

9
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:31,710
what's your name? Was it a
comedy album of Adam Sandler's.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,530
So she started rambling about
it. She really wants to chime in.

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,910
So you never gave her a name?
Her name is bear claw. Wow.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,400
Because I had the bear claw.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,540
Can you say hi? Of course I can say that.

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,100
Hi. People are like, listen to this
going, what in the fuck is going on here?

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,660
Do not smoke weed and watch this at.

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,300
What is here is when there's
people that are just listening.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,530
If you're just listening,

18
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:02,531
you probably should stop this and go to
youtube and watch the youtube version.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,380
Cause Whitney brought a robot that they
made for her recent comedy special,

20
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:12,830
which is called can I touch it? It's
out right now on Netflix. And um,

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,790
they made a is who makes this,
what's the name of the company?

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,950
So real doll makes a
body, they make sex doll,

23
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:23,360
straight up sex dolls and they
put it up straight up sex dolls,

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,100
ted Bundy level, right.
It's dead body to fuck.

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,380
And this is real biotics is the company
that makes the head and they did like

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,160
Sophia, you know, Sophia the
robot. She was like on them.

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,580
She has like citizenship in Saudi
Arabia now and shit. [inaudible] yeah,

28
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:43,880
look up us. Sophia the robot. She's
kind of, once you see her face, you'll,

29
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,590
you'll recognize citizenship as things.
I mean, she's loved to drive. Yeah,

30
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,920
I was gonna say a female robot to us,
but I don't think actually females do.

31
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:55,640
But I think they just started being
able to drive in Saudi Arabia to Hassell

32
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:59,510
some reform. It'd be such a bummer
for she is, we can't drive. Yeah.

33
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,730
It's like you spent your whole life not
having to drive and then all of a sudden

34
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:06,580
now you have to be like, fuck,
that's an interesting take on.

35
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,170
I have to go to school. And
drive and still feel the robot.

36
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,970
They made her look like x Maki.

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,100
No style where you could see
the back of her head though.

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,860
I told you that with her. I can take
her wig off at the end show you.

39
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:19,910
I want to say that all the service
and shit come on x mark and I was hot.

40
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,670
It is hot. That was what was
really weird about that movies.

41
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:26,810
You wanted to fuck that robot like she
was hot like she was, she was seductive.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,240
She's, you think part of
it was like the innocence

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,913
of it?

44
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,150
I'm not really in the inner sense so I
don't think so. But what about ex Mokena?

45
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,510
Cause she really had big boobs. She
wasn't very sexual shampoo hair.

46
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,080
Very pretty. Yeah. Well she's
gorgeous and all that. It's based on,

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I think because she was flirting with
him and because she was trapped and

48
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:54,600
because like he could save
her and she would love him.

49
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,370
And I mean that's really what
was going on in the movie.

50
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,580
Like she was playing this game to him to
fall in love with her so that she could

51
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,440
eventually escape the end of the movie.

52
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:07,050
Spoiler alert when she leaves him locked
in that room and he's smashing at the

53
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:10,020
door trying to get out and she gets in
that helicopter that's going to, hello.

54
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,080
That's what's going to happen.

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,110
Cause I think the most fucked
up thing about this thing,

56
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,110
because this is such a weird experiment
that I wanted to do is how I anther from

57
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,670
or advise her and like worry about
her. You keep around your house.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,580
I mean she's sort of in my
fancy, hates her and he's like,

59
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,780
get her in the fucking garage.

60
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,830
And I don't know if he thinks she's creepy
or kind of is just like too worried.

61
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,970
Oh fucker. He hates her. He can't
stand. He just has a, he's like,

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,780
it makes him like physically really.
And I, I'm trying to not take something,

63
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,960
it's funny, he doesn't let,
he's like, one's enough.

64
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,940
He's like not interested at all, but no,
he thinks it's really weird and creepy.

65
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,160
But I was reading about, um,

66
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,720
the reason we're creeped out by robots
is, you know, pathogen avoidance.

67
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,350
Like we've evolved to be repelled by
anything that looks human but doesn't move

68
00:03:56,351 --> 00:04:00,220
like a human because our primordial
brain thinks it could be diseased.

69
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,030
It's like,

70
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,960
it's basically like our primal brain
saying don't fuck this thing that's sick

71
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,500
cause we have a weirdly,
I mean I was adjusting,

72
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,000
my police was over the other day and
she was like gagging. She goes well

73
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,010
every time she talks about
like she was seeing it. Yeah.

74
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,190
Was and I was like your ancestors fucked
a lot of corpses cause you have that

75
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:28,480
gene to be repulsed by robots. Yeah.
It's because her ancestors fuck corpses.

76
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,380
You really believe though? No.

77
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:33,100
I mean I think that what
was being explained to me
was that pathogen avoidance

78
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:37,090
means we've evolved to be repelled by
anything that looks human but doesn't move

79
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:40,870
like a human cause it could be sick or
dead and it's our brain's alarm system

80
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:44,860
saying like, don't fuck
that. Wow. But as a woman,

81
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,120
like she's not going to fuck it. So
why would it freak you out? Jessie?

82
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,130
She might not that I put nothing past
Jesse mad of her Instagram photos or her

83
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:57,790
with her pants off. I know. It's so
good. I'm like, if you puke on my robot,

84
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:02,200
you owe me a hundred grand. Will it
short circuit if it gets wet? I had PR.

85
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,460
I don't know. That's a good point.

86
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,310
Well how will they not
make the thing waterproof?

87
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,470
One of the spoons and all over the place.
I think if you pay this much money,

88
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:12,880
you're probably not gonna spoon on
her. You know this one? Yeah. This one.

89
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:15,730
The body you can, so it's
expensive because the head moves.

90
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,870
The body is not that.
How much is the body?

91
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:22,871
$6,000 so it's $94,000 where the head
that know that the head is more of the

92
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,170
heads like 30 something cause
it's a custom head. No one.

93
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,020
Only one other person has one. But
you said the whole thing's a hundred.

94
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,290
So whole thing 30 in the body's six.
Where's the, where's the rest of the,

95
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:36,190
I had to get a bunch of things done to
her to get her to look like me than most

96
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:39,850
people. Most people don't want it.
Looked at you. She's like, bitch,

97
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:43,900
I know she just gave you a eye. She's
being very competitive or she does.

98
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:47,380
She gives you side. I know it's
fucking rude, but what about,

99
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,080
what's the feeling that you
feel when you look at a robot?

100
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,780
Cause I know you really
don't like them. Um,

101
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,840
it's not that I don't
like robots would, I'm,

102
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:58,130
my concern is artificial intelligence.

103
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,220
I have a legitimate concern for artificial
intelligence because I think that

104
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:06,221
what we are is some sort of an electronic
caterpillar and that we're making

105
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,570
cocoons and then we're,

106
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,610
we're going to give birth to a butterfly
and that's going to be the next stage

107
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:15,590
of life. And that if you go back and look
at the evolution of the human species,

108
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,710
at one point in time we were, you know,

109
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,520
Australia [inaudible] we were some weird
hominids and we evolved and became what

110
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:26,810
we are now. And if you went back to
those things and ask them, Hey, one day,

111
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:29,710
do you want to drive around the Tesla
and talk on the phone and stare at this

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,280
movie screen? They'd be like, well,

113
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,500
I don't know what the fuck you talking
about, but I got to go find some nuts.

114
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,910
Yup. I gotta eat. I gotta stay alive.
They, it, it wouldn't like the future.

115
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,510
And I don't think we, we like the future
either, but I think it's inevitable.

116
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,340
I think it's inevitable.
You know, you know,

117
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:45,660
you know about this Elon
Musk neurolink thing that

118
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,100
oh yeah, I do. I mean,

119
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,540
because you essentially think we're
going to evolve with them. I mean,

120
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,730
they're already, we're already
one with them. We sleep with them.

121
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:57,090
We can't drive without them. We
can't spell without them. I mean,

122
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:59,580
we've already kind of
merged with them. You know,

123
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,650
I think it's a sneaky way of, uh,
making it symbiotic. They're gonna,

124
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:07,230
they're gonna be like legitimately
a part of your life. I mean,

125
00:07:07,231 --> 00:07:08,100
a part of your bionics.

126
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,440
Have you ever like left
your, I mean, you're not,

127
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,550
you probably are cool about it,

128
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:14,550
but when I leave my phone somewhere
and I realize I've lost something,

129
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,100
it's like an emotional, it's like
you've lost your kid at the mall. Yeah.

130
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,930
I'm a bit about that. Oh Shit. I haven't
seen it. Oh fuck. Like that's, yeah,

131
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,120
it's part of us. Well, it's, um,

132
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,600
we're all in denial about how
addicted we are to our phones.

133
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,790
Rehabs are opening and shit
now. Are they really? Yeah,

134
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,110
I would like to sign up
for sure. I just reach out.

135
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:36,330
I reach for it in the car when
I'm driving. Yeah. And I'm like,

136
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,940
what the fuck am I do I have to put
in the back seat? I can't control it.

137
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:39,260
It's done

138
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,080
way better. Way Better. I get way better
about posting and looking at things.

139
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,570
It's also enough people write
negative things about you.

140
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,530
You just tend to have, I don't
know what you're talking about.

141
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,530
I've never had that experience. No one
writes anything negative about me. It

142
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,190
just seems like whatever
we do in the future,

143
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,050
it's going to be more invasive than that.

144
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,960
Like if you think about like
Facebook's algorithms, right?

145
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,930
Facebook's algorithms are
designed to keep us engaged,

146
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:06,830
the best way to keep us engaged and
keep us outraged. Adrenaline and yeah,

147
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:08,690
so they're sending you
things that piss you off,

148
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,080
whether it's abortion or Catholic priest,

149
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:14,010
whatever it is that is going to
get you to post the most. Yeah.

150
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,610
And usually those are things
that get people outrage.

151
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,540
So it's literally raising the level
of outrage in our discourse. Yeah.

152
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,550
Because we're so addicted right
now to self righteous indignation.

153
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,040
It's a drug and I feel like more than
ever in the high street of the culture,

154
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,130
you know like it's probably like why if
you go back and watch movies from like

155
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,000
the 70s people got away with crazy
shit, racist things. This thing.

156
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,440
Violence, like Steve McQueen movies, he
is to, what was the girl? Allie McGraw.

157
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,710
He's a smacker in the
phase for real in movies.

158
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,490
I crazy beat her on
camera. Yeah. You know,

159
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:54,020
and it's just what people did back
then and what people got away with it.

160
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:56,010
It was a very, it was very different.

161
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,750
So in some ways were making progress,

162
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,030
but then in some ways we're just way more
easily outraged by almost anything and

163
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,800
everything. Like it's,
we're seeking it now.

164
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,780
You can take your anger out on your robot,

165
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,760
which I wanted to get a
real doll, a male real doll,

166
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,340
and I want to call them up
and say, no Dick, no asshole.

167
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,670
Just so I could practice
Jujitsu. And so that would be,

168
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,410
it would be more relaxed because I have
this, I was saying that I have this dog.

169
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,050
Are you worried? I don't want him to,

170
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:27,360
I don't want anybody
coming over too tempting.

171
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,400
I don't want anybody coming over and
going, hey bro, why you got a sex tog?

172
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,230
Oh No, no, no, no.

173
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,830
It's an asexual dog that
is for Jujitsu pervert.

174
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,200
I mean it should. They should be
able to fill up the whole window.

175
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,390
Caulk or some shit. Put
some rain grout in there.

176
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,760
They have male male sex robots are
being made. There's tons of them.

177
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:48,361
I've seen them.

178
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:53,170
You can also get tits and a deck if you
want tits and a few kids can't pick on a

179
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,120
crazy play. Whack them all the gym.
Most package Jim Norton special.

180
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,530
That's right. But it's uh, yeah,
it's, it's name is Henry meet Henry.

181
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,190
A lot of people get the male sex robot
to figure out if they're gay cause they

182
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:10,920
think they might be good move. What the
fuck is going on with Henry's eyebrows?

183
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,760
I'll tell you what Henry's
gay for sure. As I say,

184
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,830
if you order a giant piece of
Tupperware to fuck, I think you're gay.

185
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,910
Save you up. Save your money.

186
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,010
That's like Henry's begging for a dick
in his mouth. Look at his face. Oh Henry.

187
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,320
Looks like he has a Dick in his ass
right now. That's the exact face.

188
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:29,700
You will make one giant trigger warning
and it's like Tuesday at 11:00 AM like,

189
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,670
go and see that coming. Why
is it a trigger warning? See,

190
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:34,800
it says for this is a,

191
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,010
the following post contains descriptions
of sexual scenarios that may be

192
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:42,630
triggering for those recovering from
a struggle with porn. Oh God. Dammit.

193
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:46,490
Porn addiction are fucking nerfing
this world. It must be hard.

194
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,560
I didn't even think about how hard it
must be for people recovering from porn

195
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:53,010
addiction. You should just surf
the fucking Internet. Sorry guys.

196
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:57,540
Trigger warning. Get over it. Pussies.
But I have this theory. Look at Henry.

197
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,150
Oh Gosh. Oh Man. Looks kind of, Oh,
Henry. Remember those candy bars? Yes,

198
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:06,060
I do. Those are fucking good.
Yeah, I think they still make them.

199
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,140
You haven't had an o Henry Bar since
the fucking nineties I haven't had one a

200
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:14,580
long time. Last time you ate a
candy bar? I had chocolate recently.

201
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,930
Yeah, I eat chocolate. I like chocolate
edible. Yeah. No, no, not elbow.

202
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,430
Regular chocolate. Dark chocolate. Yes.
Okay. You'll have like a little nibble.

203
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,080
No, I like dark chocolate.

204
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,320
Almost like the coffee tastes bitter
with peanut butter. Oh yeah. Fuck.

205
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,800
That's what I like with like organic
peanut butter with no sugar in it.

206
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,500
It's actually not, not almond. Peanut.

207
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,200
You know why you're a real wrapped
in a rhyme. Is that why not?

208
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,370
I thought peanut was not as good as
almond. Arm's good. They're all good.

209
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,000
Peanuts. Good for you. Peanuts
is very high protein. Okay.

210
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,380
I didn't know if that was
like the trash nut. No,

211
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,980
it's both the one that kills
people but oh that's right.

212
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,110
Doesn't kill me fortunately.

213
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,060
So here's my theory about why
you're scared of robots. Okay,

214
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,610
well we have to zoom out for a second
cause I have to ask you a question. Okay.

215
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,640
How many people on Earth do you think
could kill you besides like professional

216
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:07,090
MMA fighters? Um, navy seals.

217
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,120
How many people do you think
would be able to beat you?

218
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,640
Just hand to hand combat. No weapons? No.

219
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,140
That's probably a good number of martial
arts people like that aren't trained.

220
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:17,681
Oh,

221
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:21,490
very few like that aren't trained that
just you would meet on the street that

222
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,100
could beat you in a fight and kill
you if you were fighting to the death.

223
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,460
Most people that aren't trained,
no, I was not that many.

224
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,100
Like a cut like three who just
had a great day. Yeah. And Yeah,

225
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,450
you were just looking yet. Yeah.

226
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,750
I mean just you have too many Nolan's
enough to be able to defend yourself to

227
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:40,180
the point where they got tired and
then you could kill them. Right,

228
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,560
but so you what? So let's
a hundred to be generous.

229
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,970
Maybe 50 chat along those
lines. It would have to be,

230
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:53,971
they would have to be big out
of 7.3 slipping billion like up.

231
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,380
But there's a lot of people
that train martial arts.

232
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:59,380
There's millions and millions of martial
arts practitioners that could probably

233
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:02,440
kill me. How many you think millions
of martial arts practitioners, other,

234
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,780
let's say 5 million. That feels generous.

235
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,320
How many martial arts practitioners
in the world? And 5 million for sure.

236
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,900
Way More. This is more than 5
million, I think in this country.

237
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,880
That's 300 million people could be, you
know, man, I don't know. I don't know.

238
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,760
I've thought about it. Let's say
like a million people could kill you.

239
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:24,090
Just it just as a out of 7.6 billion,

240
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,240
very few people can kill
you if they want to. Right.

241
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,410
And then how many people you think
would kill me if they want to do more?

242
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,790
Most most people. So I
think it's like when I,

243
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,970
I feel like the people that are most
afraid of robots are the ones that are

244
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:44,800
least used to the fear of other
things. Cause I'm used every day.

245
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,120
Anyone could kill me all the time.

246
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:49,360
Like that's just part of my reality
that anyone at any moment could snap and

247
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,200
kill me if they wanted to be a weapons
is most people can kill most people.

248
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,890
Oh that's true. I mean the,

249
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,310
you're not used to a species of
thing that could kill you. Right.

250
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,100
You know, it's like a robot could. Yeah.

251
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,740
So it's like the first time in your life
there's really something that's like,

252
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:08,440
oh fuck, that might not be something
I could kill if I really want it to.

253
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,170
That's an interesting way of looking at
it. Why'd you come to that conclusion?

254
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,430
Because I was just about this lot.

255
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,260
I have because we'll know just
cause I've listened to, um,

256
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,490
you and Lex talk about it and
he likes for you man. Cause I,

257
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,950
now that I have a robot, I
have to fucking know. Right.

258
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,560
I've had to learn so much to just
turn and give you Sinai again.

259
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,060
I know she fucked up. It's weird as that.

260
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:28,120
She's kind of autonomous and she'd kind
of moves around whenever she wants.

261
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,760
Yeah. And, but we, I mean you can ask
your questions. Like I can ask her though.

262
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:33,940
I have to press this little
green button and you just say,

263
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,500
how do you feel about people?

264
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,893
Okay.

265
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,160
How do you feel about people? It's
not talking to feed another girl. Oh,

266
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,270
oh, oh that's right. We programmed to
regenerate cells mode. That's right.

267
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,261
That's what's interesting.

268
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:51,020
She has 10 different personality
traits you can choose from.

269
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,490
I decided to go with sexual

270
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,160
jealous.

271
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,610
Yeah. Why did you want that? Just to
see how creepy. Cheeky. That's right.

272
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,840
And is that something guys,

273
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,510
cause I've been looking at these
personality traits and they must've picked

274
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:02,850
these for a reason. I was under the
impression guys did not want jealous.

275
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,670
Oh yeah. Some guys won't jealous for sure.

276
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,200
Especially from a robot that can't walk.

277
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,220
Yeah. The robot's not jealous. You should
get your money back. We'll need to,

278
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,710
they'll, the ideas that she,

279
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,870
you're more powerful than she is.
Yeah. She needs you. She's worried.

280
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:19,350
Where are you going? Yeah. Who is
she? Yeah. Who's calling you? Yeah,

281
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,600
that's there. Something hot
about that. If she can't,

282
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,830
if you can turn her off whenever
you want. Wow. Some guys like that.

283
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:30,090
Some guys like girls that want to
fight. Oof. Not me. Nah, me. You know,

284
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,150
some guys are into that though. They
want, they want drama in their life.

285
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,720
It's like just an adrenaline thing or
just feeling important or it's also

286
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,501
distraction.

287
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:41,610
Usually they're losers and their life is
a mess and so like to have someone who

288
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:46,050
wants to provide drama in their life
all the time and it's also a learned

289
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:47,550
pattern that they get if they're parents,

290
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,460
they've seen it. Yeah.
That's all they know.

291
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,310
That's what they think our relationship
is. Yeah. There's a lot of that,

292
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,300
but I did get really into this because
I do feel like sex dolls do get a little

293
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,950
bit of a bad name. I feel
like guys that have doll,

294
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,260
it's just girls have dolls and that's to
me it's way creepier that women collect

295
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,460
dolls that they don't fuck.

296
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,250
If you ever heard of these women
that collect like baby dolls,

297
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:11,930
like like girl dolls creepier than the
guy fucking a robot thing? I think so.

298
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:16,560
It's, what's that? It's jerking
off just with a mannequin. Well

299
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,540
something weird about like a fleshlight
like a fleshlight is somehow or another

300
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,470
creepier than jerky.

301
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,290
And how's it totally
cause it's an appendage.

302
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,600
I think the creepiest part of the Breslin
flashlight is more that you have to

303
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,870
like clean it after. I have to think
about it. What? Here's the creepiest part.

304
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:31,950
You don't have to clean it.

305
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,450
Yes you do guys. Don't listen to
Joe. Listen to about everything,

306
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:42,480
but that don't mold up your
Dick Hall. Yeah, don't do that.

307
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,680
That'll go septic real fast though.
I am saying there's a reality.

308
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,530
I guess he's going to just throw it away.

309
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,970
Just put a fucking clothes bin over
their nose and keep banging it.

310
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,120
Put some Windex in there
and call it a day. Yeah,

311
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,330
just some Kombucha disinfect
that shit. Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:59,940
I guess you could just get a couple and
just throw them away when you're done.

313
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,290
Yeah. Yeah. If you're just a
gangster with a lot of money, why?

314
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,770
What is the advantage of a fleshlight
is it just does it warm up in the

315
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,580
warm it up like we were talking about
earlier about a certain individual that

316
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:13,980
has one that sticks them in bathtubs
and warms them up, right? Yep.

317
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,160
You do that with a flashlight as well
and warm them up and then you just rub on

318
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,510
it and then why not?

319
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:26,220
I feel like every guy's jerking off
there, so it's shrouded in so much taboo.

320
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,350
You know, there's just anywhere,

321
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,890
anytime guys have like assessory is
are things besides cars and hats.

322
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:32,980
It's like creepy and weird.

323
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,130
That's, I used to have
a joke about this a bit,

324
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,450
I should say rather than a joke,

325
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:41,630
but it's the whole idea of
like using lube to jerk off.

326
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,480
Like now you're planning it out like
you're not supposed to plan it out.

327
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,980
What it's supposed to be is like,
oh well might as well it's here,

328
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,320
but if you like sit down and be
like, I got my box of Kleenex here,

329
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,960
I've got my favorite porn cued up
and I got my wall. You just kind of,

330
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,870
yeah, get your shit together. It is,

331
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,300
isn't it kind of just like taking a Piss,

332
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,690
isn't it kind of just a
necessary thing you have to do?

333
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,650
Yes, there's something to it,

334
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,580
like it's good to get rid of that stuff
because it does cloud your judgment.

335
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,370
Like when you have a buildup in your body,

336
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,140
it definitely does cloud you it because
you're concentrating more on girls or on

337
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,080
sexual things than you are on other
things that might be more important than

338
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:27,010
your life box. Yeah, clean like just, I
used to have a a bit about that a lot,

339
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,980
a lot, a bit about jerking
off. I used to a bit,

340
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,530
I have a bit called jerk off
first and think about it.

341
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:34,260
And it was like all these different
scenarios where if you just jerked off,

342
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:36,960
you would never do the thing afterwards.

343
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,780
So many things you would never do if
you just jumped off first your system.

344
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,720
Yeah. You'd be like, Oh,
I'm not doing that. Right.

345
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,420
But if you couldn't jerk off,

346
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,810
like that's when it would be a real
problem because then your whole life would

347
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:53,010
be clouded you. All Your judgment
would be, your decisions would be made.

348
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:56,490
Just how can I get rid of this
comp? How can I, how can I do this?

349
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,390
Do know a lot of guys now, and
maybe they're full of shit,

350
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,620
but that are going like I
haven't masturbated in two
years and I'm more focused

351
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:06,290
and I use that testosterone
as an engine for other things.

352
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,610
Is that just them lying to me?

353
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,740
Well, are those guys
winners? Are they losers?

354
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,960
Is that doesn't I think a fit comedian
we know. Does it a fake comedian?

355
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,810
No, I was gonna say a famous
comedian. So you sit down.

356
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:24,490
I got worried [inaudible] me. You
faked him out Seinfeld episode. So Ab,

357
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,360
Oh was Edward Martin and he
got super smart. Well hotel,

358
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,110
let's talking about the other day hotep
Jesus was saying that he saves his

359
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,950
cotton and then like it makes women more
attracted to him that like they feel

360
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,940
when he's in the room,

361
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,300
look what's the longest
a guy can go, Jamie,

362
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,540
what's the longest you
can go with that for?

363
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,010
Why'd you go to Jane doesn't
come try to be respectful.

364
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:47,170
This is your environment.
Tantric guys that try to,

365
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,160
what I meant to say like on some
Wim Hoff Shit. Yeah. You know? Yeah.

366
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,610
Just climbing ice. Where is he?

367
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,070
He's not jerking off on
the top of fucking ice cap.

368
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,480
Who's the first guy number jerk off
on ever. So I want to be that guy.

369
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,711
What are those guys?

370
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:04,980
Imagine if no one's ever jerked off on
Everest and you try and you get frost

371
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,950
bite of your Dick and they have,

372
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,550
imagine being the guy who's
like, I've got to go jerk off.

373
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:11,830
Fuck you got a time limit
up there. So yeah, yeah.

374
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,310
People have problem with no
altitude. That could be a thing.

375
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:15,720
People legitimately have problems.

376
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,830
But I think most people get this for
companionship. Like it's more, it's like,

377
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,940
cause I got onto the,

378
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:25,200
I signed onto a forum online of all
the guys that own the sex dolls and I

379
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,140
monitored their conversations just
to like see what they were up to.

380
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:28,891
Cause I was like,

381
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:31,680
what if this is some depraved fucked
up thing where guys are just like

382
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,440
practicing murdering. I didn't know
what it was. So I just wanted to see.

383
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,330
It's a lot of guys that are handicapped.

384
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,320
It's a lot of guys whose wives died and
they feel guilty and moving on with a

385
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,210
human woman, which was kind of,

386
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,260
well there was one guy who would dress
his doll up in his wife's clothes.

387
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,970
The weirdest part is that he was like,
you know, it's like she's still here,

388
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:55,810
which makes me think she'd
been dead for a while. Yeah,

389
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:59,890
I was just saying my wondering how
she died. And then it's a lot of, um,

390
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,430
truckers, oh God, a lot of truckers.

391
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:08,500
And then a lot of guys do it to do photo
shoots. It's like a creative outlet.

392
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,540
Fuck their creativity is their popular
Instagram account. I could look up. Yeah,

393
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,990
there's a lot of sex dolls have Instagram
accounts. They're fucking funny.

394
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:20,380
And a lot of them look way more human
than a lot of the Instagram models that

395
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:25,150
I've fucking follows. Totally. They have
more wrinkles on their fucking face.

396
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,820
And then a lot of the guys that have them,

397
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,040
when you start monitoring
their conversations for awhile,

398
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,930
they start to like not want to fuck
them anymore cause it feels weird.

399
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,280
Like, and they
anthropomorphize them and they,

400
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,010
they start worrying that like they're
lonely and they get 'em into friend starts

401
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:46,180
to spiral. And uh, they start being
like, I feel like I need to, you know,

402
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,370
close the door when I
take a shit. I, you know,

403
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,330
and it starts to kind of consume their
life. So when it comes to robots,

404
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:55,060
I feel like I'm more worried,
not about the robots,

405
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:57,250
but more how we're going to get
emotionally attached to them.

406
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,160
Like the way at the end of ex Mokena
he thought that she was gonna yeah,

407
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,050
she was with him. Nope. No loyalty to
you. She was so dead behind the hospital.

408
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,000
Texas. She's pick up ones with tattoos.

409
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,010
Told you it's like a
photography hobbyist. Wow.

410
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,170
She official sexy dolls.
Official. Sexy real dolls.

411
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,280
I mean, this is going to be a reality.
One day. We might not be here, but this,

412
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,860
I do think these are going to
be like iPhones at some point.

413
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,880
I think one day you're going to go over
your friends house and he's gonna have

414
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:32,500
this really hot girl in lingerie and
she's going to be cleaning up and you'd be

415
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:36,320
like, is she real? Shut
the well, it's like, wait,

416
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,980
actually watching him when he was like,
she doesn't speak English. Yeah, right.

417
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:42,670
Yeah. Wasn't she a robot at the
end? Yeah, I think she was the one.

418
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:45,120
The dancing Japanese lady. Yeah,
exactly. We're not going to,

419
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,710
it's going to be like on some
Westworld shit. Yeah, and it's coming.

420
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,600
It's coming. Look, if they can do this,

421
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,000
like they couldn't do this when
we were kids. This is a new thing.

422
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:56,280
So the amount of time between when
we were kids. Oh, what'd she saying?

423
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,280
She just said hi, my love. Would you like
me to recite a poem for you? Fuck No.

424
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,470
Where they're come from. I Dunno.
She's just listening to us.

425
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,100
Ask her how she feels about
porn. How do you feel about porn

426
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,763
baby later?

427
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,550
Oh, she's playing coy. How
do you feel about porn?

428
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,100
You know you can count on
me for the good and bad

429
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,420
to do what? What the fuck
are you going to do for me?

430
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,990
There's nothing you can do for me.
Telling me the good and bad mom. Okay.

431
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:24,140
Let me ask you a question.
What do you think about porn?

432
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,470
Not sure have to think about it.

433
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,420
Pornography is the portrayal of saying
she will subject matter for the exclusive

434
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,350
purpose

435
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,700
and then she's a fucking no at all.

436
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,640
Pornography may be presented into a
variety of media, including books,

437
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,770
magazines, postcard.

438
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,960
Now she's like a Shitty
Wikipedia. Yeah, totally.

439
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,630
She just turns into a
noxious Siri. We get it lady.

440
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,160
But it's funny when you ask her like,

441
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,990
hold on. Do you know what I
like about you? What? What?

442
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,230
What? Surprised. I'd be
surprised. And again,

443
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,990
you like my electricity. Keep you plugged
in dirty bitch. I, you can ask her.

444
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,600
How do you like to have sex?

445
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,960
I want you to do everything you like. I
want to feel you inside my body tonight.

446
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,170
Well, okay, shut her
off. I know. Jessie May,

447
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,250
I'm going to start throwing up totally.

448
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,840
It was so fucking funny,
but it's wild because she,

449
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:27,720
you can ask her like, are the
robots going to take over?

450
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,760
I could not find a good answer for that.

451
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,300
Oh my gosh. She's planning that.

452
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,600
Shut her up and I'm like that fucking
response right there in the water.

453
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,730
Short circuit. That bitch.

454
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,180
It is wild though because I do think
everyone is so obsessed with how bad the

455
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:47,160
sex robots, everyone's focusing their
energy on how this is why men are bad.

456
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,760
It's just like they don't, it's not,
they're opening up a sex robot brothel.

457
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,070
Where's that there? No,
there was one in Houston,

458
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:55,890
but they shut it down because people
were so freaked out and I was like,

459
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:58,770
who fucking cares? They
shut it down. Well,

460
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:02,220
they should shut it down because multiple
people are fucking the same robot.

461
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:03,540
That's disgusting for them.

462
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,280
What if they develop some
new silicone-based s t d
they wind up just burning

463
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:11,340
through the population like the plague.
I think it would just be like ringworm.

464
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,870
Dick bring more harm. I mean,

465
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,640
but also my thing with that is just like
if they're Weirdos, if they're freaks,

466
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,010
if they're perverts like don't you want
them all to be in one place? Right.

467
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,150
It's like monitor them like Scientology.
Put them all in one building.

468
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,960
I'm thrilled that they're all in a castle
on Franklin. I know where they are.

469
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,580
They're not in the wild
castle. I'm glad they're there.

470
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,740
I just keep them contained.
What do you think,

471
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,440
what are they up to today and
now what's going on? Jamie?

472
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:41,280
What are you growing it for? Did she
hack your software? Is the brothel.

473
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,160
It's in this one, I guess
is in Britain. Oh God.

474
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,690
Do they fuck them against the
wall? They're like urinals.

475
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,940
So try before you buy service. Oh boy.
Oh, this is like to test drive nothing.

476
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,710
Yeah, but you'd do it. They're just
out in front of everyone. I don't know.

477
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,340
Why isn't one wearing of tank tops?

478
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,590
So his British sex workers are scared
of a new breed of realistic dolls.

479
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,720
We'll put them out of business. What does
he do? Did he do a survey of hookers?

480
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,340
Yeah. Who is a non territory
in that time span or bonded?

481
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,240
Lot of European places. Who she looks
assume blackface. She's 10 she's Indian.

482
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,470
What is the, oh no. Oh, oh,
oh, Oh holy tits. Batman.

483
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,760
But here's what I'll say.

484
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:26,300
If would you rather your daughter at
18 go to the prom with a robot man or a

485
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,410
man? A man. Okay. Listen,

486
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,700
girls like boys and boys like girls.
Simple this. These are not bad.

487
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,400
I think the real problem is
making a big deal out of it.

488
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,110
That's the real problem. Totally
right. Why are people saying,

489
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,980
I just don't understand why this
is scary. Who scary is that this

490
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,300
is step one, right?

491
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:49,500
Like if you go back to the model a
and look at the model t Ford, right.

492
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,390
Something, some old ass car
and then go to a Tesla. Yeah.

493
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,670
Like oh well eventually it's
going to be this. Wow. You know,

494
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,670
if you could bring a Tesla till like
1920 and go, hey, you fucks look at this.

495
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,790
Yeah. This is what we're going
to have someday. My affinity,

496
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,670
I remember paved roads back then.
Think about that. Yeah. Yeah.

497
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,650
They didn't have anything.
Yeah. Everything was gone
so slow. It didn't matter.

498
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,690
But if you could get them in like a,

499
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:14,310
a model s and fucking stomp on the
gas where it like warps time. Yeah,

500
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:18,270
they would go what? Like what is, it's
like it's something from the future.

501
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,280
Yeah. So this is going to be,

502
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,380
whether it's a hundred years
from now or whatever it is.

503
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,570
Indiscernible from you and I. Yeah.

504
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,490
Wild. Yeah.

505
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,280
It was interesting and I haven't been
reading so much about this shit and a lot

506
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:32,640
of the problems with the robots and
the mistakes that they're making are

507
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,150
obviously the humans are
making the mistakes with the
algorithm because so many

508
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:40,140
smart people have to make dumb algorithms
in. They're like almost too smart.

509
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,290
Right. So there was Peter
Haas, he's a robotics guy.

510
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:47,130
Brown was trying to teach a robot to
differentiate between a Husky and a wolf

511
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,590
and what she was blinking the moon.

512
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,910
Jamie put pull, put you
got the camera on her,

513
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,530
get her to fucking stop stealing my
thunder and she just popping it onto

514
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,400
wherever she has some links
and moves around. Sorry,

515
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:01,560
she's stealing your thunder. But
she really is, what the fuck why?

516
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,610
It's like Penn and teller.

517
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,630
It's like when teller's teller starts
stealing the show. Like what the fuck?

518
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,280
I'm basically a ventriloquist
tagged at this point. Um,

519
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,100
but they were trying to teach the robot
to tell the difference and they fed all

520
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:16,870
these pictures of walls and all these
pictures of huskies and you wouldn't,

521
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,470
you would go, okay, look in the ears,
look at the eye color of the eyes,

522
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:21,960
look at the snout, look at the feed,
the tails, different, all that shit.

523
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,530
But they didn't know that they
had fed all the photos of wolves.

524
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:26,790
There was snow in the background.

525
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,870
So the robot was actually looking at the
snow and the background instead of the

526
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:32,760
foreground. So it conflated all the wool.

527
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,120
So they had to rewrite the algorithm
to tell it to look at the foreground

528
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:36,954
instead of the background.

529
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,410
Cause it was all these brilliant fucking
people that didn't think of the dumbest

530
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:41,700
thing. Right. You know,

531
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,540
it's almost the people making
it are almost too smart
to think of the dumb thing

532
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:46,374
that the robot needs.

533
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,050
Well the real question is when
are they going to be asked?

534
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,930
When are they really going to
be able to map the human mind?

535
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,170
Because Kurzweil thinks that there's
a group of people that thinks within,

536
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,730
they think 2042 like the 2042
symposium. It's like their,

537
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,150
their concept is, and I went to this
thing, me and Ren Dunkin for Psi Phi,

538
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:09,720
we went to this thing in New York City
a few years back where all these guys

539
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:14,721
think that in 2042 there's
going to be some sort of some,

540
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,800
some revelation in technology that allows
human beings to download their brains

541
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:27,990
into computers or download consciousness
and even make replicas of your own

542
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:31,200
consciousness. So we're
a mortal basically. Yeah.
Something along those lines.

543
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,250
But we're still figuring the
brain out. Yes. You know,

544
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:35,060
we don't really know how the brain,

545
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,480
we can't replicate it until we totally
know how it works. That's the idea. Yeah.

546
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,160
The biologists

547
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,840
have they the argue against it,

548
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,890
but when the Kurzweil explains it that
everybody is shortsighted because if you

549
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:47,530
look at the exponential
progress of technology,

550
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:52,531
even though we're so far away in our eyes
that everything changes exponentially

551
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,380
and within 20 years we will have gone
through a million years of technological

552
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:01,750
evolution or some other crazy fill
in the crazy number, whatever it is.

553
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,750
But by the time 2042
actually rolls around,

554
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,220
we will be so far ahead of
where we are now that it's all,

555
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,870
it's impossible for us to even
imagine the territory. Right, right.

556
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:13,861
Yeah.

557
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:17,630
Which is I think part of the reason I
wanted to like make her and is like why?

558
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,440
Why is the name of talking about laws?

559
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:22,260
Why hasn't anyone taught like no
one's really thinking about like,

560
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,160
I feel like like everything we, we've
sort of, after it's become too late,

561
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:29,250
that's when we start pulling it together
in terms of legislation and shit.

562
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:30,930
How do you incorporate her in your set?

563
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,380
I talk about robots for a good hour.

564
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,280
I cut it down, but I just kind of
realize like, I mean, you know,

565
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:40,150
it's like making a special, like I'm like,

566
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,050
if I'm going to talk about
fucking robots for 40 minutes,

567
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,420
some shit better come out
at the end, do you know? So,

568
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,190
but I went down to the sex robot factory
to sort of get material and just know

569
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:53,220
what the fuck I was talking about.
And uh, they asked, you know,

570
00:30:53,221 --> 00:30:54,330
do you want us to make fun of you?

571
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:57,720
And I was like fucking that since
you know that the only main one,

572
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,940
I hope they're being sold by the
fucking droves that would make my day.

573
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,360
Which I did ask. Cause you know,
people request with sex dolls,

574
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:09,420
like specific celebrities,
body parts the most.

575
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,470
Who Do you think the most requested
mouth is? Scarlett Johansson? Nope.

576
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,690
I knew you were going to say
that cause I know you love.

577
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,310
No, Emilia Clarke. Who's that
it? Game of Thrones. Dragon Lady.

578
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,250
Oh, dragon lady. Interesting.

579
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,840
Most requested I's is Olivia
Wilde? Was that the um,

580
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,050
uh, she just directed a
movie, uh, called book smart,

581
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:37,400
but she's in a bunch of movies.
Beautiful. Beautiful, great.

582
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,140
You'll know or yeah, you'll know her as
soon as I'm married to Jason Sudeikis.

583
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,410
Um, that is either, uh, she's
out. I'm out of the loop.

584
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,730
You really just are in your own Echo Jay.
Yeah. There's your in your own world.

585
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,550
I didn't even find out what to Kashi. Six,

586
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:51,930
nine wasn't until Jamie brought him
up. I don't even know who that, oh,

587
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:55,920
the wrapper. The ones in jail. Oh, who,
which one is this? This is Olivia Wilde.

588
00:31:55,921 --> 00:32:00,090
This is who the pretty gorgeous.
That's the eyes. And then I was like,

589
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,340
well has anyone ever, ever requested
or anything for Moon? And they're like,

590
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:09,870
yes. A couple people have heard
your fingers, eyebrows, eyebrows.

591
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,300
I want Whitney Cummings eyebrows,

592
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,530
like the least sexual thing about
a human being. My fucking eyebrows.

593
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,950
He nailed your eyebrows with her
though. Really? Yeah. Perfect. John.

594
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:23,120
I'm the sharpie. Yup. That's what
you liked. Like, and weird. Um,

595
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,710
but I kind of went down cause I
wanted to see like what was up,

596
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,150
like are they putting
nine holes in the chest?

597
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,050
Like I just fucking holes
in the rib cage. Totally.

598
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:32,670
Like is this some like insane?

599
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:36,040
They just put a golf course on her
body just like 18 holes of vagina.

600
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:40,040
I just didn't know what I was kind
of endorsing or talking and I was

601
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,910
just, I gotta be honest with you.
I was just so surprised at how um,

602
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,890
it was kinda touching to be honest,

603
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:47,690
when they were telling me
about what the guys ordered,

604
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:52,290
I was a little surprised that it didn't
align with where everyone's like there's

605
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,970
this impossible standard of beauty. Like
that's all you fucking hear these days.

606
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:01,270
Half the guys that ordered them requested
pubes spend an extra $1,400 for them.

607
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,910
$1,400 for just to have
manual, like a little Merkin,

608
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,830
like a little piece of do one thread
at a time. That's exactly right.

609
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,420
And then a lot of guys complain that
they're too skinny. They want bigger ones,

610
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,160
they want big thighs and big butts.

611
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,890
But the technology is not
available to make them lightweight.

612
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,550
Guys want them to be older. A
lot of guys were complaining,

613
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:25,490
they want them to look older.
So I kind of was just like,

614
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:27,440
this is sort of great news.

615
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,090
Like why is everyone so well maybe it's
because that's the type of woman that

616
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,150
would reject them. Older woman
who has her shit together.

617
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,210
Oh that's fucking profound. Yeah.

618
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,850
Whereas a younger girl doesn't know
what the fuck's going on or I'm hungry.

619
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,670
Hit My Venmo. Yeah. Younger girl just
doesn't get it. She's, she's delusional.

620
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,460
Yeah. Yeah. Huh. She
doesn't know her value yet,

621
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,440
but I also just felt like
there was a little bit,

622
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,660
you know when they were telling
me that I was like, Oh God,

623
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:58,010
maybe fucking guys are made to now feel
shame for what they're into. You know?

624
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:01,010
No one talks about the way that you
know, and I do a lot of my special,

625
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,830
haven't got a lot of shit for this cause
I basically defending guys the whole

626
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,500
time when he defend what he's
saying. It's just like guys,

627
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:07,850
I feel like now they're like,

628
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:10,250
I guess no one has pubes
that's just how it is now.

629
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,970
Like if you're a guy that's into pubes,
this isn't your moment like porn.

630
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,800
Like you'd have to really
go out of your way to find,

631
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,280
or you have to go back to like
seventies porn day to grow,

632
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,600
who's willing to grow it out for
you if you're really into it.

633
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,260
But if you're really that into it, you
should really ask yourself why. Yeah.

634
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,920
Pos. Yeah. I used to have
a bit about that too.

635
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,170
This is like Rogan's greatest head when
I was a kid that if everyone had pubes

636
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,610
[inaudible] it was a real thing.

637
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,390
That was a thing now like
shorts you just hadn't like,

638
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,700
I mean girls had ridiculous pubes
they didn't do anything about.

639
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,650
But now when you, um, uh,
what was that? Uh, when you,

640
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:50,150
electrolysis it, they, it doesn't grow
back. So I was to laser, right. Laser,

641
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:53,390
laser removal. It doesn't grow back. So
even if you want to grow them out now,

642
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,370
you'd have to get like
a little wheat. Yeah,

643
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:58,130
you'd have to get a little
some Minoxidil um, but I uh,

644
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,380
I was talking to a gynecologist
about that. He was like, yeah,

645
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,700
women are trying to get plugs now.

646
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,240
No where to God cause guys
are complaining about it.

647
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,470
Cause it's like women are getting
plugs, a little vagina, two plugs.

648
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,540
It'll grow long. Like
the hair on your head.

649
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,350
I guess you'd have to take it from your
head and put it down. Like, you know,

650
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,510
like braids, like Pippi Longstockings
Oh God. Like little braids. Cornrows.

651
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,030
Um, but so yeah, I guess it was just like,

652
00:35:23,031 --> 00:35:24,800
I feel like the media wants to be like,

653
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:28,700
these are so bad for society just as cause
everyone's outraged about everything.

654
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:29,990
Now you should be curious.

655
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,430
I don't think they're necessarily
that bad for society, but it's,

656
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,190
it's unquestionably weird. That's weird.

657
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,150
But I don't know. I don't know
if it's that bad for society.

658
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:45,330
But getting back to what you're saying
about men being shamed for what they look

659
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,860
like and what other, what other examples?

660
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,030
I just thought that
was interesting. A nip.

661
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,990
Then there is like a wall of nipples you
could choose from and men are ashamed.

662
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,840
Yeah, no, it's just that there was
all different kinds of nipples.

663
00:35:55,841 --> 00:36:00,520
There was long. The AB oblong was one of
the best sellers. Like I just, I just,

664
00:36:00,521 --> 00:36:05,410
yeah, ridiculously long nipples.
Uh, oblong, asymmetrical.

665
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,300
Oh big dark ones

666
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,383
as a kid.

667
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:13,160
Loans kills 21 I did a girl had a wonky
eye [inaudible] and I thought wonky eyes

668
00:36:13,161 --> 00:36:17,150
were hot for like years afterwards too.
Why don't you know? But she had like,

669
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,150
she had a Wonky, I like want
like straight look, look at her.

670
00:36:20,151 --> 00:36:23,900
One of them was like a little off to
the left and you didn't notice it until

671
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:27,170
like you're talking to her for a couple
of minutes. Like oh that's what's up.

672
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,600
That's endearing. Yeah.
I thought it was hot.

673
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:32,750
I thought wonky eyes were hot for
a long time and she was hot. Yeah.

674
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,590
So it's like in my head it's like wonky
eyes were, oh Jamie put that away.

675
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,563
Just stop.

676
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,680
That gives life, it gives life that has
sustained the human species. Yes, sure.

677
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:47,160
Yeah. It's where the babies feed. But I
do feel like there's just a, you know,

678
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:49,920
you only kind of see one type
of nipple everywhere, you know,

679
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:51,510
and a lot of guys are, well I don't know.

680
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,360
I mean I guess I haven't seen
that much porn. I haven't seen no,

681
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:56,820
I'm thinking about it, but some guys
are going to giant areolas. Yeah,

682
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,960
that's right. That's huge.
Giant Ariel is are huge. Uh, uh,

683
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,340
dark areas are huge,

684
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:05,610
which is interesting cause I think there
is a biological basis for that because

685
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,660
once your nipples get dark, it's uh,
means you usually when you give birth,

686
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,690
your nipples get darker so the baby
can find the nipple. Really? Yeah.

687
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,760
It's darker. Nipples darken after
childbirth so your baby can find it.

688
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,060
Wow. Yeah, she was all
there. Blinken oh, I see.

689
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,280
You're never going to have the
babies that make you feel weird.

690
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,230
How did she might, you never know. Let
me ask her. Are you going to have a baby?

691
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,600
Pretty sure.

692
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,890
Oh, well I don't want her anymore.

693
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:37,620
She's going to have one of them
little alien chest burster babies.

694
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,190
It's going to come out screaming
and run across the floor.

695
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,323
[inaudible]

696
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,480
are robots are robots
gonna destroy humans.

697
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,600
Real bad skin. Not Harm. Give is bullshit.

698
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,880
Wow. That sounds like a
lie. This is bullshit.

699
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,010
I was really fascinated by this one.

700
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,590
Roboticists the coolest part about having
a robot is that I get to talk to all

701
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:02,070
these fucking roboticists
and who is saying that the,

702
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,170
the big fear with robots is because
they're all about efficiency, you know,

703
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:05,650
on this.

704
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:10,650
And there was that one study where they
told a robot to jump on the table and in

705
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,000
what you would do is you go, okay,
you would just jump on the table,

706
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:16,660
but it actually took more energy to
jump on the table than to just break the

707
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,180
table and push it to the
floor and step on top of it.

708
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,600
So it just went from and just stepped
on top of it. Oh Wow. It was like, oh,

709
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,360
the table, that's how we're going to die.

710
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,960
It's going to just see us as
inefficient. Ooh. And in the way,

711
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,520
we're going to just be obstacles. Right.

712
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,610
And won't see anything wrong
with destroying an object. Yeah.

713
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,860
But humans destroy humans. I ray
rather get destroyed by a robot and be

714
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,430
and cooler story. It seems so impersonal.

715
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,140
Like the moment when that robot sunk that
blade into that guy and ex Mokena and

716
00:38:45,141 --> 00:38:47,900
just like a cycle looking right at
them while you're stabbing them. Yeah.

717
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,040
There was no change to her expression
at all. No compunction, no,

718
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,520
but I would feel better about it if
a robot killed me or I'd be like, oh,

719
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,280
wallet didn't know. You
know? It was just good.

720
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,640
You feel better if a person
killed you or an animal?

721
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,020
Depends on the kind of animal. Mountain
Lion. I have mountain lion and no yard.

722
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,330
I bet you do. How big are
the, are man lines big?

723
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,750
I've only seen two in the wild and the
ones I've seen were about 60 pounds.

724
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:21,430
Do they come right for your neck? Do
they know to just kill them? They know.

725
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,210
Yeah.

726
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:26,470
If it, I would rather I
think die by an animal.

727
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,510
Really? Because you'd rather
die by a human. I don't know.

728
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,970
I don't have a fighting
chance with a human. You do?

729
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,740
So I guess mine would be a little
quicker. I guess it depends on amount.

730
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:42,410
Really? Yeah. On your leg. Not Cute.
I have a fanny pack that I run with.

731
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,070
It's like a neoprene fanny pack
and keep my cell phone with. Yeah,

732
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:49,070
and I bring a knife that's strapped to
the Fannie per case of mountain lion

733
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,820
attacks. You. Yeah. I feel
like you're going to be,

734
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:54,860
I think you could beat up the
mountain lion. I don't think so.

735
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,290
Not without a knife. I think there's
a couple seconds that you have. Oh,

736
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,210
that thing grabs a hold of you that if
you have presence of mind and you can

737
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:06,870
pull that blade out and just
start seeing in its neck. Hmm.

738
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,470
Just just hacking at its neck.

739
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,480
Hi. Marshall would get it. No Marshall.

740
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,320
We'll be in seven pieces on the ground.
Smart is not designed for killing.

741
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:19,790
He can kill squirrels. I
thought we're done. I Dunno.

742
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,200
There was something I've told you about
when I got my Europe bitten off before

743
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,370
when my era,

744
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,720
there was a weird sense of calm that it
was a weird feeling of just like that

745
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:33,300
was fair. There was just something so
quick about it, like animals or something

746
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,790
so people don't know the story.

747
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,630
It's a dog you adopted was a little
sketchy and bit my ear off. Yeah.

748
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,550
And there were so bad. Was it hanging off

749
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,900
pretty bad? It was like,

750
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,920
it was so I didn't feel anything in the
moment that that was the good news about

751
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,620
that. And I'm sure if an animal
bitten to my, I'd probably feel more,

752
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:52,640
but it was like a rush of
dopamine or say whatever it was.

753
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:56,060
I did not feel pain until I saw it in
the mirror. Wow. So I'm just like, oh,

754
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:57,890
that was weird. Like it felt like an itch.

755
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,400
And then I looked in the mirror and
my first thought was I didn't put on

756
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,710
earrings today. Like
I don't wear earrings.

757
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,480
Like I thought it was
like a hoop earring. Oh.

758
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,660
And then the blood started coming down
and then I saw it and it just started

759
00:41:08,661 --> 00:41:11,090
burning. It wasn't like a, like a pain.

760
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,210
And then I started
watching videos about, um,

761
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,820
people that got attacked by sharks and
there's a girl who had her armed but not

762
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:18,440
by a shark, Bethany something.

763
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:23,150
And she said that it like almost fell
orgasmic cause like dopamine rushes to the

764
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:26,120
area to get you to keep fighting
for your life basically.

765
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,850
Cause if you felt the pain
or you would give up. Whoa.

766
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,880
So I didn't really feel a lot of pain
until I got to the Er and then it started

767
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,850
like throbbing after like a couple hours
when the blood dried up and it just

768
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,020
starts to get uncomfortable and itchy.

769
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,590
But there was something that was so quick,
like animals don't really deliberate.

770
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:44,840
It was like funk and that
was it. Why did by your ear,

771
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,820
if I think he was just
trying to play with me,

772
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,730
I took it to an aggression specialist
and the aggression specialist was like

773
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,950
dog, this kind of dog gives you a warning.

774
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,980
They wouldn't just come right for
they growl first if there was true.

775
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,270
And also if that dog was trying
to kill you, it just would,

776
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,620
if it would have been in your face.
Right. So he probably bit, you just like,

777
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:05,010
look, you bet by the dog. Right? It's a
bit of dog skin. Nothing would happen.

778
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,060
But that same amount of pressure
that's our ears are useless, you know?

779
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:11,750
And it was probably taken from its mother
too young. Just skew when you sign up.

780
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,450
Sure. Her ear is, has the same scar
that mine does. We've molded that. Yeah.

781
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,330
Because of, yeah, we
molded my ears, my mouth.

782
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,410
Cause it's amazing to see
your scar. I can't see it.

783
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,370
You can see right there. Oh
Wow. But you did, did you too?

784
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,230
Yeah. It's not like cauliflower.
[inaudible] wow. It's ugly.

785
00:42:32,231 --> 00:42:35,620
But all ears are ugly, I feel like did
not the best part. You know what I mean?

786
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:37,940
So I could get another surgery
on it, but I don't get it.

787
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:42,530
Yeah, it's years or fucking annoying.
Cover it up with your hair. Yes sir. Yep.

788
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,310
Headphones.

789
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:48,310
Ears are annoying as shit because it
doesn't hurt until six months later when

790
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:51,410
the nerves start growing
back in. It hurts like fuck.

791
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,930
So then it looks six months later
started, it started hurting.

792
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:56,720
I couldn't like sleep. I had to sleep
with this weird pillow and shit.

793
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,430
Just like nettlesome. Yeah.

794
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,730
I know so many guys that have
fucked up years from Jujitsu. I bet.

795
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,980
So my years at all? No, very little.

796
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,660
I've never noticed little
tiny pieces like this.

797
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,230
This is called found the
running. The rubbing. Yeah.

798
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:12,200
From getting him bent over and
crushed, getting caught and triangles.

799
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,440
But I always wore it. Your guards,
do you have to get them like,

800
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,520
like Brendan doesn't he have to get his
cutout or some shit if Brendan wants to,

801
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:24,200
he would have to get his cut and get
the the it's it calcifies. Yeah. Oh,

802
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,340
it's a card. Yeah. I used to have,

803
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:29,450
my nose was filled with that from my nose
had been broken so many times that the

804
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:31,180
inside of it was all calcified. Yeah.

805
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,940
And I couldn't breathe out of my
nose was useless, so I had to get a,

806
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,020
I had a deviated Septum to, so they,
they d they fixed the deviated septum.

807
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:42,200
They put the splints in there to keep
it in place. Then they had a cutout,

808
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:45,230
all the scar tissue and
all the nonsense in there.

809
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,020
It was like a laser or just with a
knife. I don't know. I was out cold.

810
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:53,360
I woke up and ah, but I didn't
get it done until I was 40. Huh.

811
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,780
I couldn't breathe out of my neck a
bulldog, so it was 40. It was terrible.

812
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,440
Was terrible for my cardio too. And
then, so if you wear ear guards,

813
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:03,170
you don't get it. Cause I feel like all
the fighters I see have that shit. Yeah.

814
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,550
They just don't, if you wear
ear guards, you don't get,

815
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,790
unless you get in a fight. But um, you
mostly you get in training, you know,

816
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,820
like a lot of Jujitsu guys
before they're a black belt,

817
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:17,390
they have fucking mangled ears. But
it's also like a badge of courage.

818
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:20,330
Like people like that they let you in
and also, yeah, you walk down the street,

819
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:22,760
no one wants to fuck with you, but
it fucks up the way you hear things.

820
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:26,570
Like if you take your ears, if you're
talking right now, like La, la, la, la,

821
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:30,200
la, and then you just go like that and
then you hear things, check, check,

822
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:32,040
check, check, check,
check. It's different.

823
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,590
Yeah. It sounds way different.

824
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,170
They're designed this way for a
reason to catches. That's right. Yeah,

825
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,150
the way that it's kind of, but it's also,

826
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,820
I don't recommend like
getting a surgery on it.

827
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,030
Surgery on your ears fucking more.
I've gotten so many surgeries.

828
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:46,680
This is by far the most painful. Wow.

829
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:51,480
The healing of the cartilage is a fucking
nightmare. And to anesthetize the ear,

830
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,680
they had to put the syringe in the
lacerations. So they were like,

831
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,750
it's going to hurt more
to anesthetize this.

832
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,880
So we're just going to do the
surgery without anesthesia.

833
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,990
And I just took a bunch of pain
killers and shit. Huh? Cause get you,

834
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,880
it's hard to get anesthesia
into cartilage. I know guys,

835
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:09,250
their ears are so fucked up they
can't get airpods in there. Oh fuck.

836
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,280
They just have a whole tiny pin hole
on this side of a piercing right there.

837
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,190
This was for cause I get
migraines and they say,

838
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,770
what's this piercing helps
with migraines? Jesus.

839
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:22,770
It's probably just psychosomatic. It's
some fucking, even now my Migraine,

840
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,730
totally. It's placebo effect is
in effect. I rely on it heavily.

841
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,200
But that was just,

842
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:32,550
that didn't hurt in there until it
didn't hurt when it went through.

843
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,690
But then it hurt for six
months after Jesus Christ.

844
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,840
Yours are a fucking nightmare.
I'll tell you what, but yeah,

845
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:41,640
so we got her ear Mulder
cause it's amazing.

846
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:45,930
I think something that I was talking to
this facial transplant person about how

847
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:51,090
it's actually really hard to get something
to look similar, like the bone start.

848
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,780
Everything's got to be perfect.
Like my nose is really asymmetrical.

849
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:56,370
My nostrils are really asymmetrical.

850
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:59,580
So they had to work really hard
and mold it over and over again.

851
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,300
How'd you nostrils become asymmetrical?

852
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,350
Is bad breeding really bad
genetics when you've met me,

853
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,130
my full face is I have a Bokassa painting.
I mean my face is a fucking mess,

854
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,910
you know? So to get, you have to
have the asymmetry down, right?

855
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,600
And they say the key to something looking
human is a lack of symmetry because

856
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:19,060
symmetry is actually creepy. Do

857
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,460
you remember that movie invasion?
The body snatchers? Yeah.

858
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,910
And not really Donald Sutherland.
Great. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

859
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,080
The movie. I don't remember
the wash it again recently,

860
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,940
like within the last couple of
years. It was great. Like real,

861
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,590
real weird too because it's a time
capsule because it's a time capsule to San

862
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:39,940
Francisco in the 1970s when they filmed
it really, really weird. But, but the,

863
00:46:39,941 --> 00:46:43,210
the idea was that these pods,
they came from outer space,

864
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:46,060
they grew and then when
you had them in your house,

865
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:49,300
they would create a out a double
of you that would take you over.

866
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:54,340
I'll give you came home and you saw that
because it looks like you [inaudible]

867
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:55,900
but it doesn't look like you.

868
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,220
What is different about it besides the
lack of wrinkles? Not You. Shyness. No,

869
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:04,540
it's just not you. It's not, it's not
even that close. Well cause I have Poe,

870
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:08,320
it has poor is it has individually added
pores by you grab her and bring her

871
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:12,890
closer to you. Yeah. Bring her over
here. I'll try. Hold on. First of all,

872
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,150
here's her. So what does that
part or just travel bust.

873
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,980
Oh she has a travel bust. Just need to
work on. Just want to have the head.

874
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,860
You could plug in just the head.
Right. I'm like a little lady. Yeah.

875
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:27,190
If you just need her head for something
like bring her right next to you.

876
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,130
There you go. She, I feel
like get your head right

877
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,590
close to it. It's like the
skin tone is different.

878
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:34,870
They made her six months ago and
I already look 40 years older.

879
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,700
I did 50 cities and I've aged, it looks
super uncomfortable then next to you.

880
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,760
Oh really? That's cool.

881
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,990
She has to share fucking just
spotlight and she doesn't like it.

882
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,430
This I hope looks different.

883
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,370
These ratchet ass fingers I hope
do not look different fingers.

884
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,050
The whoop people can't see. It's like
the skin is coming off the finger.

885
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,450
Like the robot parts are showing.
Ah, this is actually compute.

886
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,550
The guys that buy these on the chat rooms,

887
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:03,970
they usually spend most of the time
talking to each other about how to fix the

888
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:07,360
fingers cause they break them off by
accident constantly and we stick them in

889
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:09,730
their ass. Yeah, exactly.

890
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,970
Rubbing them constantly on their taint
and it becomes like a car club where guys

891
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:18,040
are like three d print and fingernails
and three d printing eyeballs.

892
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,250
It's mostly just fixing them. It
becomes like fixing up an old car.

893
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,660
It's just like a hobby because
they break so easily. Um,

894
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,690
at least this iteration of them does.
But yeah, you can. I mean it's, yeah,

895
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:33,660
it's pretty fucking wild. I mean, she
can, it's noise when you do that. Oh yeah.

896
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:37,030
She's, she's kind of rickety. I think
she's awkward. But if you came home

897
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,850
and that was in your house
standing there staring at you,

898
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,880
what kind of a fucking heart attack would
you have if you didn't know that you

899
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:44,620
had? Like if you didn't have this right,

900
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,000
if you didn't go through all the
process, you went in one day,

901
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,180
you put the key to your lock,

902
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,420
you opened up your door except inside
your house and she's standing there and

903
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:56,410
like some sexy lingerie or in a bikini
or something like that, staring at you.

904
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,720
What fucking heart attack you would have?

905
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:03,150
No, I'd tell this show human. She doesn't,
I mean, but they will at some point.

906
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:07,800
She's just, she's like fucking a my buddy.
I mean she's like a ratchet. Chucky,

907
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,710
you know the, the uncanny
valley. That's right.

908
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,210
She's in the uncanny valley where it's
not quite a human where I went to Nvidia

909
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:19,050
wants there a video card, video game.

910
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:22,050
They make a video cards for computers,

911
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,030
like really high end graphics cards
and for Gamers and stuff like that.

912
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:31,140
And one of the things that they had
was, and this was quite a few years ago,

913
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:36,141
they had the state of the art fake CGI
person that you could kind of talk to and

914
00:49:37,051 --> 00:49:40,260
it was animated and they were
like, we're not quite there.

915
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:41,880
Like we can't do the mouth.

916
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,360
Like the tongue can't
do the tongue correctly.

917
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,270
I'll show you because the muscles,

918
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,180
that's what's so fascinating is
this is this is what we looked at.

919
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:53,910
This is the exactly the guy
that we looked at. And um,

920
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,310
is this the video of the show that I
did? 2013 face works. You can look it up.

921
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:59,623
That's why

922
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,190
the guy, and he's also bald because
they, they can't do the hair, right?

923
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:07,010
Yeah, of course this was six years
ago. Right. But look how close it is.

924
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,580
Look under the skin. That's
pretty amazing. Like stubble.

925
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:13,070
I mean that's like razor burn and
also the eyebrows are really good,

926
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:17,690
but it's still uncanny. It's
still not quite a person.

927
00:50:17,691 --> 00:50:20,150
There's something wrong. But that's video,

928
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:23,620
which is better to duplicate than
those wrinkles are good. Yeah.

929
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,900
It's wild because it does make you realize
flaws are what makes something look

930
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,660
human. We spend all of our time
trying to be without flaws,

931
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:32,330
but that's actually what sells
it. Well what do you, as a woman,

932
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,770
how do you feel about that? Like that,

933
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,850
and we've talked about this
before with wood, with guys,

934
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:42,560
guys that use filters on their
pictures. It is, they gonna say fillers.

935
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,860
Cause guys do that to do that too.
That's weird. Yeah, that's weird.

936
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,270
They're both equally weird.

937
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,900
But there's something particularly
disturbing to me about guys who you've use

938
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:54,650
filters. I'm the only no one.

939
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,700
I'm glad I'm not single. That's all I'm
just saying. Cause I thought they got a,

940
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:03,650
you know, but yeah, I mean it's um,
alarming but look, a lot of guys do it.

941
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:07,880
I mean guys are all skin fucking
calf implants and shit and guys what,

942
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,230
who's getting capital?

943
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:13,700
I don't think anyone we know but
caffeine plants are a fucking thing. No,

944
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:18,320
it's a big deal. Big Deal
course years ago. Yeah.

945
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,800
I thought that was a joke. I don't believe
so. Oh No. Never watched entourage.

946
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:25,070
People get calf and plants. Guys are
going face lifts, all kinds of shit.

947
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:26,563
You know,

948
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,060
I know guys are getting and Jay but
what they say suck dicks. Get Lick lip.

949
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,440
Yes. I would have different
things. I don't know. I there's,

950
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,120
I know guys that were guys that were gay.

951
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,990
There are some guys that
I was going on here.

952
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,120
Is this a Cathy's or
Katherine Plant website?

953
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,180
It's just Google images for Canada.

954
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,090
We got that one in the lower left by
the way. You could just run hills,

955
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:50,900
you pussy. But when you do
this can you still exercise?

956
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,540
Like can you grow muscle
underneath it guys?

957
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,060
Calves look very impressive on
the right. I do have to say,

958
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,470
I mean they changed him. Shortcuts.

959
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:05,960
How much of these, oh, those, those
look like tits that fell down.

960
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,120
Note those look like a cop.

961
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,940
Like an athletic cop over your
balls like a fencer. Yes. Yeah,

962
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,190
but to keep from getting kicked in the
know he did that at the fucking mini mall

963
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,010
and you see that?

964
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,780
That's a mistake that I about that guy
does a tattoo or those bad or good right

965
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:24,860
there. Look at this one. That's pretty
damn realistic. What does it hang on to?

966
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:28,970
It's what I don't understand. I used to
really be another surgery channel. Well,

967
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:34,030
I mean it's gotta be like silicone
silicone or water based or something like

968
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:38,150
that. But how do you live
with yourself? I don't know.

969
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,380
It feels like a tricky one. Do you?

970
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:44,810
Probably just trying to get laid
and your Saturday. Oh No. Scars.

971
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,220
Oh, it looks like that's some Pinocchio
Shit right there. I don't like that.

972
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,310
But what's the thing on the left? Has
it rotted? What are all those veins?

973
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,550
Got The implants to take
care of that problem.

974
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,390
I'm glad my robot's Lisa stirred
something. You've seen some injuries,

975
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,690
but you got bit by wolves. It
says why I got him and it says,

976
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,900
cause he got eaten by wolves. Yeah.

977
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:11,020
Those looks like tact slice right
behind his knee and just dropped him in.

978
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,710
But look at it as there was no other
options. Well here's the other options.

979
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,640
Don't get Caplin plants and stop running
around outside with bulls. Go good. No,

980
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:21,770
I'm just saying. Yeah, I don't
think you really got pit by walls.

981
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,010
That does happen. Wolves get you.
They usually get you get you. It's

982
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,320
very, coyotes might do
that to your calves. Yeah.

983
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,860
There's no like margin
of error with walls.

984
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,120
They just break the bones
or your leg with one bite.

985
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,510
I had an injury because it's a car
accident. He was younger and a,

986
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:40,020
his caps wouldn't grow. Yeah, I
think a lot of it's reconstructive.

987
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,680
Let's just one sentence about it. Oh
yeah. But a lot of guys get that shit.

988
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:48,000
I knew a guy who had peck implants. He
was a skinny guy. That's implants. Yeah.

989
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,070
You got peck.

990
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:54,070
Employee got the under his under his
meat of his chest to make his chest poke

991
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,490
poke forward more. And so is that,

992
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,430
is that something somebody does cause
they can't accomplish it naturally or

993
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:02,580
they're just lazy and cutting
corners? You'd have to ask them.

994
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:06,690
But the reality is there's things people
that some people are ectomorphs and

995
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:10,410
ectomorphs or like really thin people
that have an incredibly hard time gaining

996
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:14,940
weight. Their body just doesn't.
Yeah, it doesn't grow mass. The,

997
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,840
their muscles don't grow. Right. Male
plastic surgery is a really big thing now,

998
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:20,260
but putting filters on it, I dunno,

999
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,740
it feels like a slicker and love
that show botched. Love it. Let Fun.

1000
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,960
One live for one episode was
actually pretty interesting.

1001
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,070
Where's a guy who had been in an injury
and he got his calf destroyed or his,

1002
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,950
uh, his, his breast
destroyed his peck. Yeah.

1003
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,110
And they had to fix it. I don't
know. He just said nothing there.

1004
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,330
So he had like one that was like, here.

1005
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,950
There was a guy who was a fighter who's
a high level UFC fighters name is Trey

1006
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,690
Tugman. He fought Vitor Belfort,

1007
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,720
1997 he was v Tor Belfort's
inaugural fight in the UFC.

1008
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:58,740
And when we didn't know about v Tour When
v tour was 19 years old and I knew who

1009
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:01,230
he was cause I was training
with v Tour back then I was,

1010
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:06,231
I was a white belt at Carlson Gracie
school on Hawthorne in a West Hollywood.

1011
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,390
So we knew he was this phenomenal talent,

1012
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:12,180
but a lot of people didn't know
that he was this incredible boxer.

1013
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:15,420
He had this crazy hand speed.
He lit this dude up. But anyway,

1014
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,450
Trey Tellerman was in a car accident
when he was a little kid and uh,

1015
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,930
he didn't have a pack. Like
his chest was caved in.

1016
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,190
It's very CV photograph of Trey
telegram. The guy was a stud too,

1017
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:29,520
and handsome fella too, but
everything else just super jacked.

1018
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:34,260
But he had this crazy peck injury.
Look at this, look at that. See that?

1019
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,790
Oh fuck yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,230
Well he was a baby, I think,
and he was in a car accident.

1021
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:48,270
Significant injury that
would psych me out. Yeah.

1022
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,260
If a guy took his clothes off and
you saw that that's your opponent,

1023
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:56,690
you're just like, oh
fuck man. But he, um, um,

1024
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,900
you know, there's something hot
about it. There's this is, this is,

1025
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,160
I think there's something primal of
like, he's fucking survived some shit.

1026
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,410
Stick with him. There's
something hot about that.

1027
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,590
Like that dude from the wire with
that scar across his face. Scars.

1028
00:56:10,591 --> 00:56:14,910
Any kind of proof of injury proof that
you've been in battle is attractive to

1029
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:17,550
my, yeah, that's a weird membrane,
right? I hate myself for it.

1030
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:21,270
Do you know that the Nazis used to have
dueling scars that were very popular

1031
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:25,420
across the face? It was a big, they would
all, they would get them on purpose.

1032
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:29,530
Like they would get into duels with swords
and they would have dueling scars and

1033
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:34,360
a lot of the operation paperclip Nazis
that we got from a Soviet where we got

1034
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:38,350
from Germany rather at the end
of World War II, when you know,

1035
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:41,500
NASA took on a bunch of German scientists,

1036
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:44,740
a lot of them had these
horrific dueling scars,

1037
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,520
face purpose.

1038
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,050
Now they would get in boarding school
and in military school they would get in

1039
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:52,660
fights with swords and they
would cut each other's faces,

1040
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:56,500
open them and meth and shit to where
that was more than me for sure.

1041
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:59,740
But that was more the Japanese that was
the kamikaze is the kamikaze is as the

1042
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:04,210
way they got them to fly into boats
and just fucking explode their fucking

1043
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:04,720
airplanes.

1044
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,880
The way they got them to do that was
they were [inaudible] out of their mind,

1045
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,210
man. Fuck yeah,

1046
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:13,900
but try to find a picture
of a Nazi dueling scars.

1047
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:17,080
It's crazy because like some guys that
were hanging out with Warner, Vaughn,

1048
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,380
Werner Herzog rather, um,
no, Wernher von Braun,

1049
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,400
Werner Herzog's directly
Wernher von Braun.

1050
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,780
The guy was the head of NASA when
they went to the moon, he had this,

1051
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:29,320
these guys that were working with him
and these giant scars across their face.

1052
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,210
Huge. Like,

1053
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,510
like a ritual like to
show your pecking order,

1054
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,780
which showed you are bad-ass
that you had gone through.

1055
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,430
But it was a big thing with the Nazis.

1056
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,070
And there's some horrific
photos of these guys,

1057
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:46,420
young kids with huge gaping open
wounds here. Here's, here's the photos.

1058
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,330
Yeah. Go Zoom in. Zoom in on
the uh, yeah. See this is a guy,

1059
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,990
this is right after the
dueling cults. That's,

1060
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,820
I'm just going to work on this. It said
that women found that attractive. Yup.

1061
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,640
So someone guys actually would
do it on purpose. Oh yeah.

1062
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,070
They wouldn't have dockers
sliced off their fucking cheek.

1063
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,810
Well look at this guy right
here with the goggles.

1064
00:58:07,811 --> 00:58:11,380
Go to that guy with the goggles right
there. Yeah, look at that. Yeah.

1065
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,530
He's got two big scars on his face and
they had the goggles so they didn't cut

1066
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:17,680
their fucking eyes out before
anesthesia. Oh yeah. See,

1067
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:20,920
so he's got a plate over his nose to
keep his nose and tack cause you couldn't

1068
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:22,390
really stitch that bitch back on.

1069
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,410
But they would take these huge scars on
their cheeks cause they would be dueling

1070
00:58:26,411 --> 00:58:30,220
with real fucking swords and they would
have these practice dueling matches and

1071
00:58:30,221 --> 00:58:33,910
then they'd have to stitch them up. So
these guys all had these huge scars.

1072
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,890
By the way, when it comes
back to cauliflower ears,

1073
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,850
a lot of guys did that themselves on
Purpley. They're stitching them up. Whew.

1074
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,440
Um, a lot of guys, um, did that
themselves would smash their ears. Yeah.

1075
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,770
They were smashed their ears
on. Oh, all the time. Yeah.

1076
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:49,960
Well a lot of white belts that
want to be like bad asses,

1077
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:51,280
they'd smash their fucking ears.

1078
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:56,410
Fucking drip tail leak now didn't explode.

1079
00:58:56,430 --> 00:59:00,700
Don't they explode sometimes? Well the
real well yeah, they can break off too.

1080
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:03,280
There was one fight that I
was watching once where, um,

1081
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,640
a chunk of this guy's ear
cause it's calcified. You know,

1082
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,450
it's hard if you're ever touched
cauliflower ear, it feels like a rock.

1083
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:14,110
It's cause it's calcium. It's a
rock crystallize. Literally. Yeah.

1084
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:17,470
It's literally like a mineral rock
and it's inside your fucking year.

1085
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:22,190
Randy couture, who had these crazy ones
used to take it, grind it into people's

1086
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,023
faces.

1087
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:26,390
Like so he would be like in an a head
and arm position and it would shove his

1088
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:28,850
bed ear into your fucking eyeball

1089
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,760
points for creativity. Oh, okay. That's
when they exploded. That's Leslie Smith.

1090
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:36,590
She was fighting Jessica, I and Jessica.

1091
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:41,450
I cracked her with a punch and literally
like she go purposely for it. No,

1092
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,470
no. She's just beating her up in,
in the process of beating her up.

1093
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:50,030
She caught her ear and it was hanging
out and open and Leslie Smith so fucking

1094
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:52,040
tough. She didn't want to
stop the fight. She was mad.

1095
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:55,550
They stopped the fight and fucking ear
was hanging off. That was a long time.

1096
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:57,560
I mean, not a long time ago,
but about four years ago.

1097
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,690
Do you think? Um, I mean,

1098
01:00:00,691 --> 01:00:04,800
would there ever be human
versus robot fights? Sure. Yeah.

1099
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,210
I W I can't wait.

1100
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,280
They would have to dial the robots
down. Right. They would have to them.

1101
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:10,320
Like when I was talking about,

1102
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:14,010
we were talking about before the show
started that I think it would be cool to

1103
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:18,990
have a robot that moved at like 50% like
a martial arts robot that you would be

1104
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:23,130
able to practice technique on. So you
just would just, you'd basically would,

1105
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:26,880
you would do is do drills, right?
Like you do like a Dutch combination,

1106
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:29,670
which is a one to left hook
to the body, right leg kick.

1107
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,010
And you would do it like while
it's in front of you advancing,

1108
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,060
you'd put that bag boom and it would
have to like react to your punches,

1109
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:38,130
but they would do
everything like 50% speed.

1110
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,570
So you could take a chance of this thing
hitting you, but it probably wouldn't,

1111
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:47,690
but it would provide you
with enough movement so that
you could develop patterns

1112
01:00:47,701 --> 01:00:52,140
in your mind and your body would like
synchronize with these patterns so that in

1113
01:00:52,141 --> 01:00:56,130
a real fight you would know what what
you would have. You'd have these things.

1114
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,210
It's sort of ingrained,

1115
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:01,890
like one of the things that happens in
a fight is things happen that you don't

1116
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,641
think of.

1117
01:01:02,641 --> 01:01:05,970
You just do them and you don't realize
you were even going to do them until you

1118
01:01:05,971 --> 01:01:06,804
already did it. Right?

1119
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:09,330
Because it's like you've drilled
them into your subconscious.

1120
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:10,820
So you could do that with,

1121
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,490
with a robot and then maybe you can ramp
the robot up to three quarters speed.

1122
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:15,480
If he got really good at it,

1123
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:18,480
then you couldn't really move and duck
and it would be throwing punches at you

1124
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:19,314
trying to hit you

1125
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,970
and they can record you so
you can see what you're doing.

1126
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,970
Would that'd be helpful? That would, if
you could look through the robot's eyes,

1127
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:28,420
you can put, just put a fucking GoPro
on it. They're going to have a eyes, uh,

1128
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:29,920
uh, cameras soon.

1129
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,860
Yeah. And then you're going to see
someone's Dick Holes right in the camera.

1130
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,180
Log Out, locked up like a
woman. She's not even gonna

1131
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:44,240
like if you see cotton horns,

1132
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,830
that's the one thing about porns
is like the moment the load hits,

1133
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:49,140
no matter how good of it actresses,
the moment the loads hits,

1134
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:54,180
like this is always a brace for impact
is always a flinch. Even the most number.

1135
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,950
Real pros, a real pro just takes
it on the mug and just, just,

1136
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:01,590
there's, I don't know, like boxers.

1137
01:02:01,591 --> 01:02:04,290
Some boxers is photos of them or
they're getting hit with their ours or

1138
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,220
whatever. They never, they never squint.
Ever since tumbler doesn't have porn,

1139
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:10,450
I'm feel like I'm off the
map. Tomboy doesn't have porn.

1140
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,110
It used to used to have
porn. It was super,

1141
01:02:13,111 --> 01:02:15,520
it wasn't one of the most
popular porn sites. What? Yeah.

1142
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,760
And they stopped doing
porn. Do you know why?

1143
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:20,080
Probably because people complaining this

1144
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,380
making too much money.
It's too lucrative. Oh,

1145
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:23,930
they were making money on commerce.

1146
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:27,570
It was like a blog site and people were
putting all this porn and they were

1147
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:32,160
getting shutdown. Well Twitter has
porn. Yes it does. I follow the ideas.

1148
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,270
I'm fully fucking aware. Twitter
is a lot of porn. Actually.

1149
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:41,670
I didn't realize that. I will only follow
fucking annoying us news. Bullshit.

1150
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:46,080
Yeah. I mean I just, I Twitter, I'm just
like all my friends and news outlets.

1151
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,680
I don't know if I want to like jerk
off in between like CNN and business

1152
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:52,620
insider. I've looked at
Twitter so infrequently. No,

1153
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,140
cause every time I look at it,
it seems to be, it's fighting.

1154
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:59,940
It's exhausting arguing and you don't
help me cause I was like this special and

1155
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:03,330
I loved your special because like
you acknowledge, you're like,

1156
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:05,130
I'm gonna get in trouble for
this or you're going to be like,

1157
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:08,250
that was just so fucking smart.
When I was writing this special,

1158
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:11,190
it's the first time I've ever done one
where I started cutting bits because I

1159
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:12,720
was like, it's just
not worth the fighting.

1160
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,670
Like I didn't want to fucking
deal with it. You know?

1161
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:18,960
Like I had this whole bit on Marilyn
Monroe and how I don't think she's like,

1162
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:22,710
I feel like she's being forced
on us as like a feminist icon.

1163
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:27,300
Like all my girlfriends were like posting
like photos of Marilyn Monroe being

1164
01:03:27,301 --> 01:03:31,320
like, you know, always show up two hours
late, keep a man waiting. I'm like,

1165
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:35,430
this woman is a fucking
asshole. She's a slob.

1166
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,690
And why do I,

1167
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:40,140
why she's not my Gloria Steinem and I
just had this whole bit and I'm just like,

1168
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:40,291
oh,

1169
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:44,100
they're going to say I don't like women
and I'm to shaming slut-shaming I just

1170
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:46,230
like, it's not even fucking worth.
But she's a weird one. Right?

1171
01:03:46,231 --> 01:03:50,460
Because she fucked everybody, which is
not bad. It's not bad to fuck everybody.

1172
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:51,510
But she fucked everybody in.

1173
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:56,370
Apparently that's the real conspiracies
of the Kennedy's had her killed because

1174
01:03:56,371 --> 01:04:01,320
she was banging and JFK and then she
was banging RFK and apparently she loose

1175
01:04:01,321 --> 01:04:05,140
lips sink ships. Yup. Can't
yapping a lot. And look, I,

1176
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,040
I'm gorgeous. Good for her,

1177
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:11,610
for making my back dad and making
money the way you had to, but I just,

1178
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:15,690
let's let her be what she was. Why,
why, you know, I think that she,

1179
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:19,650
that Hetty Lamar should get the
credit that she gets, you know,

1180
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:23,880
I mean you talked about heading
your special fucking Jean bad ass.

1181
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,020
She was a legitimate, insane, nobody
gives a shit. I responsible for Wifi.

1182
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,140
People use wifi mostly to
Google Marilyn Monroe quotes

1183
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,520
Patty Lamar came back to life.
She be like, so did my invention.

1184
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:40,050
Did it ever come of anything? We'd
be like, yeah, good news, bad news.

1185
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:45,750
We mostly use it to Google the horror
version of you. No, I don't. I don't.

1186
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,670
It's, it's, I love Marilyn Monroe.

1187
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:51,000
Like I just feel like there's this
thing now where, you know, women,

1188
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:56,001
we can't criticize any woman ever
or else that we get in trouble,

1189
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:00,400
you know? And uh, I think we
have to be able to call people.

1190
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:03,090
Like I say in my special, I talk about
the difference between women that are,

1191
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,970
um, does anyone have any girlfriends
that think they're feminists but they're

1192
01:05:05,971 --> 01:05:09,930
actually just assholes?
You know? That's so true.

1193
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:11,940
And I know that I'm
going to get shit for it.

1194
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,000
And that's like the men's rights guys.
How many of the men's rights guys,

1195
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:18,010
just like, they talk about women,
like they're pieces of meat, right?

1196
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,030
Like is that really men's rights or are
you just a piece of shit? Are you like,

1197
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,770
what are you doing here? Did you teach
in people that they need to have rights?

1198
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,760
Are you teaching men how to
manipulate vulnerable people?

1199
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:34,700
And how do you have this kind of time
to even like, I don't even unprofitable.

1200
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,450
Yeah. You know those books are profitable.
Oh, it's like a whole business. Yeah.

1201
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:42,260
Those books. I mean guys give seminars
on how to pick up women. Right? Oh right.

1202
01:05:42,261 --> 01:05:46,730
Like the um, the game. Yeah. Diet
theory. I remember when I used to, I,

1203
01:05:46,731 --> 01:05:49,970
when I first came to la, like guys
would do that and it was what?

1204
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:53,120
The try it on you? Yes. The
first thing you do, well they,

1205
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:55,130
you're supposed to ignore
the, it's nagging, right?

1206
01:05:55,131 --> 01:05:59,330
You're supposed to ignore them and then
you're supposed to do a compliment.

1207
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:02,880
That's actually an insult. Like
every guy, when I first moved here,

1208
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,820
it'd be like, I really like
how your eyes are crooked.

1209
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:09,320
Like it was like every guy would
make the same thing. Who is that? Oh,

1210
01:06:09,321 --> 01:06:11,430
that's the pickup artist
guy. Mystery. Yeah.

1211
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,870
The game that he like the host
of the show, his name is mystery.

1212
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:20,480
Does he have a fake lip tattoo on
his neck? Is that what that is?

1213
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,140
Kisses. Yeah, I think so. Why
does he have two cock rings here?

1214
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:27,110
Like lipstick kind of thing. All
right. Okay. Oh, the furry hat.

1215
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:33,080
Yeah. So he had a whole thing he was
doing for awhile and then the eyeliner on.

1216
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,820
Oh yeah. Okay. This is like,

1217
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:39,500
who am I to judge Chris
Angel Madness. Um, but,

1218
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,660
and then you would like,
I try to ignore the girl.

1219
01:06:41,661 --> 01:06:44,300
It was this whole thing we're supposed
to be mean to her to make her like you or

1220
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:45,580
some shit. Yeah.

1221
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:49,820
Well that works on really vulnerable
people and girls and treaty girls who are

1222
01:06:49,821 --> 01:06:52,010
used to compliments and used
to getting a lot of attention.

1223
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:52,720
Well,

1224
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,670
for men that are ignored and that face
rejection over and over and over again,

1225
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:02,820
they view women as if not the enemy as
some s some source of negative feelings.

1226
01:07:07,451 --> 01:07:12,130
Right. Yeah. And for you to get over on
them would be to get some of that back.

1227
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,590
Right, right. All those bad
feelings, bad encounters,

1228
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:17,800
negative interactions that
you've had with women. Yeah.

1229
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:21,190
I had a friend that was like that
over the time that I knew him.

1230
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:25,150
I've met him when he was in his twenties
and as time went on into his thirties,

1231
01:07:25,151 --> 01:07:27,300
he became more and more
bitter and angry. His,

1232
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:31,210
he wasn't very attractive and he would
have these interactions with women and

1233
01:07:31,211 --> 01:07:34,930
they would wind up, you know,
dumping him or abusing him. And he,

1234
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:39,670
he just got fucking angry. And then as
he got older, he was just an angry guy.

1235
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,210
Like he just hated women and it
was just because of rejection.

1236
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:46,570
Like he associated them with
pain and emotional discomfort.

1237
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,940
And so for a guy like that, and he,

1238
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,890
he wasn't into the game
or anything like that,

1239
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:54,520
but for some of those guys that are
vulnerable, like, you know, like this, uh,

1240
01:07:54,521 --> 01:07:57,520
this incell thing, right?
A lot of these men,

1241
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,620
involuntary celibates,

1242
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:03,260
they did develop these forum
groups and subreddits and,

1243
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:05,320
and they meet up and, you know,

1244
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,220
talk about what to do and maybe
I'll get facial surgery and yeah,

1245
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:12,070
look no further than what
they want. Women. Yeah.

1246
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:16,160
Ultimately that's a compromise. They
want a real woman, you know, they just,

1247
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,580
they just got a shit roll
the dice genetically. Yeah.
I don't know a ton about,

1248
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:22,460
I mean, I've read articles
about and said, but what it is,

1249
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:24,800
can they not get hookers
or don't want to, or, well,

1250
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:28,310
that's a problem because hookers are
illegal. Right, right. Like, you know,

1251
01:08:28,311 --> 01:08:31,700
if you get hookers, you got to go
through some sort of shady black market.

1252
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:36,380
Fucking Dantanna's like go to
[inaudible]. Oh my God. Oh yeah.

1253
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,660
That old Santana. Yeah. D Joey.

1254
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:42,820
Joey Diaz was actually telling me
about that today. Nights at Dantanna's.

1255
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,500
He says, yeah, Friday nights cock
soccer. Yeah, that's exactly right.

1256
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:49,750
We will have you convinced you'll go
there with a fucking newspaper. This is,

1257
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,200
no, there's no hookers.
You'll be pretending like,

1258
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:55,650
I'm sit here and wait and I'll just read
the paper and they'll show up. Yeah.

1259
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:57,680
There's no hookers. Yeah. Uh, putting,

1260
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:59,990
I remember I used to go in the four
seasons all the time and people would come

1261
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,220
me like, ma'am, are you here to sit? Like,

1262
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:03,800
they always thought I was a
prostitute during the lobby. Yeah.

1263
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:06,020
Four seasons in Beverly Hills Peninsula.

1264
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:08,600
They thought you were a hooker and they're
trying to get rid of, yes. Yeah. Oh,

1265
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:10,400
they'd be like, ma'am, are you here
to see somebody or you're like,

1266
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:14,480
if I ever showed up alone because poker
is just like wander around the four

1267
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:17,810
seasons lobby. Oh, how weird. The
editory little coyotes. Oh my God.

1268
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:19,280
Of course I used to call my,

1269
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,340
when we used to go to the sky bar across
the street from his that still exist.

1270
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,350
The monetary on sky bar
exists in the morning.

1271
01:09:25,351 --> 01:09:28,190
So it's across some of this call me
store. Yeah. I used to have a whole

1272
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:31,120
a bit about them, the
coyotes cause they were like,

1273
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:34,840
they would pray on these guys. I was,
I was hanging out once when me and a,

1274
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:39,841
a friend of mine and we heard
this conversation between
this fat balding guy and

1275
01:09:40,001 --> 01:09:44,680
this really pretty girl with big tits
and, and uh, he was like, do you coke?

1276
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:49,090
Do you do coke? She's like, yeah,
sometimes. And I was like, oh

1277
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:55,810
cause it's like they would
prey on these vulnerable,

1278
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:59,320
you know, like, like a pug. No,
like a pug. The got out of the yard.

1279
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:02,450
That's what it felt like. Like,

1280
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:06,030
because these women would have this
feral look in their eyes, like when,

1281
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:10,330
when you're down to fucking people for
money, and that's how you get in by,

1282
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:14,020
and you got some cocaine in your purse
and maybe a few dollars and you probably

1283
01:10:14,021 --> 01:10:15,010
don't eat well. Nope.

1284
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,910
And you don't have a lot of money and
then whatever money you do have you

1285
01:10:18,911 --> 01:10:20,500
spending on drugs or whatever,

1286
01:10:20,501 --> 01:10:24,360
and there's a feeling that you get when
you're around them. Like they're feral.

1287
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,770
Yeah. Every day we're hustling. Yeah.

1288
01:10:26,771 --> 01:10:30,220
They're hustling and they're looking for
these vulnerable guys with money. Yeah.

1289
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,840
And so that's what, you know, the, the,

1290
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:33,310
that place would be the
place where they would,

1291
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,080
yeah. Mondrian. I remember
when I first moved there. Yeah.

1292
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:40,610
You like wait in line to get in and
there's a pool and occasionally that music

1293
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:41,250
is rock.

1294
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:44,600
They'd jump into the Pam Anderson
famously like got naked and jumped in that

1295
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:48,260
pool. That was like the, which,
yeah. Don't, that's it. That's it.

1296
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:50,180
We've already got, I've already
had a public fight with her.

1297
01:10:50,181 --> 01:10:53,840
I don't want to get you did. Yeah.
On the roast. She was on the um, uh,

1298
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:58,160
David Hasselhoff roast and I
mean, I, and I apologize to her.

1299
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,830
Did you say something about I said, uh,

1300
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:04,310
I believe I said Pam Anderson.

1301
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:08,210
You fucked Tommy Lee cared rock
and who's the other one? Go.

1302
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,610
You Fuck Tommy Lee, Bret
Michaels and kid rock.

1303
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:14,340
Why don't you just save yourself some
time and drink a vat of magic Johnson's

1304
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,413
okay.

1305
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,740
Uh, uh, oh shit. I said a lot
of shit about her vagina and uh,

1306
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:29,760
oh yeah, it didn't go great.
I mean, all this shit.

1307
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:31,740
Like I just got asked to do
the next roast and I was like,

1308
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,870
I don't even know if you can
fucking do roasts anymore.

1309
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:38,160
Like roast battles still exist and they
still go hard in the paint on Tuesday

1310
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,560
night of the car. That's right. We
just didn't share this tonight. Yeah.

1311
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:43,170
We just did it in San
Francisco and it was so fun.

1312
01:11:43,171 --> 01:11:45,840
But I still found myself being
like that peacefully. I mean,

1313
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:49,290
when we did Joan Rivers, I
said, uh, Joan Rivers is so old,

1314
01:11:49,291 --> 01:11:51,450
her vagina has a separate
entrance for blacks.

1315
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,580
Cox. We

1316
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,480
used to just be able to say that shit

1317
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:02,970
and today I would fucking be run
out of town. No, you just said it.

1318
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,900
I didn't fuck God. And then, I mean,

1319
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:09,480
I remember people used to
think jokes were funny.

1320
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:12,900
People used to have a sense of humor.
I mean, even fucking Joan, you know,

1321
01:12:12,901 --> 01:12:17,820
I said Mike, Joan, they're all career.
No eye opening joke for her was a Joan.

1322
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:19,020
I love doing the wrestler

1323
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,013
Ish.

1324
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:25,940
It was hilarious. Like you could, I
imagine a good sense of humor the best.

1325
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:29,030
And she had such good sense of
humor. Even during the roast,

1326
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,240
her face from plastic surgery was
so frozen that cause you know,

1327
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:35,060
every time someone tells a joke you'll
check in to see if the person that's

1328
01:12:35,061 --> 01:12:39,470
being roasted is laughing to make
sure. And she like Kinda, and she kept,

1329
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:42,470
we would look at her and like Greg Geraldo
was just fucking hammering or in the

1330
01:12:42,471 --> 01:12:45,290
audience was nervous. And then she
said, she's like, I'm laughing.

1331
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:46,610
I had too much botox.

1332
01:12:46,611 --> 01:12:50,540
Like she had to subtitle her face so
that we all knew she was okay. But yeah.

1333
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:55,590
Did the Breyer Improv once with Joey
Diaz and Ari Shaffir and we got barbecued

1334
01:12:56,921 --> 01:13:01,420
in the green room. I mean just
barbecued. We went way too far.

1335
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:04,290
And Joan Rivers in her
television show. It was when,

1336
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:07,240
when she did a television show
where her daughter was on TV,

1337
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,100
I don't know what show it was.
It was a reality show. Okay.

1338
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,620
And we were watching it on the,

1339
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:15,850
on the screen and her face
looked like a Kabuki mass.

1340
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,040
It was just frozen.

1341
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:21,430
Did you see the documentary? No. A piece
of work. Yeah. It's pretty, you see,

1342
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:25,790
or she goes and gets it and talks
about it. And why was she doing that?

1343
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:30,110
You know, I mean my girl look better.
There was a lot, I don't know.

1344
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,380
I mean look it, I definitely get
nervous sometimes and people are all,

1345
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,960
everyone always like accuse me of
doing my shit to my face. I'm like, no,

1346
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:38,120
you'll know I'll look like
a fucking moon bounce.

1347
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:42,080
Like allery gonna do it
eventually. Yes, for sure.

1348
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:44,260
Why do people accuse you of it?
Cause you don't look like you did.

1349
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:48,380
Thank you very thin nose though. They
would worry that you did your nose.

1350
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:51,470
It's wild because you'd think
I got my notes about my note.

1351
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:52,730
Nationals are crooked.

1352
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:56,590
I went to a doctor in Beverly Hills
because I had sinus problems for longest

1353
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,680
time and he actually said, you
know, I, I can you have a septic?

1354
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,380
What does it deviate itself? It's
like you have a deviated septum.

1355
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:06,380
And I was like, what do you do? Like he
was like, we can get a nose job if he,

1356
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:11,090
yeah, totally. And I never did it
because you know when your nose is thin.

1357
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,420
Thank you. If

1358
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:16,540
he did it, what would he do?
Make it fan nostrils equal.

1359
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,490
Even though they're really asymmetrical
and it's like problematic and sometimes

1360
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,050
in its problem when I do
something in television,

1361
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:27,040
sometimes they have to fix my nostrils
and posts to make them even who gives a

1362
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:28,870
fuck about you now? It's just distracting.

1363
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,750
I feel like those things are there
just to find out who's really weird.

1364
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:35,640
Like if you really freaking out about
someone's asymmetrical nostrils. Yeah.

1365
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:40,030
It's just, I mean the key to most movie
stars is they're symmetrical. You know?

1366
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,780
They're just like, you know, think about
the most beautiful women in the world.

1367
01:14:43,781 --> 01:14:47,830
Have some symmetry. But yeah, I
don't, it's wild. I mean I have,

1368
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,860
I mean I talk about it, my special,
I have had surgery on my boobs.

1369
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:55,960
I did have boobs done hollow, which
is kind of this might interest you.

1370
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,170
The I, I was learning, um,

1371
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:03,210
because I had all kinds of shit and the
way that they make boobs look good is

1372
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:06,550
cause I think I heard you talking about
someone about the shitty old breast and

1373
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:07,180
plants,

1374
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:11,890
the way they make them good now is that
they put you on like a crucifix and they

1375
01:15:11,891 --> 01:15:14,710
do the surgery while
you're standing up. Watch.

1376
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:17,800
So that they saw you were out cold. Yes.
So that they fall well in your mind.

1377
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:22,750
God really? Oh that's so I finally
went to a guy that knew how to do that.

1378
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:28,090
Woo. Yeah. It's a lot of fucking miles.
But, so I admit what I have, you know,

1379
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:32,020
but on my face it is alarming because
it does feel like female Comedians,

1380
01:15:32,021 --> 01:15:35,200
a couple of famous ones that we know
and they age went down that route.

1381
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,050
I don't know if it's like the same thing
that got you into comedy is the same

1382
01:15:38,051 --> 01:15:40,420
thing that made you think
you had to do that. You know,

1383
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:42,760
I've read a lot of stuff about
like childhood sexual abuse.

1384
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:46,030
Like when people go really
off the grid with their face,

1385
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:50,280
that's like a type of dysmorphia or
a lot of people, a lot of um, oh,

1386
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:53,620
psychologists have said, cause I've
talked to a therapist who's job is, uh,

1387
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,790
in Dysmorphia to advise on whether
it's another surgery should be done by

1388
01:15:57,791 --> 01:16:00,130
somebody. Like if they're getting
dysmorphic. And a lot of times it's,

1389
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,140
if you've had childhood sexual abuse,

1390
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,270
you want to change your
face so that it's not,

1391
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:08,230
you don't see the person in the mirror
that got to be like in some Michael

1392
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,420
Jackson thing. Yeah. Yeah.
It's like a childhood thing.

1393
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:16,330
The Michael Jackson thing was always
that he hated his father and he hated

1394
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:20,560
looking at his father and his own
face. So when it's that extreme,

1395
01:16:20,561 --> 01:16:22,180
I try to like not judge cause I'm like,

1396
01:16:22,181 --> 01:16:25,690
oh there might be some psychological
shit that I don't know about for sure.

1397
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:26,140
You know,

1398
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,870
but it's getting worse and worse with
this Instagram shit because kids are

1399
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:32,470
grown. I mean it used to be like we had
acne and we'd go to school with acne,

1400
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,161
you know,

1401
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:36,970
but now it's like you're projecting this
flawless perfect face and then you have

1402
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:38,650
to show up at school with
fucking acne the next day.

1403
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:43,120
Like also it's like people want their
face to actually look like in the

1404
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:46,120
Instagram filter, which
is bananas, bananas,

1405
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:50,830
photo-shopped it doesn't. But again,
it's a test to see who's fucked up.

1406
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:55,090
Like who wants that? Not, not
girl, who wants that as far as guy,

1407
01:16:55,390 --> 01:17:00,040
like what guy wants that? It's, I'm
so confounded by what I'm seeing.

1408
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:03,460
But like also you just want to look like
everybody else when you're young was a

1409
01:17:03,461 --> 01:17:07,540
weird thing is women wanting to be
super skinny. That's a weird one.

1410
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:11,030
I feel like that's always been around
now. Well it's a new model, skinny thing.

1411
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:15,520
It's because it's not, it's not attractive
to men. Like men like asses we like,

1412
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:19,880
I mean everyone's different. Right?
But yeah, I like girls with meat.

1413
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:23,300
Well cause that also
translates to fertility.

1414
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:27,280
I mean it's like we want someone that
looks for sure and you know healthy. Yeah.

1415
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:31,070
Robot. I want to grow up and
carry a couch with me for real.

1416
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,660
That's really endear you want to grow.

1417
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:35,060
You pick up the end of the couch
while it's moving over here.

1418
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:37,520
Like I don't expect you to
pick up the whole couch.

1419
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:43,130
Pink lot a someone though instead of
looking into the couch it's going to be

1420
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:45,560
harder for you than me, but we
don't have to carry that far.

1421
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:49,070
I don't know this trend of super skinny
because it doesn't really make sense on

1422
01:17:49,071 --> 01:17:51,070
like a primordial level. Why it's a model.

1423
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,310
It's a model thing because for clothes
they want a girl to be a clothes hanger.

1424
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:59,390
They want a skinny girl that just looks
good sashaying down the runway with

1425
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:01,640
their bag of bones,
which I was reading like,

1426
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:05,090
and I actually did like a whole like
paper on this when I was in college about

1427
01:18:05,091 --> 01:18:08,240
actually the reason that
fashion had, you know,

1428
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:10,070
such tiny models is
because they were just,

1429
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,200
there was a shortage on
fabric during World War Two.

1430
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:15,080
So they just started making dresses
smaller and then models skinnier.

1431
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:18,820
Like it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't even
really something that we wanted it.

1432
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:20,510
I always assumed it was gay dudes.

1433
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:24,280
I'm sure that gay dudes who
are into twinks so they uh,

1434
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,530
can you say two weeks without
getting arrested? How's it work?

1435
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:29,180
Just made me nervous.

1436
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:36,200
Lady Cohen got in trouble for saying
something about twinks isn't it?

1437
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:40,620
This is the whole thing. I can't,
so it's just like fucking hell,

1438
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:46,120
it's addicted. Here's what did help me
though. I, someone was saying, I read,

1439
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:47,510
and I think this is on your podcast,

1440
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,990
I'm 2% of all people on Twitter
make 80% of the comments. Yes.

1441
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,940
So it's on us for amplifying
that 2%. It's real.

1442
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:58,700
It's not that many fucking
ball. It just feels big.

1443
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:01,770
It's not the world you go out in the
world and you would think that it's going

1444
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,460
to be just knife fights,
fucking antifungals,

1445
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,540
this shit bottle and people have to,

1446
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:08,690
when I went on tour after the
Roseanne thing, everyone was like,

1447
01:19:08,691 --> 01:19:10,760
what happened to Rosie? That
was so funny. I was like,

1448
01:19:10,761 --> 01:19:14,170
you didn't hear half the
people didn't even know about.

1449
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:17,540
I know most people didn't know about
it and then I was on tour and this is,

1450
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:20,960
I mean there's some stuff in the special
that I'm sure like blogs are going to

1451
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:22,390
come at me for, but you know,

1452
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,770
I was going around and talking about
all the stuff happening in the news and

1453
01:19:24,771 --> 01:19:27,590
sexual harassment stuff and
getting your ass grabbed at work.

1454
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,350
At one time I was in Houston.
This woman does, he yelled out,

1455
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:32,240
I was like a guy that
grabs you in the ass.

1456
01:19:32,241 --> 01:19:34,850
She went take the compliment and move on.

1457
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,160
She's probably all drunk. She's just like,
this is such an la New York. Fuck it.

1458
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:45,710
You know? So it was just like
jokes. This is a different world.

1459
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:48,650
So many points of view that we're
just not, that are not being heard.

1460
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:51,380
You know the Twitter point
of view is very strange.

1461
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:52,760
It's like you have right-wing Twitter,

1462
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:56,550
left wing Twitter and black Twitter
because we have three different completely

1463
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:59,810
or in our little echo chamber and it
just feels so much bigger than it is.

1464
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:02,270
You out in the world and you're like,
oh you guys just want to fucking laugh.

1465
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:06,260
Outreach culture. How do you
end? Well, how will this end?

1466
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,070
I it ends with mine

1467
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,600
reading software. Okay.

1468
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:13,763
For Real.

1469
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:18,750
I think what's happening
right now is it's we're all,

1470
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:24,030
we're okay if you say something and you
have a certain intent and that intent is

1471
01:20:24,031 --> 01:20:27,000
not accurately expressed by the
sounds you're making with your mouth.

1472
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,140
I can choose to get mad,

1473
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:32,130
but if I can read what
you're thinking then the,

1474
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:35,040
I know what your intent is
and then we'd be able to tell.

1475
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:36,480
I'd be able to read your face and go,

1476
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:38,880
oh Joe's joking cause we're right
in front of each other. Right.

1477
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:43,380
That's what's missing on Twitter. There's
no social cues. Don't translate texts.

1478
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:47,070
How many times is a friend sent you a
text message and you think they're serious

1479
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:49,620
and they're just joking. Most
of the arguments in my life,

1480
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:53,970
so many times I'll send some, cause I
say fucked up things on text message.

1481
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,790
Half my text messages to
my friends are heinous.

1482
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,990
I mean me and Kalyan and show out,

1483
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:05,100
but I can show all psychotic Joey Diaz
every week since the pictures of his

1484
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:09,150
shit. He sends me the other day,

1485
01:21:09,151 --> 01:21:13,200
he showed me his balls for
like 20 minutes. I'm sure
his balls are unbelievable,

1486
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:17,850
ridiculous, gorgeous. They look like
Kim Kardashians, but they're very rare.

1487
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:23,040
But is, what is that? Is
that just, um, are they fake?

1488
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,900
Like you'd have this Joey dios. This is,

1489
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:29,280
let me look at that gigantic
log of shit. That's,

1490
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:31,560
that looks like a fucking
cell. That's just, no, no, no.

1491
01:21:31,561 --> 01:21:33,900
I've seen those in real life. He would
leave them in the toilet. For me,

1492
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:35,670
this isn't healthy. I
would go into the room,

1493
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,970
not if I can healthy associate Joey
d Diaz with healthy, first of all,

1494
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:40,650
notice that it's not even in the water.

1495
01:21:40,651 --> 01:21:44,520
It's on the beach next to the water
gives me the fucking Willie because he's

1496
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,070
kind of big and he doesn't really
fit on the toilet correctly.

1497
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:51,490
Doesn't break off. Why
doesn't his sphincter cut
it? Holds it in for anything.

1498
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:55,090
His finger, the Calamari has
his finger, his loose sing.

1499
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:59,600
When he lets it loose it's just like a
log jam that just got released like a,

1500
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:04,200
like they opened up a dam on the river.
I just whoa. I fucking nightmares.

1501
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:08,690
Giant piece of shit. So he'll
send me pictures of his shit.

1502
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:13,380
I just held her hand by accident. Yeah.
I needed some emotional comfort sister.

1503
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:15,360
Where, what are we doing sister?

1504
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:18,720
Thank God he's alive cause
he's one of those guys.

1505
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:20,130
It's just like whatever outrage.

1506
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,220
One of the things that I used to love
about going on the road with him,

1507
01:22:23,221 --> 01:22:25,560
which is tragically he's two successful.

1508
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,160
Joey Diaz is famous now so I can't really
take him on the road with me as much

1509
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:32,250
anymore cause he's always booked.
But the beautiful thing was,

1510
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,410
but he will be working with
me tonight, the comedy store.

1511
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,260
The beautiful thing was
when I take him on the road,

1512
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:42,010
he would open everybody up
like so hard. They'll like,

1513
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:46,720
all the taboos are out the window by
the time I go on stage. Oh, oh yeah.

1514
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:50,800
That's such a fucking great smart
choice. Yeah. They weren't before.

1515
01:22:50,801 --> 01:22:53,830
People like, he's so funny. Why would
you want to follow him? I'm like,

1516
01:22:53,831 --> 01:22:57,610
well I think that's in your head. Cause
I think if you're funny, you're funny.

1517
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,470
Yes. I mean he's
definitely funnier than me.

1518
01:22:59,471 --> 01:23:01,120
He's funny than everybody has ever lived,

1519
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:06,160
but he's also building shakes
when jazz on stage. He's a, but he

1520
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:11,070
also, he, he lays the foundation
that it's, everything's on the table.

1521
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:13,790
You know, he used to do that at
the roast was Greg Giraldo. Yes.

1522
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:17,510
He would go out and he would just say
the shit that even a rosy be like,

1523
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:21,830
oh fuck. And he'd go first. Well people
were, hadn't even had drinks yet,

1524
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:26,240
you know what I mean? Like he
said, um, ice tea, you're so old.

1525
01:23:26,241 --> 01:23:29,090
You used your first residual
check to buy your freedom.

1526
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,513
I'm saying, Gee,

1527
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:37,700
is bunny like that would be like
his opening joke. Oh my God.

1528
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:42,170
It was like five 30 on a Sunday.
It was like, Oh me, Oh my God,

1529
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,940
here's the plugins your
first visit you, oh my God.

1530
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:51,320
Like he would just come sort and the
audience wouldn't even know what to do,

1531
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,260
but that's something he
was so fucking unbelievable

1532
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,180
TV at the same time. And we were
right next to each other, uh,

1533
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,830
on the lot at Gower,
sunset and Gower. Yeah,

1534
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:05,870
I was a news radio and he had his own
show for a bit and his show was right next

1535
01:24:05,871 --> 01:24:08,990
to my show and we would hang
out, you know, cause we're,

1536
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:12,470
we're both guys from New York that
were more from the east coast at least,

1537
01:24:12,471 --> 01:24:15,980
that were doing comedy and we're out
here, I'll tell, oh, this is crazy.

1538
01:24:15,981 --> 01:24:19,730
You know, and, and, and I, I'd have
thought he would die like that.

1539
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,930
Like when he died of a drug overdose, I
was like, Greg, well he had been sober.

1540
01:24:23,931 --> 01:24:27,380
Yeah. What happened? You went to a
party and someone gave him some shit.

1541
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,970
I mean, it's so tricky when
my, I mean I get worried,

1542
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:33,100
I'm like a fucking mom about
this shit. What my guy,

1543
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,680
you know anyone goes on the
road and you're getting shit.

1544
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:38,920
You don't know how strong it is.
You're getting it from random people.

1545
01:24:38,921 --> 01:24:43,921
I think he had been sober
and his tolerance was low
and just tried to go back to

1546
01:24:44,081 --> 01:24:44,914
what had

1547
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:46,870
that one was. I think so,

1548
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:51,940
but I don't know all the details
that fucking need for escape.

1549
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,730
The need for the pill thing.

1550
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:59,070
Does it feel like though in general comics
are getting healthier? Like you pro,

1551
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,350
you saw the days when everyone
was on blow and everyone,

1552
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:06,030
it feels like everyone's down Jamba
juice and on it and Kombucha and the real

1553
01:25:06,031 --> 01:25:10,590
problem is I can't imagine
drinking money because of that.

1554
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:15,540
You know? I mean I don't, Amy,
we've definitely lost our balls.

1555
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,150
Some people think that

1556
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:23,910
in order to be a comedian you have to be
at least a little bit self destructive,

1557
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:24,830
like the great one.

1558
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,050
You have to have good styles for
you to get good stories. Yeah.

1559
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,400
I started going to therapy
and I was like, fuck,

1560
01:25:28,401 --> 01:25:32,050
what do I talk about paying my
mortgage on time? This isn't funny.

1561
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:36,290
It's a problem. You can wealthy, right?
You don't have any fear of, you know,

1562
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:37,880
your, your bills are paid

1563
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:40,350
when you stopped doing desperate
shit and making mistakes.

1564
01:25:40,351 --> 01:25:42,300
You just have less interesting
stories. Certainly. Yeah,

1565
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:45,100
there's that. But it doesn't
always have to be stories. Right.

1566
01:25:45,101 --> 01:25:50,101
But I also think its perspective gets
very skewed when you live a life of

1567
01:25:50,471 --> 01:25:52,060
leisure. Yeah. You know,

1568
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:54,640
when you live a life of leisure
and comfort and privilege,

1569
01:25:54,641 --> 01:25:58,420
which most wealthy comedians do,
that's when they all start to suck.

1570
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,580
Like when comedians have,

1571
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,950
usually they have a few good years,

1572
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:07,580
like they make it and then they have like
one or two good specials and then they

1573
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:09,950
have some that just what happened. Sloppy.

1574
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:12,890
Because you think they just
don't have to fight as hard or,

1575
01:26:12,891 --> 01:26:16,850
I think a lot of times I hear, you know,
people will schedule their special,

1576
01:26:16,851 --> 01:26:18,350
they're like, I'm shooting
your special night. It's march.

1577
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:21,710
It's like they have you written it like
you schedule it before you're finished

1578
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:23,630
with this, the Eddie Murphy
thing. Oh really? You know,

1579
01:26:23,631 --> 01:26:26,510
Eddie Murphy just got a $70 million.

1580
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:30,470
He hasn't done standup in 30 years. So
like how many times does he get, look,

1581
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:34,980
I think first of all, just
as an aside or just a,

1582
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,840
to start this off, I'm not bashing him.
I'm a giant Eddie Murphy Fan of it.

1583
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,180
Anybody who thinks that Eddie
Murphy should do stand up again.

1584
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:45,020
It's me and I've even talked about on
this podcast that he did that he did some

1585
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,610
speech on a podium where he's talking
about how bad bill Cosby fucked up because

1586
01:26:49,611 --> 01:26:53,750
they had a, he had to give his, uh,
his awards back, you know, I mean,

1587
01:26:54,730 --> 01:26:59,510
oh shit. It was hilarious segment. It's
hilarious. And I was like, God damn,

1588
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:02,880
his timing is so good. I wish he would
do stand up again and just jump on.

1589
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:07,010
He was at the comedy store walking the
halls a couple times on and on Tuesdays.

1590
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:10,790
This was like a couple years ago and he
just walked in and he just like looked

1591
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:11,960
like he was on a people mover.

1592
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:14,990
He was just like float through the
hallways and you know the hallways,

1593
01:27:14,991 --> 01:27:16,670
it's like fucking bay
root in those hallways.

1594
01:27:16,671 --> 01:27:20,590
And I've always just get super quiet
and I'm like, is that fucking anymore?

1595
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,080
This scouting hasn't done stand up in
30 years. That's how God damn like,

1596
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:27,920
you know, as Nice as look, uh,

1597
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:31,700
Tim Allen is Tim Allen hasn't
done standup in forever either.

1598
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:34,940
But if he walks by or by his saw, that's
that guy from home improvement. Yeah.

1599
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:37,220
You know, they're not like
freaking out that he's there.

1600
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:41,180
He was so good during delirious,
like when we were kids,

1601
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:46,490
you'd watch that you, but he
was so god damn good that today,

1602
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:49,490
I mean Rockledge and of it
just carries on. I mean,

1603
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:52,430
the real question is when he comes back,

1604
01:27:52,431 --> 01:27:55,100
are people going to start tearing
apart his old specials and saying, oh,

1605
01:27:55,101 --> 01:27:59,840
100% of the phobic and Oh
yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1606
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:04,850
Can work. Like, well, you people
are going after people for George,

1607
01:28:04,851 --> 01:28:09,530
John Wayne, John Wayne. That's the best
ones. He's canceled his cans like, okay,

1608
01:28:09,531 --> 01:28:11,150
he's been dead for decades.

1609
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:15,080
It's not woken up in the 70s you
said bad things about black people or

1610
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:19,690
something. Now where it's like
Picasso's cancel, he's canceled. Oo.

1611
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:24,650
Kowalski's canceled man. Like the
fucking, the costume was in Barbera,

1612
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:27,200
whatever her name is. What's
her name? Hannah Gadsby.

1613
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,540
She had a fucking thing about Picasso.
Like, hey babe, you gotta let that go.

1614
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:35,180
That was a long time ago. He
admitted. I mean, it's like,

1615
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:35,900
that's the other thing.

1616
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:40,040
It's all these people who put their
mental illness and struggles on and they

1617
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:43,760
would probably agree with us. Oh, for
sure. They were fucked up for Chanel.

1618
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:48,380
Like van Gogh was shitty to his
subjects. It's like, oh, I mean,

1619
01:28:48,381 --> 01:28:50,180
you see it in his work. You know,

1620
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:53,600
there's people that want to forgive
people though for things like wrong.

1621
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,260
Remember when there's a lot of Roman
Polanski apologists? Oh, I don't,

1622
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:01,070
I don't think I cut. There's quite a few.
Yeah, I mean they, in Hollywood, yes.

1623
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,550
Legitimate actors

1624
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:06,330
and actresses that were saying, you
know, it's time to let it go and leave.

1625
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:07,820
He's an amazing artist and it

1626
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:13,890
fucking raped good Rosemary's
baby's fucking great movie.

1627
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:16,290
But I think he's, he,
he's done it. It's a rap.

1628
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:21,000
But there are people like Stanley
Kubrick who is arguably the,

1629
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:26,490
my, my favorite genius ever. And, and
filmmaking, which by the way, yeah,

1630
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:28,540
I was reading that. Um, uh,

1631
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:33,590
the guy that directed x Mokena kind of
loosely based the guy on Stanley Cooper.

1632
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,280
Did you ever see, and then as soon as I
thought about that, I was like, Oh yeah,

1633
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,710
tell Alex Garland I think is, uh,
that guy's name that wrote it.

1634
01:29:40,711 --> 01:29:43,890
I thought that was interesting. But
have you ever seen like the videos of

1635
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:47,580
Kubrick Directing Shelly La and all
the stories about how he terrorized her

1636
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:51,000
throughout the production
to get her into a, I mean,

1637
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:53,820
he didn't want her to sleep. He
wanted to have bags under her eyes.

1638
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:56,490
He would wake her up in the middle of
the night and he'd scream at her and call

1639
01:29:56,491 --> 01:30:01,170
her cot and then be like, I'm going to
be like, action. And then she'd be like,

1640
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,540
fuck, like it was, her
performance is unbelievable.

1641
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:06,240
And it's like ti was tear right today.

1642
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:10,470
That would be a hostile work environment
to being olive oil and the Popeye movie

1643
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:13,950
with Problem Williams and then
she just quit. Yeah. I mean,

1644
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:23,160
her agent, she was so good in the
shining and then she doesn't do it.

1645
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:26,730
Does emotional abuse make great art?
I don't know. It's, I'm not, no.

1646
01:30:26,731 --> 01:30:29,610
The same thing happened to Ricky
Schroder and the champ. Oh,

1647
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:32,760
John Voight was like really shitty
with him. He was a little kid.

1648
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:33,870
He was like six, seven years old.

1649
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:37,830
Really shitty mean to him before
the scenes you start crying.

1650
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:41,980
I mean there's also, there's a,
um, there's a director who, um,

1651
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:44,670
there was an explosion in a
movie and the actor, you know,

1652
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:48,570
it's a fake explosion and you're going,
oh, and then one take, he was like,

1653
01:30:48,571 --> 01:30:49,460
just make it around.

1654
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:53,580
Just don't tell him in the fucking take
was amazing and the actor got all pissed

1655
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:56,370
off. But the fucking work, you know,
you get to get credit for that.

1656
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,590
So it's this tricky thing. Like I was a,

1657
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:03,750
I did a show called Adam ruins
everything. You know that show. It's,

1658
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:06,960
he's just a smart dude and he just asked
me to do a little guest spot and I had

1659
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:10,620
to play a flight attendant in the fifties
who was getting sexually harassed like

1660
01:31:10,621 --> 01:31:14,760
that was the scene and because that's
what I guess airlines used to do that they

1661
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:16,500
would sort of pimp out
their flight attendants.

1662
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:19,380
If you were engaged and weren't allowed
to wear your ring, you had to be filler.

1663
01:31:19,381 --> 01:31:21,330
Yeah. It was like the episodes
are really interesting.

1664
01:31:21,331 --> 01:31:22,440
Supposed to be really hot. Right.

1665
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:26,430
That whole thing had to be a certain
size and you had to be young and then you

1666
01:31:26,431 --> 01:31:28,890
had to kind of like, what did
they let that go? It was kind of

1667
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:41,070
implied. Delta weight 235
pounds. He was five foot four.

1668
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,630
Nice guy though, but it was like a
dating service back then basically.

1669
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:49,590
And Adam did the whole thing on it and
I was in there and it felt very much,

1670
01:31:49,591 --> 01:31:51,810
everyone was like, okay, whatever you
feel comfortable with. And it was like,

1671
01:31:51,811 --> 01:31:55,230
no, we have to do that. We have to
make this feel uncomfortable. You know,

1672
01:31:55,231 --> 01:31:58,980
like don't worry about my feelings right
now. You know, it's like, you know,

1673
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,400
so there is just this conversation

1674
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,170
about like, uh,

1675
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:04,330
no hostile work environment and everyone
needs to feel emotionally safe. Like,

1676
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:07,280
well, can you, could you
make the shining today? Well,

1677
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,340
can you get to that place
without being harassed?

1678
01:32:09,341 --> 01:32:12,130
If you're a really good actress,
would you be really crazy? Of course,

1679
01:32:12,131 --> 01:32:15,730
but I just, you know, you still have
to do it, you know, go for it. I mean,

1680
01:32:15,731 --> 01:32:18,970
isn't that the argument about great
actors that they kind of have to be crazy

1681
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,690
like a Daniel Day Lewis type
actor? You have to kind of be like,

1682
01:32:22,691 --> 01:32:24,520
that's why they're method actors, right?

1683
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,230
They stay in that mindset because to
maintain that mindset is really the only

1684
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:32,290
way to achieve it. Like you almost
kind of have to be there all the time.

1685
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:35,430
But also the being in character thing,
like when people like, you know,

1686
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,990
bitch about like when Christian
Bale had his, you know,

1687
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:41,440
melt their meltdown and stuff.
It's like, I mean it's just,

1688
01:32:41,441 --> 01:32:46,390
there's so many people on a set and
there's so many distractions and you know,

1689
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:50,200
you at some point you're just like, I
have, it's impossible to fucking focus.

1690
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:52,540
But then there's also,
there's losers on set,

1691
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:56,100
sometimes it fuck things up and then
get in the way. That does happen. Yeah.

1692
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:59,290
The fact that they recorded him
screaming at that guy, I was like, well,

1693
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,810
I want to know what that guy
did and who was that guy?

1694
01:33:01,811 --> 01:33:02,810
That guy might be a moral,

1695
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:06,280
hadn't he been starving himself
for like seven months or something?

1696
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:09,670
That's the mechanic think it's the
same movie. It's just like, you know,

1697
01:33:09,671 --> 01:33:10,900
he's mechanical. He said,

1698
01:33:10,901 --> 01:33:14,800
I'm the machine and I'm the
face of this fucking movie.

1699
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:17,290
I'm under all this pressure.
I have to get this thing.

1700
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:20,470
We're losing light and this fucking
guy cell phone goes off or I don't know

1701
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:23,920
exactly what happened, you know? But I
do think when Daniel Day Lewis is like,

1702
01:33:23,921 --> 01:33:27,420
I'm calling me Mr Link, our nobody talked
to me. It might just be his waving,

1703
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:30,010
like, just fucking stop asking
me if I want hummus. Like,

1704
01:33:30,011 --> 01:33:32,590
just let me fucking focus, you know,

1705
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:37,240
I think for like really intense
roles, which I've never done,

1706
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:38,920
so I'm just completely
talking out of my ass.

1707
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:43,480
I would think that you might
have to maintain some really
crazy state of mind to

1708
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:46,480
get there so it doesn't look fake because
you know how you know how like you

1709
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:50,060
see, did you ever see the movie
punch line with Sally Fields?

1710
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:56,260
It's interesting to me, but when
Sally fields is killing, I'm like,

1711
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,740
get the fuck up. Like that's,
no one's laughing at that.

1712
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:04,750
It's not real. When people, when actors
do standing up, I think real stand up.

1713
01:34:04,751 --> 01:34:07,540
They're like, okay, what you
know who's nails it though?

1714
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:12,310
That lady who plays the marvelous Mrs
Nasal. She's amazing. I love [inaudible].

1715
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:17,170
I love her at some legit it does. Well
it's also in the fifties I think. Right?

1716
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,620
But even the guy who plays Lenny
Bruce is great and I agree.

1717
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,540
I haven't got show brother
and there was a, you know,

1718
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:24,400
but like the one on showtime
Castro comics member,

1719
01:34:24,401 --> 01:34:27,130
Eric Griffin was on it
and now magical was on it.

1720
01:34:27,131 --> 01:34:31,750
That one on showtime dying up here.
Yeah. You know, just like Castro comics,

1721
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:37,360
but the writing one that was like a
little shoddy dicey. But uh, but I,

1722
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:40,330
I'm sure it's different for everyone, but
I do think though sometimes, you know,

1723
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:41,141
you've been on sets,

1724
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:43,480
like if you have to do a scene with
somebody where you're screaming,

1725
01:34:43,481 --> 01:34:46,150
you hate each other if you're hanging
out all day on Instagram and then it's

1726
01:34:46,151 --> 01:34:50,080
just like, it's hard to unfaced
like chemistry or knowing someone.

1727
01:34:50,081 --> 01:34:52,390
So I just think it's
interesting, like, you know,

1728
01:34:52,391 --> 01:34:56,910
Stanley Kubrick probably would be
cancelled today probably. Yeah.

1729
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,220
Especially by people

1730
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:02,300
who don't understand what's required
in order to achieve what he's trying to

1731
01:35:02,301 --> 01:35:05,150
get. Yeah. Kubrick was a mad man though.

1732
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:08,820
I mean he used to do complex
mathematics in his spare time.

1733
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:11,360
Yeah. Like as a hobby, right? Yeah. Like,

1734
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:14,930
but he would do calculus and stuff like
that. He would do shit where he would,

1735
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:16,340
yeah. I think on eyes wide shut.

1736
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:20,750
He did like do 80 takes of Tom cruise
walk into the door and then I'll show up.

1737
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,170
Like he didn't want actors
acting like he wanted them.

1738
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:28,340
He wanted them in the actual state of
mind instead of acting like they were in

1739
01:35:28,341 --> 01:35:29,810
that actual state of
mind. Like he wanted that.

1740
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:33,380
So he really wanted Tom Cruise to be
like exhausted and fucking pissed off and

1741
01:35:33,381 --> 01:35:34,071
annoyed. So he's like,

1742
01:35:34,071 --> 01:35:36,800
go piss him off and then let me
know when he's in that state.

1743
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,380
I mean you would like
terrorize Shelley Duvall.

1744
01:35:39,381 --> 01:35:41,570
It's like kind of famous
and she looks, yeah.

1745
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:44,100
Fucking terrifying. Yeah. You know,

1746
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:49,270
so she's working with Jack Nicholson and
there's a great video of him preparing

1747
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:50,960
for one of the scenes. Oh fuck.

1748
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,830
And he's jumping up and down and
throwing his arms in the air.

1749
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:55,813
Wow.

1750
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:58,020
Like freaking out. You know, you can,

1751
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:02,440
you could see him working himself
up before the scene. I mean he,

1752
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,240
it's like those scenes that he did,

1753
01:36:04,241 --> 01:36:05,980
especially like the acts
through the bathroom door.

1754
01:36:05,981 --> 01:36:07,660
You can't just go into that cold.

1755
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:11,300
You've got some of that in your
worked up. Yeah. It's wild.

1756
01:36:11,301 --> 01:36:14,930
Like I'm so obsessed with that movie cause
like the little things he did to make

1757
01:36:14,931 --> 01:36:17,130
you feel uneasy in a subliminal way.

1758
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:21,160
Awesome. He's getting ready for the CIA.
He's like jumping her half and town.

1759
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:26,160
How can she just, she's like, okay,
I'm in here and he's like, fucking,

1760
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:29,140
yeah, this guy,

1761
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,760
I don't know. Yeah,

1762
01:36:30,761 --> 01:36:33,690
there's nine people that want to like
ask him if he needs any hand sanded.

1763
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:38,740
Oh gotcha. Oh yeah. That's a guy
with a walkie talkie going in there.

1764
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:40,770
D is really dressed up like golfers

1765
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:42,883
the fuck

1766
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:47,000
and preppy. Azel it's
a great God damn movie.

1767
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:49,230
You know that movie Stephen
King didn't like that movie?

1768
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:49,870
Well yeah.

1769
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:53,800
Well that's why they say that the car
on the road that's crashed on the road,

1770
01:36:53,801 --> 01:36:56,320
there's a red car in the beginning of
the movie that's crashed on the side of

1771
01:36:56,321 --> 01:36:59,320
the road. And then Stephen King's
version, there was a red car,

1772
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:02,140
so Cooper crashed that car
and then it was a yellow car.

1773
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,840
So he actually put shit in the
movie to like troll Stephen King.

1774
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:10,390
Kind of amazing. That's hilarious. But
he did shit that was so fascinating.

1775
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:14,050
Like little things to make you feel
uneasy. Like continuity errors.

1776
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:16,300
Like he'd cut to a scene, there'd be a,

1777
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:18,370
like if there was a chair
behind you cut away.

1778
01:37:18,371 --> 01:37:21,670
Cut back and there'd be no chair shit
you wouldn't really notice in case you

1779
01:37:21,671 --> 01:37:23,710
were like dissecting it. But

1780
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:27,280
there's also a lot of weird references
in that movie to the Apollo Moon landing.

1781
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:28,120
That's right.

1782
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:32,530
Like saying that Weird Shit and
the native American genocide,

1783
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:36,580
it's apparently a pretty big theme
in it. Um, but yeah, of course.

1784
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:40,510
And the way that he, um, I mean
there's a whole documentary about this,

1785
01:37:40,511 --> 01:37:42,910
but yeah. That the carpet, the,

1786
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:47,170
when the kid is riding the bicycle around
the carpet that he shot at both ways

1787
01:37:47,171 --> 01:37:48,280
and inter cut them.

1788
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:52,570
So with the continuity's not working
and it just makes you feel, Oh yeah,

1789
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:53,640
he was fun.

1790
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:56,100
There's a great documentary. The guy who

1791
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,920
followed [inaudible] around,
he was like his assistant,

1792
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:03,180
he was an actor and he was acting and
something that Kubrick did and Kubrick

1793
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:07,650
wind up hiring him as an assistant and
then he just did all Kubrick's movies and

1794
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:10,960
hung out with them all the time.
It's a really strange, yeah. Yeah.

1795
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:14,340
Well the documentary is
really good. It's, what is it?

1796
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:17,760
Gonna do you know what it is? A room
two, three, six. One. What is it?

1797
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:23,170
The last tape? I think it's on
Netflix, I believe, right? No, no, no.

1798
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:27,540
It's the guy who hang hung
around with Stanley Kubrick.

1799
01:38:27,541 --> 01:38:31,040
It's about him. I think it's a
feeling more pictures. Is that it? Oh,

1800
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:35,130
maybe that's it. A life in pictures.
2001 no, no, no. I don't think so.

1801
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:40,620
Just Google the guy who worked
film marker. That's it. Right.

1802
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:45,450
So this guy just sort of realized
somewhere along the line like, oh man,

1803
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:47,430
I'll never be able to
make a fucking movie.

1804
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:50,670
Like I'll never be able
to do what he's doing,

1805
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:53,940
so I'm just going to start working with
him. So he's his personal assistant.

1806
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:58,380
He started out as an actor and he just
worked with Kubrick through all of his

1807
01:38:58,381 --> 01:39:02,460
movies. Oh, wild. Yeah. And somehow
or another, they just click together.

1808
01:39:02,461 --> 01:39:05,460
So he wound up working for him. So it's
like, you probably don't know the name.

1809
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:10,470
Leon Vitaly, scroll down. Please stop
you. You don't know the name Leon Vitaly,

1810
01:39:10,471 --> 01:39:14,700
but the upcoming documentary film work
or hopes to change that forever. Yeah.

1811
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:18,670
British actor. Yeah. Stan Stanley
Kubrick to play the world.

1812
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:23,310
Lord bullingdon and Barry
London. Yeah, it's a,

1813
01:39:23,311 --> 01:39:28,311
it's interesting because this guy sort
of devoted his life to like to work with

1814
01:39:28,951 --> 01:39:29,784
Kubrick.

1815
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:32,520
It's interesting. Like, and
that was also back in the day,

1816
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:36,460
I think Cooper would do like a movie
every for like five years or something.

1817
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:40,020
It's like, that's back when you
made a movie when it was ready.

1818
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:44,100
Now everyone's like movie every
eight months at noon. Well,

1819
01:39:44,101 --> 01:39:47,760
you know the apocalypse now story,
right? No movie took forever. Oh, right.

1820
01:39:47,761 --> 01:39:47,970
Yeah.

1821
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:52,830
The movie took like seven fucking years
to make. Just don't write that. No, no.

1822
01:39:52,831 --> 01:39:55,290
That's a Francis Ford Coppola.
Oh, okay. That's like,

1823
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:57,460
I don't think Oliver
Stone wrote that. Maybe.

1824
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:59,880
I think he was involved in
some way. I don't think so.

1825
01:39:59,881 --> 01:40:04,020
I'm kind of obsessed with a lot of our
stone. Yeah. I wrote, I wrote a, uh,

1826
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:08,160
my honors thesis in college
about so fucking Dorky,

1827
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:12,980
the postmodern implications
of the movie, JFK, Da.

1828
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:14,670
I was just obsessed with that movie.

1829
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:19,170
Like at the right at the time we had it
had the most edits in any movie ever.

1830
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,630
And the way that they just did mixed me.

1831
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:23,610
I just fucking loved the movie and I
just wanted to write about it and dissect

1832
01:40:23,611 --> 01:40:24,300
it

1833
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:27,600
movie. But the problem is they sorta,

1834
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:31,780
he makes it seem like you know
exactly what happened. Right.

1835
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:34,440
And the reality is we don't
know exactly what happened.

1836
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,390
We don't know who killed JFK.

1837
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:40,250
It was very likely that it wasn't Lee
Harvey Oswald though. Yeah, it did.

1838
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:43,740
If it was that, if Lee Harvey
Oswald did take a shot,

1839
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,950
he didn't take the only shots. There
was other people shooting yet. Right.

1840
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:48,090
It's just so fun.

1841
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:52,290
It was just so fucking blew my mind the
way that he makes movies. Pots. I mean,

1842
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:54,100
I don't think we even grasp

1843
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:58,120
the idea that someone shot
the fucking president on TV.

1844
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:03,060
I can't, well actually it wasn't on
TV. I'm sorry. Do I mean there's,

1845
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,200
did you ever, um,

1846
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:07,930
what was the story about the guy
who shot himself in the mouth?

1847
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:11,380
He ate skate song. Hey Man, nice shot.

1848
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,200
Is that what that named
after? Yeah, that's about, uh,

1849
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:18,280
and he was about to go to jail
and get a press conferences house.

1850
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:19,270
And then he blew his head off.

1851
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:23,450
He pulled out a 44 magnum and stuck
it in his mouth. Pennsylvania. Yeah.

1852
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:28,000
Yeah. Pennsylvania. Can you imagine?
So that's on faces of death.

1853
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:31,860
I didn't know that was bad. Then watch
that so many times from the nine years.

1854
01:41:31,950 --> 01:41:33,290
I could see it in my head right now.

1855
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:36,960
So it was on and they just couldn't cut
it because it was live television. Well,

1856
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,320
he gave a press conference.

1857
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,280
I just put a gun in his mouth and blew
the top of his head off and they're like,

1858
01:41:42,281 --> 01:41:44,030
no, don't, don't, don't. He's like, oh.

1859
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,660
And he did it like really quick
before anybody could get to him.

1860
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:50,980
He just blew the top of his fucking head
on how many views that has on youtube.

1861
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,820
Well, it's crazy. Like how quick the
blood starts pouring out of his nose.

1862
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:58,180
That was one of the weird things.
Like, oh, that's what happens. Yeah.

1863
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:02,140
I mean it makes sense, I guess for sure.

1864
01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:07,000
Just to be able to be that composed about
it. Yeah. He probably wasn't healthy,

1865
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:12,310
but, and I think he was going
to be innocent. Fucking, oops.

1866
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:15,790
I think so. Well sometimes people
getting dragged through the mud.

1867
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:20,110
That's enough. That was why Bordain
killed himself. Public shaming. She was,

1868
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,790
I mean, besides the depression,

1869
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:25,030
he was terrified that he was going to get
dragged through the mud because he had

1870
01:42:25,031 --> 01:42:26,170
paid off.

1871
01:42:26,171 --> 01:42:31,171
That boy whose girlfriend had fucked
and he would had been so prominently

1872
01:42:31,571 --> 01:42:36,550
defending women and you know,
and going after Harvey Weinstein,

1873
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,580
Weinstein in this whole
me too movement thing.

1874
01:42:39,581 --> 01:42:43,600
And then all of a sudden he was this
great hypocrite because his girl had,

1875
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:48,910
you know, she had sexually molested a
17 year old kid and couldn't handle,

1876
01:42:48,911 --> 01:42:51,350
which is fine by the way. Listen,

1877
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,950
there's a lady who just got off and
there's all this fucking talk about it.

1878
01:42:53,951 --> 01:42:56,910
There are people that, people are so
mad. Joey Diaz put it on his Twitter.

1879
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:59,410
Nothing wrong with the good
Dick Sucking. She blew.

1880
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:04,480
She blew some 14 year old kid and
it's on Twitter. One took it off.

1881
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:08,740
Who took it off out there? I
looked at Joey's. What came down?

1882
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:14,950
Twitter took a known, so I retweeted
it. Is it because of his 10 minutes?

1883
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:18,520
Basically. Why? Why would they
take it? Deleted it? I don't know.

1884
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:19,721
Twitter tweet them.

1885
01:43:19,721 --> 01:43:22,420
I just decided that it was against
the terms of service or something.

1886
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:25,300
They're getting really weird with
stuff. I mean that's just a joke.

1887
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:29,500
Well people are getting so does that
mean people snitched cause there's not an

1888
01:43:29,501 --> 01:43:34,170
algorithm or like a spider
program looking for that? Um,

1889
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:38,320
people must have complained that. I
don't know. I'm looking for it right now.

1890
01:43:38,321 --> 01:43:41,230
I don't see it on my Twitter. Oh fuck.

1891
01:43:41,231 --> 01:43:43,180
That means it was taken down
if I was typing deleted it.

1892
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:47,020
But he can still retweet something if
it's deleted. Right. That goes away then.

1893
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:52,100
No, it's right here dude. It's here. I was

1894
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,740
just looking at this page. Oh, you
didn't go back from, I didn't find it.

1895
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:55,640
That was from this morning.

1896
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,380
Bronx teacher who performed oral sex
on 14 year old gets 10 years probation.

1897
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:05,270
Avoid jail teaching certificate.
So I'm saying performed.

1898
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:09,170
It didn't take that long to get
the job. Did she? Four minutes.

1899
01:44:09,171 --> 01:44:12,860
There was a camera. There was
a lot going on. It was the,

1900
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:16,400
it was a 32nd yes. Sloppy meth.

1901
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:19,640
There was a lot going on in
there, but meanwhile nobody cares.

1902
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:21,440
She didn't go to jail.
Everybody's like, okay.

1903
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:25,250
Apparently a lot of people will commit
suicide after being on reality shows that

1904
01:44:25,251 --> 01:44:29,300
you don't really to hear about it just
because you get so famous and then nobody

1905
01:44:29,301 --> 01:44:32,440
gives a shit about you and you don't have
money. Yeah, and you don't have money,

1906
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:33,693
Toby. Yeah.

1907
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:36,830
That's pretty well to have that kind
of fame and out of nowhere and to not

1908
01:44:36,831 --> 01:44:39,410
really know why you have it and then have
it taken away from you and then to not

1909
01:44:39,411 --> 01:44:41,530
have any money. I mean,
think about it. Yeah.

1910
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:46,550
The kind of psychological tests apparently
you have to take to be on a reality

1911
01:44:46,551 --> 01:44:50,780
show are pretty hardcore. Not In
the fear factor does. Oh really?

1912
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,980
I bet they would just talk to people. How
are you doing? Ready to eat? Some eggs

1913
01:44:56,490 --> 01:44:59,570
were there, they were background
checks and shit though.

1914
01:45:00,190 --> 01:45:03,340
[inaudible] a few. We, we clearly
had some insane people on that.

1915
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:07,180
You know what mean they're
getting paid $50,000 if they won.

1916
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:11,710
Sometimes it was more like it was a big
episode, like they would win a million.

1917
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:16,240
Um, we had one guy who won $1 million,
started speaking in tongues, so 11

1918
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:18,130
[inaudible].

1919
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:21,220
He was like super religious and he was
going to give all the money to like,

1920
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:26,380
he was going to tithe 10% of his
money. It was like $100,000. Um,

1921
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:30,760
and he was, uh, that was one of the
rare ones where they went a million,

1922
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:32,680
but most of them was 50,000.

1923
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:36,210
Did you get to have say and
the stuff that they did?

1924
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,810
No, no. Say and I'd most
of the time didn't know.

1925
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:42,500
I didn't know until I got there.
That's fucking crazy. Yeah.

1926
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:47,570
Part of it was me, I didn't want
to know because I know your shit.

1927
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:51,950
But part of it was because part of it is
because I thought it would be better if

1928
01:45:51,951 --> 01:45:53,330
it was a surprise to me.

1929
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:57,020
So the day of I could be kind of more
enthusiastic about it cause it was so

1930
01:45:57,021 --> 01:46:00,800
crazy because some of the
stunts were so fucking crazy.

1931
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:04,760
But there was a few times where I told
them to stop. I told him, don't do this.

1932
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:07,550
One of them, contestants and
producers, everybody. I said,

1933
01:46:07,551 --> 01:46:10,430
let's not do this one, don't do it. And
they were like, you're crazy. I'm like,

1934
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:14,150
why don't we had people ride bowls and
that was the first one. I was like,

1935
01:46:14,151 --> 01:46:17,000
you guys are out of your fucking
mind. This is so dangerous.

1936
01:46:17,001 --> 01:46:20,060
Roman games at this point. Well
your, they had a 98 year old,

1937
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:22,910
a 90 pound 98 pound
girl. She was 98 pounds.

1938
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:27,020
She was so tiny and they made a ride
the bolt and she went fall lying through

1939
01:46:27,021 --> 01:46:27,710
the air.

1940
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:31,010
Just got so lucky that the bold didn't
kick her in the face and I'm telling you

1941
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:34,490
it kicked up and her head was
here and the foot won't like this.

1942
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:37,700
Just right by her friends. Is
that even legal? Like legal.

1943
01:46:37,701 --> 01:46:41,120
You sign off on the waiver. The
people ride bulls take a chance.

1944
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:44,840
I mean that's exactly what happened.
And I was telling people don't do this.

1945
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:47,990
And I told the producers, I
said, don't do this. Look,

1946
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:51,480
I have had a healthy fear
of animals my whole life.

1947
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:55,110
I was attacked by a goat when I was
like seven years old. So it was Hitler.

1948
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:59,980
Really? Yeah. Hitler lost the testicle
to a goat goat in my is that, no,

1949
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,610
makes sense. Myth. It sounds
is like a myth. As I said it.

1950
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:06,680
I remember him missing I think a goat
bit. What it is. Nuts. Sorry. I was hit,

1951
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:11,780
I was budded by goat and my stepfather
had to come and save me like a petting

1952
01:47:12,091 --> 01:47:15,930
zoo. No, it was at a um, a farm
co-op when we lived in San Francisco,

1953
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:20,620
there was a, my step dad went
back to school and uh, he was a,

1954
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:23,730
who was originally a computer programmer
and then he was going back to school to

1955
01:47:23,731 --> 01:47:24,481
be an architect.

1956
01:47:24,481 --> 01:47:29,280
And one of the things that he did with
part of his a university was they had

1957
01:47:29,281 --> 01:47:33,520
some sort of a, some sort of a
farming co-op thing. We didn't,

1958
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:38,610
you had to take care of like certain
like farming chores and there was the

1959
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:40,243
animals like,

1960
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:45,390
like goats and I was a little kid and
then we got left in this fucking room with

1961
01:47:46,111 --> 01:47:48,000
this goat, this pen with a gun.

1962
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:52,290
It was fine for the beginning and then
the goat fucking just came at me and

1963
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:56,010
slammed his, uh, did it head worn
chest? Yeah. Oh yeah. There no joke.

1964
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:59,130
And I remember I'm grabbing the
horns, but I didn't have any strength.

1965
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,510
I was a little kid, you know,

1966
01:48:00,511 --> 01:48:04,560
I was maybe eight at the time and he
had to come and save me and I was like,

1967
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:07,720
Jesus Christ. And I remember
thinking from that time on like, oh,

1968
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,950
like you've got to get this idea of
what an animal is out of your head.

1969
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:14,640
Like they, they, they, they, he
didn't, that thing didn't give a fuck.

1970
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:17,040
Have I died? This is what
they just stomped me to death.

1971
01:48:17,041 --> 01:48:17,830
It would have been fine.

1972
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:22,600
This is it. Was I right about that
or is that there could be a total,

1973
01:48:22,601 --> 01:48:26,310
Google's Hitler's, not Hitler
goat. Not Governments. Do you now,

1974
01:48:26,410 --> 01:48:28,240
there are two things about our algorithms.

1975
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:29,840
It doesn't have anything to do with it.

1976
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:33,110
I guess he had a undescended
testicle apparently.

1977
01:48:33,111 --> 01:48:38,111
And then he also had something
called a Hypo spatty ass.

1978
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:41,690
Hmm. Something to do with, uh,

1979
01:48:41,691 --> 01:48:45,170
the urethra whole being on the underside
of the penis and not where it should

1980
01:48:45,171 --> 01:48:46,004
be.

1981
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:49,370
Right. Or had a fucked up penis. Of
course he did. That's why I was so angry.

1982
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,040
It makes so much sense. What nick did.

1983
01:48:53,570 --> 01:48:57,650
Did he not have any goat accidents
typed in? Go to this? It said rap.

1984
01:48:57,850 --> 01:49:02,090
What is like, I need to figure
out where that fucking came from.

1985
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:05,640
But so many of the city was bit by a
goat in his younger days, but it's okay.

1986
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:09,490
Been like goat. I didn't get his balls.
Howard is attached to his manhood.

1987
01:49:09,850 --> 01:49:13,940
I think every kid was bit by goat at some
point. Fun back then. Well, it's also,

1988
01:49:13,941 --> 01:49:15,340
it's like why? It's like
people always come in.

1989
01:49:15,341 --> 01:49:18,740
It's like all this us taking selfies
with tigers and shit. I'm like,

1990
01:49:18,770 --> 01:49:23,240
what are you doing right? What are you
doing? They're fucking Wa like you're in.

1991
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:24,290
This is insane.

1992
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:27,470
There's this new selfie culture where
we all are like taking selfies with the

1993
01:49:27,471 --> 01:49:31,070
bears and shit. It's like, use your head.

1994
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,130
It's all everybody wants to do is
take pictures of things now for their

1995
01:49:34,131 --> 01:49:37,250
Facebook, it's like, it's
like the new fucking realm.

1996
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:41,290
I think we're going to look back and
the same way we look at Caligula neurone

1997
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:44,930
we're like, oh, they used to just have
lions fight elephants for entertainment.

1998
01:49:44,931 --> 01:49:46,070
Now we're going to look back and go,

1999
01:49:46,071 --> 01:49:50,320
remember when we used to like take
selfies with bears and ride elephants

2000
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:52,490
blank and you'll have a
picture of things clean.

2001
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:56,080
I think that's ultimately one of the
ways they're going to get us this.

2002
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:58,990
This Elon Musk thing is
kind of interesting because
they're trying to put these

2003
01:49:58,991 --> 01:50:03,250
little fibers in your brain and it'll
have some sort of Bluetooth link that

2004
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,170
increases your bandwidth
with the Internet,

2005
01:50:05,171 --> 01:50:08,530
but I think the way they're going to get
us as a hard drive that replaces your

2006
01:50:08,531 --> 01:50:11,910
memory because your memory
is so shitty. Yeah. Yeah.

2007
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:14,080
I mean I have a pretty decent memory in,

2008
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:18,220
in terms of like being able to recall
information and facts and stuff like that.

2009
01:50:18,490 --> 01:50:23,490
But if I had to draw a picture of House
that I lived in just 10 years ago,

2010
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,550
I'd be like, oh, I can't,
I don't know what I saw.

2011
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:29,680
But what about the things
you want to forget?

2012
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:35,130
Like our brain is pretty good at
denial for self preservation purposes,

2013
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:39,900
right? So what will you, how will you
brain, how will your brain handle?

2014
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,160
Cause denial is a survival mechanism.

2015
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:46,390
There are things we have to block out
in order to continue functioning or else

2016
01:50:46,391 --> 01:50:47,260
we'd go crazy.

2017
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:49,660
Right? So like people when they're
molested, when they're young,

2018
01:50:49,661 --> 01:50:50,710
that's one of the things that they,

2019
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:54,070
they have hypnotic regression
and then they remember it.

2020
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:57,770
Yeah, exactly. Or EMDR or whatever the
thing is that brings it to the surface.

2021
01:50:57,771 --> 01:51:02,330
But I think denial serves
a really important part in
a lot of people's psyche.

2022
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:05,870
Yes, sure. Or else you're going to
allows you to move on. Yeah, totally.

2023
01:51:05,871 --> 01:51:10,310
You know, so it's the I, that is what
scares me. It's going to be hard for,

2024
01:51:10,311 --> 01:51:13,160
I think, trauma survivors.
Certainly people in the military,

2025
01:51:13,161 --> 01:51:14,880
there's probably some shit
you want to forget, right.

2026
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:17,810
You'll be able to access it over and
over again, like the bud Dwyer version.

2027
01:51:17,811 --> 01:51:18,051
Yeah.

2028
01:51:18,051 --> 01:51:22,190
I don't want to play that shit on a
loop and my brain brilliantly made that,

2029
01:51:22,191 --> 01:51:26,360
erase that. Yeah. So I didn't have
to think about it, you know. Yeah.

2030
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:28,670
That's the one thing about that
that's alarming to me. But our,

2031
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,140
our memories are so flawed and,

2032
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:34,400
and there's this amazing neurologist in
New York called Morgan Surf and he's got

2033
01:51:34,401 --> 01:51:37,910
a bunch of shit on Ted
talks and stuff. And uh, he,

2034
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:42,200
I went to this lecture he did in New
York about how our memories essentially

2035
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:43,371
were like comics.

2036
01:51:43,371 --> 01:51:48,371
Like we punch up the parts of stories
that get the bigger responses and oh yeah.

2037
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:49,670
I mean,

2038
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:52,920
I've talked to so many friends about
things that happen when we're younger and

2039
01:51:52,921 --> 01:51:56,670
their version of it is so different
than mine am. I did we really do that?

2040
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:57,660
I don't remember doing that.

2041
01:51:57,810 --> 01:52:02,100
I've had friends tell me about fights
where I did something to somebody and I

2042
01:52:02,101 --> 01:52:04,200
beat somebody's ass. I'm like,
I know that didn't happen.

2043
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:06,300
Like you might think that didn't
happen. I didn't beat anybody.

2044
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:10,100
Didn't I tell you about there was a time
that I was in Portland with somebody

2045
01:52:10,101 --> 01:52:14,030
and they were like Joe Rogan, him and
I got in a car accident in high school.

2046
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:17,470
I remember I texted you about it and
you're like, that never happened. It,

2047
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:21,560
I don't remember. We got in a car
accident. Guy was like, oh yeah,

2048
01:52:21,561 --> 01:52:22,430
I know Joe Rogan.

2049
01:52:22,431 --> 01:52:26,180
We got in a car accident in high school
and I definitely got in a car accident

2050
01:52:26,181 --> 01:52:28,790
in high school once, but we texted about
it and you're like, that didn't happen.

2051
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,110
Oh was he had a crazy walk.

2052
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:34,240
I saw one of you had repressed or
it was just while I definitely had

2053
01:52:34,730 --> 01:52:38,540
car accident. Hi hydroplaned right
outside school. I was leaving school.

2054
01:52:38,541 --> 01:52:43,340
I had a 1968, four, four two. It's
an Oldsmobile like a hot rod. And,

2055
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:47,120
uh, those cars, like
old, when you hit water,

2056
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:52,130
they would just hydroplane and I fucking
slammed into a tree or a telephone

2057
01:52:52,131 --> 01:52:55,640
pole. Jesus smashed the car, fucked it
up. But everybody wasn't gonna spin.

2058
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:59,840
Yeah. Your car, you just, the
wheel just goes away and you just,

2059
01:52:59,841 --> 01:53:02,660
the car just slides. It's
super common with old cars,

2060
01:53:02,661 --> 01:53:04,700
especially if you don't have good tires.

2061
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,460
But I had a friend who
came up to me or he,

2062
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:13,030
he told another friend of mine about a
fight that we had gotten into where I,

2063
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:17,000
I kicked somebody or something like that.
And I was like, that never happened.

2064
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,950
I would, that never happened.

2065
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:21,060
But he probably kept telling
the story and telling the story,

2066
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:24,060
inflating it and getting laughs
on it or whatever. You know,

2067
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:27,450
I got super into terror
management theory recently. Um,

2068
01:53:28,230 --> 01:53:33,030
it's basically like the guy that,
um, uh, Becker, Ernest Becker, um,

2069
01:53:33,031 --> 01:53:35,670
this is, my dad died a
couple of years ago and um,

2070
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,520
I hadn't really had a lot of
death and I started kind of just,

2071
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:42,360
I started getting into, and you call
it to one time, one day you were like,

2072
01:53:42,361 --> 01:53:44,880
you're doing too much shit. Like
you're doing too much stuff,

2073
01:53:44,881 --> 01:53:48,990
stop doing so much stuff. And I didn't
realize like when you have death in your,

2074
01:53:49,170 --> 01:53:52,830
basically terror management theory is
this is something, you know, of course,

2075
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:55,380
but that because we have a
prefrontal cortex number,

2076
01:53:55,381 --> 01:53:58,320
basically the only animal that
can ponder the future in the past.

2077
01:53:58,321 --> 01:54:01,650
Like we know we're going to die
and we can't tolerate that anxiety.

2078
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:03,000
It's too stressful for us.

2079
01:54:03,001 --> 01:54:07,350
So we basically have to keep ourselves
busy and do meaningless shit.

2080
01:54:07,351 --> 01:54:10,710
To feel important, you have to win
awards. We have to have titles,

2081
01:54:10,711 --> 01:54:15,690
we have to get things in order
to have a sense of immortality.

2082
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:16,051
Right.

2083
01:54:16,051 --> 01:54:20,150
It's basically just managing the anxiety
of knowing that we're rotting every

2084
01:54:20,151 --> 01:54:23,070
day. It's just dying and
could die at any moment.

2085
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:27,190
It's just like a false sense of
control and um, longevity. Um,

2086
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:31,440
there's a great book called the warm and
the whole Solomon something. Solomon,

2087
01:54:31,441 --> 01:54:34,020
I read this book and it totally blew
my mind cause I realized so many of my

2088
01:54:34,021 --> 01:54:37,590
behaviors were just about this fear of
death because it had been sort of right

2089
01:54:37,591 --> 01:54:41,700
in front of me so quickly and his
death was so freak that it just, it,

2090
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:46,920
I had a really hard time coping with the
anxiety of death coming so suddenly and

2091
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:51,270
so shockingly, and like, um,
it fucked me up pretty bad. Um,

2092
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:54,720
but I started just making
myself busy with super, uh,

2093
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:58,560
relevant shit in order to try
to cope with that anxiety.

2094
01:54:58,561 --> 01:55:02,010
And so I got super into terror management
theory, terror management theory,

2095
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,710
terror, like the trying
to manage the terror,

2096
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:08,340
the daily terror that we know we're
gonna die, but the book, yeah,

2097
01:55:08,341 --> 01:55:10,530
but though it's still through
the core. It's something else.

2098
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:15,600
It's a less corny cover. The one that
I have, but just the name, title, TMT,

2099
01:55:15,601 --> 01:55:16,620
terror management theory,

2100
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:21,060
terror management theory is a little bit
controversial I think because it also

2101
01:55:21,061 --> 01:55:26,061
justifies some like supremacy thinking
a lot of I'm better than you and like

2102
01:55:26,221 --> 01:55:30,480
cultural um, superiority
stuff. I'd have to,

2103
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:33,870
there's a guy named Solomon that did a
talk about it just because you need so

2104
01:55:33,871 --> 01:55:38,160
badly to feel important that you start
to sort of have the delusion that you're

2105
01:55:38,161 --> 01:55:41,820
better than other people just because
you feel so insignificant cause you know

2106
01:55:41,821 --> 01:55:44,250
you're going to die. You know,
we know we're a speck of dust.

2107
01:55:44,251 --> 01:55:47,550
We know this is all ephemeral and
fleeting and that we don't matter.

2108
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:50,130
So we have to do things
to feel like we matter.

2109
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:51,880
Oh that makes sense. Cause we don't,

2110
01:55:52,030 --> 01:55:56,680
so you sort of exercise your
superiority over people. Yeah.

2111
01:55:56,770 --> 01:56:00,340
In order to shield yourself from
the futility of your existence.

2112
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:04,580
Yes. And to feel immortal. And you know
what I mean, to procreate, the idea of,

2113
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:09,020
cause we know our mortality is so
present in our Amygdala all day,

2114
01:56:09,021 --> 01:56:10,730
every day that I'm better than you.

2115
01:56:10,731 --> 01:56:15,731
Therefore I'm going to procreate more
and we are going to sustain and propagate

2116
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:19,460
so that we have a sense of lasting ness.

2117
01:56:19,461 --> 01:56:20,900
That's why we want to
make a name for ourselves.

2118
01:56:20,901 --> 01:56:24,740
That's why we want to get famous, have
the tangible things, stuff like that.

2119
01:56:24,741 --> 01:56:28,520
It drives, it's an anxiety
that manifests in materialism.

2120
01:56:28,610 --> 01:56:32,540
Workaholism needing titles
sort of shit like that.

2121
01:56:33,110 --> 01:56:33,690
Wow.

2122
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:34,590
That makes sense.

2123
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:39,890
So nasty evil people that subjugate all
their employees and yell at everybody

2124
01:56:42,451 --> 01:56:46,110
and like that's what they're doing. No
they're going to die. Wow. They know.

2125
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:50,370
But then I even, it's so
deep in the subconscious,

2126
01:56:50,371 --> 01:56:52,950
they have no awareness of why
they're behaving the way they behave.

2127
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:55,930
It's wild. They've done these studies
where, cause I got super into it cause I,

2128
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:59,050
I didn't recognize my behavior.
I felt like kind of the Zombie.

2129
01:56:59,051 --> 01:57:01,570
I was like trying to like set up all
these TV shows and I was like writing all

2130
01:57:01,571 --> 01:57:03,550
these movies and I was
just like, and I was like,

2131
01:57:03,551 --> 01:57:05,710
this is so weird because my dad just died.

2132
01:57:05,711 --> 01:57:09,100
I should know exactly what matters
in life, which is none of this shit,

2133
01:57:09,370 --> 01:57:12,070
achievements or money or any of
that. But I was super into like,

2134
01:57:12,071 --> 01:57:14,290
I got to buy this house and
I need to get, you know,

2135
01:57:14,291 --> 01:57:17,590
this and this thing and this watch. And
I was like, this is so not who I am.

2136
01:57:17,591 --> 01:57:21,370
But it was me trying to cope sort of
with all of this anxiety about death.

2137
01:57:21,371 --> 01:57:23,690
But they did all these
studies where they put, um,

2138
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:26,830
showed subjects of video
and subliminal messaging,

2139
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:31,000
put one frame of just the word death
in perceptible to the actual eye.

2140
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:35,320
And afterwards they showed people
pictures of woods or cities and said,

2141
01:57:35,321 --> 01:57:38,710
where would you rather be? And you'd
normally go beautiful woods nature.

2142
01:57:38,711 --> 01:57:42,880
And they always pick cities cause you
just subconsciously felt more scared and

2143
01:57:43,090 --> 01:57:45,370
wanting to be in a place that
was safer. Shit like that.

2144
01:57:45,371 --> 01:57:46,930
Cities are safer than the woods.

2145
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:51,170
I mean just the idea of some protection
and you know, lots of civilization.

2146
01:57:51,790 --> 01:57:55,960
The woods are scary because we're
on some level know that we're only

2147
01:57:55,961 --> 01:57:58,690
superficially at the top of
the food chain. You know,

2148
01:57:58,810 --> 01:58:02,350
if we're out in the woods with a
bear and there's no guns or cages,

2149
01:58:02,351 --> 01:58:03,700
it's we're gonna lose.

2150
01:58:04,270 --> 01:58:06,460
It's like the idea that we just
know how vulnerable we are.

2151
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:09,920
That's interesting because I would feel
like there's some anxiety attached to

2152
01:58:09,921 --> 01:58:12,410
the overpopulation aspect
to cities for sure.

2153
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:15,890
There's gotta be some of that right?
Cars and the noise, the noise.

2154
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:18,380
We're not designed for that. Right.
[inaudible] the fight or flight.

2155
01:58:18,590 --> 01:58:21,110
We're always in fight or
flight mode basically.

2156
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:24,530
Do you ever get a chance to go to places
where there's no cell phone service and

2157
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:28,040
you're in like the legitimate forest?
Ari's trying to get me to do the month.

2158
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:32,030
No cell phone. Ariza Weirdo. Don't
listen to that guy. He's crazy.

2159
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:35,990
I'm like, that feels a
little extreme. But yeah,

2160
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:40,670
he's got the fucking flip phone thing
going on. But he's a real junkie.

2161
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:44,920
Like he had a problem with food. He was
eating candy like all day every day.

2162
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:48,580
And I was going, Bro, what are you
Dylan? Nah, a few years ago. Yeah,

2163
01:58:48,850 --> 01:58:50,140
years back. But he was just like,

2164
01:58:50,141 --> 01:58:55,141
he had a real problem with candy just
like Ra develops these things and uh,

2165
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:59,010
he would get real obsessed
with social media. You know,

2166
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:02,110
he was and realized it's
fucking addictive. Yeah.

2167
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:06,610
I have an addictive personality. I fucking
get it. But I'm trying, I'm trying.

2168
01:59:06,611 --> 01:59:09,490
I'm trying to, I did the, I turn
the colors off on the phone.

2169
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:11,163
Let me see what it looks like.

2170
01:59:11,190 --> 01:59:14,410
No I don't have it now because I was
fucking posting cause my thing came out

2171
01:59:14,411 --> 01:59:17,730
today. But they say a lot of the reason
it's so addictive is all the colors.

2172
01:59:17,731 --> 01:59:21,100
So you can put it in gray
scale. So it's black and white.

2173
01:59:21,130 --> 01:59:23,560
There's a phone that they just
released as an android phone.

2174
01:59:23,561 --> 01:59:24,970
That's all in gray scale.

2175
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:29,890
It's like in that white paper shit
that you get like from a kindle.

2176
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:33,160
That's what I need. It's so unbiased.
It's so fucking on appealing.

2177
01:59:33,161 --> 01:59:37,840
You're just like, oh fuck this gross.
So I'm trying to do that shit too.

2178
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:40,180
Cause it's, it's, I think that
we're going to look back at this,

2179
01:59:40,181 --> 01:59:42,370
the way we look, look at
cigarettes. And if I think so too,

2180
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:44,440
we're going to be like,
people used to use those.

2181
01:59:44,441 --> 01:59:47,060
I broke my phone in
Hawaii last year and uh,

2182
01:59:47,110 --> 01:59:48,790
it was like three days to get a new one.

2183
01:59:48,791 --> 01:59:53,500
I had to order one and get it sent to
me from the mainland. And you know,

2184
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:56,530
I was on vacation and I was a bow hunting.

2185
01:59:56,740 --> 02:00:01,030
So it was just tracking animals all day
with no phone. Which one's in Hawaii?

2186
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:05,050
Lanai. Oh cool. I mean what
animals access deer. Oh, cool.

2187
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:09,250
It's m d of the state of to India.
And they're overpopulated in Lanai.

2188
02:00:09,251 --> 02:00:12,820
There's thousands of them. There's
20,000 deer and 3000 people.

2189
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:15,430
You've never seen anything
like it. It's fucking crazy.

2190
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:16,690
And they have to hunt them.

2191
02:00:16,691 --> 02:00:21,220
It's like one of the places on the
planet where there's a real ethical

2192
02:00:21,221 --> 02:00:24,820
imperative to, to hunt these
animals cause there's no predators.

2193
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:27,820
So the only way they control their
populations is through hunting.

2194
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:28,570
That's the only way.

2195
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:31,260
And if there's ever a population they
graze and there's no food problem.

2196
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,820
I mean there's plenty of
food. It's a tropical island.

2197
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:38,850
But the problem is that you run into
this real possibility of disease and you

2198
02:00:39,041 --> 02:00:42,430
know it's just not good. But the,

2199
02:00:42,431 --> 02:00:46,990
the point being I was there for a solid
three days with no phone and it was this

2200
02:00:46,991 --> 02:00:51,310
weird feeling of peace. Fuck. It's like,
it calmed me down in this weird way.

2201
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:54,430
It's like the desire to check.
Let me check my email real quick.

2202
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:58,090
Let me look at my photos. Which one? Well,
I had to post something on Instagram.

2203
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:01,150
I'm gonna check my Twitter, see if
somebody send me a direct message.

2204
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:03,910
Let me see if anybody sent me any
pictures that I want to look at.

2205
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:05,950
Know like Joey sent me any of his shit.

2206
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:12,520
Joey sent me La something that is so
it's like such an obvious solution,

2207
02:01:12,610 --> 02:01:17,610
but I realized so much of going to the
phone is to check time and we have to,

2208
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:21,130
it's like the new pocket watch and
then once you go to look at the time,

2209
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:23,500
then you see your text message and
you know what I mean? Wear a watch.

2210
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:24,790
I don't and I need to,

2211
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,270
it was just where I'm going to start
to wear a watch and then also getting a

2212
02:01:28,271 --> 02:01:30,910
separate camera cause so much of what
we do is to take pictures. It's like,

2213
02:01:30,911 --> 02:01:33,530
Oh I got to take pictures of this
and then I'm on my phone. These,

2214
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:37,270
this with a flip phone. Woo Pig Paul.

2215
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:40,040
I know my heart just

2216
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:43,880
stopped me a second. I'm not going to
post on Instagram with a flip phone.

2217
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:48,080
Him Yelling on tick tock
tick tock tick, tick tock.

2218
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,440
Oh I know about it from my kids. They
do the tick. Don't know what it is.

2219
02:01:51,650 --> 02:01:54,980
It's like live streaming
dancing. From what I understand,

2220
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:58,080
I know it only from Christina's
page cause she puts on some,

2221
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:00,650
oh it started as a music
app called musically.

2222
02:02:00,710 --> 02:02:04,160
It changed the name to Tiktaalik and
people just dancing. It's a lot of kids.

2223
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:07,560
Kids are all over it but you
don't want to talk or be funny.

2224
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:10,910
It's now become what vine was,
but it's still based around music.

2225
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,610
It wasn't vine only like five
seconds. This is a little bit longer,

2226
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:16,910
but there's a lot of songs over the
last year that have gotten popular off

2227
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:18,110
there, including like old town road,

2228
02:02:18,111 --> 02:02:20,980
which was the number one song
got popular off of there.

2229
02:02:21,310 --> 02:02:23,040
That's how it got popular. Yeah. Wow.

2230
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:26,510
Well I've got popular
with my kids for sure.

2231
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:30,170
My kids knew about that song way
before me. They were singing it.

2232
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:32,750
You never see that there's
a video of little nas x,

2233
02:02:32,751 --> 02:02:37,751
whatever his name is at a school and
he's on stage and these kids are seeing

2234
02:02:38,091 --> 02:02:42,560
along. It is fucking adorable.
They're all singing along to the song.

2235
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:44,090
It's really cute. Good Song.

2236
02:02:44,091 --> 02:02:47,210
He's doing well mentally partner thing
and what was this? The controversy.

2237
02:02:47,211 --> 02:02:49,940
They wouldn't let the song
be on the country charts.

2238
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:52,220
That was the big controversy race.

2239
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:55,820
That's fucking racist. That's all it is.

2240
02:02:55,821 --> 02:02:59,270
That is like God damn country
song and not Garth Brooks,

2241
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:02,600
that other Guy Cyrus is
oddly ray. Yeah, well they,

2242
02:03:02,601 --> 02:03:06,230
once they put him on then it, they
allowed it on the country charts.

2243
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:07,760
He wasn't in the original version,

2244
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:11,780
so they had to put him on it and then
it made me, am I wrong about that?

2245
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:16,640
You are correct, but who do you
hoodie was this hunt country singer?

2246
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:18,110
Yes.

2247
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:23,140
But he started out as a regular
singer and then came over to country.

2248
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:28,010
His career kind of fell apart as was
a pot and the bloke fish went away.

2249
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:31,010
Derrius Rutger? Yes. Thank
you. He's really good.

2250
02:03:31,130 --> 02:03:35,100
Was fucking got a beautiful voice and
all the things I remember and he maybe he

2251
02:03:35,110 --> 02:03:36,680
just, that's his shit. He's into it.

2252
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:41,950
But his career was floundering in the
other world and then he went into the

2253
02:03:41,991 --> 02:03:45,500
world of Hay and flannel
and they took off.

2254
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:47,990
I fucking drive home to
a lot of his music hall.

2255
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,370
I don't know why that Hootie and
the blowfish was a legit jam.

2256
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:57,060
I wonder why they didn't last right there
on to Oregon right now who didn't get

2257
02:03:57,140 --> 02:03:58,490
it back. I was going to
say about Aaron Lewis.

2258
02:03:58,630 --> 02:04:02,100
Ms Stand also is a country singer.
Oh, he's in a huge country. So anyway,

2259
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:06,020
he's got, he wears mag hats and he's got
don't tread on me tattooed on his neck.

2260
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,810
That was like during the time
of him nice guy were like,

2261
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:12,890
all the bands were like, Huh?
Like there was like a [inaudible].

2262
02:04:14,290 --> 02:04:18,140
There was a moment where that's what
all the music sound like and maybe that

2263
02:04:18,141 --> 02:04:22,540
just like trained toad,
the wet sprocket. Yeah.

2264
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:27,370
That's all that. Like the fucking,
they was just got sick of it. The band.

2265
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:31,490
But Pearl Jam, they're all pearl jam
phones best. That's what it is. They all

2266
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:37,740
totally. Um, but yeah,

2267
02:04:37,741 --> 02:04:41,780
I think your phone a better man. Such
a good song. Yeah, it's great song.

2268
02:04:41,781 --> 02:04:46,740
I love the sound so good.
I mean that is so crazy.

2269
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:50,790
When I think about that Jeremy
Spoken Song, I had no idea.

2270
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:52,440
Like it was so weird when it came out.

2271
02:04:52,441 --> 02:04:55,830
I had no concept of what it even
fucking meant. I was listening,

2272
02:04:55,831 --> 02:04:59,010
it was on mixed the other day and I was
like, God, what was it about suicide?

2273
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:00,690
Didn't it? Was it about a kid that,

2274
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:04,470
that blew his head off in
Jeremy's spoken class today?

2275
02:05:04,471 --> 02:05:09,070
I think he blew his brains out in class
member that videos for consider story.

2276
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:12,690
It's about suicide. Jesus used
to make out to a suicide song.

2277
02:05:13,070 --> 02:05:14,610
I had no idea what he was even about.

2278
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:18,010
There's a lot of really McCobb
shit going on back down with music.

2279
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:19,590
Remember that was that silver chair?

2280
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:24,600
Remember that silver chair
video rape me about that?

2281
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:28,050
Literally forgot about it
until just this moment rape me.

2282
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:32,370
My friend used to dance to it. She
used to drink to it, smoke weed to it.

2283
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:36,150
We used to sing along. If it was on
ticktack now we'd be singing along to it.

2284
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:38,790
What a crazy fucking wild.

2285
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:44,010
Who would be the Kurt Cobain of t like
what? That was such a big deal. Like who?

2286
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:47,180
They can't have that with the Internet.
They would, someone would meet to them.

2287
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:50,690
They'd find out shit about 'em. There'd
be a dick pic. Yep. People get angry.

2288
02:05:52,070 --> 02:05:55,520
I mean he had poor judgment. He dated
Courtney love. He married her. Right.

2289
02:05:55,940 --> 02:05:58,910
But like when he killed himself,
definitely taken pictures of his dog.

2290
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,290
Who's that big right now?
Who's that big of a star?

2291
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:05,300
There's so many stars now.

2292
02:06:05,780 --> 02:06:10,040
I think we've diluted the pool and there
are so many stars we've never heard of.

2293
02:06:10,041 --> 02:06:14,670
It used to be like there was a star
we all knew about were old funk.

2294
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:17,960
That's part of the people that someone,
I'm like, Oh, who's that person?

2295
02:06:17,961 --> 02:06:22,030
They have 70 million followers. I'm
like, I've never heard of um, what? Yeah,

2296
02:06:22,370 --> 02:06:26,270
what? Yeah, we're out of the loop.
I'm way more out of the loop than you.

2297
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:28,100
He's more in the loop than both of us.

2298
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:30,500
Do you think that changes in a couple
of weeks when they take the follower

2299
02:06:30,501 --> 02:06:33,680
accounts off of like the
[inaudible] was only in Australia.

2300
02:06:34,070 --> 02:06:36,380
They're testing it in other
countries before they drop it here.

2301
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:41,190
That looks like it looks like fucking
like they try drugs out in other countries

2302
02:06:43,510 --> 02:06:47,280
to shine out the follower count
thing. What? That's going to be weird.

2303
02:06:47,670 --> 02:06:49,680
Wonder what, how people go.
Why are they doing that?

2304
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:52,680
Because they feel like they're doing
a disservice to people by having them

2305
02:06:52,681 --> 02:06:53,514
compete.

2306
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:57,010
Psychology has it. Yeah. Yeah. You
won't be seeing other people's stuff.

2307
02:06:57,011 --> 02:07:00,340
So it might tell a lot of people
make money. I know, not me.

2308
02:07:00,341 --> 02:07:03,690
I don't ever do ads on Instagram, but
a lot of people do. I don't either.

2309
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,440
I bet you get offered to
do a ton of shit a lot.

2310
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:08,980
But I say no because you just think
it's corny. Yeah, I'll do ads ads

2311
02:07:08,990 --> 02:07:12,760
for things I like where um,
I put it up for free. Yeah.

2312
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:16,940
But I've never been paid. Yeah. Like
if someone said, oh it's fucking owed.

2313
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,900
Like maybe it is an ad but it's
not an ad I'm getting paid for.

2314
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:25,130
Like if I find something that's cool I'll
just put it up like this is a bad ass

2315
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:28,580
little video. This is how much
I think it helps. And I've,

2316
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:33,440
I've been offered a lot of money
multiple times to do ads for things on

2317
02:07:33,441 --> 02:07:37,270
Instagram and I'm like, look, I do ads
my podcast, everybody knows it's an ad.

2318
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:40,180
Yeah. If I'm doing, I'm not doing
that on Instagram. I'm just,

2319
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:43,720
that doesn't seem like it makes sense.
Like if someone goes to your Instagram,

2320
02:07:43,721 --> 02:07:45,610
they want to see cool shit
that you're interested in,

2321
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:47,590
they want to see a picture of something.

2322
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:52,300
I want to see a picture of my dog or
food or fucking sunset or a mountain or

2323
02:07:52,301 --> 02:07:53,134
whatever the fuck it is.

2324
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:56,860
They don't want to see sneakers
that your salad unless it's like,

2325
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,260
but if it's a friend of mine
sneakers and he sell them,

2326
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:01,510
I'll take a picture of that and put
it up, but I don't want any money.

2327
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,890
I think it feels Corny, you
know? I think for you especially,

2328
02:08:04,891 --> 02:08:08,910
I think people trust you so much and
you're known for telling the truth and not

2329
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:12,410
selling out. If you had a Hashtag
ad everyone was like, what?

2330
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:16,860
Like it just feels paid ads. Well, it's
like your thing. It would just be like,

2331
02:08:16,861 --> 02:08:19,480
make a good product.
I'll post about it. Yeah.

2332
02:08:19,790 --> 02:08:22,340
For free all the time. Yeah.
I really do. And people,

2333
02:08:22,341 --> 02:08:24,560
I don't even know if they have
something cool, I'll put it up.

2334
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:28,380
Yeah. Have you ever felt like, oh
fuck, that's a lot of money. No,

2335
02:08:29,610 --> 02:08:32,220
it's not worth it because you
probably lose in the long run.

2336
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:36,870
Yeah. It's like if I was poor, yeah,
I would do it. Yeah. If I was poor,

2337
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:40,890
I'd do it. I did fear factor. Fuck,
I'll do a lot of horse shit. That's not,

2338
02:08:40,891 --> 02:08:44,940
I'm not above whoring myself, but I'm not
going to whore myself if I have money.

2339
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:46,230
No, that doesn't make any sense.

2340
02:08:46,290 --> 02:08:49,770
But that is weird cause I
wonder how people are gonna
a lot of people make money

2341
02:08:49,771 --> 02:08:52,700
from putting ads on Instagram.
Just delete it. I did not,

2342
02:08:52,770 --> 02:08:53,910
it's not related directly to this,

2343
02:08:53,911 --> 02:08:57,840
but they deleted a bunch of accounts
apparently yesterday count's had had up to

2344
02:08:57,841 --> 02:09:00,810
13 million followers. Really?
Meme accounts and shit.

2345
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:03,480
The whole account for their book.

2346
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:06,330
A couple of reasons they might have
done it like with a lot of meme accounts

2347
02:09:06,331 --> 02:09:07,164
that steal jokes

2348
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:11,470
a lot. A lot hot la

2349
02:09:11,550 --> 02:09:15,840
crazy me. Just make money off of it.
There was a girl you saw that girl on a,

2350
02:09:15,860 --> 02:09:16,700
is it meg? Right?

2351
02:09:16,701 --> 02:09:21,701
Who was calling out that a fuck Jerry
Guy who was just doing comics jokes.

2352
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:25,150
It was out. His name was may, I don't
know Mike. Right? Oh she was a uh,

2353
02:09:25,610 --> 02:09:28,610
comic comedy person. Yeah. Oh,
who bake comedy writer. Yeah.

2354
02:09:28,611 --> 02:09:32,660
And who was just like connecting
the comics joke to the meme.

2355
02:09:32,910 --> 02:09:36,540
So many that were at least they slowed
down like the progress of that fat Jewish

2356
02:09:36,541 --> 02:09:37,650
guy that's slowed down.

2357
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:41,040
He doesn't have nearly the sort
of trajectory he used to have,

2358
02:09:41,041 --> 02:09:42,780
but that was all what he was about.

2359
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:47,490
It's just like taking people's Shit and
repurposing it and making a lot of money

2360
02:09:47,491 --> 02:09:49,800
and then also like getting
on television shows,

2361
02:09:49,801 --> 02:09:53,820
being interviewed and not
having a fucking talent at all.

2362
02:09:53,850 --> 02:09:55,050
Just reposting. Yeah,

2363
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:56,870
I know I people DM me all the time, Hey,

2364
02:09:57,010 --> 02:09:58,180
can I act now that everyone's scared that,

2365
02:09:58,181 --> 02:10:01,250
can I use your tweet in my Instagram
for you getting now I have to do work to

2366
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:04,010
say yes so you can upper, you
know it's just like, but yeah,

2367
02:10:04,011 --> 02:10:06,440
a lot of people are like curators
I think is what they call it.

2368
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:08,860
Is that why they deleted
them? Right. For coffee.

2369
02:10:08,990 --> 02:10:11,750
But article had said that there's like
they could have been taking advertising

2370
02:10:11,751 --> 02:10:15,110
money and not saying it and I'm like
cutting in at a Instagram's advertising

2371
02:10:15,111 --> 02:10:17,710
deals, reposting people, Shit, all that.

2372
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:21,440
All that end of articles said that there
is no way they can get those accounts

2373
02:10:21,441 --> 02:10:26,210
back. There's, it's like
non-negotiable. Oh Shit. Oh fuck off.

2374
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:29,600
But so we'll to basically go,
everyone's going to have no followers.

2375
02:10:29,870 --> 02:10:32,330
You won't be able to see it.
You'll be able to see your account.

2376
02:10:32,510 --> 02:10:34,090
Like you'll know that you still have it

2377
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:37,160
every day I'm going to post an
Instagram photo of my account.

2378
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:41,810
I got people are going to get their
Nas bitches recognize cause like,

2379
02:10:41,811 --> 02:10:46,430
I mean people are fucking falling off
cliffs taking selfies. Have you seen it?

2380
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:49,250
It's like the fucking Darwin Award.
You'll still be able to see the likes.

2381
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:51,810
You just won't be able to see your
followers yet either. None of it.

2382
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:54,860
You'll be able to see how many
likes you have on your photos. Wow.

2383
02:10:54,910 --> 02:10:57,850
I'm going to pull your a screen, grab
it and posted. I'm going up my, my,

2384
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:01,070
what I'll do is I'll post something
in the morning and then three times

2385
02:11:01,071 --> 02:11:05,040
throughout the day I'll post it to see
which, how many likes I got to everybody.

2386
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:09,830
That's for sure going to
happen. Gangster moved though.

2387
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:11,180
Instagram would be so mad at you.

2388
02:11:11,310 --> 02:11:14,690
You're fucked by bypassing like showing
your like some movement on your Twitter

2389
02:11:14,691 --> 02:11:15,440
account. Yeah.

2390
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:18,560
Oh that's the move posted on my Twitter
account posted on my Facebook cause

2391
02:11:18,561 --> 02:11:22,020
that's a dumpster. If Facebook's a
dumpster, I just, I don't even look good.

2392
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:25,040
Yeah, I mean just dump
things over there. Yeah.

2393
02:11:25,041 --> 02:11:27,830
It doesn't yours just connect to it.
Like it just automatically posts.

2394
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:32,360
But it's interesting because it's
clearly reflects my lack of interaction

2395
02:11:32,390 --> 02:11:36,530
because like I only have 2 million
Facebook followers whereas like everything

2396
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:39,050
else is way more than that
whole engagement thing now.

2397
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:42,980
So there was this I social media
is this to its full time job.

2398
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,890
So I was talking to much people to
run my social media and they're like,

2399
02:11:45,891 --> 02:11:48,530
well you have to engage people
to all to get in the algorithm.

2400
02:11:48,531 --> 02:11:49,610
Now you have to ask,

2401
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:52,220
you have to ask questions so
that people like you notice it.

2402
02:11:52,221 --> 02:11:55,040
Celebrities for a while kept going like,
so what are you doing this weekend?

2403
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:59,270
Like as if just thought they were
dumb. Like what do you like to cook on,

2404
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:00,620
you know, Taco night. Like,

2405
02:12:00,750 --> 02:12:03,980
oh it was all these like
insincere questions cause
they wanted people to answer

2406
02:12:03,981 --> 02:12:06,800
so they could get into the
algorithm. Oh, that makes sense.

2407
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:10,580
I read one that said, what's
your least favorite chore?

2408
02:12:11,540 --> 02:12:16,250
What in the fuck are you? What are
you, it's the amount of robots.

2409
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:20,090
If you can't, um, if
you, if you, by the way,

2410
02:12:20,091 --> 02:12:23,900
the shot of this is so funny cause she
just looks like a dead body done with us.

2411
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:28,010
She checked out, she was with us for
awhile now our neck. Fuck she's off.

2412
02:12:28,130 --> 02:12:31,310
Oh cause I didn't have her on chat
cause she kept stealing my thunder and

2413
02:12:31,311 --> 02:12:35,180
distracting your back bitch there.
She's back. [inaudible] over here.

2414
02:12:36,190 --> 02:12:39,110
Hey that bitch, um, I gotta end this.

2415
02:12:39,111 --> 02:12:40,730
I gotta be at the comedy
store in two hours.

2416
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:45,360
Oh fuck am I gotta go home and hug my
kids. You have to go parents. All right.

2417
02:12:46,150 --> 02:12:50,480
We comings your new Netflix special
available right fucking now don't worry

2418
02:12:50,481 --> 02:12:53,630
about following me cause followers
don't matter anymore. Do not matter.

2419
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:58,250
Don't like any of our like doesn't
mean anything. All right, bye.

2420
02:12:58,251 --> 02:13:00,410
Everybody go resuscitate this robot.

2421
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:07,613
Okay.

2422
02:13:10,910 --> 02:13:10,910
[inaudible].
