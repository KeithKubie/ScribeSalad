00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.410
SPEAKER 1: Today, in honor of
Sustainable Seafood Month here

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.050
at Google, we are joined
by Michael Passmore

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.560
of Passmore Ranch and Chef
Bill Ngo of Kru in Sacramento.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.630
And they are going to
tell us a little bit more

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.849
about sustainable seafood,
sustainable seafood farming,

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.640
aquaculture, and I
think they're also going

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.449
to make something delicious?

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.740
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Hopefully so.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.990
I hope everybody enjoys it.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.490
SPEAKER 1: We're
going to go for it.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.330
We're going to try.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.990
So thank you guys.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.030
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Food in your mouth.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.660
It's gonna happen.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.049
SPEAKER 1: That will be the
end result, will be delicious

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.840
food in your mouth.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.300
I'm going to go ahead and commit
to the delicious right out

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.800
of the gate.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.220
So I don't have
to make it happen,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.410
but I'm convinced you
guys are going to make

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.700
it happen for all of us.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.790
So tell us, when I say
"sustainable seafood farmer,"

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.860
what does that even mean?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.830
MICHAEL PASSMORE: It's a
big word is what it is.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.550
Sustainable-- you know what?

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.860
We almost have dropped that a
little bit just because it gets

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.240
thrown around so much.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.240
SPEAKER 1: We're
post-sustainable at this point.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.210
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
I think we are.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.500
It's like post-modern
or something.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.830
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.490
We're meta now.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.400
MICHAEL PASSMORE: But
it is super important.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.150
For farmers like
us-- or any farmer,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.820
whether they're land-based
or protein-based or anything.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.810
Sustainable's part of our
DNA, or it should be, because

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.280
if we're sucking up
all the resources,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.860
then we have nothing left.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.750
And so it's absolutely been
a part of our ethos from the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.250
get go.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.790
And when it applies
to fish, it just

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.100
means that we're not
sucking all the resources

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.270
for feed or for water.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.080
We're recycling,
doing all these things

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.400
that we need to in order
to continue to produce

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.920
that delicious protein.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.280
SPEAKER 1: So paint the
picture for us of your farm.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.660
What is it like?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.450
It's 86 acres, but--

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.994
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Guns,
beers, motorcycles.

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:46.910
SPEAKER 1: Giant dogs.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.810
BILL NGO: I can attest to that.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.810
MICHAEL PASSMORE: No, in
all seriousness, it is.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.600
It's 86 acres.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.880
We're about to double that with
some other locations in Oregon

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.550
and around the corner from
us because of great demand.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.700
But it's a bunch
of outdoor lakes,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.590
and combined with some tanks.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.729
And so we do what we call kind
of a bastardized recirculation

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.020
system, because we feel like
I'm not so focused on just fish.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.780
I want to use that water
over and over and over again.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.430
And so to kind of paint that
picture, the water comes up.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.520
We have a great aquifer,
like a spring there.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.210
Comes up, this
beautiful, clear water

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.730
that we don't have to pay
for, like the bottled water.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.249
We just drink ours.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.540
And it comes through, and it
starts growing little fish

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.810
into bigger fish.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.990
But then once we're
all done with that,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.960
then it goes into the vegetables
that you're seeing here today.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.670
And we grow some
vegetables with it too.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.700
So at the end of
the day, the water

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.930
doesn't just go away and go
down a river or something else.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.250
We're using it over and over.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.640
And again, part of the
sustainable part of things.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.270
SPEAKER 1: So how
many of you have

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.360
heard of farm-raised fish
in a negative context?

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.040
MICHAEL PASSMORE: OK, fess up,
fess up, we all have, right?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.789
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I
think traditionally you

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.480
hear about ew, farm fish.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.466
Wild, right?

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:04.090
That's the way.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.562
So tell me why that's
not necessarily true.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.020
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
You know, I think

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.478
you asked the right
person on that,

00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:13.680
because people say, number
one, what's your favorite fish.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.250
And my favorite fish
is, well, mostly what

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.880
Bill cooks me, or slices.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.830
But really, it's a good fish.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.970
And so to me, a good fish
is a good, fresh fish

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.610
that's been handled well
and then processed well.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.610
Well, that can happen in both
wild and farmed environments.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.670
I think the key to really
nicely raising a fish

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.590
is-- we were talking
earlier about all being

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.182
shoved into an elevator.

00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:42.390
Does anybody enjoy, like,
you've been in an elevator?

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.800
Like, in New York,
I was there, and I

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.940
think we were going to the top
of that really tall building.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.130
There had to have been
25 of us in this thing,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.480
and we were just like this.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.519
And it was I'm just
breathing that person's air.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.310
And then the other
one's in the back going,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.810
[COUGHING]

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.040
SPEAKER 1: Touching
all of their germs.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.180
MICHAEL PASSMORE: My mentor told
me it's really not that hard,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.980
Michael.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.875
Just--

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:08.670
[SNEEZING]

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.510
Yeah, like this guy.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.551
BILL NGO: Just like that.

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:13.430
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I was in
the elevator next to him.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.650
But that's how
animals get sick too.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.190
You shove them all in
together way too close,

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.519
it's not good for them.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.970
So on our farm, we try to go
with a much less of a density.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.610
And so everybody's
got a lot more room

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.140
to run around in there.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.950
We're feeding them a
higher quality feed,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.850
because we believe
that people like Google

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.200
here are willing to pay a
premium for the increased cost

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.870
because we're not
growing it more dense.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.960
We are feeding them a
higher quality feed.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.350
The other key to it is just--

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.920
[BEEPING]

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.360
--continued low stress.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.142
Bill, I told you that metal.

00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:47.850
BILL NGO: My bad.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.141
MICHAEL PASSMORE: We're going
to get trouble with that.

00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:52.050
I thought the Ansul
system was going off.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.599
But that's really the key,
just not crowding them.

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:55.890
We don't have to medicate them.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.580
We don't have to throw
all these drugs at them.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.740
We just keep feeding them good
food, and they raise well.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.990
SPEAKER 1: Plenty of space.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.770
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Yup, plenty of space.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.020
SPEAKER 1: Good food.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.420
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Good food.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.280
SPEAKER 1: Good water.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.080
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Yup.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.270
Good environment.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.145
BILL NGO: The other
thing with the water too,

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:12.670
bad with farm fish
is all the waste,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.410
when they're packed up so
much that all their waste is

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.000
going back out in the wild that
affects wild fish and water.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.751
Like you said, none of this
water is going back to the wild

00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:24.250
or streams.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.880
It's going back to his
crops that he's growing.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.630
MICHAEL PASSMORE: We push
out the nutrient-rich water.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.714
That's code word for fish stuff.

00:05:32.714 --> 00:05:33.880
SPEAKER 1: Poopy water, yes.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.338
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Yeah, fertilizer.

00:05:35.338 --> 00:05:37.500
But seriously, it is some
of the best fertilization

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.700
you could ask for.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.770
And so we put it
out in our crops,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.320
and that's what grows some
of these flavorful vegetables

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.820
here.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.100
SPEAKER 1: So it's not
just about taking better

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.450
care of the fish themselves.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.390
It's also about taking better
care of the environment

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.732
and all of the other impacted.

00:05:52.732 --> 00:05:53.940
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Absolutely.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.650
It's kind of like
raising good kids, right?

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.770
You were mentioning that.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.990
Give them a great environment
to run around, feed them will,

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.920
give them room to run
around, and what do you know,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.190
you've got healthy kids, right?

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.390
SPEAKER 1: What other advantages
are there to farming fish?

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.250
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
I think for me,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.860
the thing that
fascinates me and where

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.390
we're going with
some of our things,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.650
is not just in the rearing.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.410
But in the rearing, if
I can keep the stress

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.740
level of that fish
at a very level area,

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.340
if they're not
stressed, then they're

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.480
not using their
energy in other ways.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.010
So we can keep them just
super relaxed there.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.160
They're growing,
they're super healthy.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.820
But I think the real advances
have been in processing.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.340
And for instance, when you
bring that fish in a calm state

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.490
and you're able to process
that fish without it

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.090
in a super frenzy.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.620
You see these videos and such
where they're pulling them

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.370
in from something and
they're just all going crazy,

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.270
I mean, that has an
effect on the musculature

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.210
and the flesh and
everything else.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.714
So when we're doing that
in a more calm manner,

00:06:57.714 --> 00:06:59.380
and then what we've
learned, too-- like,

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.870
you're going to enjoy the
texture of this sturgeon

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.180
in particular, because
it's a real meaty fish.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.290
Who thinks straight
from the hour

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.990
after you catch it is the
best way to always eat a fish?

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.530
Anybody?

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.900
Anybody?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.100
OK, that's reasonable.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.200
We all hear it's
fresh is the best.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.220
That's sturgeon, if we
put it on that grill

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.920
like you're going
to see us doing,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.480
and we did that right-- if we
just slaughtered that fish,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.034
it would-- like a rubber band.

00:07:28.034 --> 00:07:29.450
BILL NGO: Rubber
or leather, yeah.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.980
MICHAEL PASSMORE: It
would just be chewy.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.880
These fish need
to resolve rigor.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.980
And so they relax, and it's
all about those processes

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.000
and techniques.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.682
And in our environment,
we get to do those things.

00:07:40.682 --> 00:07:42.640
BILL NGO: Certain fish
it's good to have fresh.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.874
Certain fish you
want to age, though.

00:07:44.874 --> 00:07:45.970
Tuna you want to age.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.980
I use this fish at
both of my restaurants,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.800
and we take it
even a step further

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.165
of letting it go through rigor.

00:07:53.165 --> 00:07:54.540
This meat's really,
really dense.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.550
Once you guys try
it later and you'll

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.720
see what I'm talking about.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.803
We take it a step further.

00:07:57.803 --> 00:08:01.680
We actually freeze it in
a slow freezing process

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.129
just to soften up the meat,
just to make it not as tough.

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:09.170
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Changes
the molecular structure

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.010
just a little bit for it.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.989
BILL NGO: Freezing it slowly
and then defrosting it.

00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:15.280
SPEAKER 1: You're quite a team.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.090
So how did you meet and
start working together?

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.715
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I
thought I was going

00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:20.870
to be the farmer's market king.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.990
I had this weird dream that
I was at the San Francisco

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.758
Farmers Market.

00:08:24.758 --> 00:08:26.507
I bet a bunch of you
guys have been there.

00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:27.421
SPEAKER 1: At the
Ferry Building?

00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:27.880
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Yup.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.620
I was wandering
around as I usually

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.830
do, probably with a beer
in my hand or something.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.919
And I look around and I
say, wow, this is cool.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:35.789
I grew up in Texas.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.179
We didn't have all these
farmers markets everywhere.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.840
We ate well, but it's
more beef running around.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.510
And I looked there, and I
was like, why isn't there

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.660
fresh fish here?

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.890
Because that's kind of
been a new thing there.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.077
10, 12 years ago,
they didn't have that.

00:08:50.077 --> 00:08:51.285
So now, I was looking around.

00:08:51.285 --> 00:08:54.510
I was like, wow, there's a whole
lot of these all over our area.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.720
I could bring my live fish,
because I didn't really

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.761
realize that you could
process fish at that time.

00:08:58.761 --> 00:08:59.650
SPEAKER 1: Live fish?

00:08:59.650 --> 00:08:59.750
Like a tank?

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.770
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Oh, yeah.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:01.360
We were going live.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:01.990
SPEAKER 1: Swimming around?

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.810
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Oh, yeah.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.785
SPEAKER 1: Pick your fish.

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:05.493
MICHAEL PASSMORE: So
I'm getting to that.

00:09:05.493 --> 00:09:08.790
And there's a really neat
guy-- Randall Selland

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.350
of The Kitchen in Sacramento.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.040
Kind of a patriarch there.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.750
Bill did his externship there.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.780
And so he sees me at the
farmers market, my wife and I,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.870
and sees these live fish.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.609
And he just, oh my
gosh, what's going on?

00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:23.150
Can you bring those
to my restaurant?

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.180
I'm like, yeah.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.600
You call, I haul, sure.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.930
What's the problem?

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:31.130
I don't think he realized
that they were coming in live,

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.190
and I didn't realize
that some chefs don't

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.440
know how to cut a fish either.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.931
I'm like, well, you're a chef.

00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:37.306
Don't you know
how to cut a fish?

00:09:37.306 --> 00:09:38.040
SPEAKER 1: Uh-oh.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.164
MICHAEL PASSMORE: So yeah,
this little pocket knife

00:09:40.164 --> 00:09:42.800
has processed a
whole lot of fish.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.580
Well, Randall was eating
at Bill's restaurant.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.450
Bill's restaurant's
kind of like the spot

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.520
that-- the secret
not-so-secret spot that I

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.810
can't get a seat in anymore.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.460
But he was in there,
and he started

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.940
talking to Bill about it.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.850
And so Bill was my second
chef ever to use our fish.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.710
And we used to pull the
fish bus right up there,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.020
unload the live fish,
and in it went to Bill.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.005
And that's how it all started.

00:10:09.005 --> 00:10:11.051
BILL NGO: Picked out
the fish, pulled it out.

00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:11.550
Love

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.940
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Tap.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.398
BILL NGO: Gave it
the tap, and then

00:10:13.398 --> 00:10:15.020
went inside the restaurant.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.460
SPEAKER 1: So obviously
Bill's your second.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.930
But what other chefs
that we would recognize

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.526
are you now working with?

00:10:22.526 --> 00:10:24.435
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Well,
Matthew Accarrino,

00:10:24.435 --> 00:10:26.690
we were over there
defacing him over there.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.580
He's a both very good
friend, but I don't know.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.300
Do you guys dine a lot
out in Napa and Bay Area,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.690
I'm assuming?

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:38.870
So pretty much anybody with a
Michelin star, or a James Beard

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.490
Award, or all those things.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:45.220
So Mr. Keller and his
restaurants utilize us,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.590
and Christopher Kostow and those
guys, good friends of ours.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.690
And I could just go on and on.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:54.805
Dominique and her places.

00:10:54.805 --> 00:10:55.846
SPEAKER 1: Atelier Crenn.

00:10:55.846 --> 00:10:58.270
Yeah, many, many chefs
who have joined us here,

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.187
and the ones you had--

00:10:59.187 --> 00:11:01.019
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I
think they've all graced

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:02.170
this kitchen, haven't they?

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.822
SPEAKER 1: We're
trying, but not all.

00:11:03.822 --> 00:11:04.530
We're on our way.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.540
I've got a list.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.000
So tell us what
you're making today.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.284
BILL NGO: Today we're doing
a really simple recipe

00:11:11.284 --> 00:11:12.450
that anybody can do at home.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.660
It's poke.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.940
Poke is a Hawaiian dish,
usually traditionally done

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.490
with tuna and onions,
salt, sesame oil.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.335
But today, we're doing
it with sturgeon.

00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:23.664
We're using Michael's sturgeon.

00:11:23.664 --> 00:11:25.080
We're going to
sear it real quick,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.640
and we're doing it with all
the veggies from his farm--

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.920
the fennel, the onions,
the purple daikon.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.870
That's all from
his ranch and farm.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.370
Cool.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.330
Right there.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.196
SPEAKER 1: And what was your
inspiration for this dish?

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:39.570
BILL NGO: It was
just [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.395
the ranch and farm, and
also, was it last year where

00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:45.510
we went to Japan to check
out the Tsukiji Fish

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.270
Market to check out the
fish scene out there.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.619
And right across
from the market,

00:11:50.619 --> 00:11:51.910
there's a little market, right?

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.380
And all those little stalls
and street food, and everybody

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.850
was just doing chirashi bowls,
or fast-grab [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.870
It's just bowls with
rice, and they'll just

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:00.772
chop chunks of fish.

00:12:00.772 --> 00:12:02.480
So this something
similar we're going to.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.790
We're going to do a little poke
bowls with his fish, the trout,

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.162
sturgeon, and his veggies.

00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:09.620
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Actually, we were

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.280
looking for knives
at that moment

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.210
too, because the Nenox shop
was right around the corner.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.500
And so that was part of it.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.250
We were hungry.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.020
SPEAKER 1: The market
just moved, I heard.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.220
BILL NGO: Did they move yet?

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.340
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I don't
think it shut down yet,

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.340
because Yoshi's--

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.510
SPEAKER 1: It's going to?

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.550
BILL NGO: It's going to, yeah.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.470
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
There's a fellow,

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.500
I wish I had his handle.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.590
If you guys love
that Tsukiji Market,

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.650
it is one of the coolest places.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.460
And one of our good friends is
a generations-old vendor there.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.340
He has been posting some of
the coolest images on Instagram

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.250
just for remembrances for him.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.170
He grew up there as a little
kid working his father's market,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.090
and it's been pretty
cool to see that.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.900
And speaking of
sustainable, he is

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.750
one of the few guys over
there pushing sustainability.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.020
And he gets a lot of pushback
from that over there.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:54.510
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.230
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Yeah.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.230
SPEAKER 1: What are the
main reasons that people

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.915
would say it's not beneficial?

00:12:58.915 --> 00:13:00.470
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I don't know
if it's not so beneficial,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.550
but there's just
a lot of culture.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.600
SPEAKER 1: Not as easy
to make a lot of money?

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.891
BILL NGO: It's just the
culture or the stigma that wild

00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:08.390
is still better,
and the best sushi

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.097
restaurants what to say all our
fish is wild, or wild bluefin.

00:13:12.097 --> 00:13:14.180
It's the stigma of thinking
wild the still better.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.765
SPEAKER 1: It's just a stigma.

00:13:14.765 --> 00:13:15.260
BILL NGO: Yeah.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.676
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Oddly enough, he

00:13:16.676 --> 00:13:19.140
was the one who began to
bring our catfish over

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.800
to the Tsukiji Fish Market.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.909
And here, sometimes catfish
is looked upon, you know,

00:13:25.909 --> 00:13:26.450
I don't know.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.890
But I love the texture of it.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.600
And once again, you raise
it well, it's fantastic.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.500
He was at the Monterey
Bay, and Bill was making.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.320
And we started doing a
catfish sashimi, basically.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.906
You remember when he was--
we were slicing away.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.170
BILL NGO: And he liked it,
and he brought it over.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.766
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Might have
been a little sake involved.

00:13:46.766 --> 00:13:47.634
A lot.

00:13:47.634 --> 00:13:49.800
SPEAKER 1: Well, I am super
excited to try the dish.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.606
Let's go for it.

00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:51.980
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Get to searing.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.430
BILL NGO: So we got a
little sturgeon fillet here.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:14:00.090
Like I said, it's been froze
and then defrosted just

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.870
to make this meat a
little bit more tender,

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.200
because this meat is really,
really dense and firm.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.950
And when you freeze it slow, it
kind of breaks down the meat.

00:14:14.037 --> 00:14:16.620
MICHAEL PASSMORE: So we're just
going to mark this real quick,

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.230
and hopefully not set
off anything here.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.281
And it just takes a
moment on each side.

00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:26.030
SPEAKER 1: Does anybody
have any questions

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.270
while we're watching this
deliciousness cook up?

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.680
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I
raise white sturgeon,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.120
and we also make some
caviar from that.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.920
And I do a striped
bass, a black bass.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.160
What else do I do?

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.910
A catfish and a silver carp.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.790
And then I co-op with my
neighbor on the trout,

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.730
although we were
probably going to start

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:52.594
doing that in our Oregon project
and do a freshwater salmon up

00:14:52.594 --> 00:14:53.593
there as well, probably.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.085
Now you should ask me why
do I raise those fish.

00:14:59.085 --> 00:15:02.200
AUDIENCE: Why do you
raise those fish?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.950
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Because I was riding

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.780
on the coattails of my mentor.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.370
I moved in next
door to a guy who's

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.460
been doing it for 35 years now.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.870
World-renowned expert.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:17.840
But mainly kind of going
back to raising fish well.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.680
You want to raise them in what
their natural environment is.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:26.190
And so for us, the temperatures
really worked for that.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.510
So you have to have the
least inputs into that.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.890
And so those temperatures, the
environment, the seasons all

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.050
work out very, very
well for those fish.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.870
Somebody might say,
well, why don't you

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.370
raise a saltwater fish.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.850
And it's just because why
try to create something that

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.040
isn't already existing there?

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.550
There's a lot of great
saltwater fish being raised.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.130
But they're raised in saltwater
environments, obviously,

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.530
and then you don't have
to recreate that and put

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.640
a bunch of salt into it.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.560
SPEAKER 1: Question?

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.935
AUDIENCE: So I
was wondering, you

00:16:03.935 --> 00:16:07.310
mentioned that
farm-raised fish isn't bad

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.680
if it's raised correctly.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.130
But if you're in the
store, how do you know?

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.750
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I'm sorry,
I missed the last part of it

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:12.820
there.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.153
SPEAKER 1: If you're in a store.

00:16:14.153 --> 00:16:17.470
MICHAEL PASSMORE: So I think
one of the best references--

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.510
and I used to not think
this several years ago,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.060
but they've done a lot of
work since-- is Monterey Bay

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.380
Aquarium's Seafood Watch.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:31.350
I really think that they do a
fantastic job of researching.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.180
They put the effort into it.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.370
They are listening to all
of the communities involved.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:42.960
And so they have both an
app, and you'll oftentimes

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.300
see that referenced on there.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:50.130
And they don't
sell their ratings.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.990
You can't get that
rating if you're just

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.440
really nice to them.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.050
And I think they're just a
really reputable organization

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.930
that I look to, and
that we converse

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.229
with a lot on our rearing
practices as well.

00:17:03.229 --> 00:17:04.020
Does that help out?

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.962
BILL NGO: Cool, so
we just combined

00:17:07.962 --> 00:17:08.920
all of the ingredients.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.900
We got the sturgeon
marked off on the grill.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.920
Some of the purple daikon.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.859
The fennel, onions, green
onions, a little sesame oil,

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.463
sugar, and soy.

00:17:19.463 --> 00:17:23.230
So we're just going to
toss everything together.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.379
There's been many, many
variations to do poke.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:27.920
You could use sea
salt instead of soy

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.280
and do sesame oil if
you're gluten free.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.132
You could add whatever you
want in there-- the veggies.

00:17:35.132 --> 00:17:37.590
MICHAEL PASSMORE: One thing I
forgot on your question, too.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.730
Seafood Watch not only
rates farmed fish, but also

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.850
wild fish.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.820
Which is super helpful,
because they really

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.200
do spend the effort, the money,
and all the resources to track

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.640
what species are being
overfished, underfished.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.880
And not just that
worldwide but also

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.110
originally, in
different fisheries.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.490
There's just a huge amount
of resources going into it,

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.950
and it's a major reason
why we support them.

00:18:04.632 --> 00:18:06.090
BILL NGO: Cool,
we're just bring it

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.490
over a little bit of
steamed, organic brown rice

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.400
from our friend's farm,
Rue and Foresman Ranch.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.024
Right there.

00:18:13.024 --> 00:18:14.480
What else?

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.581
And we're got a little bit of
trout from his ranch as well.

00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:22.032
Just putting that on the side.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.370
SPEAKER 1: We have one
question over here.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.020
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Yes, sir?

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.270
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could talk more

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.630
about the diet of the
fish that you raise

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.580
and how you keep that
sustainable as well.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.720
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Huge,
huge question all the time.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.490
I'm sorry we overlooked that.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.380
I'll speak from a couple
of different areas.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.610
I had the pleasure of
serving as president

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.010
of our whole association
for the state,

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.280
so I can speak on that
level a little bit.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.980
There are a lot of initiatives
into vegetarian feeds,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.210
these type of things that are
claimed to be more sustainable.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.030
I feel like we're learning still
a lot about that, where also

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.950
each fish is a little
bit different in the way

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.440
that they want to eat.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.780
So those are things that we
have to take into account too.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.500
Just like people.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.597
Some people, they're
vegan or vegetarian,

00:19:14.597 --> 00:19:15.680
they like to eat that way.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.790
Some of us are carnivores,
and we grow and eat

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.380
better that way.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.600
Fish are much the same.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.590
So for my farm, what
I do is, for instance,

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.710
the sturgeon has a
diet-- it needs about 68%

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.230
of its diet to be protein.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.060
And so we feel like,
as we've played

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.490
around a little bit with
different proteins within that,

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.950
we feel like fishmeal is
still a big part of that.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:44.346
But I limit it to a less
than 15% of that 68%.

00:19:44.346 --> 00:19:45.720
Let me know if
I'm boring anybody

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.320
with all these
percentages and such.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.530
I can geek out for a
while on this if you want.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.950
But what we've
found is that fish

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.640
is a large part of their diet.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.360
So we feel like they need to
have that scent, if you will,

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.090
for them to be
attracted to that feed,

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.610
and to grow and be healthy.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.180
But I did want to limit it,
because I didn't believe

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.140
in just throwing
a ton of fish meal

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.380
into it needlessly when
I can add other proteins

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.650
from other areas.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.930
And the fishmeal that
I do put in there,

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:23.610
we spec that to be scraps
from other processing areas.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.670
And so I feel like
that's a responsible way

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.090
to still get fishmeal
without sending

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:33.730
a boat out and harvesting that
just to go to a fish feed,

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.760
so to speak.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.867
The other, well, about
14% of it is fat.

00:20:38.867 --> 00:20:41.200
And then the other are just
the other essential vitamins

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.710
and elements that that
fish needs to grow as well.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.780
Fat's actually a
really important thing

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.140
for sturgeon in particular,
because if you reduce

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.570
the fat too much, then
they're not reproducing right,

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.690
and all that great fat's not
going into that wonderful roe

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.340
that some of you guys may
like with a little bit of salt

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.810
and cured in caviar for you.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.430
So the fat's very
important as well.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.719
Yes, I'm sorry, I'm
probably speaking

00:21:06.719 --> 00:21:08.010
a little ahead of myself there.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.550
Yes, we contract with
a feed manufacturer,

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.140
and we tell them, we say,
hey, here's our spec,

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.530
here's our ingredients.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.940
We want this to come
together, and I want

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.130
it to be certified to that.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.280
I want it to be certified
that it's chemical free.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.240
I don't want any other hormones.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.296
I don't want steroids in there.

00:21:28.296 --> 00:21:29.670
I don't want all
this crazy stuff

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.630
that maybe some other people
might like in their fish feed.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.870
That's not for me.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.170
And so they certify that
for us, and it comes out

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.960
into a pelleted form
of different sizes,

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.070
because when we have
little fish this big

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.870
to a couple-hundred-pound
sturgeon,

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.060
they're all going to take
different sized feeds

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.210
So we have talked about,
though, at some point, maybe

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.530
a finishing with some fish
or something in there.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.120
But we haven't gotten there yet.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:54.953
AUDIENCE: The first.

00:21:54.953 --> 00:21:57.560
Is there a reason why you chose
to sear the fish today rather

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.049
than just serve it purely raw?

00:21:59.049 --> 00:22:00.090
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Oh, oh!

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.170
I know, I know!

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:02.339
I'll let you tell.

00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:03.880
BILL NGO: It's just
a textural thing,

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.700
and to add another
layer of flavor,

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.324
to bring a little
smokiness to it too.

00:22:08.324 --> 00:22:09.620
That's the main thing, yeah.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.286
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:22:10.286 --> 00:22:13.230
And then the second
question for you, Chef Ngo.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.350
Were there any learnings
from Tsukiji Market

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.030
that you're going to take
back to your restaurant

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.070
and go forward with?

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.820
Tsukiji Market or
Japan otherwise.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.070
BILL NGO: Yeah, there's a lot.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.819
I think one of them
he just talking about,

00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:27.460
he didn't get into the feed.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.270
Well, he explained the
feed of the sturgeon,

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.810
but something we talked
about was finishing it.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.860
We learned some of the
fish farmers in Japan

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.610
would finish their
fish with citrus peels,

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.276
or somebody will grind
down citrus peels

00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:40.960
and put that in their
feed too to change

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.650
the flavor of the meat.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.370
And that's something
we've been talking

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:44.970
about he wants to mess with.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.670
So that's something learned
from the Tsukiji Market.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.180
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I learned
that-- what was a top tuna

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:52.930
auction that day?

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.970
It was like, $20,000
or something like.

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.320
BILL NGO: $25,000, yeah.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.350
MICHAEL PASSMORE: And so
we're walking in there.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.410
There's the fresh and
the frozen auctions.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.680
And so we're looking around
and we see these numbers

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.480
on the fish, these
little stickers.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.370
And I think that top one
was like, number four.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.350
And so I'm thinking,
well, number four, maybe I

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.130
want number one.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.440
Where's number one?

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.730
And all these are graded.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.470
Well, you go over
into the frozen aisle,

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.080
and we saw like,
number rating 487.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.290
It was huge.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.970
So their grading
process is that broad.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.570
I thought that was fascinating.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:29.360
And the uni auction
was super, super tight.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.672
And probably even more
scrutinized than the tuna,

00:23:34.672 --> 00:23:35.380
wouldn't you say?

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.610
BILL NGO: Yeah.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.401
MICHAEL PASSMORE: And
other than that, just

00:23:38.401 --> 00:23:42.490
the sheer and immense
size, the variety.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.840
BILL NGO: Just
the amount of fish

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.740
that is taken out of the ocean.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.960
That's why we're going
back to sustainability.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.180
Everybody wants wild
fish, but if you

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.872
see how much fish was going
through that market a day,

00:23:54.872 --> 00:23:56.830
and that's how much is
coming out of the ocean,

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.860
you will want to start looking
for another source of fish,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.260
which is farm-raised fish.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:02.910
A good farm-raised fish.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:03.900
MICHAEL PASSMORE: You
make a good point there.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.210
I'm not against wild
fish whatsoever.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.290
I enjoy a great wild fish.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:12.380
I think what has been
impressed upon me by Tsukiji

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.910
is just that, by all accounts,
our wild fisheries are fully

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.010
utilized, because all of
us are eating more fish,

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.020
and there's more
and more population,

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.700
and everybody's
growing and everything.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.690
And so that part of it-- we
speak about sustainability.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.030
That doesn't seem
really sustainable

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:34.030
if we continue to pull
more, and more, and more.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.790
And I'd like to continue to
enjoy nice, fresh, wild fish

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:37.290
too.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:42.300
So I think that a good
farmed fish has a real place

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.770
in the community of seafood.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.360
SPEAKER 1: So that brought
something to mind for me.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.230
So we recently obviously
lost our crab season

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.705
for the most part this year.

00:24:51.705 --> 00:24:53.080
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Boy, didn't we.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.691
What an impact.

00:24:54.691 --> 00:24:56.190
SPEAKER 1: That's
something that may

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.420
continue to happen with other
fish populations in the wild.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.290
As our climate shifts and
all these other things

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.990
are happening, is this
yet another reason

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.170
why controlling as many
variables as possible

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.620
could be beneficial in terms
of maintaining our supply?

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.530
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I
think it does offer,

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.980
oftentimes-- I'm not
immune to having issues

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.320
with raising animals.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.080
Animals sometimes do
have health issues,

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.260
or they die, or
otherwise, or have issues

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.850
like the crab or something.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:32.380
But certainly we don't deal
with some of the oceanic weather

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.210
forces and warming or
otherwise, whatever

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.590
your particular
philosophy is on that.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.700
And it does seem that some
warming is causing some algae.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:46.340
And you hear about the fish
dying in a port or something.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.020
And it's because
they're schooling fish,

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.780
they've lost oxygen in there.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.700
And so they swim and swim
and swim until they perish,

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.380
because there's just
not enough oxygen.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.150
I do think that that will
have an effect on and on.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:04.650
And I hope that other folks,
aquaculturists, continue

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:07.800
to raise good fish to
help offset that and do it

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.240
in a responsible manner that's
not overly consuming resources.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.950
SPEAKER 1: Are you
seeing in an uptick

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.420
in that idea of aquaculturists?

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.110
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Not so much
in California, oddly enough.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:23.990
I live in an area where there's
quite a few aquaculturists,

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.460
some long-time standing guys.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.120
But in California, we're a
fairly small little industry,

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.860
oddly enough.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.600
SPEAKER 1: That's surprising.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.640
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Oddly enough.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.895
SPEAKER 1: Why do
you think that is?

00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:36.380
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
I think that we

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.490
will see more as California
continues to think about what

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.610
offshore looks like for us.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:44.210
Can that be done responsibly?

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.500
Can that be done in a way
that doesn't interfere

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:53.790
with wild fishing, environmental
concerns-- "viewsheds,"

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.760
I believe they call them there.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.711
I think as we can
look into that,

00:26:57.711 --> 00:26:59.210
I think you're going
to start to see

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.460
a lot more investment in that,
and a lot more production--

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.650
healthy production
for our state here.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.650
SPEAKER 1: Are there other
parts of the US where

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.245
it's a more common practice?

00:27:08.245 --> 00:27:09.370
MICHAEL PASSMORE: There is.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.250
I believe the Gulf of
Mexico is doing it.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.510
I'm not sure on the
East Coast right now,

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.290
but some of those areas
are also a lot easier

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.460
to basically put a straw in.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.690
There is a abalone farm,
some friends of ours,

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.310
and it is one of the coolest
operations you've ever seen.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.900
They've got a huge
straw, and it comes in,

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.780
and they raise
millions of pounds

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.000
of abalone, which is delicious.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.910
I could eat that forever.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.430
And then it goes back out
purer than it came in,

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.780
because the abalone
are a filtering device.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.330
It's one of the coolest things
I've ever seen out there.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.330
SPEAKER 1: That's fascinating.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.580
I love the ingenuity there.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.430
Anybody else?

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:49.471
AUDIENCE: I do, actually.

00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:51.170
SPEAKER 1: Chef!

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.900
So, for the benefit
of our friends

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:58.060
who are going to watch this on
YouTube later, one of our chefs

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.020
is wondering if you'll tell us
a little bit about your process.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.770
From the moment he places
an order, what happens?

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.010
How fresh is the product that's
actually being delivered?

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.470
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Sure.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.320
I'm going to back it up just
a few minutes though, here.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.110
So when I first started
serving guys like Bill,

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:17.890
it was all just cut to order,
because our volume really

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.472
wasn't that big, and we
could make that work.

00:28:22.472 --> 00:28:23.680
BILL NGO: It was still alive.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.221
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Well, this is true.

00:28:25.221 --> 00:28:26.620
It was really cut to order there

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.660
SPEAKER 1: Real fresh.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.201
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
So then we advanced

00:28:29.201 --> 00:28:31.900
into that Bill would say,
hey, I need this, and OK.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.120
So we'd process it, and
we'd bring it over to him

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.180
pretty much day, thereafter.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.170
I mean, really
short supply chain.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:44.040
Well, when you start dealing
with the Googleplex here,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:44.840
it's enormous.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.800
I mean, Bill and
I just got crushed

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.710
over there doing sushi service.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.460
It's like this wave
of humanity came in,

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.730
and everybody wanted
sushi, and I'm like--

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.220
SPEAKER 1: Did any of you
join them for sushi today?

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:56.720
No?

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.222
You did?

00:28:57.222 --> 00:28:58.430
I missed that, I'm so bitter.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.830
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Were you the guy

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.050
that about knocked out
our friend [? Kimio? ?]

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.360
Was that you?

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.882
Somebody gave him an elbow
to get out of the way.

00:29:05.882 --> 00:29:07.715
SPEAKER 1: That does
not sound very Googley.

00:29:07.715 --> 00:29:09.490
I don't think that happened.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.990
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
It was good sushi,

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.420
so they're like, nothing's
standing in the way.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.192
But what Chef brought up, what
has been really fun for us,

00:29:17.192 --> 00:29:18.900
and what's been really
cool to work with,

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.880
like Lauren over there.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.070
Hello, Lauren.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.290
SPEAKER 1: Hi, Lauren!

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.480
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Is
working through how

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.550
do we get processed
an enormous amount

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:32.240
and still maintain our standard
of very, very tight-- now,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.170
the sturgeon, we don't bring
that out for four days.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.950
It really needs four days.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.280
But that's factored
into our timeline.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:46.820
The rest of it is day after,
day in, maybe 12, 13 hours tops.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.850
Depends on when it
gets served to you.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.070
But in order to keep
doing that, they've

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.040
really been working
with us with throwing

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.779
their orders out earlier.

00:29:55.779 --> 00:29:57.820
This is what their technology
and everything does

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.880
for us, and their forecasting.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.900
And it's been what an exercise
for us too, and a real pleasure

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.420
to work with the folks
that get all of you

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.710
guys this food, to be able
to utilize that to-- gosh,

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.100
we're bringing in several
thousand pounds a week

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.080
here to Google.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.140
And to be able to do
that in a manner that

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:23.170
keeps that lead time less
than 48 hours, oftentimes.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.060
And that's pretty incredible
at that kind of scale,

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.600
because otherwise
what's happening

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.260
is if it's out on a ship, or
if it's across the country,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.110
then it's processed.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:36.200
And not necessarily anything
bad about that, per se.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.950
It's just a lengthier
supply chain.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.340
And so then it hops
on a truck, typically,

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.760
comes over, and then
goes to the distributor,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.140
comes over to Chef there,
and then comes to you guys.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.670
SPEAKER 1: So we've got
an abbreviated supply

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:52.080
chain when we partner with?

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.330
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Pretty much.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:57.040
It comes from comes from
our ranch right down here,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.620
and our drivers leave bright
and early at 3:30 in the morning

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.607
to get it to you guys.

00:31:03.607 --> 00:31:04.690
SPEAKER 1: That's amazing.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.290
We try to partner with farmers
locally as often as we possibly

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.966
can to make sure that
not just your proteins,

00:31:10.966 --> 00:31:12.340
but your veggies
and all of those

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.360
are as fresh and
local as possible.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.430
MICHAEL PASSMORE: You
guys do an astounding job

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.640
for the immensity
of the operation

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.115
and the quality of food.

00:31:22.115 --> 00:31:23.240
I've thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.530
My lunch here was great today.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.950
SPEAKER 1: We serve
150,000 meals a day.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.200
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Is that all?

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.224
SPEAKER 1: That's it.

00:31:29.224 --> 00:31:30.840
No big deal.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.007
Globally.

00:31:32.007 --> 00:31:33.840
MICHAEL PASSMORE: And
Bill's looking forward

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.475
to a 12-person sushi
bar in the future.

00:31:36.475 --> 00:31:38.460
He's like, I want to
serve 12 people a night.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.230
That's what I want to do.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.063
BILL NGO: That's it.

00:31:40.063 --> 00:31:43.170
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, sushi is a
hot commodity around here.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.060
We don't have to many
sushi bars at Google,

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.360
but you certainly
saw the demand.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.250
Anybody else?

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:52.980
Last couple questions while
our dish is finished up?

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.230
MICHAEL PASSMORE: And I will
say as you go over there,

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.950
if you are in Sacramento,
go out of your way

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.240
to go see Bill at Kru.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.530
And it's on J Street.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:06.720
I've been all over the
world, I love to eat sushi.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.770
And the sushi that I've
had sitting at Bill's bar

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.340
has been, bar none,
some of the finest.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:18.180
His sourcing, his skills, I
can't say enough about the guy.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.950
I hope his head doesn't get
too big for his hat right now.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:25.684
But anyways, question?

00:32:25.684 --> 00:32:27.100
AUDIENCE: One of
the reasons I try

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.474
to get most of my
animal protein,

00:32:28.474 --> 00:32:31.170
or almost all, from seafood
is-- this kind of terrible,

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.850
but I feel like
fish and things are

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.360
sort of lower consciousness
than land animals.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:36.800
MICHAEL PASSMORE: They are.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.258
AUDIENCE: But I'm
curious from you,

00:32:38.258 --> 00:32:42.670
working so extensively with
fish, if you feel that's true.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.480
I know there's sort
of debate amongst

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.454
the scientific community
about what lobsters

00:32:46.454 --> 00:32:48.620
go through when they're
boiled and things like that.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.430
I'm curious, just sort
of your experience

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.231
on whether this is true.

00:32:52.231 --> 00:32:53.980
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I
am more familiar-- I'm

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.650
glad you brought that
up, because I do.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:59.365
I see that animal
welfare is a hot topic.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.500
I haven't seen what
I would consider

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:10.990
to be irrefutable proof
showing that a fish has

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:15.550
the mental capacity
to experience pain.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.510
When we talk about pain
and those kind of things,

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:22.370
it's different when you have
a reaction to something.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.410
That is an environmental thing.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.389
Does anybody
remember roly polies?

00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:29.680
Everybody knows what those are?

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.460
I'm a Texas boy.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.420
We used to get our little
magnifying glasses out,

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.710
[ZAPPING SOUND] you know?

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.660
They're not experiencing
pain, per se.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.050
What you saw happening there
was just a physical reaction

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.510
to that stimuli.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.000
So you were spot on.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.540
Their neuro makeup,
a fish-- and I'm

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.406
not talking about mammal fish.

00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:55.450
I'm talking about shrimp or
bass, these type of things.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:59.885
They do not have the same
processing abilities as, say,

00:33:59.885 --> 00:34:03.520
a human, or my cute
little puppy, or otherwise

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.280
to experience it in the same
way that some of, like you said,

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.127
your upper-level animals would.

00:34:09.127 --> 00:34:11.210
AUDIENCE: You had talked
a little bit about stress

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.010
before, trying to keep
the stress levels equal.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.540
I'm a bit more curious about
whether-- in your experience

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.940
of being a fish farmer
for a while now,

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.690
you sort of get to
know them a bit better.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.380
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Right, I'll clarify.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:30.830
When I talk about stress, I
am talking about in energy.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.110
For instance, if I am
thinking a whole lot,

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:37.429
if I have a lot of troubles or
something and I'm stressed out,

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.270
I'm not talking about if
I'm happy or sad in that.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.790
I'm talking about
the energy that I

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:46.080
may be utilizing in order
to deal with those stresses.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.780
I'm talking about
that with the fish,

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.820
not that they are happy or sad.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.330
From a personal or an anecdotal,
if you're asking for that,

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.969
I do see behaviors.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.980
I don't see personalities
in those fish.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.740
They're really terrible
pets, quite frankly.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:07.380
But certainly amongst some of
our larger sturgeon and such

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.970
that we're growing
out for caviar, sure.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:15.650
Can I relate behaviors to
almost cute personalities,

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.690
so to speak?

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.910
If I really wanted to
stretch that far, sure.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.960
But really, all
they're hoping for is

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.960
that I'm coming by with
feed when they come up

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.650
and they bring their nose up,
and they're looking, going,

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:26.150
hey, buddy.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.320
You got any feed for me?

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.940
Because that's what
they're used to.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.204
That's what they've been--
Pavlov's dog, basically.

00:35:32.204 --> 00:35:34.120
You ring the bell and
they get the food there.

00:35:34.735 --> 00:35:36.610
AUDIENCE: The sturgeon,
you raise them from--

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:37.510
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I should've
brought some, right?

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.560
That's the question?

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.305
"Where is the caviar?"

00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:43.680
AUDIENCE: So you raise them
for like, seven, eight years.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.680
And then in their first
full reproductive year,

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.746
you cut them open, take out
the caviar, and sell the flesh.

00:35:50.746 --> 00:35:52.245
There's several
techniques that I've

00:35:52.245 --> 00:35:55.430
read about for taking out
caviar without killing the fish.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.830
Why have those not caught on?

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:59.800
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Lots
of reasons, actually.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.825
So first of all, I
will say that I'm

00:36:01.825 --> 00:36:03.200
learning that I
really don't like

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.890
the first reproductive cycle.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.870
I like the second
reproductive cycle.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.330
It's a stronger, more robust
egg, these kind of things.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:13.410
So you're talking about
no-kill caviar, right?

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.290
That sounded like a fantastic
idea, because shoot,

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:20.850
why couldn't we take a
resource, get caviar from it

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.710
year after year
after year, and we

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.850
wouldn't have to grow them
up to seven to 10 years old?

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.660
Wow, wouldn't that be great?

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.390
So here's the problems.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.540
In any facility or otherwise,
like when they designed

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.650
this kitchen, the put a certain
amount of stations in there.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:40.310
And so it makes it difficult
to facilitate more than what

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:41.800
it's able to do.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.900
So in our environment,
you have things that

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.460
are sized to certain sizes.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.160
So as that fish
continues to grow

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.280
in kind of a fantasy world,
so to speak, of no kill,

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.430
soon you'd be dealing
with a 400-pound fish.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.200
That can be troublesome.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.330
Bill, how is it to deal
with 150-pound fish?

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:03.810
BILL NGO: Crazy.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:07.170
MICHAEL PASSMORE: They are
extremely strong animals.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.090
We call them like,
monkey strong,

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:14.290
because when you're in their
environment, they outpower you.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.940
So there's that aspect of it.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.360
But when we get into just
pure quality of caviar,

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.100
and I've experienced
some of the no kill,

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.080
I think it's a fascinating idea.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.640
But what I'm not
real excited about is

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.660
that, in layman's
terms, basically they're

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.250
injecting a hormone
into that fish

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.830
so that you can spawn it just
as if we were spawning fish

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.090
to make up our next
fish class, so to speak.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:42.600
So you milk that fish,
basically pushing those eggs out

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.100
through the vent there.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.010
Well, those eggs, then,
from those hormones,

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:50.140
they have a very porous
cell wall to them.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.400
Porous cell wall is code
word for mushy eggs.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.570
And as a general rule,
people who enjoy caviar

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:58.220
are not looking for jam.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.490
They're looking for a
nice bead, a nice pop,

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:02.990
these kind of things.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.994
So those folks knew that
and they said, gosh, we

00:38:04.994 --> 00:38:05.660
don't want that.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.520
We have to figure out how
to close up that cell wall.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.670
So then they dip
it into a chemical

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.280
that then chemically
alters that and makes

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.740
that cell wall tighter
and a much tighter bead.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:22.000
None of that really gets me
too excited, quite frankly.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.630
I suspect, maybe at
some point in time,

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:31.760
if they could modulate that
chemical to make for a medium

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:37.150
or maybe not as tight, because
personally I prefer caviar

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.930
that I don't have to chew.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.000
And so those are
almost like-- did

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.930
you ever decorate your
cupcakes with those little BBs?

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.380
That's what it kind
of reminded me of.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.750
Flavor was fine, flavor was OK.

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.260
But I was chasing
the caviar around.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.800
So I think those present some
issues for that technology

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.610
to go forth.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:01.060
But in theory, it sounds
absolutely fantastic.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.410
I think there's just some
logistical challenges to it

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.910
is all.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:04.970
SPEAKER 1: Not there yet.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:05.800
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Yeah.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.620
SPEAKER 1: Maybe in the future.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.536
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Like
a lot of things though,

00:39:08.536 --> 00:39:10.906
everything's advancing,
and certainly open to

00:39:10.906 --> 00:39:12.030
if they can solve that one.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.321
I don't think I'm going to
be the one solving that one,

00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:17.550
but we'll see what
everybody else does.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:18.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:18.480
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Hi!

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.855
AUDIENCE: So different fish
are sold at different prices.

00:39:20.855 --> 00:39:24.000
Is it harder to raise some
kind of fish than others?

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.700
SPEAKER 1: And is your pricing
model based on difficulty?

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.410
Is it a skill level?

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.670
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I
think it's both a skill.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:35.550
I think there's are some what
the market will bear or not

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.340
bear.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.520
Like salmon, for instance.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.150
Salmon has an awesome
marketing team.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:44.540
I mean, we all expect
salmon to be on the plate

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.300
everywhere, right?

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.650
So I think that there
are issues of market

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.290
that go towards price.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:56.040
Mainly what you're looking
at, though, is inputs.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.330
So what does it cost
to raise that fish?

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.870
And that's not necessarily
given to expertise.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.770
It can be like higher protein.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:06.570
We were talking
about feeds there.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:09.690
More protein in it,
those type of fish,

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.010
that feed costs a lot more.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:15.230
So we have to factor that in
in feed conversion ratios.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.400
I'm going to nerd out
here for a minute again,

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.750
but the better the
conversion ratio is,

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:24.850
the more you can
produce at a lower cost.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:30.110
But yes, some of it is
rarity or expertise.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.600
We are going to find out how
well we did at striped bass

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.470
this year.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:39.720
I know that we hatched
nearly 10 million eggs.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.880
Nearly 10 million eggs!

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.200
But I don't expect to get
all of those fish out.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.920
We will find out when they
go into about a little larger

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.571
than a sac fry.

00:40:48.571 --> 00:40:50.945
SPEAKER 1: Could you even
accommodate 10 millions striped

00:40:50.945 --> 00:40:51.030
bass?

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.880
MICHAEL PASSMORE: No, and
that's why we hatched so many,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.320
because we knew--

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.440
SPEAKER 1: It's like a wedding.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.733
You hope not everybody comes.

00:40:55.733 --> 00:40:56.816
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Exactly!

00:40:56.816 --> 00:40:57.642
Over-invite.

00:40:57.642 --> 00:40:58.600
SPEAKER 1: Over-invite.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.016
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Our striped bass

00:41:00.016 --> 00:41:01.270
are over-invited right now.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.515
SPEAKER 1: So what is
the most complicated fish

00:41:03.515 --> 00:41:06.320
you've attempted to farm in
terms of number of inputs,

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.295
or complexity of
the inputs required?

00:41:08.295 --> 00:41:10.420
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Right
now I will say, hands down,

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.190
my striped bass.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:16.050
They have been extremely
challenging this year.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:18.610
It is a fish that we're
just getting into.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.890
We see them as a great fish.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:23.850
Someone was asking why
do we grow what we grow.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:26.740
Well, striped bass used to be a
great fish that a lot of people

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.670
would grow, but they grew
it for stocking purposes,

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.460
because they didn't travel
well to the live Asian markets.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.530
Because once they went in,
they're such a fragile fish,

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:36.570
they would die.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.610
Well, live market, dead
fish, that doesn't quite

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.110
work quite as well.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.290
But for us, in a
processing environment,

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:44.560
it's a fantastic fish.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.040
But we really, really
struggled with it.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.960
This was our first
big year into it,

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.340
and it's a challenging
fish to spawn.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.520
Really challenging.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.610
SPEAKER 1: What's the
easiest one you've done?

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.840
MICHAEL PASSMORE: My
friend, the catfish.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.060
The catfish love to propagate.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.610
They just love to propagate.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.831
You put a little music
on beside the lake.

00:42:06.831 --> 00:42:08.330
SPEAKER 1: They do
the work for you.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.163
MICHAEL PASSMORE: It
is, it's pretty simple.

00:42:10.163 --> 00:42:13.130
We put out milk cans,
basically, that creates

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.514
little caves for them.

00:42:14.514 --> 00:42:16.180
We're recreating that,
and you would not

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.790
believe that it's these
antique milk cans.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.060
That is the secret to it.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.610
We've tried to replicate
it in plastic and all

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:25.910
these other things, because
those milk cans are not

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.986
easy to come by, and people
want like a million bucks

00:42:28.986 --> 00:42:30.110
for these silly things now.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.570
SPEAKER 1: Super romantic
for a catfish, though.

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:32.528
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Yeah.

00:42:32.528 --> 00:42:35.470
So you put those out there,
and you go out in there,

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:39.560
and usually Papa Catfish is
in their guarding the eggs.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.680
But all in all, super
simple fish to deal with.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.740
SPEAKER 1: I like it.

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.281
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
And that's actually

00:42:46.281 --> 00:42:49.019
because we probably don't have
to mess with them too much.

00:42:49.019 --> 00:42:50.560
SPEAKER 1: Interfere
that much, yeah.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.970
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Back to
the interference thing.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.136
SPEAKER 1: Like we said,
and streamline the process.

00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:55.660
Do you have--

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.560
AUDIENCE: Most
underrated fish that you

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.150
see becoming more popular
in the next couple years.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.597
You'd mentioned catfish earlier.

00:43:01.597 --> 00:43:03.060
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Ooh.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.616
Bill, what do you think on that?

00:43:04.616 --> 00:43:05.470
BILL NGO: What was the question?

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.670
SPEAKER 1: What's
the dark horse?

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.920
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Yeah,
underrated fish that you think

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.112
is coming up.

00:43:10.112 --> 00:43:11.570
SPEAKER 1: We want
to get in early.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.550
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Like they've
got a weak marketing team,

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:14.049
yeah.

00:43:14.049 --> 00:43:15.700
They got a weak marketing team.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.480
What's coming up?

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:16.624
SPEAKER 1: Salmon?

00:43:16.624 --> 00:43:17.124
So over it.

00:43:17.124 --> 00:43:19.481
What's next?

00:43:19.481 --> 00:43:21.230
MICHAEL PASSMORE: What
do you think, Bill?

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.360
BILL NGO: I would say it's
the sturgeon right now.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:23.870
MICHAEL PASSMORE: You think?

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:24.060
BILL NGO: Yeah.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:24.982
SPEAKER 1: Sturgeon.

00:43:24.982 --> 00:43:27.190
MICHAEL PASSMORE: I mean,
we are seeing it on a lot I

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.500
more menus.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:27.660
BILL NGO: You guys see
it a lot at restaurants?

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.100
Not really, right?

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.600
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Yeah, we're
seeing it on a lot more menus,

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.460
and I think it's just interested
people like y'all that are

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:40.150
willing to go past that easily
marketed or that familiar fish.

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.510
I'm an adventurous eater.

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.210
I'll eat anything, anytime.

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.600
We had some fantastic
horse in Japan.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.422
It was fantastic,
I really loved it.

00:43:48.422 --> 00:43:49.630
SPEAKER 1: Did you say horse?

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:50.520
MICHAEL PASSMORE:
Horse, absolutely.

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.860
SPEAKER 1: Like, H-O-R-S-E?

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:56.190
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Yes,
like [NEIGHING] Mr. Ed.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.892
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:43:56.892 --> 00:43:58.350
BILL NGO: So I
guess the sturgeon--

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.620
I'll go with him on that.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.130
I wasn't going to go to one
of our fish, specifically.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:06.290
But I think that caviar
production is rising.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:12.430
And so through that, the level
of sturgeon is out there more,

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.350
and I think there's more
resources behind it,

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.489
so I think you're going
to hear more about it.

00:44:16.489 --> 00:44:18.280
And they're taking
really good care of them

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.990
fish so that they get
a great roe from it.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.800
So it stands to reason, I
think Bill's probably right

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.600
that that would be
an up-and-comer.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.933
SPEAKER 1: Please join me, then.

00:44:26.933 --> 00:44:28.420
Thank you guys so
much for coming.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.210
MICHAEL PASSMORE: Thank
you for having me.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.090
Thank you, Bill.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:34.740
[APPLAUSE]
