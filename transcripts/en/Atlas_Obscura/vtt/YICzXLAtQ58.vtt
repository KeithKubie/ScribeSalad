00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.458
In the middle of the Turkmenistan desert

00:00:02.458 --> 00:00:05.041
 is a 230 foot wide hole 

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.458
and the hole 

00:00:06.458 --> 00:00:08.000
 it’s on fire 

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:16.542
 In 1971 a group of Soviet petroleum geologists 

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:18.625
 set out across the desert of Turkmenistan 

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:20.875
 and they were on the hunt for petroleum 

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.458
 and when they found a place 

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:25.583
that they thought would be full of oil 

00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:27.792
 they decided to set up a drilling rig 

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:29.875
 unfortunately for them 

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:33.750
 they set this drilling rig up over what turned out to be 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.375
 an enormous cavern of natural gas 

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:40.208
and when they punched in through the top of the desert 

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:43.375
 the entire thing collapsed, taking the drilling rig with it 

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:46.125
 and even more problematic than that 

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.250
 now leaking from this gigantic hole 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.291
 was methane gas 

00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.959
 which is a potentially deadly and definitely super explosive gas 

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:58.875
 so the Soviet geologists did what was for them 

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:01.125
 the sensible thing 

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.583
 they lit the hole on fire 

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.917
 The scientists thought when they lit this crater of fire 

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.875
 that it would burn for a few weeks, maybe a few months 

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:13.667
 and then it would just extinguish itself 

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.959
 It has been burning for over 40 years 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.250
 locals call this the gates of hell 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.083
or the door to hell 

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:25.417
 or more scientifically, the Darvaza Gas Crater 

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:27.333
 In 2009 the Turkmen president 

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.792
 declared that he wanted the gates of hell closed 

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:33.041
 Capped. That is was an embarrassment to the country 

00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:34.458
 but that hasn’t happened 

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:39.959
 In fact, the Gates of Hell have become a kind of tourist site 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.500
 even the minister of tourism 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
 now sites it as one of their major attractions 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.208
 and for a country that only sees 

00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:49.208
 between ten and fifteen thousand tourists a year 

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:52.750
 it’s a big deal that people are excited 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.875
 to go to the gates of hell. 

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:59.333
 It’s also said that the crater attracts 

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.333
 local spiders, drawn to the light and the heat 

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.083
 which come to the edge of the crater 

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:05.583
 and then throw themselves into it. 

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:08.792
 Presumably they are trying to reunite themselves 

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:10.000
 with their dark lord 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.375
 the crater has been burning for 40 years 

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:16.083
 and there is no telling when it will stop 

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:19.500
 but with continued tourist interest 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.875
 it’s likely that it may be burning for some time to come
