1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,983
Okay.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,230
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:07,770
Just before Friday, Monday
morning podcast. And

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,110
just checking. Just checking in
on you. Just checking in on you.

5
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:20,040
What's going on now? It's
been a sad week, you know,

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,800
for standup comedians.
It's been a sad week.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,090
Joe De Rosa has decided to
retire. No, I'm kidding. Um,

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,400
why did I pick, why did I pick John
Room? Because his birthday's coming up.

9
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:36,450
Everybody wish Joe de Rosa happy
birthday on Sunday. All right.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,470
On Twitter.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,060
Yeah.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,950
You call them twinkle toes. You call
them whatever you want, but just,

13
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:47,640
just, just wishing me happy
birthday. Anyways. Um,

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,370
what am I talking about here? Uh, it's a
sad day in stand up comedy because, uh,

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,320
that fucking Scaramucci guy got fired.

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,470
I know it happened a few days ago,
but I don't pay attention.

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,640
I don't do a podcast every couple of
days. What do you want from me? Huh? Well,

18
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,000
Bill, you know, we'd
like to fill, you know,

19
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,170
you know some Douche sent me something
on Twitter. He goes, hey bill,

20
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:11,770
please read the news before you
do your podcast on North Korea.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,840
Shot off a nuclear warhead or a
missile or something. And I'm tilting.

22
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,030
My head goes, it wasn't no killer
with some sort of ballistic,

23
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:22,020
whatever the fuck that means. It's a
giant mad that could make it to Chicago.

24
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:24,540
That's the way I heard it.
And I looked it up and it wasn't nuclear.

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,180
So I wrote him back. I said, I come,

26
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,390
it wasn't nuclear.
You fucking dope.

27
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,680
Stop back and like you're too smart
to listen to my dumb podcast. I Dunno.

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,900
And then now whenever I call
people out on that, they go, oh,

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,680
she's looking for a reaction.
Oh, where are Ya? Ya. Yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,500
Take your comment and fucking go home.
Right. You're not in the sandbox anymore.

31
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,720
He got to run away. Huh? You're going to
go down there and hide under the scaredy

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,010
Yamada, Huh? Um, SCARAMUCCI
got fired. Fucking sucks.

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,290
Everybody says they want somebody honest.

34
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,980
And this guy goes in and he literally
just says what he's thinking.

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,880
I didn't know how to say
that guy. Renzi rance, r e I.

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,240
N c e tell me what it means to me.
Um,

37
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,300
rents he says is a fucking
paranoid schizophrenia.

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,410
Uh, paranoiacs, whatever the hell
that means. And he goes, I'm not sure.

39
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:21,870
Like Steve Bannon.
I'm not trying to suck my old caulk.

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,260
I'm not trying to build my own brand.
I'm here to serve the country.

41
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,610
I mean Jesus Christ.

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,680
What more do you want from
somebody in the White House?

43
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,380
Is it cause he said Cock,
is it,

44
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,390
cause he said fucking like these people
who go in there like Obama who speak

45
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:41,580
eloquently and just fucking,
you know,

46
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,210
hit a jump shot every fucking once in
a while. Now. My God, he's so cool.

47
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,880
I don't, I really don't. And I
fucking given up on people, you know,

48
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,030
that's how people are. And
when, when, when fucking, uh,

49
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,080
when George Karl had
died and what's his face?

50
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,530
The guy there who fucking
was always grabbing a,

51
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:03,100
or whatever the hell he was doing,
kept settling out of court, you know,

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,993
like led Zeppelin?

53
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:09,920
Yeah.

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
Yeah.
He does his tribute to George Carlin.

55
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,320
It's MD sitting there shitting on
him for fucking cursing too much.

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,313
I Dunno.

57
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,060
That's a fucking shame,
man. That is a f uh,

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,980
that is a real fucking shame
that that guy is gone. You know?

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,181
So what did we get it?

60
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,880
We're going to have somebody who we're
going to have a clean comic go in there

61
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,200
who still lies his ass off. But
where's the sweater? I mean,

62
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,440
if you can get past cock and fucking,
he basically said,

63
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:42,730
I'm not here for my own needs.
I'm not here to,

64
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:47,590
to advance myself. Actually, you
know, that's a lie. All right?

65
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:51,580
He's a liar too. But he was a fun
liar. Come on people. The Fun,

66
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,140
the guy was fun.

67
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,143
Okay.

68
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,000
He goes, I'm not a backstabber. I'm
more of a front stabber. I mean, this,

69
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,460
this was like,
it's like what if,

70
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,310
what if fucking somebody you watch good
fellas too much got to be in the office.

71
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:05,700
Right?

72
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,520
And he never took it debating class that
no one ever told them not to curse into

73
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,700
the microphone. I mean,
is it this one? I mean,

74
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,130
isn't that what the Internet is all about?

75
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:16,860
Isn't that why the Internet blew
up at the end of the fucking day?

76
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,660
Isn't that why it blew up.

77
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,920
It's not because you wanted to go on there
and research how fucking seagulls fly

78
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,580
from one side of the beach to the other
and all those other fun filled facts you

79
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:30,480
can find on a website you went on
cause you wanted to see Teddy's,

80
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,380
you wanted to see some pussy and
you wanted some uncensored language.

81
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,490
Isn't that what you wanted?

82
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,580
And look how much better society
is now because of the Internet.

83
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,640
Uh, you know something, if I
was ever on the debating team,

84
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,770
they would need to be another
person there. Okay. First of all,

85
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,510
because I'm not good at debating.
And second of all,

86
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,800
I ended up undoing all of my points
during my argument. You know,

87
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,740
like if you ever debated
me like the worst,

88
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,520
the most apprehensive you'd get is you
bring your eyebrows up like half. Like Oh,

89
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,180
oh, oh, okay. They come back then.
Okay. He just fucked the whole thing up.

90
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,870
He just fucked it all up like
Scaramucci did aren't you get him all,

91
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:15,710
look who's here. Hey, I know you're
doing your podcast and then leaving.

92
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:17,870
So where are you guys going?
Wow.

93
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,460
You got oatmeal on your forearm to
clean up and get ready to start the day.

94
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,610
Okay. Kiss Goodbye.
Little princess you. Huh?

95
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,150
You eating oatmeal and bananas?
Just like Yo man now. Huh? You got,

96
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,920
we got mush them up pretty good.
It's just called the podcast sweetheart.

97
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,760
About who?

98
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,203
No,

99
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,410
I'm talking about scare a
Moochie the MOOC. The MOOC.

100
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,720
I want to scare a MOOC audios will
judge. Oh yeah, the daily news.

101
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,390
[inaudible] and then the other one's a

102
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,200
Henry in our writing when Henry Good
milk came up with a Mooc. There it is.

103
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,430
That's what he would have had for the
fucking great.

104
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,830
Okay. All right ladies.
Okay, I'll go to work.

105
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,050
Bye Bye.
Alright.

106
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,030
Um, yeah, you know something.

107
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,470
Parenting has entered a new scary phase.
This is where she's mobile.

108
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,620
She's going mow bile
and I don't give a shit.

109
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,630
Like if there was a cobra on the floor,

110
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,050
she'd grab it by its neck and try
to stick it into her mouth. I mean,

111
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,940
I had her on the floor the other day.

112
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:38,150
I thought I had everything all cleaned
up and I got one of these casino rugs.

113
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,940
Basically you're the ones with all
the different colors on and be like,

114
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,320
oh my God. Is that from the Orient?
No, it's from fucking leash man.

115
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,840
Right. And uh, it's fucking, you know,

116
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,770
you can't see stuff.

117
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:54,290
So I remember I was stretching
before I worked out like an old man.

118
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,530
I got stretch, right? And I saw
one of those spongy earplugs on,

119
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:01,940
on the ground and I was like,
note to self, pick that up.
And I was just, you know,

120
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:04,640
being a neat freak, cause I've
never had a baby crawling around.

121
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:07,970
So long story short,
I'm hanging out here with my lovely wife.

122
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,220
My daughter's crawling on the
floor and I see her in a tongue,

123
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,980
looks like it's purple.
And I'm like,

124
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,950
what's says that are tongue with the
fuck's going on with their tongue?

125
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,550
And then she kind of was moving it
around a guy, I guess it's all right.

126
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,460
Cause the earplug was purple by the way.
She wasn't like losing oxygen and then,

127
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,700
yeah, he goes, yeah, no, she's looking
down. She's fine. Oh Jesus Christ.

128
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,040
I can pull that out

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,470
and I can't even begin
to tell you like the,

130
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,210
when something like hap that
happens to you, to your kid,

131
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,050
when you drive to work, you get in a
cab and you're gonna sit in the subway.

132
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:45,350
However the fuck you get to work, you ride
a tricycle with the giant front wheel,

133
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:48,650
however you get to work, you're not even
paying attention to what you're doing.

134
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,070
All that's going on is a
fucking movie in your head.

135
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,270
That would make Stanley Kubrick fucking,
I don't know what

136
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,750
Stephen came one of those
fucking guys freak out.

137
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:02,000
Like just the stuff I was thinking about.
Like you know,

138
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,540
the worst case scenario
of all of that and now,

139
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:10,220
so now there is nothing on the fucking
ground. All right, we got those things.

140
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:12,410
You stick on the tables on the corners,
you know,

141
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:16,130
so they don't hit the corner with their
head. Evidently it's okay. The rest of it,

142
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,190
they fucking give themself a
face rub along the fucking Dasha.

143
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,650
What is the dasher mostly you're going
to ask, cause you're not hockey fans.

144
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:29,420
That's a little ledge that goes around
the boards. The fucking boards do.

145
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,110
So anyways, we're doing the table
read today for episode three Oh three

146
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,430
episode three Oh three.
We're moving along.

147
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,230
We're doing an episode three Oh four next
week. We'll have five of them done by

148
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,143
the end of the month and a half way there.

149
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,720
Halfway there to writing
and then rewriting and then
the rewriting starts. Um,

150
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,371
but it's,
I think,

151
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:58,370
I feel like everybody knows the characters
this year and we're cruising along.

152
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,310
Knock on wood, knock on wood. So I
think this'll be a nice table read.

153
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:06,230
But Oh my God. Every once in awhile
a nice fucking lay up comes in.

154
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:10,670
You needed that guy. You needed scare
a mulch to fucking balance out Trump.

155
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:14,930
Cause everybody's doing Trump jokes
enough with the fucking Trump jokes.

156
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:19,560
Jesus fucking Christ. Oh my
God. What's going to happen?

157
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,190
The same fucking thing that happened
when Obama was in office. You're morons.

158
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,520
The exact same fucking thing.
Watch.

159
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:28,941
Just watch.

160
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:33,230
Watch how much our foreign policy to watch
out much fucking corporations have to

161
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:36,320
pay attention to the environment.
Watch how much bankers go to jail.

162
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:38,090
It's going to be the
exact same fucking thing.

163
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,690
And I'm not talking about minorities,
I'm not talking about illegal aliens.

164
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:45,140
It's white people. Stop acting like
you fucking life is gonna Change.

165
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,500
Like somebody is going to come
in and take your fucking SUV,

166
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,670
your little fucking bran
muffin or whatever the fuck
else she got at Starbucks.

167
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,920
All of these fucking assholes freaking
the fuck out, which I understand,

168
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,980
but where was this for the
last fucking eight years

169
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,700
and the eight years before that, the APA
and all the way back to Jimmy Carter,

170
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,360
Jimmy Carter was the last fucking real
man that was in the God damn office.

171
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:09,961
Look at him out there.

172
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:13,860
He's not out there fucking doing Payton's
waiting for his library to be built is

173
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:16,230
out there building houses.
I could God damn man,

174
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,660
but it's fucking hammer mouth Malthus.

175
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,780
These other fucking guys just sitting
around waiting for their library.

176
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,800
But you know there's a Roman,

177
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:29,730
all those presidential libraries that
you go in there for the rest of your life

178
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:32,250
and there's a group, he
just standing there, right?

179
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,370
And she just blows you the second you
walk in and the whole time she does,

180
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:39,810
you know
it's fucking true.

181
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,253
All right?

182
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,260
You don't think that's true then you
need to get on the Goddamn Internet. Um,

183
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,500
anyways,
plowing ahead here.

184
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,630
But he had a bolo tie.

185
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,780
Um, anyways, people, I don't, I don't
pay attention to politics. I don't,

186
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:03,230
I just do all of this shit's so then
people can air quote correct me on the

187
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:05,810
fucking,
on Twitter with their own misinformation.

188
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,670
It's a little game I like to call.
I don't have a name for it. Um,

189
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,430
anyway.
Scaramucci God dammit,

190
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,390
that guy should have
his own fucking podcast.

191
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:21,450
I would listen to that every fucking week.
Isn't that what you do now?

192
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,400
I love how everybody,
when they get fucking,

193
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,110
when they totally ruined their career,
their first fucking option is what I do.

194
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,950
Hey, did they start doing stand up?
Remember Charlie Shanie fucking two guys,

195
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:38,760
a girl and a fucking pizza place. He was
on that whatever the fuck his thing was.

196
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,520
Hey, there's two guys in there as a kid
and there's no chick. What am I gonna go?

197
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,560
I know you know exactly
what you're gonna do,

198
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:50,550
200 fucking episodes and make
it to syndication. Let me guess.

199
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:53,470
Do you got two dates in the same
fucking night? Now what are going to do?

200
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,720
But up but up up is the story.

201
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,360
No wonder he ended up doing all
those fucking drug. So would I.

202
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,290
How many fucking times can you just
sit there? Do what? Another episode.

203
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,690
Those poor people on those
fucking sitcoms match.

204
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,710
Once you get up to like
episode 80, 90, and just like,

205
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,630
and you know that you don't care anymore,

206
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,810
you know it's bad enough when you
don't care just the cruise there.

207
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,470
I just can't imagine walking out in
front of that fucking studio audience.

208
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,380
You know, you guys missed
it. I was actually,

209
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:25,060
I was in Hollywood during the
fucking heyday, that shit.

210
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,780
And uh,

211
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:31,480
used to always hear these stories about
all of these fucking shows. These,

212
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:35,020
they would be in like the, uh, they were
in the seventh season and they'd be like,

213
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,940
dude, they are heard. They don't
come in until Thursday. You know,

214
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,100
most of them don't even
show up to the table read.

215
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:44,650
Then they would blow up for her.
So Tuesday and Wednesday,

216
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:47,140
they wouldn't even
fucking come in Thursday.

217
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,900
They just do the block and
cause they have it so down,

218
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,103
you know,

219
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,850
I know I go sit on it, Richie,
and then I jump in the air,

220
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,210
cross my legs and sit in Howard
cutting hams chair. I got it.

221
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,520
How many of these fucking
episodes do we gotta do? Right.

222
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,920
They'd show up for the camera blocking,
which is basically,

223
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:05,990
so you know where you stand.
So you're going to be on camera,

224
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,190
you won't block anybody else.

225
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,880
And then the next day they do the
taping and then that was it. Yeah.

226
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,720
Um, anyways, these motherfuckers,
he's, I bet he does a podcast.

227
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,190
You know, they should start a podcast
network. Just the outcasts. Right.

228
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,900
And it should be like fucking Paula Deen.
Um,

229
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,250
uh, who's that guy who was a
fat fucking really weird guy.

230
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,500
Glenn Beck debt. That guy,
Jesus Christ. You know,

231
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,320
I used to watch him just
to feel emotionally stable.

232
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,360
He was like a character out of wrestling,
like kind of like a fucking,

233
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,540
I dunno like one of those high pitched,
uh,

234
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,670
who's that high pitch
guy who had the megaphone

235
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,120
and was like Bret Harte except he was
built like that guy from gladiator

236
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,580
gladiator. I forget what
that movie was called. Um,

237
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,320
anyways, they should
have them. Bill O'reilly.

238
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,330
Should you just stick them all on the
same network and they just sell them like,

239
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:15,590
you know, the main stream couldn't
handle it. Couldn't handle our truth.

240
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,730
We went out there were shaded
Lego will wait. It will,

241
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,050
everybody is asked what I do,

242
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,040
you know I in America label can't hate
on me cause I'll tell it like it is.

243
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,870
That's the male version of when a woman
goes like guides are like intimidated by

244
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:34,130
me. Now you're a cunt and you
sir are a racist more on, okay,

245
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:35,840
you're not telling it how it is.
Okay.

246
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,000
You're telling it how
you're fucking racist.

247
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:41,750
Parents told you how it is and then you
never left your town and then somehow

248
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:45,170
you got on television and then you started
saying the shit that you heard at the

249
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:49,010
local diner. Right. And then everybody
else with dirty boots are like, ah.

250
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,570
Right.
That's how it was.

251
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,520
So it was people, I don't know what
I'm talking about right now, you know?

252
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,050
I have no idea. Oh Man. Oh Jesus.
I'll tell you, me and my wife all,

253
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,250
we almost got into it. Oh, he almost
got into it this morning, you know,

254
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,380
fucking unreal. I had to work out this
morning to keep my figure in shape. Okay,

255
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,380
I've got to do this fucking podcast.

256
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,300
Then I got to go over the script and
then I have to go do a table read.

257
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,360
I got to do all of that before 10 o'clock
in the morning and I forget whatever

258
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:24,000
the fucking branch of the armed server
we do more before looking Millenium.

259
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,140
Oh yeah, you've got a
table. What do you do?

260
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,510
You march around and sing dirty limericks

261
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,953
birth

262
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,543
last decade.

263
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,483
Huh?

264
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,670
Woo Hoo.
That's what the fuck you do with.

265
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,300
Then you do some pull ups and all of a
sudden I'm supposed to fucking sit there

266
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:53,310
and feel like I haven't done anything.
I got to do what those guys are doing.

267
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,280
I've always wanted another adult with
more lines on the side of his sleeves

268
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,770
screaming at me. How can I
sign up for that? You know,

269
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,360
if I was a gun nut, I joined the fucking
military. That's what you want to do,

270
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:09,620
right? You know, you know what the
deal is. You start off with tin cans,

271
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,560
then you move up to squirrels,
then you shoot a bird, right?

272
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,310
And then eventually you're getting fucking
bored. Cause at the end of the day,

273
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,580
no matter how difficult it is,
no matter how much deer year,

274
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:22,700
and you've got to put on yourself,
you shooting something dumber than you,

275
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,130
at some point you want to go
after the ultimate brain, okay?

276
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,610
You've watched Jurassic
Park too many times.

277
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,270
You realize there's no real
Velo Razah pants or shirts,

278
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:38,780
whatever the fuck they goddamn things
where you realize there aren't enough of

279
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:42,710
those. You like, I'm joining the Goddamn
military. Right? That's what you do.

280
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,540
I wonder how many psychos did that,
you know,

281
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,080
they always say that they're doing
it for your freedom. Right? I joined,

282
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:50,910
I saw sharp can happen and I was like,
I'm not dead.

283
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,070
And then there are those people, come
on, somebody write me in anonymous,

284
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,000
what branch of the service? Or You
went, Huh? Are you in the coast guard?

285
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,230
You ever get the sense, what are
the people you're working with join?

286
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,220
Just because they wanted to see someone
half eaten by a shark pull 'em out of

287
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,490
the water just to see what it looks
like. You know, I think the coast guard,

288
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,420
that's, that's like the worst
fucking like out of all the jobs,

289
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,140
because the war never ends.
It never ends. You know,

290
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:22,880
hopefully at some point this shit will
end over in the Middle East, you know?

291
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,990
Um, I don't know how it ends, but
who the fuck knows? But anyways, um,

292
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,950
the coast guard,
it never fucking,

293
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,740
and that right there, I mean,
can you get the metal Avanti,

294
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,580
they should have a civilian saving a
dumb civilian medal of honor for the

295
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:41,730
fucking coast guard.

296
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,610
Do you realize every time there's like
a bad storm coming and that telling

297
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:50,340

home from work early.

299
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,250

in the fireplace, you know,

300
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,610

301
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,750

302
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,560
Some smarts. That's why
I love you lady. Right?

303
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,340
You're getting ready. You know what
the fuck that door to the coast guard,

304
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,220
they have fucking palms are sweating.

305
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,420
Their stomach is in and not because they
know some stupid fuck is going to get

306
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:23,400
in his goddamn boat around his fucking
surfboard or his boogie board or some

307
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:27,460
dumb shit is going to go on
a fucking hike. All right,

308
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,140
and he's gonna to on.
You got to come get me.

309
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,070
And these people who are completely
safe got to get in there.

310
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:39,570
Fucking got to get enough fucking
helicopter fly out the middle of a fucking

311
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:44,340
hurricane to find some fucking dope in
his silly named yet who had to take the

312
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:45,450
fucking thing out right.

313
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:49,170
Had to show off in front of his trophy
fucking wipe and now they got to go out

314
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,930
there.
It's some poor bastard.

315
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,230
He's got a fucking jump out of a
helicopter in a hurricane into the fucking

316
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:03,000
ocean to try to get these fucking
dopes out of there, back to the lead.

317
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,180
So what they can breed and make more
stupid people so the people at the top of

318
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,440
the coast guard can keep making their
fucking blood money. We're taking college.

319
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,690
That right there is the
scariest fucking job.

320
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,660
I am terrified to the fucking ocean.
Okay.

321
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,620
You would not want to have a bunch
of mes in the Coast Guard. Okay.

322
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,330
Those fucking boats would just be sitting
there in the sun and on the day will

323
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:33,870
be yet that would be it. I would fucking,
I would be, we would be on the dock.

324
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:38,871
I'd be on the boat with a life jacket on
playing cards and I would get like this

325
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:40,194
distress car.

326
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,853
Yes.

327
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,780
Good. I'd be like, Hey Bri, Roger that at,
well, what the fuck you doing out there?

328
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,860
I don't want the frontal [inaudible] Kong.
Jesus Christ.

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,630
You went to fucking dance.
Although I don't,

330
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,380
that would be me.

331
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,670
I would have that meltdown every dime
and then I would do the job because

332
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,040
basically at the end of the day,
if I was in the coast guard,

333
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,630
that's how I have to fucking make my
living and now I have to go out there and

334
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:13,460
fish some fucking dope out there.

335
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,300
Is Anybody in the Coast Guard listening
to this? Can you please tell me?

336
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,970
There's no way when you phish
somebody out of the ocean. Okay.

337
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,340
And then you got to fucking go last

338
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,650
and then they send that
fucking hook down again. Right?

339
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,340
It's just sitting there
and 40 foot waves are

340
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,810
going up and down.

341
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,253
Okay.

342
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,520
When they were, when they fucking crank
you back up in that Goddamn helicopter,

343
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:46,910
there is no fucking way, you
know, talk some shit to that guy.

344
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,300
Is he sitting there with that fucking,

345
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,680
I almost got swallowed by the ocean.
Look on his face.

346
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:58,590
Whatever the fuck that looks like.
He knows he's fucking dumb. Right?

347
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,870
Do you must look them right
in the heg hey fuck head.

348
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,390
Next time you take your boat out,

349
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:07,530
why don't you make sure the fucking sun's
out and it's not a fucking whatever.

350
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,370

always think that they fucking look like?

352
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:18,341
I mean,
you just,

353
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:23,341
I would be so fucking embarrassed if I
ever did some dumb shit like that and

354
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:27,370
somebody had to go out, risk their
fucking life. Fly a fucking helicopter.

355
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,060
You're not supposed to fly. And turbulence
with helicopters. As far as I'm Mike,

356
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:35,050
my little knowledge of it and these
fucking guys got to go fly out until that

357
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:39,760
shit unfucking believable. Yeah.

358
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,120
They have to make a movie
about the Coast Guard, Huh?

359

You can always breath and then it comes
up and a few supposed to be there.

All right.

364
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,640
You have to make a fucking TV
show about a of a guy saving fish.

365
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,390
You know that f beached themselves and

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,540
Five bows makes fucking none,
but don't worry,

428
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,580
my balls feel fine because I got that
velvety under wherever up my giant

429
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,960
stretched up fucking nut sack. I
really mean. All right, me undies.

430
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,570
Mondays are the softest, most comfortable
underwear you'll ever wear, period.

431
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,800
And a fucking story.
And summer is the perfect time to upgrade.

432
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,840
Upgrade your underwear drawer because
everyone is thinking about looking good

433
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:46,841
and feeling good because everyone is
on social media and me undies are the

434
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,480
ultimate feel good undies. Wouldn't you
love to take a selfie with you and nuts?

435
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,800
What? You couldn't do it
before this underwear? Um,

436
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,490
put your scrotum in a good mood.

437
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:01,020
Every pair of me undies is sustainably
sourced and made from micro modal, modal,

438
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,750
a fabric that is three times softer than
cotton according to the people at me on

439
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,600
these because me undies comes in all
kinds of colors and patterns and they

440
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:14,460
release new limited edition patterns
each month that will always sell out.

441
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,700
You know what me undies
needs to go up against? Uh,

442
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,970
what said gay underwear brand?
Uh,

443
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,390
a filthy pig or nasty pigman.
At that time.

444
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:28,920
I told you I was unfortunately going to
Charlie Murphy's funeral and I didn't

445
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:32,400
pack enough underwear and the only
fucking underwear place in my neighborhood

446
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,480
was right across the street and it
had like the banana hammock shit.

447
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:39,720
And I walked in there and there was
like cock rings and all this shit.

448
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,170
I ever tell you this story. So
I go, so I'm looking for the,

449
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:46,560
all the underwear is just like
fucking like atlas and all this.

450
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,480
So I finally got to the guy behind the
counter. I go, eight skews me, but I go,

451
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:56,460
do you got any? Uh, you got any normal
underwear? And he goes to find normal.

452
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,020
And I was like, I dunno, it doesn't
say nasty pig in the fucking waistband.

453
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,940
Yeah.

454
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,330
Does it say stretch out my ass on
the fucking right across the booty.

455
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:13,440
Cheeks skinny. Do you just got a pair of
black or Greg or white ones? I'm sorry,

456
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,550
my life isn't as exciting as yours.

457
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,380
Beyond these ought to go up
against those guys. You know,

458
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,020
you're doing all the different
colors in the patterns.

459
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:27,490
You know people who buy
nasty pig underwear.

460
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,060
Maybe you could get them on.

461
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,340
I don't think nasty pig is made
out of micro modal modal. Uh,

I've Elbert said.

471
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,130

of anybody over here trying to make

473
00:29:12,171 --> 00:29:13,004
it's August.

474
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,100
Why don't you take a bouquet of flowers
and put them in your girlfriend's face?

475
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:17,980
Huh?
Um,

476
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,470
talk about the last time you spontaneously
surprise someone with something

477
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:26,240
completely unexpected and how
it felt. Um, Jesus Christ.

478
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:28,430
I hope you don't send
this to fucking hope.

479
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:30,170
There's no serial killers with podcast.

480
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,120
Talk about the last time you spontaneously
surprise someone with something

481
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:37,040
completely unexpected and how it felt.

482
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,810
Picture in Hannibal Lecter. You remember
it was heart rate would even go up.

483
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,000
He's listening to the classical music.
I Dunno. Um, I would surprise my wife,

484
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,620
but she snoops too much.

485
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,260
She always figures out what the fuck
I'm doing and then I just be all right.

486
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,980
Fucking here it is.
All right.

487
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:01,981
Talk about what the Rose Bouquet bouquet
bouquet recently sent to you by profile

488
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,030
is look like and your overall impression
of it. Uh, well, I didn't receive it,

489
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:07,411
but I,

490
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:11,800
I have seen bouquets of roses before and
I know what they look like when they're

491
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:16,450
in the vase and uh, you know, it was,

492
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:20,540
yeah, those are flowers. Uh,
and they really smell like.

493
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,240
All right. Pro Flowers wants to help you
surprise someone for no reason at all.

494
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,960
Well. In other words, you want
to make more money selling
flowers. In other words,

495
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,910
there's no real fucking
holiday this month,

496
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,290
all while also surprising you with
a special deal. For my listeners,

497
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,560
get 20% off any other of their unique
summer Rose Rose bouquets or any other

498
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:44,260
boot K of 29 why are they
trying to fucking do this?

499
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,340
Just saying what the fuck you mean here?
This is the deal. There is no Easter.

500
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,460
There's no mother's Day.

501
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,080
There is no fucking Valentine's
Day unless it's her birthday.

502
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:57,010
There's no fucking reason to
get her flowers other than this.

503
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,330
Shut the fuck up for a couple of hours.

504
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,800
Okay? If you, if your girlfriend's
birthday is in this month, okay.

505
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,800
God knows Jesus didn't do anything in
August cause just like f one he took the

506
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,030
month off. Okay, so there's no Jesus
holiday. I don't know what Muhammad did.

507
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,470
I don't even want to get into Buddha.
But as far as me as a white male,

508
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,030
Hawaiian male Christian, there's
no holiday this month. Okay,

509
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:27,820
so you're probably sitting there going,
why the fuck would I get a flowers?

510
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,960
You know why? Because it means
something. It means more. Yes.

511
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,980
Opposed to do it on mother's Day. You're
supposed to do it on their birthday.

512
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:40,300
You're supposed to tip them upside down
on Christmas and use their fucking clam

513
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:44,140
is a vase on Christmas.
We all know this. Okay,

514
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,630
but you're not supposed to do it in
August and that's why you do it. Okay?

515
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,010
This is like when Michael Jordan used to
come to practice and rather than acting

516
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,630
like he was the best guy in the league,

517
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,820
he would practice like
he was going to get cut.

518
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,550
That's what you want to do with pro
flowers, so fuck their copy. All right?

519
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,280
You can get 20% off the summertime roses.
Go get some for your mother and August.

520
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,970
Just get him for and be like,
Yo, why didn't you do this?

521
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:14,320
Because you're the best mother
I ever could have asked for. Oh,

522
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,960
that's what you're going to
get right there. All Right,

523
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:21,180
and you get 20% off some or roses
or any on at bootcamp. Okay?

524
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,210
For fucking $29 or more,
go to pro flowers.com use my code.

525
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,750
Berbee you are are a checkout.
That's proflowers.com code bar.

526
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,980
Don't wake to make someone's
Day. That's it. 32 minutes.

527
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:37,990
32 like Oj Simpson. He's going
to be running. Wow. Come October.

528
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,170
What you're going to do when
Oj McCombs running wild on you?

529
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,920
I've had a pretty nonconfrontational life.
Yes you did.

530
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:50,900
Oj except for that night get killed. Two
people. Other than that, that was it.

531
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,590
Give us he that fucking documentary about
how he got fucking arrested the second

532
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:57,470
time when he went down there
to go get his shit, you know,

533
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,470
and then he had his buddy take out
his gun and then they didn't have his

534
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:01,730
memorabilia that he thought.

535
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,540
So then these other fucking assholes
started grabbing autograph Pete Rose

536
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,990
baseballs and then they took the guy's
cell phone and then it became an armed

537
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:12,050
robbery. I mean, I would have to also
think, depending on how that got,

538
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,190
got the memorabilia, I don't really
remember. All I know is that Jack Dude,

539
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,180
I can tell you this man.
Okay.

540
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,580
If I was a black guy who got away with
killing two white people and I would not

541
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:29,630
leave the fucking house for the rest
in me. That's where the fucking guy,

542
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:30,560
I don't know what he's thinking.

543
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,030
You know your run for 2000 yards and a
14 game season and then all of a sudden

544
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,050
you think you're invincible.

545
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,630
That fucking look on his face when he
gets arrested the second time where he

546
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:43,700
knows he's fucked and
yet he's trying to smile.

547
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,320
I was talking about that
yesterday in the writer's room.

548
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:50,240
It's the one of the funniest fucking
things I've ever seen. It's like that.

549
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:55,520
And there's one of ric flair
with somebody's interviewing
him and asking him,

550
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:59,030
what was it like the last time you
went to Japan and you see his love for

551
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:02,480
wrestling and he knew it was his last
day. He said, look at this picture,

552
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:05,390
what was going on? And
he was like, this was,

553
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,810
I knew this was my last time I was going
to Japan and he starts to fucking cry

554
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,490
and he doesn't want to cry,
you know,

555
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,390
cause he's the nature boy
and he's trying not to cry.

556
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,870
So he smiling while he's trying.
I can try not to cry.

557
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,730
I've never seen an actor do that in a
scene because if an actor starts to cry,

558
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,860
they can't help it. They're
like, oh good. I'm crying.

559
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:31,190
This is what the director wants.
Crying equals good acting.

560
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,970
I'm going to get an award.
All right.

561
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,140
Dan gets one with one tier. I got to
tears coming down that aren't, I mean,

562
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,080
I get a Golden Globe and a fucking Oscar,
right? All right, that's the podcast.

563
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,160
Please listen to this wonderful
music. Um, oh, by the way,

564
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:52,370
you know what do I finally
fucking got into? And I,

565
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,260
I used to trash him all the time.

566
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:58,990
Joe Rosa was right above Frank Zappa.
I could never get into it.

567
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:01,940
Granted, I was listening to fucking
hair metal. It was two and now, oh wait,

568
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,650
people always said Joe's garage.

569
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:07,970
Every time I read a fucking drummer
magazine for fucking 15 years,

570
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:11,510
every drummer was trying to get Vinnie
call you is high head sound in Yoga Joe's

571
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:13,880
garage. It's what they always said. You
know, I wanted to get that video call,

572
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,210
Uta high hats and Joe's garage.
And I always got to put on and I was like,

573
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:19,280
what the fuck is this?
I don't even know what's going on.

574
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,620
Is is frank mocking music is easy
trying to take what though? I just,

575
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,460
it was so far beyond anything.
I was listening to it.

576
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:31,700
It didn't sound good if you
can believe that. And um,

577
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,230
I finally just put it on in the car
and I also fucking had another 15 of

578
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:42,231
listening to music and actually trying
to expand my horizons from top 40 Horse

579
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:46,200
Shit that I had been listening to. And
uh, it's fucking unbelievable album.

580
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,680
It's fucking unbelievable.
So, uh, Joe de Rosa,

581
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,940
I trashed him so many goddamn times
about Frank Zappa so many times.

582
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,150
And I was like, Joe, you're
contrarian. You just like
it. Cause it's different djs.

583
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,850
I swear to God, if everybody like Frank
Zappa, you wouldn't fucking like him.

584
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:04,410
And he goes, that isn't true, Bill. I,
I, I hate you when you're freckled face.

585
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:05,520
And we would go back and forth,

586
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:09,330
back and forth as we drank the fucking
the brown devil then that's what we would

587
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:12,060
do. Okay. And Joe Rosa,
I'll tell you right now,

588
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,680
and I'm going to tell
them this on his birthday,

589
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,160
he was never more right about
Frank Zappa and he was never,

590
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,620
he was right about the
brown album with Primus.

591
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,870
And he was right about the fucking golden
girls. Okay. I saw the golden girls.

592
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:28,200
I saw four old ladies,
Joe de Rosa saw comedy gold.

593
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,590
I didn't see it the other night.
I was sitting and they went on,

594
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,860
if they were having a marathon,

595
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,760
I was trying to get my daughter to go to
sleep and I'm watching this shit that's

596
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:39,450
like 30 years old and I'm laughing my
ass off. I fucking love that show now.

597
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,300
You know. So my apologies to the Great
Joe de Rosa and happy birthday to him.

598
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,890
And Oh,
by the way,

599
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,270
if you guys would like to do meet the
biggest fucking favor you could ever do,

600
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,070
there's a few fucking tickets left
for Paul Versey stand up special.

601
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,720
His first one, his first
hour, then me, Pete Davidson,

602
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,100
Al Madrigal and all things comedy. We'll
be producing our first standup special.

603
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:08,850
We would love to sell this place
out. Okay. With so fucking close,

604
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,250
we could lie to Paul and say,
this is sold out.

605
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:13,920
We just want to sell these last
few tickets. If he could do it,

606
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,900
if he can make it down.
Okay.

607
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:20,430
It's at the Tarrytown theater in
beautiful Tarrytown, New York.

608
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,820
I mean this is like one of those again
at the beginning of a Tom Hanks movie

609
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,350
when he has the perfect life before he
decides to fucking go out there and get

610
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,820
stuck on a Goddamn island
talking to a volleyball, right.

611
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,460
This is where they would start member,
his neighborhood and like big,

612
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,070
when he was riding the fucking ball
with a little kid was riding the bike.

613
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:37,560
That's what this place looks like.
You could bring your lady up,

614
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,910
you can have a nice fucking dinner.

615
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,530
Me and Pete Davidson are going to go on
stage and fuck around at the same time

616
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,780
trying out new bits,
getting you guys warmed up,

617
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:49,080
and then Paul Verges can absolutely
fucking crush it. All right.

618
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,530
In all things come.

619
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,580
But he is producing it and
it's going to be great.

620
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:56,480
So please come down if you can.
I'll be hanging out in between shows.

621
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:58,070
You want to get a picture?
I'll sign shit.

622
00:37:58,071 --> 00:38:02,390
Whatever the fuck I gotta do to get you
into the goddamn building. Um, that's it.

623
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:07,040
I'll be tweeting out a link. Let's
make it happen. Okay. That's it.

624
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,050
Enjoy the music and we'll be playing some,

625
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:12,110
a greatest hits of a Thursday afternoon,
just before Monday morning,

626
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,090
Friday in whatever the
hell they call this thing.

627
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,190
Over Thursday gone by and another
year possibly go fuck yourselves.

628
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,660
Have a great weekend concept.

629
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,923
[inaudible] [inaudible]

630
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,553
[inaudible] [inaudible]

631
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,710
hey,
what's going on?

632
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:14,490
It's built bar and it is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

633
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:18,510
August the third,
2009

634
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,180
why the fuck does it say November? You
know what? I thought I finally had it.

635
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:29,210
I was going to be like at 77 degrees
out chance at the high of 83 and now I'm

636
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,850
looking at says fucking November.
Why is that?

637
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,790
I Dunno. Why the fuck it does it? That
does to meet every God damn week. Oh,

638
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,470
it gives a shit, whatever.
It's August 3rd all right.

639
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:48,130
Another year flying by Jesus Christ.
Where is the summer going?

640
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,550
Huh? How many people have said that
to you already? Everybody always says,

641
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,760
is that where's the
thumber go egg every year?

642
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:01,040
It just seems to go by even faster.
I'd say it's amazing.

643
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,700
Like the first 20 years of my life,
it just seemed like it took forever.

644
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:09,170
But I'll tell you once she had 30 those
years, they just, they just, they fly by.

645
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,360
Oh, and if you have a kid, forget
about it. Just forget. I mean, I don't,

646
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:17,320
I don't even remember 35
to 46 nobody cares, lady.

647
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,670
Nobody cares. You're saying
the same shit. We got it.

648
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:24,640
Life goes by fast.
Okay.

649
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,910
Where is the time going?
I don't know.

650
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,980
I'm wasting a lot right now listening
to you going on your big long fucking

651
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:38,180
seemingly philosophical little rant about
where the fucking time is going. Well,

652
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:39,170
you're not really being,

653
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,190
you're not presenting any
one of philosophical shit.

654
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,110
Now you liked that people,

655
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,030
this is going to be a hybrid of
podcasts where I hit you with terms like

656
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,610
philosophical shit.
All right?

657
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,560
So don't be coming at me acting like I'm,
I'm getting all upper crust here.

658
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,350
That's your own insecurity
because you get nervous when I,

659
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,200
when I use terms like that.
All right? That's not my fault.

660
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,960
You went to a community college,
you know,

661
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,920
and you didn't have great teachers to
teach you about philosophical shit.

662
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,340
All right, whatever. This is
the Monday morning podcast.

663
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:17,450
I do one of these every single week
and um, I really enjoy doing them.

664
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,360
Um,
I don't know why cause you know why?

665
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,520
Cause I walk around my apartment and I
talked to myself anyways and when I have,

666
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,120
um, when I have headphones on and I
haven't talking into a microphone,

667
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:32,480
I don't feel as crazy.
Why am I dog is already asleep.

668
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,910
She's in heat right now.

669
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:39,020
Jesus Christ walking around
with a fucking swollen pussy.

670
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,690
That's what I got. Huh?
How was that? Yeah,

671
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:45,050
I hope you were eating when I
just said that. That's disgusting.

672
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,430
That's what the most disgusting
things I've ever said it. Anyways, I,

673
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,660
this is really going off
the rails quick this week.

674
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:54,650
People brand new conductor
here. Um, all right, let's,

675
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:58,010
let's get down to some shit here that
I want to talk about. First of all,

676
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,950
I have some homework for all of you guys.

677
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,080
Everyone who's listening
to this podcast and, um,

678
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,580
I gotta admit my podcast.

679
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:12,350
I think it's finally taking off because
in the last couple of weeks I've learned

680
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:17,120
that I don't have enough bandwidth
on iTunes for the amount of people

681
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:20,090
downloading it.
So I appreciate all the new listeners.

682
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,830
I got a computer nerd friend around
the corner who hopefully will solve the

683
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:27,680
problem tomorrow.
You know,

684
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:30,590
teach me how to get some
more bandwidth or whatever,

685
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:35,000
so more people can listen to it. I
get a ton of questions. So anyway,

686
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:39,040
so I feel like I'm starting to
build a force here. All right.

687
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,430
So maybe I can use this force for,

688
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:44,900
for like my own wishes.

689
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,760
You know that Jesus Christ said
didn't even for my own wishes, for,

690
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:49,580
for my own desires.
There we go.

691
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,370
So this is a required homework
for all of you this week.

692
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:56,810
All of you have to go out and you got,
you have to go see the movie, the orphan.

693
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,490
All right,

694
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,080
it is required because I want to
talk about that movie for a good 10,

695
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:07,190
15 minutes. I want to
talk about that movie. Um,

696
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:11,030
but I don't want to ruin it for people.
All right,

697
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,580
you have to go see that movie.

698
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:18,581
That movie is a throwback to classic,

699
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:24,070
I would say mid maybe late
eighties horror films where um,

700
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,840
they just kind of went off the rails
and they stopped building suspense.

701
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,810
So the whole thing just became funny
cause it was inadvertently a fucking

702
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:39,780
hilarious movie.
And uh,

703
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,460
I dunno a shit.
I want to talk about this.

704
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:46,650
I'm giving you guys one
fucking week next week.

705
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:51,510
I'm talking about that movie
because it was so, uh, it
was so ridiculous. You know,

706
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:51,801
this is,

707
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:56,801
I know it's a good horror movie is if I
go and see it and then when I get home

708
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,740
and I'm turning the lights out, you know,
I'm creeped out in my own apartment.

709
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,790
You know, as I walked by a hallway
and there's no light on, you know,

710
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,350
like to this day,

711
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:11,790
to this day when I'm on the road
and I go back to my hotel room,

712
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:16,791
every once in awhile I'll put the fucking
lights out and I'll expect like the TV

713
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:21,870
to come on and see the girl crawling out
of the well or to hear the phone ring

714
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:25,680
and I pick it up and it's going
to go seven days, you know,

715
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,590
cause that movie,
I don't know what it was about the ring,

716
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:30,630
that one stayed with me,
the Blair witch,

717
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,920
which is really a polarizing movie where
a lot of people look to those fucking

718
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:39,110
stupid, oh fuckers scared
all I, oh just fucking left.

719
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,920
And you know those people,

720
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,070
those people who go to scary movies and
they get to talk about how it didn't

721
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:48,330
scare them and how they laugh the whole
time as if that means if they were

722
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:50,640
actually confronted by
a psycho on the street,

723
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:54,080
they would have a better
chance of, uh, you know,

724
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,540
of surviving because they laughed
in a movie theater. I mean,

725
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,810
anybody can sit in a fucking movie and
just take themselves out of the movie and

726
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:04,500
just fell is just an actor. Oh, it's
fake blood. You can do that. You know,

727
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,241
I don't know.

728
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:10,170
Maybe this is me just getting fucking
defensive because the Blair witch scared

729
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:14,040
the shit out of me. You know, I
fucking bought that movie hook,

730
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:17,190
line and sinker in the end when that dude
was standing there facing the fucking

731
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:21,030
corner, it was just creepy. I
like when I can't see the monster.

732
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,120
That's my thing. Is that your thing, bill?

733
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,270
I don't remember asking you what your
thing is. Well then don't fucking listen.

734
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:32,140
Sorry. I'm going a, I'm kind of in
a mood right now. There's a lot.

735
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,100
I had a lot of devastating shit happened
to me this week. And not only that,

736
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:37,040
I was driving,
uh,

737
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,200
down the street out here and I
saw some lady had a, a sane on,

738
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:47,160
on the back of her, her Isuzu
trooper, everybody 1988,

739
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:52,050
Isuzu Trooper Zuzu however the
fuck you said. And it says, uh,

740
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:57,720
I might be slow, but I'm in front of
you, you know? And that's kind of person.

741
00:46:57,721 --> 00:47:01,530
If someone dragged him out of the car
and started beating them repeatedly about

742
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:02,364
the head and neck,

743
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:07,110
as much as I would feel bad for the
person who's driving the zoo trooper,

744
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:13,170
he kind of be kind of asking for it,
you know,

745
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,090
why are you baiting people
to beat the [inaudible]?

746
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:21,750
That's what you're doing right there.
That's like Nan Nan ass shit. And uh,

747
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:25,260
you know, it's like, uh, I don't know.

748
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,010
There would be like me a,
I don't know,

749
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,170
in the 60s when the race
riots were going on, you know,

750
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,330
and having some fucking racial shit.
Oh my,

751
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,190
is it really bill? Is it really to
that level? Now? You're right, it is.

752
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,850
And I don't even go down that fucking
road. What a moron. Um, but anyway,

753
00:47:41,851 --> 00:47:44,920
speaking of the 1988 Zuzu trooper,

754
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,410
and that's kind of been a new
thing that I have on my, uh,

755
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:52,360
my myspace page is I'm taking pictures
of random vehicles out here in Los

756
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:56,230
Angeles. Um, because I, I just,

757
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,680
you can't believe how long is,
if you're from the east coast,

758
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:02,500
you can not believe how
long cars last out here.

759
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,900
Some of the cars that like,
oh,

760
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,450
do you ever hang out with your friends?
You know, some high school buddies,

761
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:11,620
you know,
you haven't seen in awhile.

762
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:16,480
And then they bring up some kid who
moved in the second grade, you know,

763
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:21,280
hey, remember John Sarno,
remember that? And you were like,

764
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:22,720
holy fuck,

765
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,370
I have not thought about that kid since
1982 that is what it's like walking,

766
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,570
driving around out here.

767
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:34,470
I don't know if I told you this a couple
months back I saw a Pontiac t 1000 in

768
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,260
good condition out here.
Chocolate,

769
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:42,070
Brown Pontiac t 1000 and for those
of you who aren't in the cottage,

770
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,330
probably thing, oh t 1000
probably had some bulls. You know,

771
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,250
you could probably do a
burnout or whatever fucking
stupid thing those gearheads

772
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:56,110
do. Um, that I'm jealous of because
I don't know how to fix a car myself.

773
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,040
Um,

774
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,020
Pontiac team 1000 was actually
the Pontiac's answer to the show.

775
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,370
A Chevy Chevette,

776
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:08,800
which was a hatchback Chevy
Chevette and was also a very,

777
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,060
um, on its way to becoming
a hugely hacky joke.

778
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,740
When I first started in stand up,

779
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,550
one of the classic hacky jokes
when I first started was,

780
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:24,670
uh, people get on stage and be like,
Hey, I'm doing pretty good. You know,

781
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,680
you see my car outside? Yeah, I got,

782
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:29,860
the vet has Chevette and it'd be like,

783
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,540
Oh shit. I thought he was
done good about it. Go of it.

784
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,140
And then the guy, there's,
everybody's laughing.

785
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:38,830
The guy would be adjusting his sport
coat sleeves to make sure that they were

786
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:43,300
three quarters of the way
down his forearms to let you
know that he wasn't in an

787
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:45,700
office.
You know,

788
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:50,860
that's why he had the pastel colored tee
shirt underneath his sport coat to let

789
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:54,970
you know that he was, he was off
the grid. He was out of the Matrix.

790
00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:00,820
He found a way to find
your daily grind uniform,

791
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,070
a fucking edgy.

792
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:07,720
That might be one of the worst
periods of fucking dress ever.

793
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,690
The late eighties stand up comedian.

794
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,130
Remember that with this skinny ties or
the fuck he's just, it's just in the,

795
00:50:17,131 --> 00:50:21,100
in the, the, the was basically
the feathered mullet.

796
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,350
It was like Farrah Fawcett met at,
I don't know,

797
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,020
Billy Ray Cyrus. I got, I
got fucking nothing on that
one. But speaking of which,

798
00:50:29,021 --> 00:50:31,400
let, let's, let's plow ahead.
So anyways, I, I have, uh,

799
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:35,030
I've been taking some pictures of
some pretty random fucking vehicles,

800
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:39,230
one of which I don't even know what
it was. It looks like a big RV.

801
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,170
I thought it was a Volkswagen.
It's missing the bumpers.

802
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,350
It literally looks like it's made out
of Styrofoam Styrofoam and I'm convinced

803
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:48,350
someone's living in it. Um, but anyways,

804
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:51,410
check those out on my myspace page
if you're bored. But hey bill,

805
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:53,360
why don't you get back to the podcast?
Fine.

806
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:56,750
I will and I will you probably wondering,
you know,

807
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,470
a couple minutes ago I said I
kind of had a devastating week.

808
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:05,900
Um, how do I get into this?
All right. Once again,

809
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:10,901
going back about a month
ago when the subject of,

810
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,350
uh, steroids in baseball came
up, I did not name a name,

811
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:20,351
but I said if one particular person
were to some for some reason get busted,

812
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:25,490
I guess it wasn't a, it was
h, g, h or whatever with
Hdh, whatever the fuck it is.

813
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,880
If they were to get busted that I was
going to be done with baseball and uh,

814
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:36,380
the person got busted and
a, that's it. I'm out.

815
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,700
I'm out. I'm out. Fuck baseball.

816
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,000
I don't know if I'm going to
be out forever, but fuck it.

817
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:47,600
I did catch myself for half
a second watching a Dodgers.

818
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:50,430
I think they're playing the cardinals.
I can't watch it. I literally,

819
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,350
I watched for like three seconds and then
Manny Ramirez came up and I was like,

820
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,780
Oh, here we go again. I'm done.
I'm fucking done with, you know,

821
00:51:56,781 --> 00:52:01,360
what bugs me the most about all of
this shit. And um, you know, I got,

822
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:04,620
I got emails from a couple of Yankee
fans going on. Go now what now?

823
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:09,420
What you say vogue in [inaudible].
You know what a yeah, you're right.

824
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,950
You're absolutely right.
But I'll tell you,

825
00:52:10,951 --> 00:52:14,220
us against you is even
roids verse Roids in Europe.

826
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,020
We are actually still a
couple ahead of us, but no,

827
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,780
it's roids verse Roids.
All right,

828
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:23,480
if you want to argue
the 2004 championship,

829
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,890
because I can't really think of
a cardinal that got caught. Uh,

830
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,470
I would have that argument
with somebody from St Louis.

831
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:35,450
But as far as Yankee fans go, I mean,
come on dude. All right. We, we, we,

832
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:39,980
you know, you guys did everything but
send a fucking center up to the plate.

833
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,260
You know what? That's what the Yankees
and red sox should be right now.

834
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,210
They should just have half men,

835
00:52:48,211 --> 00:52:52,590
half horses and they just
come up to the plate.

836
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,983
You know,

837
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:59,190
you gotta put on a Jersey cause you
can't look at that little fuck in a,

838
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:03,060
you can't look at that. You know, you
know what it is when they come up to bat,

839
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:03,331
they're going,

840
00:53:03,331 --> 00:53:05,790
they're going to need a
shirt cause they're going to
need a little pocket to put

841
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:08,790
that little fucking pan
flute in when they come up.

842
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,120
I think that that's what they should do.
So I gotta be honest with you,

843
00:53:12,121 --> 00:53:15,570
I don't know what is going on in baseball,
but uh,

844
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,030
I'm not even mad at the players anymore.

845
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,800
What's really pissing me off at this point
is how the owners made all that money

846
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:26,550
and they're not being held
accountable on any level.

847
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:31,610
I really think like the last 10 years of
baseball was just a big marketing like

848
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,970
scheme to get everybody. Like how insane
is this country into baseball now?

849
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,550
I don't know if you guys remember,
but back in the early mid nineties,

850
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:45,870
it was really going downhill even
before the strike and all that.

851
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:50,070
Basically all you had was cal Ripken
was going to break Lou Gehrig's record

852
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,720
record record record. And, um,

853
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,870
he was like this throwback guy and he
was doing something that was really

854
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:05,070
respectable. Uh, you know, it was a record
that, okay, how much, I can't even talk.

855
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:06,060
What the fuck is wrong with me?

856
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,900
It's like Lou Gehrig went back to an
era that was considered, you know,

857
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,090
a golden age during America as far
as hard work and World War II when

858
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:19,140
segregation and water fountains and
all that other fucked up shit that they

859
00:54:19,141 --> 00:54:22,620
don't really tell you ever noticed that
when they go back in time, you know,

860
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:26,100
when they talk about the golden years,
they, they or they talk about racism.

861
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,880
They never tell those two stories
at the same time. You know, America,

862
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:32,370
we made all this, you know,
made steel, steel workers.

863
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:34,900
I don't know all this type of shit and
the American card, all the type of stuff.

864
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:37,470
But they always, and then if they're
going to tell the racism story,

865
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,560
they just tell that one separately,
you know? All right, you could,

866
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:45,180
you could beat your wife.
The rule of thumb, you know,

867
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,280
what was the rule of
thumb? You can, you could,

868
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:51,330
you could beat your wife with a stick
no bigger than your thumb. You know,

869
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:55,020
you can't tell me girls weren't looking
at guys thumbs on first dates back then.

870
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,430
Those little five foot,

871
00:54:56,431 --> 00:55:01,431
six inch do with little fucking little
sausage fingers so that Jesus could I

872
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:04,650
take the beat down from this guy
and I don't think I could, you know,

873
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,360
but then again, the women back then
it was like big milkmaids, you know,

874
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:10,423
they're all doughy.

875
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,940
Never see like the paintings from way
back in the day of like sexy women,

876
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,080
you know, they were raw.
They were definitely healthy.

877
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:25,410
So healthy fucking women. All right, I'm
getting off the track here. All right,

878
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:27,450
so let's get back to baseball.
So you fucking,

879
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,780
so basically what they did was I think
basketball and football were overtaking

880
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:36,810
him. I mean that's what I was watching.
Bird magic, Jordan, Isaiah, Thomas,

881
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:40,110
all those great teams, Dominique
Wilkins, all that stuff was going on.

882
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,120
Then in football,

883
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:47,420
I mean I went from the late seventies
Roger Starbuck beaten the Denver Broncos.

884
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:50,970
That was the first Superbowl I watched.
And I went right through, you know,

885
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:55,290
the last two Terry Bradshaw's Steeler
championships into Joe Montana,

886
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:01,470
Dan Marino, John Elway, right on through,
right on through, right up til like, uh,

887
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:07,260
I would say the end was maybe a

888
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,410
cowboy's dynasty

889
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:16,040
that year with the fuck happened
when the 40 niners played the,

890
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,020
the charger's in the
Superbowl. That's, that's when,

891
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:23,440
that's when the golden age you ended,
that was a bad one. Um, anyways,

892
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,910
but whatever. So no one was fucking
watching baseball. So then they just want,

893
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:30,100
they want, they, they juiced up the
ball, they made the ballparks smaller,

894
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,330
and then they just look the other way as
these fucking roided out dudes came up

895
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:39,160
and hit like 80 home runs as a third
baseman and they all made a shitload of

896
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:43,430
money and now they're leaving the
players to hold the fucking bag. Uh,

897
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:47,260
I don't know. I think it's
bullshit. So because of that,

898
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:48,843
I actually,

899
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,760
I'm beginning to try to find a
different sport that I can watch in the

900
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:53,110
summertime. And, uh,

901
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,770
I went to the x games in Carson,

902
00:56:56,771 --> 00:57:01,570
California on Saturday and I watched
a little motorcross man. It was,

903
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:04,580
that was definitely, it was cool. But I,

904
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:07,960
I've never felt so old in my
life going down to that thing.

905
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,990
And I also did not fit in.

906
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:15,430
If you've never been to the x games
of motorcross Sorta Skateboard,

907
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,530
all that type of shit
to describe the crowd.

908
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,130
It's Sorta if Travis Barker and dog,

909
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:25,150
the bounty hunter had children,
that's what the crowd would fucking live.

910
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:28,270
Somehow they had 30,000 children. That's
what the fucking crowd would look like.

911
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:33,100
It was very, uh, everybody there, it
looked like they had at least one felony,

912
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,970
you know, and I'm dirty, filthy,

913
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,850
filthy Skanky fucking women
just, you know, I, you know,

914
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,600
[inaudible] is getting a tattoo.
Is that out yet? Is that it?

915
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,320
Has that gone the way of the bell bottom?

916
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:52,321
There is nothing more skanky or than
just fucking just tattoos on a woman.

917
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,340
It's just, you know, I don't know.

918
00:57:57,341 --> 00:58:01,720
I remember there was a period where they
were kind of cute or whatever and then,

919
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:06,100
I dunno, it jumped the shark when
whoever coined the term the tramp stamp.

920
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,500
And if you live under a fucking log,

921
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:12,400
that's basically the tattoo on the small
of a woman's back that just really just

922
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:16,840
says that, you know, I fucked
a lot of guys in my sorority.

923
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,850
That's another major red flag when you
see a girl who has like a sorority tattoo

924
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:26,080
down around her ankle
that yeah. Um, I dunno,

925
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,850
I'm not saying don't marry her.

926
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:32,320
I'm just saying don't go to any of her
high school or college reunions because

927
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:35,650
there's going to be a lot of guys going
up shaking your hand with that look on

928
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:36,484
their face.

929
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:41,530
Like does this guy know that me and my
buddy fucking double teamed his fucking

930
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:46,300
wife, the mother of his children and
I know a lot of females right now.

931
00:58:46,301 --> 00:58:49,270
What you're saying right now,
that's a double Saturday.
That's it. That was Santa.

932
00:58:49,271 --> 00:58:52,000
How can we as a, how I'm a guy
can go out and blah blah blah.

933
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,430
And if a woman does it, she's
a whore. I'll tell you why.

934
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,180
This is actually a bit for my act
and I'm going to burn in my podcast.

935
00:58:58,181 --> 00:59:02,170
I'll tell you why. Because for a
woman to get laid is absolutely,

936
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:06,400
there's no fucking skill involved.
All right?

937
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:09,970
You're getting laid is like me trying
to get fat kid eat ice cream. You know,

938
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:14,230
it's really, there's not a
lot of, you know, I guess

939
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:20,680
see what is is a guy is men have
to make women want to fuck us.

940
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:24,440
We have to come up, we have to
dazzle. We gotta put on a show.

941
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:28,940
We got to come up with some
sort of fucking angle to
get someone of the opposite

942
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:33,680
sex to touch us. You guys can you
just fucking lay down in a pool table.

943
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:36,800
You could bang everybody fucking bar.
There's no skill.

944
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,310
It's gluttonous. That's
what it is. It's gluttonous.

945
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,640
It's like watching a fat guy eat
ice cream in public and listen to

946
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,660
[inaudible] scary guy does
you? Nobody gives a shit.
But when I do, do I go, what?

947
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,120
The food? Fuck, because

948
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,490
you're a fat fuck.
That's why.

949
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,900
So getting back to the woman thing.
No respect,

950
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,670
no respect for your numbers
because you have a vagina.

951
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,670
All right, there we go. Jesus Christ Bell.

952
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,060
You went a long way on that one.
All right,

953
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:12,710
we're 20 minutes in and I don't think
I've ever felt more ignorant. Um,

954
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:17,420
all right, continuing on. Here's
something, um, that I wanted to, uh,

955
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,080
you know, I just realize the record
levels of kind of high here open,

956
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:24,920
not my screaming into this thing.
Um, anyways, one ever gives a fuck.

957
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:30,440
Uh, this is what you get. This is what you
get. What do they want to say this week?

958
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,380
Oh, I know. This is something I
would like, if anybody out there,

959
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:41,381
does anybody out there have a VHS
copy of the Superbowl with the rams?

960
01:00:41,631 --> 01:00:44,990
Beat the titans?
I've never seen that.

961
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,330
Superbowl and it bugs me.

962
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:52,010
It's the only super
bowl since 1978 Broncos,

963
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:55,250
cowboys. It's the only one that I
missed. And when I say I missed it,

964
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:59,480
I missed the whole fucking thing.
Um,

965
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,890
and why was that?

966
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:06,050
I was dating some girl
and she wasn't into it.

967
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,280
Are you seeing my dog here?
Just go.

968
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:15,530
Sometimes I feel like I'm telling a story
and she's actually board. Um, anyways,

969
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:19,490
she wasn't into it and uh,
yeah,

970
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:23,900
so I ended up fucking hanging out with
her instead. Wow. Was that embarrassing?

971
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:24,561
And it ended up being,

972
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:27,020
course ended up being one of the
greatest Superbowls fucking ever.

973
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,970
I've never seen it. So if anybody has a
copy of it, please can you make me a copy?

974
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:34,910
Send me an email and uh, send
it my way. I'll trade you.

975
01:01:34,911 --> 01:01:39,620
I'll trade you a fucking
DVD for a VHS copy of that.

976
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:45,860
Um, all right. There we go. That was
really fucking long way to go. All right,

977
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:48,410
let's try to get this thing back on
track. She can tell you, you can't,

978
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:51,380
you guys always tell when I'm searching
on my computer and my sentences become

979
01:01:51,381 --> 01:01:54,470
more choppy. All right. Hey, Bill. Uh,

980
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:58,850
you talked about inadvertent racism on
your July 27th podcasts and I see what

981
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:00,240
you're saying.
Uh,

982
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:04,280
simply recognizing that certain dialects
can be found in whites, blacks, Asians,

983
01:02:04,281 --> 01:02:05,900
et Cetera,
isn't really racist.

984
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:10,550
But the woman who emailed you about
shiny suits on Conan called you working

985
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:12,590
class or blue collar or some shit,

986
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,880
presumably based on your Boston accent
and you seem to take offense to it.

987
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,800
Just thought you'd want to know,
uh,

988
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:23,160
you're talking out of two sides
of your mouse here, miles here.

989
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,210
And I emailed her back and told her that
basically my entire act and the podcast

990
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:31,200
are based on talking out
of both sides of my mouth.

991
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,500
So I found that email hilarious.
But my point,

992
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,940
and I'm not going to stop blaming people
for not getting my point because I

993
01:02:38,941 --> 01:02:43,020
understand how my complete inability
to present my points. Clearly.

994
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,600
My point is that,
you know,

995
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:51,210
each race does have an accent.

996
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:56,730
So if you were to say that sounds
sounded like an Asian dude. Oh,

997
01:02:56,731 --> 01:03:00,000
that sounded like a black dude.
It's not racist.

998
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,300
You know,
it isn't,

999
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,610
I still can't fucking explain
this without sounding like a dick.

1000
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:12,030
I look if,
if some,

1001
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,810
if you were talking to some guy on
the phone and he's like, oh, hello, I,

1002
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,460
I'd be over there very
nearly. Sure. And again,

1003
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:21,060
he comes over and it was a black guy
when she be in the back of your head like

1004
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:24,270
Jesus Christ, this guy, he sounded
like like a fucking Asian dude.

1005
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,270
Now I'm not saying that all
Asian guy sound like that,

1006
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:28,860
but if somebody sounds like that,

1007
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:32,910
they are going to sound like they're Asian
and I'm also not a master of dialects,

1008
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:37,380
so I am going to be doing an
exaggerated version of your people.

1009
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:42,720
That's it. The same way def jam
comics go on TV and imitate.

1010
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,120
White Guy's going, oh yeah, I got go
do my taxes. Holy Heck Gee. Willikers,

1011
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,350
Jimmy gimme cricket. I mean, nobody
knows anyone who talks like that,

1012
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:56,460
but you know what they're saying? Plus
it's comedy. It's a fucking joke, right?

1013
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,380
That's all I'm saying. Okay, so
way back in the day, the Oj trial,

1014
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,220
when a neighbor heard a voice and it
said it sounded like a black guy and they

1015
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:09,120
tried to sit there and make that
unbelievable, the most racist thing ever.

1016
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:13,830
It wasn't, you know, believe it or not.

1017
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:18,540
Like let's look at gay guys.
One of the most fascinating accents ever.

1018
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:20,370
Here's another bit I used to do in my act.

1019
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:24,870
How gay guys come from all over
the country, all over the world.

1020
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,630
Let's just stick with this country.
They come from all 50 states,

1021
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:31,080
yet there is a gay accent.

1022
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:38,100
Hi, how are you doing? Yes, Jesus, right?

1023
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,540
Hacky, absolutely. But a 100% not true.

1024
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,430
You can't say that.

1025
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:47,730
And that fascinates me because I think
if you're a gay guy from down south,

1026
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:51,390
you should be like, hey buddy, I knew
and I want to suck your fucking Dick.

1027
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:54,570
What do you think about that? You
really got a nice buck there, buddy.

1028
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,490
You know what I mean? Ah. Gives a fuck.

1029
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:04,350
I'm so sick of trying to explain my
uninformed fucking views, whatever.

1030
01:05:04,351 --> 01:05:08,920
It's a podcast. Don't take it seriously.
Some people take it seriously. Yeah.

1031
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,430
Who gives a shit? You know, just here
to know who they take it seriously.

1032
01:05:11,431 --> 01:05:14,520
Then it gives me something to read. So
please, for the love of God, keep, uh,

1033
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:19,270
keep taking this shit
seriously. Um, all right,

1034
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,400
here's another one for you.

1035
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:25,030
We're going to be dealing a lot with
racist week evidently. Here's a very, uh,

1036
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,060
he's a very, some of these emails,
they're getting a little serious here.

1037
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:31,300
Here's one for you. Hey
Bill. Um, and um, I'm uh,

1038
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:36,280
18 age old black man, you know, do
you guys proof read these things?

1039
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:41,410
And I've always wanted to
interracially date since middle school.

1040
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,150
I'm sorry.
Just had some fucking weed checks so

1041
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,280
that literally sound like
I was getting choked up.

1042
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:52,810
I've always wanted the interracially
dates middle school. Um,

1043
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:57,811
but there is one short five 11 guy that
is always there to a mess up something

1044
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:02,170
good. My Dad, my dad is what
you would call a buzzkill.

1045
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:06,260
I'm a photographer from my
school and there was a girl, uh,

1046
01:06:06,261 --> 01:06:09,430
that I've been friends
with for awhile and uh,

1047
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:14,260
almost every halftime at
the football games we would
talk one time she said, hey,

1048
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:16,060
can I take a picture with you?

1049
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,090
I was not going to say no because
the more you please women,

1050
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,510
you went a little closer
to her pleasing you.

1051
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:26,470
Oh God. Is that hilarious?
That's how a young man, thanks.

1052
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,020
That's a whole nother subject.
You know what,

1053
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:32,050
you actually want to be going in the
opposite direction a lot of the times.

1054
01:06:32,051 --> 01:06:36,970
But if she's a nice girl, yes. Be
Nice to wear anyways. Um, so anyways,

1055
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:40,900
years she gets close to pleasing you.
But uh, as she climbed out of the stands,

1056
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:42,640
I was running through my,

1057
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:45,670
it was running through my head what my
old man would say because he makes me

1058
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:49,900
show him the photos to see my
progress I guess is a photographer.

1059
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:50,831
Um,

1060
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:55,240
we had someone snapped the photo of us
and when I got home and put the photos up

1061
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:57,850
from my old man, I tried
to skip it, but he sought,

1062
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:03,250
I had to sit there for an hour in 45
minutes and listen to how white people did

1063
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:07,270
US wrong for 400 years. And if
you, if you start liking them,

1064
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,470
it's because you want to be them.
Bill A,

1065
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,060
that's just the light version.

1066
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,260
A couple of weeks ago we were at our
family reunion and we were watching tiger

1067
01:07:17,261 --> 01:07:20,290
woods. I said, the tiger
woods had a hot wife.

1068
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:27,310
I really wish you recorded all of this.
And my dad butted in and said, is she hot?

1069
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:30,220
Is She hot? Because she's white. Bill,

1070
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:35,160
I tried to tell this shithead that I
love all women no matter what race. Um,

1071
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,020
what am I know what the race is?
My old man flew off the handle.

1072
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:42,220
I had to sit for three hours and listen
to him rant about the same shit I've

1073
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:45,850
heard since I was 13. Stuff like,
you just hate black women, don't you?

1074
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,600
He just want mud kids,
don't you? Jesus Christ.

1075
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:54,040
If you do marry them,
you'll just be a dog to them.

1076
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,780
And I always know and I always knew that
that yellow skinny yours would go to

1077
01:07:58,781 --> 01:08:01,030
your head.
Uh,

1078
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,500
I guess that's lightskin it's
like a whole nother fucking thing.

1079
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:09,610
High Yella doesn't that
mean light-skinned?

1080
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:14,050
Anybody out there of a African persuasion
that can explain that to white people,

1081
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:18,380
red boned and all that
shit. Um, anyways, uh,

1082
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:23,580
so whatever more lightskin so thinks
he's a cut above. Can't hang out.

1083
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:24,543
So what does your dad,

1084
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,440
does your dad look like? Keith Robinson.
All right, that's for standup fence.

1085
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,740
Anyways. Um, where'd we go?
What am I going with this?

1086
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:41,720
I just lost my fucking plates.
Mud kids,

1087
01:08:41,721 --> 01:08:45,920
yellow skin. Jesus. When the fucking
ugliest emails ever. Um, Bill,

1088
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:50,240
this is a bill. This is just

1089
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,280
I short on me. I don't know what
you're writing here. I'm six.

1090
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:57,380
One loved Jennifer Love Hewitt,

1091
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,590
Vanessa and Hughes Rianna.

1092
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:07,280
Ah, Jesus Christ. What the fuck?

1093
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,780
And I always,

1094
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:13,700
and I always that that
Chris Brown would backfire.

1095
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:18,830
I always knew that that Chris Brown would
backfire and that Asian girls from the

1096
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,670
beat and that Asian girl from the
beginning of true lies a girl is a girl.

1097
01:09:22,671 --> 01:09:26,780
And when you're, and when you are hungry
like a wolf, this kid's hilarious.

1098
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:32,510
You do not want to settle for just one
kind of food. This guy basically. Yeah,

1099
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:36,170
he's 18.
He wants to fuck on every continent.

1100
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:41,240
He wants to bang a girl from every
racist is total normal behavior. Bill,

1101
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:42,470
I've hated my family.

1102
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:47,810
This has really become a
doctor. Phil here. Bill,

1103
01:09:47,811 --> 01:09:52,811
I have hated my family for fucking up my
life from birth with their divorce and

1104
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:57,080
my mom died when I was 14. She us
iron man. I forgot about that part.

1105
01:09:57,081 --> 01:10:00,830
I would have been laughing here, but I
hated her like m and m hated his mom.

1106
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:06,680
I'm living with my dad now for now because
I'm about to head to college and that

1107
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:10,070
same girl is going to the same
college and she wants to hook up.

1108
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:14,000
Bill helped me find an easy
way to tell my dad to fuck off.

1109
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,950
Wow. Do, I don't know if you've
been listening to my podcast,

1110
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:23,951
but do you really think I'm qualified
on any level to address the shit that's

1111
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:26,210
going on here?
Do this is like,

1112
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:32,330
this is like the perfect storm of stuff.
All right. All right. The first of all,

1113
01:10:32,331 --> 01:10:37,331
the mistake your dad's making
is by ranting and raving
at you for an hour and 45

1114
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:41,720
minutes about what he doesn't want you
to do is the quickest way to make you run

1115
01:10:41,721 --> 01:10:46,210
out and go do it. All
right? And from what I,

1116
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,470
I've my experience as a kid, obviously
I don't have any kids and uh, yeah,

1117
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:56,390
he should be able to date whoever
you want a date. I will say this,

1118
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,980
you're 18 don't get a girlfriend.
All right.

1119
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:04,340
Stay single. Get out there,
figure out what you want.

1120
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:08,480
And as you're going around fucking the,
uh,

1121
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,850
entire rainbow of color out there,

1122
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:16,380
be making a mental list of what
you're looking for in somebody to,

1123
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,230
uh, to settle down with.
This is the shit that I,

1124
01:11:20,231 --> 01:11:21,960
this is all the shit that I didn't do

1125
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:28,380
is I rudderlessly just bounced
from one fucking chick to another.

1126
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,110
Um, nice way to tell you I an easy
way to tell your dad to fuck off.

1127
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:39,770
Uh, you know what, why don't
you try agreeing with them,
you know, when he goes,

1128
01:11:39,771 --> 01:11:42,170
yeah, I knew that yellow skin
would go to your head. Be like,

1129
01:11:42,171 --> 01:11:45,530
you're absolutely right. Data. I can't
even believe that I'm talking to you.

1130
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,580
In fact,

1131
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:49,910
when we walk in public or is there any
way that you could kind of walk like 40

1132
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:53,210
feet behind me so people don't know that
we're together? You can, I don't mean,

1133
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:55,770
I don't know if your dad gets physical
and you starts fucking slapping you

1134
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,920
around like some lifetime movie. But,
uh, I've used this technique on, uh,

1135
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,820
a number of people after wow.
When you just get sick,

1136
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:07,820
you ever get somebody they just get,
they just get, I don't know. They,

1137
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,833
they get,

1138
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:12,920
they get pissed cause they know you're
going to go out and possibly enjoy life

1139
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:17,690
more than they have. You know,
like I had a couple people,

1140
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:21,470
uh, you know, when I moved down in New
York I had friends given me shit like a,

1141
01:12:21,471 --> 01:12:24,260
you know, hey I got a new apartment.
Hey but it's not New York City.

1142
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:28,460
And then I'd always find myself having
to knock living in New York City,

1143
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:33,440
like tone down my shit so they could feel
better about where the hell they lived

1144
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:35,990
in. After a while I was just like, yeah,
I just started agreeing with them. Yeah,

1145
01:12:35,991 --> 01:12:39,830
you're right. It isn't New York. New
York is shit. It's the Paris of America.

1146
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:43,790
You know. It's too bad you
don't live there cause it's
fucking awesome. You just,

1147
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:47,060
you just agree with the,
Oh you think you're the shit now.

1148
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:49,310
Could you live down there?
Yeah, I know. It's unbelievable.

1149
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:54,350
My Ego is completely out of
control and you know, just,

1150
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:57,930
I don't know. I don't know what
to tell you, dude, that that's,

1151
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,790
that's a really tough one
because no matter what,

1152
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:03,300
you're always going to want
your dad's approval. Um,

1153
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:09,830
but just watch out for the anger that's
building up in you and just make sure

1154
01:13:11,431 --> 01:13:15,960
that you don't start making spiteful
decisions towards Sam about your own life

1155
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:21,020
and the path you want to go
down because, uh, then you get,

1156
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:23,510
you're going to end up in some
miserable plate. Yeah, you'll start,

1157
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,850
you'll literally start dating
someone just to piss him off.

1158
01:13:25,851 --> 01:13:30,020
I'm not saying you might, you'll do.
Maybe you will. I don't know. Um,

1159
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,433
okay.

1160
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,360
Uh, I dunno. Do that. There's, there's a
lot of shit going on there, but you know,

1161
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:38,840
I'm glad you brought all of this stuff
up because you remember that bit I was

1162
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:40,250
doing that.
Get out of the pool,

1163
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:45,140
making fun of those movies where
they show like racist white people.

1164
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:49,310
And this right here is
the point of that bit,

1165
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:54,770
which is they've made 80 million
movies about white people being racist.

1166
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:59,330
And I was laughing that,
that started off with slavery.

1167
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,770
One of the most horrific things that's
ever happened in this country other than

1168
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:06,170
then I guess the straight
up genocide or the Indians.

1169
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,580
Native Americans are the fuck you supposed
to call them and there's been so many

1170
01:14:10,581 --> 01:14:13,840
movies made about that shit that now
it's all the way down to like swimming.

1171
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:17,490
That was the joke and I know I like,

1172
01:14:17,491 --> 01:14:20,490
I stopped doing the jokes once they were
on TV, but I know I said at some point,

1173
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,940
are white people the only
ones who think evil shit,

1174
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,340
I can't remember the joke wins.

1175
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:29,820
Isn't there some a Mexican guy making
fun of an Asian dude or whatever.

1176
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:34,260
This is what the fuck I'm talking about.
This is what I'm talking about.

1177
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:39,180
And it just gets annoying after a while
that you take a movie like guess who's

1178
01:14:39,181 --> 01:14:44,040
coming to dinner when it's, when it's the
white girl, bring it home, the Black Guy,

1179
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:45,480
the original movie.

1180
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:50,690
Then it's this drama and it's just really
serious fucking thing that needs to be

1181
01:14:51,061 --> 01:14:55,050
addressed. But when you flip it and it's
a black girl, bring an Ashton Kutcher,

1182
01:14:55,530 --> 01:15:00,270
all of a sudden now, now it's a
comedy. And, and what's his face?

1183
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:05,820
The Dad there, you know, not wanting
her to bring home a white dude.

1184
01:15:05,821 --> 01:15:10,710
Now it's fucking hilarious.
I mean, I guess I get it
because of a, on some level,

1185
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,350
because it's not like black
people and slave white people.

1186
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,380
So though the rules are fucking different,
but you know what I'm saying?

1187
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:18,750
So I'm not just saying, I'm just, I
don't fucking know. I don't want him,

1188
01:15:18,751 --> 01:15:20,400
you know what I mean? You
know what the fuck. I mean,

1189
01:15:20,401 --> 01:15:23,010
I'm just saying it's like I
got it. I understand. You know,

1190
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:27,390
there's 80,000 fucking movies
about white people being racist.

1191
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:32,160
How about we switch it up every once in
awhile and make a movie about Mexicans

1192
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:36,060
stabbing Puerto Ricans after a boxing
match. How about that? You know,

1193
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:39,600
we ever see that like whenever a Mexican
fire fights a Puerto Rican fighter,

1194
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:43,650
guaranteed somebody getting stabbed
in the Bronx, that's all I'm saying.

1195
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:49,380
I mean, maybe that's not a movie. Maybe
that's more of a, uh, a short, but a,

1196
01:15:49,381 --> 01:15:51,720
you know, he could have the
hackey characters in there. Right.

1197
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:56,820
And what the fuck I'm talking
about. Anyways, let's move on here.

1198
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,590
Let's recommend some are youtube
videos for the week. Um, here we go.

1199
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:04,530
Here's one that you guys can search.
I don't have time to fucking look.

1200
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,640
I watch all of these,

1201
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:09,390
but this is just becoming way too big
to try to watch all of these and try to

1202
01:16:09,391 --> 01:16:11,900
come up with the greatest
one ever. My, my,

1203
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:15,840
my youtube video of the year is tough
call a tough talk in college, Girl.

1204
01:16:15,841 --> 01:16:19,530
That one. Um, here's some other ones
that people are also suggesting.

1205
01:16:19,531 --> 01:16:22,170
If you're at work and you
don't want to work, um,

1206
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:26,940
go on Youtube and search killer dwarf,
midget Muey Thai fighting.

1207
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:29,280
MMM.

1208
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,280
You don't have to watch that and
you want something a little cuter.

1209
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:36,140
Watch a search Charlie bit my finger,
which it literally has 90 million views.

1210
01:16:36,141 --> 01:16:38,390
So if you haven't seen it yet,
um,

1211
01:16:38,391 --> 01:16:40,670
you're one of those people who
not only does not watch TV,

1212
01:16:40,671 --> 01:16:45,500
but you don't have a computer. Uh,
this is a weird one. Dog Malfunction.

1213
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,790
I went to show that to my
girlfriend and she was just like,

1214
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:54,290
is he going to shit himself? Like shit
all over the place? It's like, no,

1215
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:58,940
it's something different.
A guy with gun confront skateboarder,

1216
01:16:58,941 --> 01:17:02,090
I can't remember if I told you that
one last week, but that's a decent,

1217
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,420
that's actually a really good one.
And here's a really good one.

1218
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:07,340
A boxer beats up two guys.

1219
01:17:07,341 --> 01:17:12,341
I love this video because the boxer dude
is basically what every man wants to be

1220
01:17:13,431 --> 01:17:14,091
in this video.

1221
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:18,830
Basically two guys do something fucked
up to his girl and without even without

1222
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:23,150
even a moment's hesitation, he fucks
up these two guys. Guy Is like,

1223
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:27,170
you know who all those guys and like
the action movies pretend to be.

1224
01:17:27,171 --> 01:17:31,110
This guy's the guy in
real life. Um, all right,

1225
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:33,800
well getting up here in time,
aren't we? 37 minutes. Okay,

1226
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:35,230
we got to start winding down here.

1227
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,443
MMM.

1228
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,080
All right. Here's something
sneaky corporations. All right.

1229
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:45,680
And I know I keep saying that I'm done
trying to tell people not to use those

1230
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,620
automated machines at the grocery store.

1231
01:17:48,621 --> 01:17:51,590
I had another guy telling me
how much easy there. Oh yeah.

1232
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:54,380
I'm in and out of there in two minutes.
Really?

1233
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,770
You scan a week's worth of groceries
and you have them in a bag and you're in

1234
01:17:57,771 --> 01:18:00,770
and out of there in two minutes.
Oh yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure it's,

1235
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:03,710
I'm sure it's way easier than having
someone who's trained to do it.

1236
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:06,650
Do it for you and stick it in a bag
as you sit there rubbing your balls,

1237
01:18:06,651 --> 01:18:10,660
doing nothing. I'm sure
it's way fucking easier. Ah,

1238
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:15,800
idiots. Idiots who want to
work for free. Have Fun. Um,

1239
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:19,130
anyways, there's another one
sneaky corporation thing. Um, Bill,

1240
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:20,820
I share your and Bubba Bubba.
Yeah.

1241
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:23,423
MMM.

1242
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:24,880
Here's an article you should check out.

1243
01:18:24,881 --> 01:18:28,330
I'll sum up the basic idea of the
article. Essentially, here's one for you.

1244
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:33,660
Starbucks opened a coffee shop in Seattle
called 15th Avenue Coffee and tea.

1245
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:39,640
They have nothing blatant to
indicate that they are a Starbucks.

1246
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,900
They've gone out of their way to disguise
their company as an independent coffee

1247
01:18:43,901 --> 01:18:48,730
shop. They even send scouts to check
out independently owned coffee shop.

1248
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:51,430
I'm assuming to better emulate them.

1249
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,470
15th Avenue Coffee and tea
will serve beers and wines.

1250
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:59,440
It will have cheese platters
and entertainment at night.

1251
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:04,390
I think this is a new direction that
corporations go into these days.

1252
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:07,990
They create new brands and new images
to trick people into supporting their

1253
01:19:07,991 --> 01:19:11,530
company.
And you can't tell who owns what anymore.

1254
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:15,490
So for overrated,
underrated, I say overrated.

1255
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,500
The 50th Avenue Coffee and tea,
Aka Starbucks in disguise.

1256
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:23,230
How fucking creepy is that?
You know what?

1257
01:19:23,231 --> 01:19:25,450
I Bet I've gone in and spent
money at a place like that.

1258
01:19:25,451 --> 01:19:28,060
I was go out there and as
long as it's not a, uh,

1259
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:34,120
as long as it's not like a, uh,
a chain name that I recognize,

1260
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:40,340
I know some of this shit, like I know
like, uh, but this is a chain anyway,

1261
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:41,630
so I wouldn't eat,
there was the,

1262
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:45,260
that chipotle Lei is
actually owned by Mcdonald's,

1263
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:49,130
but anyways, they, I fucking hate your
pote lay. I don't know if you've noticed,

1264
01:19:49,131 --> 01:19:49,611
you have a note to say,

1265
01:19:49,611 --> 01:19:51,830
always open right across the
street from like a really good,

1266
01:19:51,831 --> 01:19:53,390
a Mexican food restaurant.

1267
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,410
That's how they didn't just fucking put
those guys out of business. I tried to,

1268
01:19:57,411 --> 01:19:59,910
I tried to stay away from those,
but I'll have to, I'll have to, uh,

1269
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:03,350
I gotta be honest with you. I didn't
even read the article. You know,

1270
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:03,891
that's what I do.

1271
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:06,650
Somebody just tell something that's all
you gotta do is just tell me something

1272
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:08,970
and it becomes fact here because
I'm not going to look at it.

1273
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:13,170
I'm on bullshit and I'm actually going
to read it. All right. Um, horror films.

1274
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,500
Bill, after hearing your story
about the movie curtains,

1275
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:19,560
it brought back memories of a
movie that I saw when I was young.

1276
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:23,940
It was called the unseen. All right,
you guys got to hear the description,

1277
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,460
this movie, and just to let
you know, he ruins the ending,

1278
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:30,810
but I still have to see this. This
is a fucking classic. He goes,

1279
01:20:30,811 --> 01:20:34,620
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
back in the 80s but being six and seeing

1280
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:37,290
this one did a number on me for a while.
Pretty much.

1281
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,500
The movie is about three chicks
who can't find a hotel to stay in,

1282
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,340
so they end up at a bed and
breakfast type place. Jesus.

1283
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:48,570
This and original beginning to our
horror movie. Um, so there's some quote,

1284
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:52,590
there's some quote unquote thing that
attacks these people that stay there.

1285
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:56,520
The part that screwed me up is
that the thing that attack them,

1286
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:02,070
um, would attack through the oversized
air vents in the walls and floors,

1287
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:05,880
pulling them through and killing them.
So after watching it,

1288
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:08,790
I was terrified to go into the bathroom
because all of our bathrooms in our

1289
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:13,290
house had vents right behind me as
I took a piss for the longest time,

1290
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:16,860
I would have to use the bathroom with
the door open in case something would try

1291
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:21,450
to get me. I look back at it now and think
to myself, what a pussy I was. But Hey,

1292
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,480
I guess that's why six year olds
shouldn't watch horror flicks.

1293
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:28,440
Here's to four months of pissing
with the door open. All right,

1294
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:32,400
now here's the spoiler alert. Everybody
here's a, if you're gonna rent curtains,

1295
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:37,530
you don't want to hear, uh, you don't
want to hear this last part. Um,

1296
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:40,140
and of course, okay. By the way,

1297
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:43,440
the thing in the movie turns
out to be a retarded kid,

1298
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:48,450
that the parents kept locked in the
basement and all he wanted to do was play

1299
01:21:48,451 --> 01:21:53,070
with people.
Apparently his play was a little rough.

1300
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:02,200
How many of those horror
movies are basically,

1301
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:07,400
it always comes down to some, somebody
being shunned as a kid. I swear to God.

1302
01:22:07,401 --> 01:22:08,240
I think most of those,

1303
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:13,520
most of those horror movies have something
to do with the person who wrote the

1304
01:22:13,521 --> 01:22:17,180
movie, their childhood. A lot of
writers, they're fucking nerds.

1305
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:20,750
So they had these awful childhoods
and then they had like these fucking

1306
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,280
fantasies of what the,

1307
01:22:22,281 --> 01:22:27,281
what they wanted to do to people and then
they just move it a little to the left

1308
01:22:27,441 --> 01:22:29,090
and they turn it rather from,
you know,

1309
01:22:29,091 --> 01:22:31,280
just some kid having
some murderous fantasy.

1310
01:22:31,281 --> 01:22:32,900
They turned it into a fucking monster

1311
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:38,050
and then you've got a goddamn movie.
Does that make any sense?

1312
01:22:38,051 --> 01:22:40,690
That I just say that retarded
people are writing movie scripts.

1313
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:45,580
I think I did. I think that's how
the math works out on that one. Wow.

1314
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:47,800
Let's blow by that. All right,
bill question. I love your calm.

1315
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:50,530
This is the questions for the
week and then I'm done. Ah,

1316
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,060
let me hype what I got going on this week.

1317
01:22:52,061 --> 01:22:54,370
I'm going to be at the comedy
connection in Providence,

1318
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:58,030
Rhode Island on Friday
and Saturday of this week.

1319
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,730
That would be a,
what's today?

1320
01:23:00,731 --> 01:23:05,590
The third Friday is four days a
seventh and eighth. All right,

1321
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:09,640
I'm going to be back there doing two shows
both nights. You can go on my website,

1322
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:14,900
uh, Bill bird.com and just click
to the link. Please show up and uh,

1323
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,670
watch my new hour of hilarity and the
following week I'm going to be at the

1324
01:23:18,671 --> 01:23:23,530
punchline in um, Atlanta, Georgia
and I believe I have the dates wrong.

1325
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:27,310
I'm going to be there Thursday, Friday,
Saturday. I have it down as Friday,

1326
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:27,311
Saturday,
Sunday.

1327
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:31,000
I have to change that and hopefully
by the time you listen to this I have,

1328
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,300
um, and other than that I'm
going to be in Stockholm,

1329
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:39,301
Sweden at the end of the month and that's
going to be ended my summer and I'll

1330
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:41,920
be enjoying being in Stockholm,
Sweden.

1331
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,700
Cause I'm not going to be missing
baseball. I will not because I am done.

1332
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:49,030
I'm fucking, I don't know
if I'm done forever, but I'm
taking a break. I've had it.

1333
01:23:49,031 --> 01:23:53,420
I don't give a fuck anymore. I think
what that guy in the white sox said,

1334
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:57,140
the coach there was true. He's just
like for the love of God, just release,

1335
01:23:57,350 --> 01:24:01,940
just release the list, you know, so
you can just get on with it. You know,

1336
01:24:01,941 --> 01:24:03,200
I don't understand about these guys.

1337
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:07,550
They get on roids and then they get off
roads and now they're clean and they're

1338
01:24:07,551 --> 01:24:11,450
still the same size that they
were. The only guy. Like I said,

1339
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:14,600
the only tag I ever saw it get
smaller was uh, Jason Giambi.

1340
01:24:14,601 --> 01:24:19,100
That's the only fucking guy. All the
rest of them, they look the exact same.

1341
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:23,030
So I dunno, I have, fuck it.

1342
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:27,990
I feel like a dope getting all excited
the last 10 years, boy. Oh boy.

1343
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:32,210
Did you see that home run?
All boil. It's all bullshit.

1344
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:35,940
All right. Questions. Hey Bill.
Uh, let's call me podcasts.

1345
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:40,540
I read recently started working at a
retail store and during the hiring process

1346
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:45,541
they gave me a choice between
direct deposit or a debit
card that they provided.

1347
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:47,670
Yeah.

1348
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:49,950
Basically saying,
um,

1349
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:52,890
I wouldn't be getting a
physical check every other week.

1350
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:57,150
I asked why they did that. And The lady
said, that's just the way we, they do it.

1351
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:59,820
Isn't that how you, isn't that the
response you always get from corporations?

1352
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:04,830
You know what, why, why do I have to do
it? Oh, that's they just, they make us.

1353
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:08,460
That's just, that's just
how they do it. So anyways,

1354
01:25:08,461 --> 01:25:10,680
like every other person
I said, oh, all right.

1355
01:25:10,681 --> 01:25:13,650
And even though that's the way they do it,
didn't answer my question.

1356
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,600
So I guess my question to you is,

1357
01:25:15,601 --> 01:25:19,170
do you think that this is just a way for
paper money to be turned into numbers

1358
01:25:19,171 --> 01:25:20,004
on a computer?

1359
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:24,420
Is it really easier to have my money
directly deposited in a bank or say,

1360
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:29,070
or on some debit card rather than me going
to the bank and physically getting my

1361
01:25:29,071 --> 01:25:32,940
money? If I may use your
reference about it, um,

1362
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:37,730
about if your iPod crashes
and all your songs are gone,

1363
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,720
but if you physically had
the cds back to back it up,

1364
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,210
then you will be okay. Uh,
did any of that makes sense?

1365
01:25:46,211 --> 01:25:47,390
Not The way I'm reading it now.

1366
01:25:47,391 --> 01:25:51,160
I'm just saying I would rather get the
physical checks than to be doing things

1367
01:25:51,161 --> 01:25:55,720
online, but I guess that's just the way
they do it. Yeah, dude, that's brutal.

1368
01:25:56,410 --> 01:25:57,400
That's fucking brutal.

1369
01:25:57,401 --> 01:25:59,980
See what they're doing is they're
forcing the herd into a direction.

1370
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,890
So when guys like me don't play
ball with that, just out of,

1371
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:06,620
I'm going to have to play ball the
same way with those automated machines.

1372
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,440
Everyone's going to start using them
and then there aren't going to be any

1373
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:13,340
cashier people and then I'm
going to be fucked, you know?

1374
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,720
So, um, yeah, that,

1375
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:20,180
that's what they're doing
is they're phasing out cash.

1376
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:26,200
So anybody who has any cash hidden in
their walls are in their bed or any of

1377
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:29,210
that type of shit.
Um,

1378
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:33,080
that stuff eventually will become obsolete
unless you take it out and then you

1379
01:26:33,081 --> 01:26:35,870
give it to them and then there'll be like,
well, where the fuck did you get this?

1380
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:39,260
And then they'll tax the shit out of you.
Um,

1381
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:40,700
and I know a lot of you right now going,
well,

1382
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:43,880
you should have fucking reported the
money anyways and all this type of stuff.

1383
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:48,230
And if you really read about the Federal
Reserve and all and how fucking corrupt

1384
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:49,933
it is,

1385
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,900
there's a link on the Internet right now
where it's where some guy used to work

1386
01:26:53,901 --> 01:26:57,320
at the Federal Reserve just called
it a Ponzi scheme on television,

1387
01:26:57,830 --> 01:27:01,340
on CNBC said it's basically
nothing more than a Ponzi scheme.

1388
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:05,920
I don't know if the guy, actually, let me,
let me get, let me get that link for you.

1389
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:11,650
Um, if you really want to
check this shit out, go, uh,

1390
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:18,010
it's called the daily bail.com
and oh,

1391
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:19,710
this is, this is when they have the, oh,

1392
01:27:19,711 --> 01:27:23,010
that's a woman testifying
for the Federal Reserve.

1393
01:27:23,011 --> 01:27:27,660
When they've asked if they have any, you
know, they put it, give them $1 trillion.

1394
01:27:27,661 --> 01:27:31,320
And there was no record of where it
went or who took it and they just keep

1395
01:27:31,321 --> 01:27:36,321
talking in circles while we have a
person that is looking into that,

1396
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:42,510
but right now I can't give
you an answer on that.

1397
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,550
Like that's the way they
answered everything.

1398
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,520
Do the whole thing's a fucking scam.

1399
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:49,830
It's all a scam and what
they're trying to do is

1400
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:56,390
they're trying to phase out cash so
there'll be no way for you to every like

1401
01:27:56,590 --> 01:27:58,480
everything you do will
have to be reported.

1402
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:01,570
They'll know where all your money is
at all times and then not only that,

1403
01:28:01,571 --> 01:28:05,320
they're going to have all
your money at all times. It's,

1404
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,540
I don't know how I do you know how to,
it's so fucking huge.

1405
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:09,610
I never know where to begin
to try to explain what,

1406
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:13,150
how little that I understand
about this is just,

1407
01:28:13,151 --> 01:28:17,680
just let me put it this way. The amount
of money that you've made in your life,

1408
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,470
how much of it have you
actually held in your hand?

1409
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:26,180
How many times have you gone out and you
work all week and then they just type

1410
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:30,410
some numbers on a piece of paper and
then you the check and then you just go

1411
01:28:30,411 --> 01:28:34,130
down to the bank and then it just
becomes this number on a computer screen.

1412
01:28:34,131 --> 01:28:35,780
The amount of number,
that's money,

1413
01:28:35,781 --> 01:28:39,830
money that's out there versus the amount
of money that's actually printed first.

1414
01:28:39,831 --> 01:28:43,790
The amount of money that actually has
gold behind it, it's fucking terrifying.

1415
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,070
It's a,

1416
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:51,770
it's the biggest fucking scam

1417
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:58,460
I think in the history of the world.
It's the biggest fucking scam.

1418
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,190
And when you get a mortgage like I have,

1419
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:02,130
and I'm sitting here to
figure out how to get

1420
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,080
out from underneath that debt and meet,

1421
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:08,850
realizing that me getting
out from underneath the debt
will actually cost me an

1422
01:29:08,851 --> 01:29:11,010
extra four grand a year in taxes,

1423
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,170
if not even more. I think on the way I
worked it out, yeah, it would cost me,

1424
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:18,930
I pay about 24 grand a year in
taxes or something like that

1425
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:23,680
and we'd go up to 28 I
can't even remember. I,

1426
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:25,650
I tried to work all of this shit out,

1427
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:28,950
but basically my best move was

1428
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:30,623
to Jess

1429
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:36,130
take 30 years to pay off a mortgage
to basically pay 200% interest on six

1430
01:29:37,441 --> 01:29:38,274
figures.

1431
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,390
I Dunno. You know what?
I can't even explain it.

1432
01:29:41,391 --> 01:29:46,020
I'm probably sounding like a more
on right now. Just [inaudible] just,

1433
01:29:46,021 --> 01:29:50,460
I dunno. Read up on this stuff.
It's fucked. It's brutal.

1434
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,300
It's just fucking brutal. I
can't even, I don't know. I'm,

1435
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:54,600
I'm coming off like a moron.

1436
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:57,660
I wasn't prepared to discuss this
and what little I knew about it.

1437
01:29:57,661 --> 01:29:59,850
Now you guys are probably gone.
This guy, it's just a fucking idiot.

1438
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,390
I don't know where the fuck do
you begin to try to explain?

1439
01:30:04,391 --> 01:30:07,240
This is actually funny. Like,
I'm really stammering right now.

1440
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:10,090
I feel like I committed a murder right
now and I'm trying to say that I didn't,

1441
01:30:10,091 --> 01:30:13,210
and I didn't take time to fucking
come up with a, with an alibi.

1442
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:18,150
Um, I don't think that you should
put your money in the bank is basic.

1443
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:22,790
What I'm saying, you know,
these guys fucking you,

1444
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:27,230
you take your money. Okay. He
put it in a bank, all right?

1445
01:30:27,410 --> 01:30:32,410
They give you like fucking 0.5% interest
on it and then they take your money and

1446
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:36,860
then they turn around and they loan it
back to you with everybody else's money

1447
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:39,470
at some ridiculous fucking interest rate.

1448
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:43,150
And then on top of that,

1449
01:30:43,151 --> 01:30:47,680
they come up with these fucking loans
that make homeless people qualified to get

1450
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:49,900
homes,
which drives the price,

1451
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,320
artificially drives the
prices of houses up hip.

1452
01:30:53,321 --> 01:30:57,580
It comes like Superbowl tickets. Everybody
wants to go. So now a fourth thing,

1453
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,720
something that's worth $400 face
value now becomes worth four grand.

1454
01:31:03,010 --> 01:31:04,630
It's not fucking worth four grand.

1455
01:31:04,631 --> 01:31:09,280
So then you go out and you pay like a
couple of hundred grand more than your

1456
01:31:09,281 --> 01:31:13,410
fucking places actually worth and
you're paying interest on it. And who?

1457
01:31:13,411 --> 01:31:15,520
Who drove the price up?
The bank.

1458
01:31:15,521 --> 01:31:20,500
And how does a bank make money
on interest? So they dig,

1459
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:24,170
just basically create a loan so they
can make houses more fucking expenses.

1460
01:31:24,171 --> 01:31:26,420
So it's expensive so they
can make even more money.

1461
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:31,560
The whole thing was was bullshit.
It was completely criminal actually.

1462
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:34,110
You know what? It wasn't criminal. That
was a great thing. It was actually legal,

1463
01:31:34,111 --> 01:31:36,240
what they were doing.
That's how much fucking power they have.

1464
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:40,440
And then when the whole thing fucking
topples, they make us fucking pay for it.

1465
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:43,410
We pay for it,
and they keep the fucking money.

1466
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:49,230
They're beyond fucking corrupt.
It's the most corrupt bullshit

1467
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,720
on the planet.
I think it's worse.

1468
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:55,430
Yeah.

1469
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:58,130
It's worse than, than anything that's
going on in the planet right now.

1470
01:31:58,131 --> 01:32:00,160
It's right up there with genocide.
What

1471
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:04,000
the fuck they're doing is
because basically they're in
slaving the entire planet.

1472
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:08,500
And right now they rather, you know it
or not. You are financially enslaved.

1473
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:12,580
You're fucking indentured. So I really
sound like I'm fucking crazy. I'm serious.

1474
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,930
You're, you're fucked. You're in a dent.

1475
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:18,700
Might my own guy who invest my money when
I was trying to figure out how to get

1476
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:20,770
out of this bullshit,
he said it to me.

1477
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:25,570
This is a guy who actually could probably
obviously and a much more intelligent

1478
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:28,270
way explain this fucking
game. He said, Bill, face it.

1479
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:33,160
We're all indentured servants
to the banks. Um, I don't know,

1480
01:32:33,161 --> 01:32:36,670
Dude. I don't know what the fuck happened
back in the day when you moved to town,

1481
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:41,440
we went from having a house raising party
to having a 30 year fucking mortgage.

1482
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:45,970
Will you pay 200% interest on the
fucking money that you were loaned?

1483
01:32:45,971 --> 01:32:49,360
And by the time you pay it off,
you're in a fucking wheelchair.

1484
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:53,620
There has to be a happy medium.
I don't want to live in a log cabin.

1485
01:32:53,621 --> 01:32:55,510
I don't want to live in a cave. But, um,

1486
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:59,140
if you think that the
government is above the banks,

1487
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,580
you're out of your fucking mind.

1488
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:05,610
And a great example is when the president
tells bankers after they fucked up the

1489
01:33:06,851 --> 01:33:09,940
economy not to take a bonus.
And they basically say, hey,

1490
01:33:09,941 --> 01:33:14,350
go fuck yourself with taking a bonus
anyways. And then he just says, oh, okay.

1491
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:19,220
I think that should basically tell you,
you know who the fuck is running stuff?

1492
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:21,320
So I know that came off
as completely ignorant,

1493
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:26,600
but read up on it. Okay, I can't,
I'm just a fucking comedian.

1494
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,160
I really shouldn't get
into this type of shit.

1495
01:33:28,161 --> 01:33:31,730
But that fucking question
really set me off. It's a,

1496
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:34,760
I dunno.
It's frightening.

1497
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:37,790
Frightening is why I'm trying to pay
off my apartment as quickly as I can.

1498
01:33:37,791 --> 01:33:39,800
I don't think I'm going to make
it because of the end of it.

1499
01:33:39,801 --> 01:33:44,540
I want to have something of some sort of
fucking value that I can go out and get

1500
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:46,040
a sandwich with.
You know?

1501
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:50,540
Maybe I can rent out a part
of my apartment because I
don't think money is going

1502
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:54,590
to be worth anything if they just keep
printing it. They're phasing the shit out.

1503
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:59,890
It's, it's bad. Bad people don't do that.

1504
01:33:59,891 --> 01:34:02,590
Don't get direct deposit.
Don't do that.

1505
01:34:02,591 --> 01:34:05,080
Don't do your fucking
banking on the Internet.

1506
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:12,160
It's the level of faith you,
you're, you're, you're an
idiot. If you're doing that,

1507
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:14,440
you think you're the only
guy looking at that shit.

1508
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:16,780
I'll tell you what pisses me off
with someone sent me an email said,

1509
01:34:16,781 --> 01:34:19,930
even if you don't do banking on,
on the Internet,

1510
01:34:19,931 --> 01:34:23,140
all your information is up there anyways,
just in case.

1511
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,500
Just in case you want to go online now.

1512
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:29,280
I don't think that they should have
the right to do it. It's my money.

1513
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:31,080
I should be the one who tells them,
listen,

1514
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:33,570
I don't want my information
out there like that,

1515
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:37,290
but they can do whatever the fuck
they wanted. It's just, it's all,

1516
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:39,270
it's not your money,
everybody. It's not your money.

1517
01:34:39,271 --> 01:34:42,840
They give you money and your job is to
go out and get into as much debt as you

1518
01:34:42,841 --> 01:34:45,120
possibly can sustain.
And if you don't,

1519
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:48,990
then they just take it from you so you
can never become rich and they keep

1520
01:34:48,991 --> 01:34:51,660
getting fucking richer.
That's what the fuck is going on.

1521
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:54,330
And this has nothing to do
with Republican or Democrat.

1522
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:59,720
That's just has to do with a select few
group of evil people at the fucking top

1523
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:02,730
who are running everything.
I know I sound like a motto,

1524
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:06,200
my fucking mind and I probably am.
Um,

1525
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:09,200
but I welcome the debate.

1526
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:14,270
Anybody whose in economics or whatever,
who majored in that Shit and you want to,

1527
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,150
you want to email me and
you want to explain to me,

1528
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:19,381
I mean,

1529
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:23,100
am I wrong thinking that the Federal
Reserve is a private corporation that does

1530
01:35:23,101 --> 01:35:27,840
not have to answer to the u s government
that has never been audited. Am I wrong?

1531
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:32,700
Aren't they in charge? I know the
treasury physically prints the money.

1532
01:35:32,701 --> 01:35:33,540
Am I wrong?

1533
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:38,541
I'm just asking am I wrong when I say
that they are the ones that are in charge

1534
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:44,760
of how much gets printed and when and
that the u s government or the banks then

1535
01:35:44,761 --> 01:35:46,830
take that money and have
to pay interest on it.

1536
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:50,460
And that creates this debt that
we can never fucking get out of.

1537
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,980
And isn't that what happened over in
Europe and isn't that why they are now on

1538
01:35:54,981 --> 01:35:59,180
the fucking euro and are we
now moving towards the Amera?

1539
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:01,483
Huh?

1540
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:05,770
This is me just regurgitating
all my Wikipedia youtube shit.

1541
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:11,080
That even sounded dumb to me,
but I dunno. That's the general,

1542
01:36:11,410 --> 01:36:12,220
you know what I mean?
Um,

1543
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:14,590
you know what I'm like right now
I'm a guy who just started watching,

1544
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:17,620
like it'd be like me trying to
intelligently talk about the x games.

1545
01:36:17,621 --> 01:36:21,160
Then when I went to the x games
once and I'm like, do the backside.

1546
01:36:21,161 --> 01:36:25,900
Fakey all right, whatever. Let's
plow ahead. Hey, bill, I love the,

1547
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:31,510
uh, the podcast here. Okay. Bill Harris.
Bill, have you ever been offered to do,

1548
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:36,250
to be on the show, last
comic standing, um,

1549
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:40,150
offered to be on it? No, I did. I
could've auditioned for it, but I didn't.

1550
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,970
Um,
I just thought it was,

1551
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,690
I thought it was good for Comedians
at a certain level and I thought I was

1552
01:36:46,691 --> 01:36:50,380
beyond the level where it was good and I
would have just looked cheesy on there.

1553
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:53,260
You know what I mean? Plus
I want to, I knew myself,

1554
01:36:53,261 --> 01:36:56,800
I wouldn't have done any of the
competitions. I just would been like, no,

1555
01:36:56,801 --> 01:36:57,730
I'm not fucking doing that.

1556
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:02,050
Just challenged me and I'll go up and
I'll do three minutes. And if you beat me,

1557
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,990
then I don't have to live in a
house with seven other comedians,

1558
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:07,510
which would be kind of enjoyable.
In other words,

1559
01:37:07,511 --> 01:37:11,260
I wouldn't have been good on the show.
So No, I never, uh, I never got offered,

1560
01:37:11,261 --> 01:37:15,640
but I, I could've auditioned
and I, I didn't think it
was for me. All right, Bill.

1561
01:37:15,641 --> 01:37:19,240
Hey, love your comedy a on the podcast.
Thank you. I have a question for you.

1562
01:37:19,241 --> 01:37:23,410
I need your advice. My brother passed
away two weeks ago at 34 years old.

1563
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:27,610
All right. This is kind of a fucked
up one to end on, but I'm gonna um,

1564
01:37:27,611 --> 01:37:32,350
needless to say, I'm crushed. Sorry to
hear that, man. That's really a brutal.

1565
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:36,610
So my condolences. I'm, here's the issue.
My inlaws haven't said anything to me.

1566
01:37:36,611 --> 01:37:39,580
No phone call, no cards,
nothing. I'm devastated.

1567
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:44,650
You would think that them
being parents themselves, um,

1568
01:37:44,651 --> 01:37:49,330
that they may care about me since
I am married to their daughter. Um,

1569
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:52,600
they will, they would have said
something. They didn't say anything.

1570
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:54,940
I don't really want anything
to do with them now.

1571
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:58,500
I relationship was fine before this
as good as you can be within laws.

1572
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:01,380
I'm just not feeling
much like seeing them.

1573
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:03,780
It hasn't come up yet with my wife,

1574
01:38:03,781 --> 01:38:08,370
but she is really close with them
and likes for us to go over, um,

1575
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:12,180
likes to go over there to hang out.
What should I do?

1576
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,550
Should I just drop it and
pretend like they, uh,

1577
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:19,980
couldn't have cared less that my brother
died or do I stand my ground and fuse

1578
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:22,710
to go over to any functions
until I hear something?

1579
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:26,100
Obviously the latter choice
would cause friction at home.

1580
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:31,140
I'm the first choice would kill me
inside the one being to go over there.

1581
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:35,280
What do you think? Uh, you
know what this podcast is?

1582
01:38:35,281 --> 01:38:36,150
This should just be,

1583
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:40,770
Bill just talks about shit that he's not
qualified to talk about. Okay. And uh,

1584
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:43,980
that includes all that banking stuff.
Even though I know on my gut level,

1585
01:38:43,981 --> 01:38:48,870
somewhere in there, I'm
right. Um, all right.

1586
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:53,350
My Gut is telling me, uh,
you're obviously you're,

1587
01:38:53,351 --> 01:38:56,500
you're angry right now and uh,

1588
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,790
you have to go through that stuff.

1589
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,870
I think the move here is it's a bad move

1590
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:07,400
to, um, you know,

1591
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,740
basically you're gonna be married to
your wife for the rest of your life.

1592
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:14,920
You don't need the fucking not getting
along with the in laws to make it a

1593
01:39:14,921 --> 01:39:19,030
miserable situation. Um, I don't
know anything about your in laws.

1594
01:39:19,031 --> 01:39:22,750
I Dunno if they're not good with our
emotions. I don't know if they like, he,

1595
01:39:22,751 --> 01:39:26,380
I don't know what to say. I mean, I
don't know how old they are. I mean,

1596
01:39:26,381 --> 01:39:29,470
a lot of these people who come from
the pre Oprah fucking Winfrey show,

1597
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,010
especially guys and a lot of
women, they don't, you know,

1598
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:36,880
they don't know how to express shit.
Like when stuff like this comes up,

1599
01:39:36,881 --> 01:39:37,780
they don't know what to do.

1600
01:39:37,781 --> 01:39:42,430
So the move is right now is you have to
talk to your wife and you have to tell

1601
01:39:42,431 --> 01:39:47,431
her how devastated you are that your
in laws haven't expressed any sort of

1602
01:39:48,101 --> 01:39:48,940
condolences.

1603
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:53,110
And you have to tell her that it's making
you not want to do anything with them

1604
01:39:53,111 --> 01:39:56,470
ever again.
And just say that you're putting into,

1605
01:39:56,471 --> 01:39:58,150
you really have to
communicate that to your wife.

1606
01:39:58,151 --> 01:40:01,120
Because what you're doing right now is
you're already going through something

1607
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:04,870
devastating and you, you could
possibly, through your grief,

1608
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:09,760
make your own personal life, which I'm
guessing was happy up to this point.

1609
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:12,100
Even worse because you're gonna,

1610
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,460
you're gonna push away your in laws and
then push away your wife at the same

1611
01:40:15,461 --> 01:40:18,580
time. So what you have to do, you
have to go to her and in a calm way,

1612
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:23,240
just tell how hurt you are that they
didn't, that they didn't. Um, they didn't,

1613
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:27,960
you know, send a car to flowers or
anything like that. Um, some of these,

1614
01:40:27,961 --> 01:40:30,320
I know I asked somebody about this and
they actually brought up a great point

1615
01:40:30,321 --> 01:40:31,111
that they had some,

1616
01:40:31,111 --> 01:40:35,180
a friend of theirs pass away and there
was so many flowers at the funeral and

1617
01:40:35,181 --> 01:40:37,340
people were coming up going,
hey, did you get the flowers?

1618
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:41,240
Did you get the flowers I sent? And it's
like, you know, they're dealing with,

1619
01:40:41,241 --> 01:40:46,100
you know, the, the funeral stuff
that they got to take care of,

1620
01:40:46,101 --> 01:40:49,790
picking out the coffin and all that
awful stuff so they don't get a chance to

1621
01:40:49,791 --> 01:40:52,970
look at all the flowers. So for all you
know, they might have sent some flowers.

1622
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,820
So the first, Oh, there you go.
Do this, you jump off point.

1623
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:02,140
You have to say to your wife that, listen,
I need to talk to you about something.

1624
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:07,840
And you just say, obviously you know
what happened. And as far as I know,

1625
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:10,710
uh,
you know,

1626
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:15,090
as you have your parents sent a card
or any flowers that I didn't get,

1627
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:19,170
let her answer that.
And if she says she doesn't know,

1628
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:21,600
then that's when you go
and say, look, you know,

1629
01:41:21,601 --> 01:41:24,960
obviously this is a big thing to me and
they haven't expressed any condolences

1630
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:29,070
and this is making me want to do
x, y, and z. That's how you do it.

1631
01:41:29,071 --> 01:41:33,630
So just use the jump off point,
you know,

1632
01:41:33,631 --> 01:41:36,450
with that question. That's something
I've learned in my life was shit,

1633
01:41:36,451 --> 01:41:37,590
a lot less devastating,

1634
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:41,730
which is basically the first thing you
do is you have to find out if what you're

1635
01:41:41,731 --> 01:41:46,170
thinking is correct before you go off
on somebody. Going off is step two.

1636
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:51,120
All right? I can't tell you how many times
in my life someone comes up and says,

1637
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:52,920
hey,
so and so says this,

1638
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:56,700
and then I just take that as law rather
than going up to the person going, hey,

1639
01:41:56,701 --> 01:41:59,130
you know,
I'm not saying

1640
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:02,640
you did this, but somebody, somebody
saying that you said this shit,

1641
01:42:02,641 --> 01:42:06,420
and then you're supposed to do it that
way rather than just flipping out.

1642
01:42:06,421 --> 01:42:09,600
Because if you flip out and they
actually sent flowers, you're, you're,

1643
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:13,740
you're really going to look bad. And then
you made already a, a brutal situation.

1644
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:16,830
Even worse. All right, there you go.
I'm done. Babylon for a week. Dude,

1645
01:42:16,831 --> 01:42:20,430
I'm sorry to hear about your
loss. I hope, uh, you know,

1646
01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:21,991
I hope,

1647
01:42:21,991 --> 01:42:24,960
I hope shit works out for you with your
in laws and all that type of stuff.

1648
01:42:24,990 --> 01:42:29,730
All right. Uh, it's a devastating way to
end this podcast and it's over an hour.

1649
01:42:29,731 --> 01:42:31,440
These things are getting
way too fucking long.

1650
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:35,080
And I apologize for all my babble on
this weekend. Yes, I know. I am a moron.

1651
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:39,240
So I would love to hear from all
you economic majors out there, um,

1652
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:42,930
or someone who is even in banking.
Please. Somebody for love of God.

1653
01:42:42,931 --> 01:42:45,360
If you're in banking, please defend
it because I got to tell you,

1654
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:49,140
I'm not one of these psycho conspiracy
theorists who thinks he's 100% right.

1655
01:42:49,141 --> 01:42:52,020
I want to be fucking
wrong on all of this shit.

1656
01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:54,810
I want to be wrong on the
automated cashier things.

1657
01:42:54,811 --> 01:42:57,540
I want to be wrong and all I want to
say that they're actually sitting there

1658
01:42:57,541 --> 01:42:58,050
going,

1659
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:03,030
how can we make less money and pass
savings onto the fucking customer?

1660
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:07,200
How come I yet be smaller?
All right, that's it. Um,

1661
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:10,860
I should like, I should have lost
a lot of credibility on that one.

1662
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:14,670
I really stammered my way through that
banking thing and I'd be lying to you if

1663
01:43:14,671 --> 01:43:19,470
I wasn't embarrassed. All right? And then
hit. That is the podcast for this week.

1664
01:43:19,471 --> 01:43:20,560
Thanks for listening,
everybody.

1665
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:23,580
I'm going to try and get the
bandwidth up so more people can enjoy

1666
