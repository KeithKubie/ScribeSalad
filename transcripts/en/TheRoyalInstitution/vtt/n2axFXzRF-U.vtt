00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:26.820
So Halloween has come around again so we thought it was time explore the previously unknown interface between pumpkins and thermite

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.540
Thermite is a word that is used for a few reactions but the most famous one is the one that

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.560
we're using here, which is a reaction between iron oxide, basically rust,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.460
and aluminium powder. Now when these two react together,  it's hugely exothermic.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.750
They release an enormous amount of heat. So much so that those products which are

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.300
iron and aluminium oxide (so the two kind
of swap over). The iron is produced as molten iron.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.550
So the reaction is about 2,000 degrees. Iron melts at about 1600 I think

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.640
So we see molten iron pouring out of
this pumpkin's face into his poor friend's head.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.850
And we see all these sparks flying
everywhere, and each of those sparks

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.400
is a tiny piece of iron thrown out from the reaction because it's so energetic.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.480
I can actually pick up some of the pieces now that they have cooled down.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.280
There are loads of actual bits of iron coming out of this reaction. There's a nice little nugget there.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.869
And then a second part just because
we have some lying around was that we

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.900
stuffed some guncotton into our little friend down here.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:57.390
So we have a nice fireball as soon as the thermite starts to make its way down.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.050
Now I'm setting the reaction off with a piece of magnesium ribbon

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.300
because althought the thermite reaction generates lots of heat,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.300
it also needs a very high temperature to get it going and magnesium ribbon is an easy way of

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.400
producing enough heat to just get that reaction to start

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.610
So, thanks for watching! If you like
what you saw here, don't forget to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.180
subscribe and happy Halloween.
