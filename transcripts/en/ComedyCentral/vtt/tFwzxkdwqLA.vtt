00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.501
(quick drum beats)

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:04.504
(lively music)

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.006
- Let me show you
what an athlete

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.141
keeping it 100 looks like.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.642
- Well I'm the best
corner in the game!

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.745 align:start size:97% position:3%
When you try me with a
sorry receiver like Crabtree

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.080
that's the result you gon' get!

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.915
Don't you ever talk about me!

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:16.883 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience cheering
and applauding)

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:17.717
- See?

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:20.253
That...

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.187
That's 100.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.390
Right?

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.924 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean, do you know
how scared America was

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.426
for that white woman?

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.694
Oh my god, woo.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.430 align:start size:84% position:16%
Is faking an orgasm
keepin' it 70?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.531
- [Man] Hello!

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.832
- Or is it lying?

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:33.800
- Well that's.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.101
- And why am I asking you right?

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.803 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It's keeping it, first
of all I don't know

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:37.904
what you're talking about.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.339
(audience laughing)

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.608
But second of all I'd
say it's keeping it 70.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.776
It depends though.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:43.843 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you're not enjoying
the sex at all

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.145
and you're faking it,

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.980
that's, you're Marshawn
Lynch-ing at that point.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.548
(laughing)

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.116
- All you have to do is spend
a month with Donald Sterling.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.351
(audience member laughing)

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.185
Hold on!

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.153
- Okay.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:54.454
- At his summer house, okay.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.756
And he never calls
you Sherrod, okay?

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.024
- Oh fine yeah, done.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.325
- He only refers to you as

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:00.527
"that's my (bleep)
right over there".

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.861
(audience ooh-ing)

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.063
Hey America.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.297
Larry Wilmore here.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.965

Show on Comedy Central,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.735
Just don't poke me.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.770
I do not like being poked.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.604
You can Candy Crush me.
