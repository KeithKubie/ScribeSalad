00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.070
Welcome to my presentation
on domain of a function.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.060
So what's is the domain?

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.720
The domain of a function,
you'll often hear it combined

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.090
with domain and range.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.830
But the domain of a function is
just what values can I put into

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.150
a function and get
a valid output.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.360
So let's start with
something examples.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:32.880
Let's say I had f of x is equal
to, let's say, x squared.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.270
So let me ask you a question.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.440
What values of x can I put
in here so I get a valid

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.460
answer for x squared?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.820
Well, I can really put anything
in here, any real number.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.980
So here I'll say that the
domain is the set of x's

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.620
such that x is a member
of the real numbers.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.020
So this is just a fancy way of
saying that OK, this r with

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.370
this kind of double backbone
here, that just means real

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.210
numbers, and I think you're
familiar with real numbers now.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.420
That's pretty much every number
outside of the complex numbers.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.640
And if you don't know
what complex numbers

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.910
are, that's fine.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.980
You probably won't need
to know it right now.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.210
The real numbers are every
number that most people are

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.290
familiar with, including
irrational numbers, including

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.180
transcendental numbers,
including fractions -- every

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.470
number is a real number.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.820
So the domain here is x --
x just has to be a member

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.730
of the real numbers.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.840
And this little backwards
looking e or something, this

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.150
just means x is a member
of the real numbers.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.200
So let's do another one
in a slight variation.

00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:51.310
So let's say I had f of x is
equal to 1 over x squared.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.620
So is this same thing now?

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.890
Can I still put any x
value in here and get

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.970
a reasonable answer?

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.950
Well what's f of 0?

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.880
f of zero is equal to 1 over 0.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.870
And what's 1 over 0?

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.860
I don't know what it is,
so this is undefined.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.780
No one ever took the trouble to
define what 1 over 0 should be.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.810
And they probably didn't do, so
some people probably thought

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.170
about what should be, but they
probably couldn't find out with

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.450
a good definition for 1 over
0 that's consistent with

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.250
the rest of mathematics.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.710
So 1 over 0 stays undefined.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.930
So f of 0 is undefined.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.700
So we can't put 0 in and get
a valid answer for f of 0.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.630
So here we say the domain is
equal to -- do little brackets,

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.900
that shows kind of the
set of what x's apply.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.303
That's those little curly
brackets, I didn't

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:56.400
draw it that well.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.030
x is a member of the real
numbers still, such that

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.560
x does not equal 0.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.230
So here I just made a slight
variation on what I had before.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.925
Before we said when f of x is
equal to x squared that x

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:15.050
is just any real number.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.250
Now we're saying that x is any
real number except for 0.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.400
This is just a fancy way of
saying it, and then these curly

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.290
brackets just mean a set.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.390
Let's do a couple more ones.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:44.360
Let's say f of x is equal to
the square root of x minus 3.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.170
So up here we said, well this
function isn't defined when we

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.680
get a 0 in the denominator.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.090
But what's interesting
about this function?

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.600
Can we take a square root
of a negative number?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.000
Well until we learn about
imaginary and complex

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.030
numbers we can't.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.280
So here we say well, any x is
valid here except for the x's

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.220
that make this expression under
the radical sign negative.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.510
So we have to say that x minus
3 has to be greater than or

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.690
equal to 0, right, because you
could have the square to 0,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.235
that's fine, it's just 0.

00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:20.070
So x minus 3 has to be greater
than or equal to 0, so x has to

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.700
be greater than or equal to 3.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:35.130
So here our domain is x is a
member of the real numbers,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.165
such that x is greater
than or equal to 3.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.140
Let's do a slightly
more difficult one.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:05:01.260
What if I said f of x is equal
to the square root of the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.200
absolute value of x minus 3.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.320
So now it's getting a little
bit more complicated.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.020
Well just like this time
around, this expression of

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.180
the radical still has to be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.400
So you can just say that the
absolute value of x minus 3 is

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.910
greater than or equal to 0.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.580
So we have the absolute value
of x has to be greater

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.830
than or equal to 3.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.480
And if order for the absolute
value of something to be

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.440
greater than or equal to
something, then that means that

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:46.290
x has to be less than or equal
to negative 3, or x has to be

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.530
greater than or equal to 3.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.460
It makes sense because x
can't be negative 2, right?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.240
Because negative 2 has an
absolute value less than 3.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.700
So x has to be less
than negative 3.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.930
It has to be further in the
negative direction than

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.220
negative 3, or it has to be
further in the positive

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.790
direction than positive 3.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.490
So, once again, x has to be
less than negative 3 or x

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.000
has to be greater than 3,
so we have our domain.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.920
So we have it as x is
a member of the reals

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.960
-- I always forget.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.460
Is that the line?

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.080
I forget, it's either
a colon or a line.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.510
I'm rusty, it's been
years since I've done

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.400
this kind of stuff.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.050
But anyway, I think
you get the point.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.800
It could be any real number
here, as long as x is less

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.650
than negative 3, less than or
equal to negative 3, or x is

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.980
greater than or equal to 3.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.650
Let me ask a question now.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:50.970
What if instead of this it was
-- that was the denominator,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.270
this is all a separate
problem up here.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.500
So now we have 1 over the
square root of the absolute

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.160
value of x minus 3.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.730
So now how does this
change the situation?

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.650
So not only does this
expression in the denominator,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.170
not only does this have to be
greater than or equal to

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.360
0, can it be 0 anymore?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.960
Well no, because then you would
get the square root of 0, which

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.560
is 0 and you would get a
0 in the denominator.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.310
So it's kind of like
this problem plus this

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.600
problem combined.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.210
So now when you have 1 over the
square root of the absolute

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.430
value of x minus 3, now it's no
longer greater than or equal to

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.690
0, it's just a greater
than 0, right?

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.420
it's just greater than 0.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.040
Because we can't have a 0
here in the denominator.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.080
So if it's greater than 0, then
we just say greater than 3.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.510
And essentially just get rid of
the equal signs right here.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.790
Let me erase it properly.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.750
It's a slightly different
color, but maybe

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.640
you won't notice.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.130
So there you go.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.450
Actually, we should do another
example since we have time.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.180
Let me erase this.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.810
OK.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:35.140
Now let's say that f of x is
equal to 2, if x is even,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:53.970
and 1 over x minus 2 times
x minus 1, if x is odd.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.970
So what's the domain here?

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.620
What is a valid x I
can put in here.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.820
So immediately we
have two clauses.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:13.270
If x is even we use this
clause, so f of 4 -- well,

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.030
that's just equal to 2 because
we used this clause here.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.300
But this clause applies
when x is odd.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.370
Just like we did in the last
example, what are the

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.270
situations where this
kind of breaks down?

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.200
Well, when the
denominator is 0.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.850
Well the denominator is 0
when x is equal to 2, or

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.870
x is equal to 1, right?

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.970
But this clause only
applies when x is odd.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.350
So x is equal to 2 won't
apply to this clause.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.370
So only x is equal to 1
would apply to this clause.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:49.010
So the domain is x is a member
of the reals, such that

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.320
x does not equal 1.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.160
I think that's all the
time I have for now.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.210
Have fun practicing
these domain problems.
