Speaker 1:          00:00          What in the fuck is that $5,000 a pound? Japan's King of tuna. Is that racist? Is that racist? Uh, the way I said it, it seemed racist. Uh, the first tune auction of the year, a Tokyo's new fish market set a record price more than 3 million for a giant Bluefin tuna, a critically endangered species. Wow. Yeah. See that's where you gotta go, man. Is he critically endangered? And if it's, if it is, so should you really be cutting that fucker up? I don't know about that. When I was in Hawaii, uh, we caught some, uh, yellowtail my youngest daughter loves fishing, so went out with her and we, uh, went on this boat and we were actually jigging. There's like this shelf in this big drop off in these yellow tails hanging out there. And we caught a gang of them. And one of the things they were saying was that the big island had a farm where they were farming yellowtail.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Like they had this gigantic, like sort of netted in area where the fish couldn't leave and they were, they were trapped in this area. But then the storm came and broke down all the nets and the fish escaped and now they're everywhere and you're catching them. We caught like, oh, I'm like six or seven of them and they're fucking pig like 10 pounds and you're fighting them on like a light, a spinning rods, like really awesome, awesome time. But they were unbelievably delicious, but these are non native. They brought him over there and released him and I'm like, they've been our start doing that with other fish right there. Really should set up these fish farms and just released these motherfuckers out into the ocean because they're just taking nets and pulling them across the bottom of the [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:39          Lauren even, it's like such a, there's something to be said about going out and catching the fish, like you're saying, rather than taking a net and just scooping everything up in its path. Everything. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:51          turtles, dolphins, whatever the fuck is there. Everything gets jacked. And the problem is, you know, there's, who knows how many countries have boats that are doing that and they're all operating in international water. And I don't know what the fucking laws are, but they're just pull in what any, you know the other thing they do that's fucked up when they're done. A lot of times they cut the, the net loose and they just leave it in the ocean. They just dropped the net to the bottom of the ocean.

Speaker 2:          02:17          It's funny they have the regulations for like hunting. Yeah. They don't have it like in the ocean, you know it's because nobody owns it. You only own like a certain,

Speaker 1:          02:26          I'm out of your shore. Like I'll off like say from Malibu out. I don't know how much they the United States owns, but we only own a certain amount and then it becomes international waters, international waters. It's like kind of anybody could be out there. It's weird. I mean it makes sense but there's no, I don't think there's any, I think if you have a boat you can just kind of go anywhere. That's international water, just no regulations here. What is, what parts of the ocean are considered international water? Territorial waters or seas defined by a 1982 United Nations convention on the Law of the sea. It's a belt of coastal waters extending at most 12 nautical miles from the baseline. Usually the mean low water mark of the coastal state. So 12 miles or 12 miles out, or a 13.8 miles nautical miles. Nautical miles is different.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Huh? Hm. Interesting. Why is it different or weird? Is that nautical miles is different than regular miles? The fuck get it together. Yeah. Don't call it a mile then he fucks. Imagine, hey buddy, I'll meet you at 12 miles. All right. 12 nautical miles and the guys at mile on a 0.8 away from you. Although stores use the label Sushi grade fish, there is no official standards for using this label. The only regulation is that parasitic fish such as salmon, should be frozen to kill any parasites for being consumed raw. The best ones are assigned grade one, which is usually what be sold as Sushi grade. But what about Sashimi grade is when he said it's the same thing. So I looked up and that's what popped up. Yeah. You're not supposed to eat salmon raw. Apparently salmon is a freshwater fish and salmon. It can fuck you up, but you could pull a tune out of the right out of the ocean.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Yeah. I have a buddy of mine who when a tuna fishing off of San Diego, they call it a tuna and they sliced it up and ate it right there on the boat. Like right as they read after they pulled it out of the water. That I haven't done, but uh, that, that to me would be the bus eating right out of the water. I mean, I just hope they don't wait until there's nothing left before they start doing something to save them. It just doesn't, it doesn't seem like the, I mean, if you're taking us fish and you're buying it for $3 million, that's almost like a scene in the movie. Right. That's like the end. This was one of the last tune I looked. They bought it for 3 million. Everybody's smiling and they're cutting it up. It's like hunting regulations are critical, but you could, you know what the population is.

Speaker 1:          04:48          It's very, they, they do. The fish and wildlife departments have all these different methods they use, whether it's, I'm using reports from Hunter's, whether it's uh, they, they fly over with airplanes and helicopters and things along those lines. Whatever they use. They have a bunch of different ways that they can determine what the population is. Then they had determined the population of predators, how many animals are lost, how many animals are our shot during any hunting season. And then they determine how many tags can be divvied out. So like say if you live in an area, um, there might be a 500 tags available, but there might be like 2000 hunters that are applying for those tags. So most people are not going to get it. It's a, it's a, a very smart way. They've really got it down to a science because of that.

Speaker 1:          05:33          There's more white tail deer in this country than, than even when Columbus landed. Yeah, it's a, they've got a really good system. If they could figure something out for the ocean. The problem is you'd have to get everybody to cooperate in some, like they can't even get Japan to stop killing whales. Like there's, there's certain Japanese folks who, uh, they have this really sneaky thing they do and there's this, there's this, um, um, conservation group called the sea shepherds and they catch these fucking people all the time. But what they basically do is they say we're a research boat and they use a research boat and go slaughter whales and then sell the whales. But they pretend that it's, that it's research, but if they kill a whale, certain countries still value parts of Wales. They make things with it. What the fuck did they make with whales? I think they make some perfumes. Like what? But people are still killing whales. It gets, it gets weird when things are smart. That's when it gets weird. Yeah. You know, something as smart as a fucking whale.

Speaker 2:          06:34          Yeah. I mean, uh, the end, these, in these countries, the, they're using, like you said, parts of the fish for, you know, they put it on their mantle. They got like a a, I dunno, a tooth or, or what have you found from a whale or a shark

Speaker 1:          06:52          or whatever it is. That's the big thing with rhinos. Guys cut the rhino horns off and they drink it like in a tea and supposed to make your dick hard.

Speaker 2:          07:01          Oh, is, see, this is what I'm talking about. You know, these things. I mean, I don't know how the hell you remember all this stuff. I'm going to, I've just forgot the mileage off the coast. Great. Now,

Speaker 1:          07:19          13.8 models. Miles 12 nautical miles. One point difference. 1.8 difference at 12 miles, which is, who knows how long you get to 500 miles out. You gotta do the math. It's crazy. It's stupid. Yeah. Um, yeah. I don't know how I remember these things. It's a fucking screw we brain. I wish I had your memory, Joe. That's what I'm saying. It's not the best. I'm telling you. It's like there's still a lot of shit that I don't remember. I just remember things that are interesting. You know, I have, uh, it's, it's an odd, it's an odd sense of memory, but the, uh, the Rhino Horn thing is kind of sad because it doesn't even work, you know, especially in this day and age where people can get Viagra. It works. Yeah. But there's something about it, I think in some Asian cultures where it's considered like a sign of wealth.

Speaker 1:          08:10          You drive a Rolls Royce, you drink rhino t this guy's a baller. You know, he doesn't give a fuck. He drinks wine, Ot, you know, like, Oh man, guys drinking rhino t what a guy. Yeah. This, but there's something about that, like, you know, yeah, I want to eat an extinct animal. I want to bring a woolly mammoth back to life and shoot it in the head. Like there's some people that are like that. Like, they, they want to be the ultimate conqueror and you know, I want to eat a whale dick. You know what I mean? Like this. There's people that are like, that.
