00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:06.676
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Once you gain
your students' trust,

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:09.426
if you can give them that's just
a little beyond their reach,

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:13.086
then they will go way farther
than you ever expected.

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:17.986
And they will be hooked into that,
because every kid wants to achieve.

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:22.226
&gt;&gt;Student: Me having an idea
alone is not going to make as much

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:26.336
of a difference as ten kids having
an idea and putting that to life.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:29.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The students decided that
they wanted to have this campaign

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:34.376
against bullying and they
created a logo and a slogan,

00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:36.116
and the slogan was
"Break the System."

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:42.166
So their idea was that bullying is
this system of bad things that kind

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:46.206
of happen between victims and
perpetrators, between bullies

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:48.166
and the people that they bully.

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:52.716
So the idea was, if they could
get control of this thing

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.846
by teaching people to break the
system, then things would start

00:00:56.846 --> 00:00:58.316
to get a little bit
better for people.

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:06.476
In order to make this belong to
the kids, I started off by starting

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:09.146
with how they were feeling, and
things started coming out, like,

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:13.276
"I experienced bullying at this
time," or "I saw a kid get bullied

00:01:13.276 --> 00:01:14.796
and it made me feel
like this," or even,

00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:16.976
"I feel like a really
bad person right now,

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.146
because I've seen what things

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:20.566
that I've done could have
done to somebody else."

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:24.396
I think one of the most important
things for making something belong

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:25.846
to the kids is letting them talk.

00:01:25.846 --> 00:01:28.466
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Don't follow
in anyone's footsteps.

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:33.836
&gt;&gt;Student: Where's the "Find
someone that's confident" stuff?

00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:34.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, that's here.

00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:38.346
&gt;&gt;When the kids feel connected to
the material, they engage in it.

00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:43.276
And when they engage in it, they
participate in a whole different way.

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:46.086
And the other way that
kids really participate

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:49.326
and they become participants
is when you hand

00:01:49.326 --> 00:01:53.596
over the onus of learning to them.

00:01:53.796 --> 00:01:56.466
Kids learn so much more when
they're talking to each other.

00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:59.816
They learn so much more when they're
working through a problem together.

00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:02.816
They learn so much more when the
feedback comes from each other,

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:06.766
rather than from this higher power
that they hear from all the time.

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:10.606
&gt;&gt;Student: The things that are good
about it was the collaborative aspect

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:17.186
of it, how we were all able to
talk together and make a huge way

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:23.926
for teachers and students to learn
with each other about not bullying.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:26.126
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Starting at a
place of collaboration,

00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:30.816
finding the common ground, is a
place to build that collaboration

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:32.996
and it becomes a form of inclusion,

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:37.556
because when you have kids
collaborating on big projects,

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:40.416
on big issues, on solving
big problems,

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:45.336
then the kids who might not normally
have the strength in a situation,

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:46.856
their strengths come out.

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:50.036
&gt;&gt;Student: I was scared that
this wasn't going to work

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:53.146
like we wanted it to, but it did.

00:02:53.146 --> 00:02:55.646
Like it really taught
me lots of things,

00:02:55.876 --> 00:03:00.156
not only like as a person,
but, you know, as a kid.

00:03:00.156 --> 00:03:02.036
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The thing I like the
most about the Quest models,

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:05.316
I really like that
everything's contextualized.

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:10.656
I feel like my students have
connected a lot with that.

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:13.386
And the fact that they
have this reason,

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:16.396
this impetus for figuring things out.

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:20.436
And then on top of it, I think
it's really nice to be at a school

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:23.306
where we're expected to
have students collaborate,

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:28.356
because I really learn the value of
collaboration for kids and how much

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:29.976
of a difference that makes
for them in learning.
