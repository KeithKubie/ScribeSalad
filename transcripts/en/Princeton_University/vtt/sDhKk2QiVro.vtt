KATIE CHENOWETH: My
name is Katie Chenoweth,

00:00:01.923 --> 00:00:04.380
and I am teaching a course
called "Derrida's Library --

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.220
Deconstruction and the Book."

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.340
It's one of the very few
philosopher's libraries

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.749
that has been kept intact.

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.790
CARLOS KONG: When I decided
to come to Princeton,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.550
I knew that Derrida's
library was at Princeton.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.700
So that was an archive
that drew me here.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.450
ANNA KIMMEL: Princeton
University recently

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.880
acquired his library, and
I think the opportunity

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.310
to be hands-on with that
material is definitely

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.554
very enticing as a
researcher, and to be

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:29.970
able to be one of
the first people

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.447
not only to analyze his work
since his passing in 2004,

00:00:34.447 --> 00:00:36.030
but also to be one
of the first people

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.246
to really view how he read.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:39.870
KATIE CHENOWETH:
Derrida used his books

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.350
as these kind of almost files.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.630
So it's actually full
of this other stuff.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.780
And then there
are books that are

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.434
just full of annotations
and interesting marginalia.

00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:53.850
JOHN LOGAN: We
collect real things

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.090
because we want students to
have real experiences of them.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.730
That's why we buy annotated
books, for example.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.490
When you see a book that
Derrida had in his hand,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.290
and that he marked
up, and that he

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.960
put paper clips into
and post-its into,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.320
you have a feeling that you're
looking at a process happening.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.840
You're part of a process
that's happening.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.090
And that, it seems to me,
is extraordinarily exciting.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.830
KATIE CHENOWETH: There
were two main things

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.320
that I wanted the students
to get out of this class.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.370
One is that it's an introduction
to Derrida and his thought,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.410
and I didn't ask that
the students have

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.210
any prior experience with
Derrida before coming in.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.760
So it's really a course in
philosophy, in that sense.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.860
And that's sort of half
of what the course is.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.750
And then the other
half is really

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.600
an exploration of an
archive, and what it

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.010
means to use archival
materials, to really think

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.380
about archival
materials in relation

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.971
to a philosopher's work.

00:01:51.971 --> 00:01:54.220
ANNA KIMMEL: I'm really
interested in how he perceives

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.130
writing as gestural, as
an activity, as something

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.690
that's actively lived.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.680
As a dancer, that attention
to the now, to the presence,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.590
is very important.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.140
And that's something that I
have brought to the table.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.312
But at the same time, the class
is filled with other students

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:11.020
who might speak German
instead of French,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.380
or who might have a
presence in Greek language,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.459
and can really offer
a different nuance

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.625
to the readings of the text.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:20.180
CARLOS KONG: That the books in
it are real physical objects,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.970
and they have a
life of their own,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.779
and you see Derrida just putting
a bunch of different materials

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:26.320
in the books.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.580
So there are amazing
postcards and photographs

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.874
and notes, even pressed
leaves, sometimes,

00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:33.540
that I wouldn't expect
to find in books.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.206
KATIE CHENOWETH: So
there was a decision

00:02:35.206 --> 00:02:38.470
to treat this not as a
collection of book, book, book,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.750
book, book, but as something
else, something where

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.300
each object had a
relation to other objects,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.930
both in terms of their location,
in terms of their materiality.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.820
So if you go into the library
and you want to request a book,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.170
you never get just one book.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.280
You get an entire box.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.490
And that box will
often have books

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.860
by the same author,
books that were

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.230
close to that one on the shelf.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.020
And you'll have this whole
kind of treasure trove

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.830
where you get to
discover other things,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.980
and not just the
one thing that you

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.422
thought you wanted to look at.

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:15.130
ANNA KIMMEL: One day,
Professor Chenoweth

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.920
brought in a
typewriter to class.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.210
It modeled one of the
models that Derrida had.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.200
And that was just a way for
us to engage with our body,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.927
to really be hands-on, in a
very literal and physical way,

00:03:25.927 --> 00:03:27.760
with the text, in the
same way that Derrida,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.081
when he was writing.

00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:30.580
Especially now,
since our generation

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.950
mainly types on the
computer, that really

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.200
removed the physicality of
writing from the process.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.200
KATIE CHENOWETH: Well,
you can't do two fingers.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.780
Mm-mm.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.740
It can't do two things, usually,
right next to each other.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.720
For me, probably the
one thing I would

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.200
want students to take
away from the course

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.050
would be a sense that
thinking is not something

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.660
that happens abstractly.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.400
Philosophy is not something that
happens purely in the abstract,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.090
purely in the mind, that it
happens in relations to books

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.930
that you hold in your
hand, and pencils and pens,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.000
and marking and reading
as this active, material,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.680
technical process, and that
you absolutely cannot separate

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.790
those two.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.850
And I really hope
that that in turn

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.310
encourages students to
become more active thinkers

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.890
themselves, and to not think
about philosophy as something

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.800
that happens up in the clouds,
but as something that they're

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800
engaging with and they're
doing, even as they're

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.390
holding their books
in their hands

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.910
and making their
marks in their books.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.090
JOHN LOGAN: It's probably
the last library of its kind

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.030
that will come our way, because
people simply don't collect

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.491
books like that anymore.

00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:46.990
CARLOS KONG: With reading these
texts, with also the library

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.230
in mind, it's incredible to see
the way the idea of the library

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.541
is something that is
animated throughout Derrida's

00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.040
whole career and
his whole thinking.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.450
And you can read closely
the ways in which he

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.381
is thinking consciously about,
what will happen to my books

00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:00.881
one day?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.030
