Speaker 2:          00:10          let's keep going through the grammar of words. This time we're going to focus on the part of speech known as the pronouns. Pronouns work. A lot like nouns. They don't necessarily reference a specific concept like a noun does, but they can stand in for now, relate back to a now and they often share a lot of the same properties. Just like with nouns, we can expect that pronouns can reference a specific number, so we might have a distinction between singular and plural or singular, dual and plural. This allows some languages to distinguish between a singular you and a group of you in the plural pronouns also commonly show person. I am the first person. You are the second person he she or it is the third person, but notice that an English, we have a second set for the plural. We are the first person.

Speaker 2:          01:02          You all are the second person and they are the third person plural in English. The third person singular draws a distinction between he, she and it, but the third person plural, they doesn't make this differentiation in Romanian. On the other hand, gender is actually reflected in the third person, plural pronouns. We have Yay for a group of males or males and females, mixed gender and yelly for a group entirely composed of females or feminine nouns. The final property we'll talk about when dealing with pronouns is case. This is easier in English because we actually do distinguish case with our pronouns. Unlike with our nouns, think about the subject or nominated case versus the accusative or object case that I introduced when discussing nouns. I say I when I'm the subject, but me, when I'm the object. Compare ICU too. You see me? Both of these are first person singular pronouns. In the first sentence, it's in the nominative or subject case I and the second it's in the object or accusative case. Me

Speaker 2:          02:17          just as with nouns, we can lay all of these properties out and we ended up with a declension of a pronoun.
