00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.420
- Hi, I'm Karl Dunn
and this is my home forge

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.750
in Greenville, South Carolina.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.830
This is my main grinder here,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.290
uh, big vise there,
all the tools and stuff

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.580
right there.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.710
Keep all my belts
on a, uh, rolling cart

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.790
so I can get at them
whenever I need to.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.000
Here, this is my pride and joy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.170
This was my grandfather's
anvil.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.290
It gives me a lot of pride
to use this.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.210
This is my main forge,
uh, the big one.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.880
Um, I've had it six months
or so.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.380
Uh, this is the one
that I started with.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.750
Little bit smaller--more of
a knife maker, horseshoe forge.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.500
- Hi, I'm Derick.
Welcome to Damselfly Forge.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.040
<i>Let me give you
a little bit of a tour.</i>

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.380
This is the beast.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.330
It's a, uh--it's a drop hammer.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.960
It drops the hammer
once a second.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.790
It comes with appropriate
warnings.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.670
[laughs]

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.880
Let's take a step inside.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.420
<i>♪ ♪</i>

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.210
First thing, right inside
the shop is my punch press.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.620
This particular machine
was built in 1946.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.750
<i>I fully restored it.</i>

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.290
<i>This is actually what I use</i>

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.960
<i>to punch the holes
for pickets for fences.</i>

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.290
<i>This is my anvil I use
every day.</i>

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.750
This used to shoe horses
in New York City

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.420
back in the early 1800s.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.790
And now it is used every day
inside my shop.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.830
- Got my old coal forge
over there and a bag of coal.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.250
Didn't know if I was gonna be

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.040
doing some coal work
on this challenge.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.750
Up there, that's my favorite
saying in the world.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.580
Uh, do is greater than say.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.710
Anybody can say something,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.120
but the people that do it,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.540
those are the ones
you gotta look out for.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.420
So that's pretty much
Karl's forge

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.920
in Greenville, South Carolina.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.750
- So these are some examples
of ornamental pieces

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.080
I'm currently working on.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.420
I made these,
and I added to the form

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.420
for my own uses, but these
were practice pieces

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.880
to get ready to--
to do this job.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.380
This is my finish room
and machine room.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.000
Uh, of course,
I've got my milling machine.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.920
This is--this is a glorious,
wonderful thing.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.120
Before I built this shop,
I had a nonelectric shop.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.790
I drilled every hole
with a crank drill.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.330
It was quite a challenge.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.960
This is my bench for doing
all of my polishing,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.790
as well as some layout work and
miscellaneous this and that.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.040
So while I'm sitting at
this bench, doing layout

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.790
or anything else,
I can just, you know,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.960
take a look out this beautiful
view that I've got.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.330
That's pretty much
the whole tour.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.670
Thanks for stopping by
and checking it out.
