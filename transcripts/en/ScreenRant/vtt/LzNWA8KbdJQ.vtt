00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.500
When it comes to the fantastic, weird and
wonderful world of comic book characters,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.580
it's easy to think that they're all entirely
fictitious and created solely from the imaginations

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.770
of talented writers.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.529
In some cases, that may well be true, but
there are also some very real inspirations

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.970
behind a lot of them.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.000
Obviously there's nobody in the real world
who can lift a building, travel around the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.230
world in ten seconds or take a bullet to the
eye without suffering a horrific injury, but

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.550
the personalities, appearances and lifestyles
of many comic book characters are very much

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.750
based on people who have really existed.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.090
This notion applies to superheroes, supervillains
and indeed supporting characters and we’ll

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.140
look at some examples of all those in this
video.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.890
Here are 10 comic book characters you didn't
know are based on real people.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.690
Iron Man
Marvel legends Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Larry

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.640
Lieber and Don Heck created Iron Man with
a very famous business tycoon in mind.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.720
That man was Howard Hughes and Lee described
him as being "an inventor, an adventurer,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.631
a multi-billionaire, a ladies' man and finally
a nutcase" - doesn't all of that sound exactly

00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:08.850
like Tony Stark?

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.640
Hughes was incredibly rich and lived the kind
of eccentric life that most people could only

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.330
dream of - and that's certainly reflected
in Stark's lifestyle too.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.930
He also suffered from a crippling obsessive-compulsive
disorder - something that is touched upon

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.830
in a less devastating way in some of Tony
Stark's behaviour, such as his refusal to

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.080
be handed things.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.880
Batman
Artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger came

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.380
up with the idea for Batman AKA Bruce Wayne,
but their inspiration for the kind of character

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.750
he would be came from two very well-known
historical figures.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.250
Not only did they take Batman's real name
from the men in question, they also based

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.140
the kind of hero he would be on them.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.490
The first was Robert the Bruce - a famous
warrior who led Scotland against England during

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.740
the Scottish War of Independence.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.610
And the second was Mad Anthony Wayne - a war
general during the American Revolution who

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.670
became famous for winning battles against
opposition with bigger numbers, just like

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.689
Batman fights a one-man war against crime
in Gotham City.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.860
Wonder Woman
The incredibly powerful Amazon princess known

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.789
as Wonder Woman was based on two extremely
strong and formidable women from the real

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.789
world.

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:15.820
Wonder Woman's creator, William Moulton Marston
- the same man who invented the lie detector

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.540
- took inspiration from two of the most important
women in his life to create the superheroine.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.090
The first was his wife, Elizabeth, and the
second was his research assistant, Olive Byrne.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.819
Elizabeth inspired William to create someone
who triumphed over evil with love, while Olive

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.130
wore Arabic "protection bracelets" that inspired
the creation of Wonder Woman's Bracelets of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.340
Submission.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.959
Constantine
Created in a joint effort by Alan Moore, Stephen

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.810
R. Bissette and John Totleben, anti-hero and
supernatural expert John Constantine was actually

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.340
inspired by world famous musician and former
front-man of The Police, Sting.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.770
In this case, the inspiration came in the
form of the character's likeness.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.849
Early illustrations of Constantine heavily
resembled Sting both facially and in terms

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.410
of the character's clothing, and there was
even a nod to this fact in one of the character's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.129
first appearances on-panel, when Constantine
appeared on a boat with the words The Honourable

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.550
Gordon Sumner - Sting's real name - written
on the bow.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.800
Bucky Barnes
These days, pretty much everyone knows Bucky

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.650
Barnes as the best friend of Steve Rogers
AKA Captain America.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.690
The pair went to school together and are the
same age - but that wasn't always the case.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.739
Bucky was introduced in the comic books as
a schoolboy companion to the grown-up Captain

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.900
America and was actually based on a real-life
schoolkid.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.150
Bucky was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby
and Simon revealed that he was named after

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:41.060
Bucky Pierson, a star player on his high school
basketball team.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.080
The Flash
There have, of course, been several characters

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.019
who have gone by the name The Flash throughout
DC Comics' history - Jay Garrick, Wally West

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.250
and Bart Allen, for example - but the second
super-fast hero to go by the name was Barry

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.250
Allen.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.849
Barry Allen was named after two different
iconic American talk show hosts from different

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.230
media platforms.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.300
Writer Robert Kanigher and artist Carmine
Infantino came up with his name by combining

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.060
those of radio host Barry Gray and Steve Allen,
the first host of television's The Tonight

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.640
Show.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.160
J. Jonah Jameson
There's simply no way we could create a list

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.690
like this without mentioning J. Jonah Jameson
– and there’s an extremely good reason

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.690
for that.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.280
It's because Jameson was based on none other
than real-life Marvel legend Stan Lee!

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.979
Created By Steve Ditko and Lee himself, Jameson
is an exaggerated, much angrier version of

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.539
the latter.

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.389
The Spider-Man-hater and editor-in-chief of
the Daily Bugle resembles Lee in terms of

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.860
his appearance and has an amplified version
of the former Marvel president's already huge

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.569
personality.

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.639
Professor X
Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the personality

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.259
of the X-Men's wise mutant mentor Professor
Charles Xavier - also known as Professor X

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.099
- is quite famously inspired by Martin Luther
King Jr. (with Magneto - his more militant

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.369
and often more evil counterpart - being inspired
by Malcolm X, incidentally).

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:01.289
But his appearance was influenced by a real-life
individual too.

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.490
That man was Russian actor and The King and
I star Yul Brynner, whose bald head and extremely

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.360
prominent eye-brows were quite obviously mirrored
by those of the telepathic superhero.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.349
Superman
No list of comic book characters is ever complete

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.080
without the most iconic of them all - Superman.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.029
Pretty much every aspect of the Man of Steel
was inspired by real-life people.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:25.639
Superman was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe
Shuster, both of whom were fond of swashbuckling

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.979
movies like Robin Hood and The Mark of Zorro
- so they modeled Superman's physique and

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.379
poses on the star of those movies, Douglas
Fairbanks Sr.

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.720
The look of his alter-ego, Clark Kent, was
based on the appearance of both Shuster and

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.889
silent actor Harold Lloyd, while his name
was a combination of actors Clark Gable and

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.069
Kent Taylor's.

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.879
The Joker
Don't worry, nobody in existence has ever

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.110
been quite crazy enough to have their personality
inspire the creation of The Joker, but there

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.370
was a real-life actor whose iconic silent
movie character formed the basis of Batman's

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.370
most formidable foe.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.879
In The Man Who Laughs, Conrad Veidt played
a man whose facial disfigurement meant it

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.550
looked like he was creepily grinning all the
time.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.861
The Joker's creator, Bob Kane, came up with
the idea to apply that concept to his character

00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:11.039
- although the initial idea for The Joker
character actually came from a 17-year-old

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.449
boy he knew called Jerry Robinson.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.069
Thanks for watching our list of 10 comic book
characters you didn't know are based on real

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:18.069
people.
