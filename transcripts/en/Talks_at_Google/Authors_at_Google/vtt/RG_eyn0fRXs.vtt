RICH MINER: OK.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.860
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.680
Very exciting speaker today.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.810
For all of you, I bet a
bunch of you are in sales,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.460
is that correct?

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.690
I know there's a formula
at the top of this book.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.930
Don't be too intimidated.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.940
Mark will go over it.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.684
So don't worry about that.

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:24.100
And this is Google
after all, so I

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.058
think this is a very
appropriate talk about how

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:27.860
to use data to drive sales.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.619
Mark Roberge from HubSpot is
here to talk about this book.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.740
And I'm not sure
if you guys know,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.550
I'm Rich Miner from
Google Ventures.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.570
We actually invested in
HubSpot several years ago

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.700
and rode that through its
initial public offering.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.440
And that's when
I first met Mark.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.540
Today, HubSpot's trading
at about $1.6 billion.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.920
Mark was employee number four.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.230
Started the sales there after
graduating from MIT Sloan.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.340
And that was his first sales
job, which he'll talk about.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.920
And he grew it from,
basically, $0 in sales

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.580
to over $100 million and
to where it is today.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.120
And so without further ado, I
will let Mark hop up on stage

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.070
and tell his story.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.195
MARK ROBERGE: Thanks, Rich.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.180
Thanks, guys, for having me out.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.740
Thank you, Rich.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740
One of my favorite things
about coming to Google

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.840
is I love using Google
Maps to find Google.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.340
It's like you guys need to have
a take me to your master button

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.980
just to make that
super straightforward.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.820
But, awesome to be here.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.070
It's been great getting to
know Rich over the years

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.560
and watching the
HubSpot journey.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.960
As he mentioned, I met one
of our co-founders, Dharmesh,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.850
sitting next to him
in class at MIT.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.340
He had this business
idea about HubSpot.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.624
He invested in a startup
that I was doing.

00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:50.040
As part of that deal, he asked
that I help him out one day

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.580
a week.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.450
And that was my
venture into HubSpot.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.860
I decided to join full-time
and join as a fourth employee.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.400
Scaled up sales and service
to about 425 employees

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.910
and got the company to about
$100 million in revenue.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.576
In the last two years,
I've been working

00:02:05.576 --> 00:02:07.910
on getting us into the sales
product arena, which I can

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.441
talk to about during the Q&amp;A.

00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:10.940
But it's that first
journey that I'm

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.190
going to tell you about today.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.870
What people get a
kick out of the story

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.010
is, as Rich mentioned, I've
never been in sales before.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.990
This was my first sales job.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.970
Probably like many of you, I
studied engineering undergrad.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.810
I started my career at Accenture
back in the late '90s, writing

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.510
Java and et cetera.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.550
And I have a degree from MIT,
which tends to be quant-based.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.420
So my professional
world has always

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.910
been viewed through this
lens of data, and technology,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.340
and science.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.400
And it was that lens
that I used to challenge

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.291
some of the norms of
traditional sales execution.

00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:49.290
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.220
So when I took the
role, really, my mission

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.840
was predictable
scalable revenue growth.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.720
If some of you ever decide to
go and found your own company,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.830
and do a Series A or a seed fund
to pitch to a guy like Rich,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.560
write these four
words on the screen.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.862
They all love it.

00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:08.570
Scribble it down.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.430
That's what we want too.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.320
So that's a good place to start.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.650
There were four tactics that I
used to achieve that mission.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.180
The first one was,
how can I hire

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.047
the same successful
salesperson every single time?

00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:25.630
The second was, how
could I train them

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.480
in a very predictable way?

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.150
The third was, how
could I provide them

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.690
with the same quality
and quantity of leads

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.980
every single month?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.480
And the fourth was,
how could I hold

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.820
them accountable
to the same sales

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.680
process against those leads?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.780
And I figured if I could
achieve those four tactics,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.410
I'd have a high degree of
likelihood of succeeding

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.730
against my mission.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.600
And these are the four sections
we'll talk about today.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.390
So hiring.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.500
And I typically
stop here and ask

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.450
the audience, what do you
look for in a salesperson?

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.740
Or if you were to hire a
salesperson as a founding

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.323
entrepreneur, what
would you look for?

00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:01.880
And I do that because the
audience has no clue what

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.660
they're talking about.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.910
In this case, I'm very envious
of the very scientific approach

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.150
that Google takes, so maybe
I'll pose that question

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.690
in hopes of maybe
learning something here.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.970
But are there sales?

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.220
I know Rosenthal's a
hiring manager here.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.630
Are there other hiring managers
in the audience for sales?

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.490
So just what do you guys
look for in sales hiring?

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.122
AUDIENCE: Process-oriented.

00:04:26.122 --> 00:04:28.580
MARK ROBERGE: And how do you
look for that in the interview

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.780
process, briefly?

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.130
AUDIENCE: We have them describe
a situation or situations,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.749
and we tease that out, how
they approach problem-solving.

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.540
MARK ROBERGE: You want
to give me one more?

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.290
That's a good one.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.636
I love that.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:43.055
Go ahead.

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:44.474
AUDIENCE: General
business sense.

00:04:44.474 --> 00:04:46.880
Give them a business challenge
like starting a company

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.975
and hear how they think.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:49.350
Especially if it's
something they

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.786
haven't thought
about before, just

00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:52.036
to hear the level of thinking.

00:04:52.036 --> 00:04:52.785
MARK ROBERGE: Yep.

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:53.430
I love that.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.350
So we had business sense,
for the video there.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.169
And we had
process-oriented there.

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:57.710
I love those.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.790
So let me tell you a little
bit about a story that I had.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.770
So when I first went
out and hired folks,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.440
I think it was the seventh
hire I made in 2008.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.430
And I was able to
nab the number one

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.400
salesperson from an 800 person
sales team here in Boston.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.790
It wasn't Google.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.270
It was a public company.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.971
And I was psyched.

00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:23.470
I had somehow
convinced them that we

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.700
were going to be the
next big deal in town,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.330
and they decided to come over.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.220
And I was surprised
that that person did not

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.585
crush it at our company.

00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:31.460
I thought they would.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.626
I thought they would come
in and completely teach us

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:34.800
how to sell.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.950
And as I stood back
and thought about it,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.270
and reflected on
that situation, I

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.050
realized that they came from
such a different context

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.480
than where we were selling.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.649
They came from this
enormous brand.

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:46.690
They picked up the phone.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.870
People knew exactly what was
coming in terms of the pitch.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.830
It was a very
transactional sale.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.172
It was usually a
same-call decision.

00:05:55.172 --> 00:05:57.380
And they would do as much
activity as [? probable. ?]

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.580
That led to success.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.170
That couldn't have been more
different than the context

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.360
that we were selling at
HubSpot in the early days.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.119
No one had a clue who we were.

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.410
We told them we are selling
inbound marketing software.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.560
They had no idea what
inbound marketing was.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.960
It was a very evangelistic
consultative sell.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.630
And it made be understand
that when hiring managers

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.500
and when entrepreneurs
ask me, well,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.480
what do you look for
in a salesperson?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.560
It's almost like an
irrelevant question.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.030
Because it so depends
on their unique context,

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.180
and how complex their sale
is, who they're selling to,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.310
et cetera.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.590
So that was my first takeaway is
the ideal sales hiring formula

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.320
is different for every company.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.470
However, I do
think that there is

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.080
a consistent process on how
that formula can actually

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.261
be engineered.

00:06:41.261 --> 00:06:43.760
And I think this is something
that you guys do exceptionally

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.620
well.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.700
And it's something that I
just, using my engineering

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.550
background, kind
of instinctively

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.750
try to go at this in terms
of predicting success.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.840
So the first year, I
wrote down the 10 criteria

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.890
that I thought would
correlate with success

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.020
in our environment.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.630
I clearly defined what
each criteria was.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.960
I clearly defined what a score
of a 1 to 3, or a 5 to 7,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.630
or an 8 to 10 would look like.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.990
And I was disciplined about
scoring every single hire

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.730
against that criteria.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.610
And the nice thing about
sales, unlike engineering

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.460
and marketing and
other disciplines,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.530
is it's probably the most
quantitative function where

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.950
you can quantify success.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.220
And by following
this process, it

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.270
allowed me to reflect
on the first six hires,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.190
the first twelve
hires that I made,

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.180
and start to pick up patterns
as to what's predicting success

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.490
and what's not, and
iterate on that approach.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.660
And it wasn't, long
probably about 18 months in,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.640
where, as a young startup, I
was able to do a regression

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.320
analysis against
predicting success,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.860
and attainment rate,
and revenue success,

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.650
and that kind of stuff,
with the criteria

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.420
that I was actually observing
during the interview process.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.790
So this is the results of
the first regression analysis

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.800
that I did.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.550
And this evolved a little
bit from where we ended up.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.220
What was really
interesting about this

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.060
was some of the criteria
that you typically associate

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.500
with a good salesperson,
maybe in like a car sales

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.400
environment, something we
think is a traditional sales

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.730
environment, like closing
ability, convincing, objection

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.420
handling, those are actually
negatively correlated

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.320
with success in our model.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.120
And things that
you would associate

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.880
with a great
consultant or a coach,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.190
like preparation, and
domain experience,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.830
and intelligence, those
were most highly correlated.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.610
So I thought this was a really
cool outcome that there's

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.610
been a lot of chat about how
the buyer behaviors change,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.890
and sales needs to change,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.570
And this was some form
of statistical proof

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.730
that the buyers wanted a
different type of salesperson

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.330
that was less the person that
was jamming concepts down

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.310
your throat, and more someone
that they could trust, respect,

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.580
get advisement from, and
appreciate through the sales

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.700
process.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.150
So there were five criteria
over time in our context

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.010
that correlated with success.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:14.070
And I do believe that in a
lot of tech entrepreneurship

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.680
situations, these five criteria
actually correlate pretty well.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.920
I'll poll you guys to
see how you do here.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.552
So these three are
all in the top five.

00:09:23.552 --> 00:09:25.600
One of them is number
one, obviously.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.290
So how many think intelligence
is the number one correlating

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.400
criteria in our environment?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.220
How about coach-ability?

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.720
How about curiosity?

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.220
OK.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:38.801
Cool.

00:09:38.801 --> 00:09:39.300
I got you.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.030
Curiosity was number two.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.240
Coach-ability was
actually number one.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.290
And what was really interesting
about that was coach-ability

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:51.010
wasn't even in my first
set of the 10 criteria

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:51.750
that I laid out.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.130
It didn't come
until a year later

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.580
when I looked and saw some
people who were absolutely

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.490
crushing it at their
last job, but they

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.640
weren't doing well here.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.670
And they were the types of folks
that just locked themselves

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.460
in the room and weren't open to
the training and the coaching.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.160
They were like, you know what?

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.730
I know how to sell.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.170
I've been selling for 10 years.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.230
Let me just go figure it out.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.550
And they were the folks that
actually ended up failing.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.390
So it's something that
we had to really get out

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.457
in the interview process.

00:10:17.457 --> 00:10:19.540
So there's coach-ability,
curiosity, intelligence,

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.450
work ethic, and prior success.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.470
And if there's curiosity
on how I interview on that,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.730
we can talk about
that during the Q&amp;A.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.920
So moving onto training.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.300
What I found with
training was, I first

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.790
interviewed 30 VPs of
sales when I took this job

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.911
in the first year.

00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:39.910
Because I didn't know
what the heck I was doing,

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.600
and I'd never done this before.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.620
And I learned some
stuff from that process.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.460
But I also found
some things that I

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.710
didn't like about the process.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.234
And training was
certainly one of them.

00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:51.650
It seemed like
when I asked folks,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.840
how do you train
your salespeople?

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.700
They said, hey, Bob,
welcome to the company.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.770
You remember, Sue, our
number one salesperson

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.022
from the interview process?

00:10:59.022 --> 00:11:01.230
Well, you're going to sit
next to her for two months,

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.360
or you're going to ride
with her for two months.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.760
And that didn't feel scalable
nor predictable for me.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.160
So I wanted to challenge
that and create

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.690
a much more predictable
exam-oriented,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.180
certification-oriented
approach, which we did.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.880
We introduced a
sales methodology,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.200
and that was very important.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.130
What I found was,
over the years,

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.930
as I looked at our top
performing salespeople,

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.710
each salesperson that
was a top performer

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.330
was a top performer
for a different reason.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.100
Like I had this guy, Adam, who
was an absolute activity hound.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.850
Every time we generate
our monthly reports,

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.349
he had 40% more activity
than everybody else.

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:45.640
He would just crush the phones.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.640
If you went and sat
behind him at his desk,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.647
he had like five
tabs of his CRM open.

00:11:50.647 --> 00:11:51.480
He was on the phone.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.150
He was writing emails.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.983
He was taking notes.

00:11:52.983 --> 00:11:53.950
He was a multi-tasker.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.260
He was insane.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.680
And he was mediocre
at everything else.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.427
He wasn't the best
consultative seller.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.510
He didn't build the best
trust with his prospects.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.370
He didn't do the
best discovery calls.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.460
But because he had 40% more
activity than everybody else,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.520
huge numbers came
out the bottom.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.500
And then I had Jen.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.160
And Jen was an amazing
rapport builder.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.960
Like you listened to her
demos, the first half hour

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.750
was about sports, and kids,
and church, and the weather.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.050
And she was best friends
with every prospect

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.730
that she spoke to.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.000
Now again, didn't give
the best product demo.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.540
Didn't give the best
discovery calls.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.110
But because her prospect loved
her so much, many, many of them

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.300
bought.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.100
Now they were both
top performing reps.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.860
Imagine if Jen trained
by watching Adam or Adam

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.280
trained by watching Jen.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.950
They would have
picked up bad habits.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.320
They would have had
different perception

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.153
of their unique superpowers
and whether they

00:12:46.153 --> 00:12:48.210
could use their superpowers
in our environment.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.419
And I see that happen
time and time again.

00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:51.960
So that's another
reason why I really

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.000
wanted to strive toward
this standard process.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.930
Now beyond that
in training, there

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.140
are two opportunities
that we took advantage of.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:08.670
One was because the buyers have
a higher expectation from sales

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.860
and want to learn
from them, we thought

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.750
it was absolutely
critical that we

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.380
strive in training to
put our salespeople

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.340
into the seats, the professional
seats, of their buyers

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.820
as best we could.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.980
So in our example, every
single HubSpot salesperson

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.810
spends a good deal of
their 30 day training

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.340
building their own
website and their own blog

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.140
on the HubSpot software.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.990
They generate a
social media following

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.380
of 100 plus followers for this
mini-business that they start.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.070
They rank in Google
for dozens of words.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.000
They set up landing
pages and run A/B tests.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.500
They generate an email following
and nurture those emails.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.261
They set up an
analytics platform

00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:52.260
so that they can actually
measure the conversion

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.410
rates between each one.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.700
And by the time they're
done with that training,

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.460
they can actually school
90% of the marketers

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.800
that they're going to
speak with on the phone.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.110
And so I think that's a
big opportunity that I'd

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.860
like to see more companies
do is go beyond just

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.534
the typical product
training and try

00:14:08.534 --> 00:14:10.825
to get these folks engaged
in the day-to-day lives that

00:14:10.825 --> 00:14:12.040
are better sellers.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.720
The other opportunity
that we had was there's

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.930
an opportunity for
the salespeople

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.050
to build up their own
personal brand and trust

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.820
within the ecosystem.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.440
So many corporations and
brands are doing a better job

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.060
on their content
marketing strategy

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.480
and their inbound marketing
strategy these days.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.380
And trying to come
up more organically,

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.210
whether it's in search or
social media discussions.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.860
That same opportunity
exists for the salespeople.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.900
And I encourage our salespeople.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.732
And even when I go out and
meet other salespeople,

00:14:48.732 --> 00:14:49.690
and they'll talk to me.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.320
They're like, Mark, I
cold call 50 hours a month

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.880
in order to generate demand
for myself and my company.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.252
I say, that's the reality.

00:14:58.252 --> 00:14:58.960
It's a sales job.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.700
You need to cold call.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.960
But here's what
I'd like you to do.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.170
Next month, spend 40 hours
a month cold calling.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.030
And use that 10 hours
a month that you saved

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:13.320
and actually participate
online where your prospects

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.950
are actually conversing.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.920
So what blogs are your
prospects following?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.010
Read those blogs,
comment on those blogs.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.340
In fact, submit a guest
post for your blog

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.710
if you have a corporate blog.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.235
What LinkedIn groups are
your prospects a part of?

00:15:28.235 --> 00:15:30.510
Get involved in
those LinkedIn groups

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.400
and answer those questions.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.620
On Twitter, who do
they follow on Twitter?

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.769
Follow those same people,
and retweet their stuff.

00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:39.435
And you'd be surprised
that those people

00:15:39.435 --> 00:15:40.830
will start following you.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.163
And then do that for two months.

00:15:42.163 --> 00:15:45.190
And then ask yourself,
were those 10 hours a month

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.230
spent better cold calling,
or were they spent better

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.920
participating in social media?

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.860
What kind of action did
that stir up for you?

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.360
And I think most
salespeople find

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.110
that that was a really
productive process,

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.290
and they may actually double
down on those efforts.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.748
So there's certainly
an opportunity

00:15:59.748 --> 00:16:01.770
out there for
salespeople themselves

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.576
to set themselves up
as thought leaders.

00:16:03.576 --> 00:16:05.450
And that's something
that can be incorporated

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.420
into training as well.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:13.240
Third section, same quality
and quantity of leads.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.400
How many people in
the last six months

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.910
have received a cold call,
either at your office

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.330
or at your home, and you got
into this engaging conversation

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.900
with the telemarketer,
and you ended up buying

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.729
the product they were selling?

00:16:26.729 --> 00:16:29.020
There's usually like one,
like a timeshare or something

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.610
like that.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.870
I had one that called me.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.610
He said, do you have a
crack in your windshield?

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.110
I said no.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.240
And they just hung up.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.650
That's what these people
are doing in these jobs.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.440
I don't know why they do this.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.220
How many people in
the last six months

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.720
have received a piece of direct
mail or an unsolicited email

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.950
to your inbox?

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.760
You opened it, you
were intrigued,

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.070
and you ended up
buying the product.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.760
What was it?

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.510
AUDIENCE: Clothes.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.426
MARK ROBERGE: Clothes?

00:16:56.426 --> 00:16:57.690
OK, you're fired from Google.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.550
You're not supposed to do this.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.140
That's cool.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.056
It's unique to find that
amongst the audience.

00:17:02.056 --> 00:17:02.950
But that's cool.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:03.930
What brand was it?

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.119
They get me too.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.871
I always get the
catalogs and stuff.

00:17:06.871 --> 00:17:08.079
AUDIENCE: I'd rather not say.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.829
MARK ROBERGE: OK, that's cool.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.250
I'm a big fan of
Pistol Lake these days,

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.069
like the startup
hoodie thing going on.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.470
But yeah, you don't
have to tell me.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.150
How many people in
the last six months

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:22.849
have gone to Google to do a
search or out into social media

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:24.230
to do some research
on a product,

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.460
and that research led
to you buying a product?

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.600
OK, so the folks in
this room has probably

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.970
had the biggest influence of
any company on this trend.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.100
But this is the reality
of the buying journey

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.800
that we're dealing
with today is buyers

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.630
have complete empowerment.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.970
And they don't have
to go to trade shows.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.630
They don't have to deal with
these interruptive outbound

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.230
marketing, as we call it.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.900
They can be in their bunny
slippers on a Saturday night,

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.670
doing research after
the kids are asleep,

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.086
making business decisions and
choosing the vendors they're

00:17:53.086 --> 00:17:54.471
going to do business with.

00:17:54.471 --> 00:17:56.720
And what's really interesting
and still an opportunity

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.675
for us, and obviously, a huge
amount that you guys continue

00:17:59.675 --> 00:18:04.730
to take advantage of, is
when you go back and resurvey

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.864
most audiences and
ask them, where

00:18:06.864 --> 00:18:09.030
are they spending their
sales and marketing budgets?

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.670
How much are they
spending on trade shows,

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.740
and interruptive
advertising, and cold calling

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.300
versus how much are they
putting into content

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.180
and the efforts that can attract
people to their businesses?

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.520
There's still a
huge disproportion

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.460
to the buyer behavior that we
just proved out in that survey

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.094
and proves out time
and time again.

00:18:29.094 --> 00:18:30.760
And that's a big
opportunity, obviously,

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.240
that we've always tried to
push is this inbound marketing

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.800
message leading into content.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:42.980
And the thing that most
businesses don't recognize

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.460
is the importance of
content development

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.390
and the journalist's
role in that.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.810
I was actually just speaking
to a startup on the way

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.040
here, down in New York.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.180
100 people, starting to build
out their marketing team.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.320
And it amazes me, to this
day, that it knocks them

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.460
off their seat when I tell
them that our second hire

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.430
in our marketing team when
we were only 20 people

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.660
was a journalist from
the "New York Times."

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.070
And that's really how a lot
of these marketing teams

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.470
need to be thinking.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.890
It's less about these folks
who have product marketing

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:19.500
backgrounds, and trade show
booth skills, or direct mail

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.300
skills, and that kind of stuff.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.630
And it's more about
people can just

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:30.470
speak to a neurologist with
a very deep PhD and great

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.900
knowledge in a space that
they know nothing about,

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.100
and actually take from that
hour-long cup of coffee

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.630
a beautiful piece that
layman folks can understand.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.610
That's what a great
journalist can do.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.730
And that person
and that skill set

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.920
plays an enormous role
in marketing teams today.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.230
It plays an enormous role
in the demand generation

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.980
formula for many businesses.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.410
The great thing
about that is it's

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.680
not a great time to be
a journalist these days

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.580
in a traditional manner.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.340
The newspapers and magazines
are not exactly doing well.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.960
And these folks are far less
expensive than a programmer

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.140
and far easier to find.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.155
So not even they know that they
hold the keys to the future

00:20:13.155 --> 00:20:14.230
of sales and marketing.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.810
So we hope to see more companies
take advantage of that.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.356
And the process
that we like to see

00:20:19.356 --> 00:20:20.730
is once you find
that journalist,

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.300
they don't have to
necessarily have

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.930
domain experience
in the business

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.370
that they're working in.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.990
That's really the
job of the business.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.360
The CEO, the C-suite,
the salespeople

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.655
usually have great
knowledge of the domain

00:20:32.655 --> 00:20:34.960
because they're talking
to prospects all the time.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.650
So when you find that
journalist, coupling them

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.610
with a few dozen or dozens
of thought leadership folks,

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.470
a committee, within the
organization is advantageous.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.510
And they can sit down once
a week for an hour with one

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.070
thought leader, and
they can interview them

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:54.770
and produce a five-page ebook,
and produce three or four blog

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.720
posts, and produce a few dozen
social media messages that they

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.820
can actually schedule
over the course of a month

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.800
from that one interview.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.360
And those social
media messages go out

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.530
over the course of a month.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.000
They point back to the
relevant blog articles.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.610
And most importantly, at
the end of each blog article

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.830
is a call to action
that says, did you

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.230
like this blog article on XYZ?

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.590
Perhaps you'd like the
five-page ebook that we wrote.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.790
And that is yours for free.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.190
We just need your name,
phone number, email address,

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.340
and company, and
you can have it.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.340
And that simple process
that didn't put a big burden

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.250
on the executive
leadership team, the sales

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.590
team, the engineering team
for content development,

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.750
really specialized it in someone
who can do that very well,

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.279
creates a huge
following in Google.

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:42.445
Lots of great organic traffic
coming to the website.

00:21:42.445 --> 00:21:45.380
A really high conversion
rate from visit

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.920
to lead on your website.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.620
And a nice stream of quality
leads for the sales team.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.660
So this has done very
well for organizations.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.160
The other thing
that comes up a lot

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.060
is aligning marketing
and sales, especially

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.892
at that mid-market
company level.

00:22:00.892 --> 00:22:02.350
It's something that
we went through

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.150
and a lot of our customers
go through as well.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.880
And a lot of the companies
that we go and visit,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.510
we find that marketing and
sales has traditionally

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.850
not gotten along.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.500
I don't know if
you guys have gone

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.910
through that at some point.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.490
You probably did.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.690
What I find often
is that marketers

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.370
feel that their salespeople
are overpaid spoiled brats.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.150
And the salespeople
feel that marketers

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.920
do arts and crafts all day.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.890
And that's the reality
of that relationship.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.540
And then they go back to
their respective corners

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.050
of the office, and
do their cold calls

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.110
and do their trade show
booths and branding exercises.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.700
And there's dysfunction.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.740
And that dysfunction
is the kiss of death

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.130
in today's modern organization
when so many buying journeys

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.470
start online and need
to be eloquently passed

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.560
off to the salesperson.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.000
So this alignment is
really, really critical,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.770
and something that we worked
hard on in quantifying.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.670
And so that's the first step.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.380
We created this sales and
marketing SLA, service level

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.810
agreement, where we quantified
the deliverables from marketing

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.040
to sales and sales to marketing.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.930
So as an example, we
knew in the first year

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.570
or two of our business that
for a mid-market salesperson,

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.220
if we gave them 100
inbound leads a month,

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.370
that they would
connect with half,

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.130
create 30 sales
opportunities, do 15 demos,

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.310
and close 5 customers
for roughly $800 monthly

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.230
recurring revenue per customer.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.200
And that math worked very well.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.880
So if we had 10 mid-market
salespeople, each needing 100

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.060
leads a month, it was
very easy to define

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:40.330
that SLA of 1,000
mid-market qualified sales

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.280
leads for that team.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.600
And that was the journey
that marketing had to follow.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.040
Sounds really good.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.110
And if I found a company that
did that, I would say, great.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.960
You're in the top
5% of your peers

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.070
in terms of the sales and
marketing alignment journey.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.450
However, even that
sophistication

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.090
created misalignment.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:02.730
And what happened was we
counted a VP of marketing

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.930
who came to our
website and requested

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.170
a demo as a qualified lead.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:08.870
That was beautiful.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.550
We also counted
a VP of marketing

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.070
from a mid-market company
that download a white paper

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.650
as a qualified lead.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.120
That's a great lead.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.160
Now any guesses as to which
one closed at a higher rate?

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.140
The demo request or the
white paper download?

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:26.820
Demo request.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.660
It was about three times higher.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.990
And which one is easier
for marketing to generate?

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.010
To get a visitor
to request a demo

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.000
or to get them to
download a white paper?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.500
Right?

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.560
So even though we were pretty
sophisticated in our approach,

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.350
it still created a misalignment.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.760
And sure enough, as the
month or quarter unfolded

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.830
and the marketing team
fell behind in their SLA,

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.860
all the calls to
actions on the website

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.040
moved from demo requests
to white paper downloads.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.950
And the sales team
was like, what

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.060
happened to those
beautiful demo requests?

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.660
So Mike Volpe, our CMO and I,
sat back and thought about it.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.830
And we're studying
the lead flow.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:07.280
And let's take the mid-market
example in the upper-right.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.270
We studied tens of thousands of
leads that were at the problem

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.720
education stage.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.740
They had downloaded
white papers.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.140
And those converted
to customers at 2%.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.451
And when they bought software
from us, they spent $200,000.

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:20.450
I made these numbers up.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.410
But you get the point.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.330
Versus if someone
went all the way down

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.362
to the solution research
stage and requested a demo,

00:25:27.362 --> 00:25:29.320
well, they would close
at three times the rate.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.510
They'd close at 6% and
again, would spend $200,000

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.959
when they bought software.

00:25:34.959 --> 00:25:36.750
So we simply multiplied
the conversion rate

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.375
times the average
revenue per customer,

00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:41.010
and that got us a lead value.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:46.600
So now, white paper
downloads were worth $4,000,

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.850
and demo request were worth 12.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.170
And now I was in a
position to tell marketing,

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.060
I no longer need 1,000
mid-market leads from you

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:56.900
a month.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.440
I need $700,000 of lead value.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.410
And whether you
get there through,

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:08.720
whatever the math is, 1,000 or
so of the white paper downloads

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.860
or 3,000 or so of the demo
requests, that's up to you.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.640
And this was a very,
very effective concept

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.510
and a cool concept when
you think we put marketing

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.160
on a revenue quota
just like sales,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.360
and that kind of
accountability month to month.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.840
And suddenly, literally,
the next week,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.700
all the calls to actions on the
website went to demo requests.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.650
And it was great.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.360
Sales loved them,
more qualified leads.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.425
And marketing was getting
the appropriate credit

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:34.800
for the hard work
they were doing

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.450
in driving that quality lead.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:40.980
Now sales does not get off
the hook with this process.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.570
They're equally accountable.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.700
And what I would do is I'd
ask questions like, OK, when

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.554
I get a qualified lead, I know
we should call it right away.

00:26:49.554 --> 00:26:50.470
I know we should call.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:55.980
But if I do get voicemail, do
I call it this afternoon again,

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.240
or tomorrow, or next week?

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.690
Or when should I try it again?

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.960
And how many times should
I try it before I give up?

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.890
And as a sales leader, should I
give each salesperson one lead

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.397
a month and have them
call it 1,000 times?

00:27:07.397 --> 00:27:09.105
Or give them 1,000
leads a month and have

00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:10.589
them call them once each?

00:27:10.589 --> 00:27:12.880
So obviously, the right answer
is somewhere in between.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.580
But where is that right answer?

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.805
So another study, to
give you some examples

00:27:16.805 --> 00:27:19.510
of some of this stuff,
stuff that you guys

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:23.450
do quite well as well,
is here, the x-axis

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.690
is the number of attempts
we made against these leads.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.990
Some were only attempted twice.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.820
Some were attempted 12 times.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.660
And the y-axis is the
profitability of those efforts.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.694
Because clearly, when you call
something more frequently,

00:27:37.694 --> 00:27:39.610
your likelihood to get
on the phone is higher,

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.020
but it costs you more
in terms of your pursuit

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.320
of that account.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.602
So wherever we could
maximize these behaviors

00:27:46.602 --> 00:27:48.810
in terms of profitability,
that was the right answer.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.310
So the orange line was
the small business leads,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.546
and that maxed out
at around 5 attempts.

00:27:54.546 --> 00:27:55.920
The blue line was
the mid-market.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.810
That maxed out
around 8 attempts.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.362
And the black line
was 12 attempts.

00:28:01.362 --> 00:28:02.820
The black was the
enterprise leads,

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.340
and that maxed out
at 12 attempts.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.210
So now I could go to the
sales team and say, guys,

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.900
we have calculated the behavior
to making the most money here

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.180
at HubSpot.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.680
And that's what
salespeople like to hear.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.720
And guys, we programmed
this into the CRM.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.530
You don't even have
to think about it.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.820
You go, you call lead.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.900
The CRM automatically
notes that call

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.420
and puts that lead away, and
brings it back the next time

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.700
it should call.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.190
And each night,
we're going to have

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.770
a report that goes out to
make sure that nothing's

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.670
fallen through the cracks.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.500
And salespeople like
that, too, if you

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.370
start with a very
data-driven culture.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:39.340
They like the fact that
this is my lead flow.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.497
And I want to make sure
I'm optimizing the revenue

00:28:41.497 --> 00:28:42.330
from that lead flow.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.800
And I'm glad that the
system checks it for me.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.350
So each night, a report
went out to the whole sales

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:50.370
team, the whole marketing
team, me, our CEO.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.582
And it showed if any
of these behaviors

00:28:52.582 --> 00:28:54.290
were not being followed
by the sales team

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.050
so we could act immediately.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.180
And it also showed where we
were on this marketing SLA

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.170
so the marketing
team was accountable.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.000
So we were able to
manage that demand gen

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.470
handoff on a daily
basis to make sure

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.639
that we had the right
demand feeding to the team

00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:10.180
and to make sure
that that demand was

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.780
being acted on appropriately
by the sales folks.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.450
And we were intervening
immediately if it wasn't.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.380
So that helped us
out quite a bit.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.400
Last section, then I'll
move to the questions.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.910
So managing
salespeople and holding

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.000
them accountable to
the same sales process.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.900
I wish we could rename
the sales management

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.132
title to the sales coaches.

00:29:37.132 --> 00:29:39.090
Because I think that's
the most important thing

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.150
that sales managers
can do is coach

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.260
and develop their salespeople.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.020
And the best and
simplest example

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.170
I can give in what I see
as effective coaching

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.300
comes from my
pursuit of the game

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.160
of golf, which has not been a
very successful pursuit today.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.090
But I've taken many lessons.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.880
And one golf pro said,
Mark, take a swing.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.290
And I did.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.000
And he said, OK, turn your
grip over a little bit.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.250
Lean back in your stance.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.549
Put more weight on your
right foot not your left.

00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:09.590
Think 1 o'clock not 2
o'clock on your back swing.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.120
And turn your wrist over more
when you contact the ball.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.020
And I was like, you
gotta be kidding me.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.480
The next golf pro was like,
all right, Mark, take a swing.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.240
And I did.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.590
And he said, all right, turn
your grip over a little bit.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.410
Now take a hundred swings.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.592
I did that for 20 minutes.

00:30:24.592 --> 00:30:25.800
And he said, how's that feel?

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.966
I said, yeah, I can feel it.

00:30:26.966 --> 00:30:27.930
That feels good.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.340
So now start leaning back
in your stance a little bit.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.735
Take another hundred swings.

00:30:31.735 --> 00:30:33.190
How's that feel?

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.640
So a really simple example.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.620
But I have promoted 17
sales managers at HubSpot.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.030
Every single one falls into
the trap of the first golf pro.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.140
Where they get a
new salesperson,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.150
and they see the
90 things that are

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.110
broken with them of
where they are today

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.470
and where they want them
to be, and they throw up

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.750
on them for an
hour with feedback.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.750
And you can just see
the rep's head spinning,

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.660
and they don't know
where to start.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.410
And the best sales
managers and coaches

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:04.070
can actually see the 90 things
but focus on the one or two

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.010
that are going to make
the biggest impact today.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.910
And they decipher and
diagnose that through metrics.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.310
And I call that
metric-driven sales coaching.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.140
And let me show you an
example of how that works.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.840
So here's a really
simple sales funnel.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.380
In the very
upper-left, you've got

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.210
how many leads each rep worked.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.867
How many they generated.

00:31:26.867 --> 00:31:27.950
Then how many they worked.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.199
How many demos they delivered.

00:31:29.199 --> 00:31:30.734
And how much
revenue they closed.

00:31:30.734 --> 00:31:32.650
The different colors are
different salespeople

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:33.664
in a given month.

00:31:33.664 --> 00:31:35.080
And on the right-hand
side, you've

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.120
got the conversion
rates between each.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.270
So just to throw out
some examples here.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:47.230
Let's look at the
top person in purple.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.200
So if you were
their sales manager,

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.420
be a brave soul
here and tell me,

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.024
what would your coaching
diagnosis be here?

00:31:55.024 --> 00:31:56.440
What do you see
in their activity,

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.503
and where are they broken
in the sales process?

00:32:00.503 --> 00:32:02.390
AUDIENCE: They're not
bringing in revenue.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.370
MARK ROBERGE: Yeah, low revenue.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:04.102
AUDIENCE: Demos.

00:32:04.102 --> 00:32:06.213
Lower demos than when you
look at who's coming in

00:32:06.213 --> 00:32:07.195
with the most revenue.

00:32:07.195 --> 00:32:10.141
So potentially, if they focused
more of their time doing demos,

00:32:10.141 --> 00:32:13.524
little less of their
time doing leads work,

00:32:13.524 --> 00:32:15.565
and really finding the
ones that are working well

00:32:15.565 --> 00:32:18.526
for them, transitioning
those to demos quicker.

00:32:18.526 --> 00:32:19.900
Then they might
get more revenue.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:20.733
MARK ROBERGE: Right.

00:32:20.733 --> 00:32:23.850
So she said, maybe a little
less focus working leads,

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:24.610
little more demos.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.840
And that could get
to higher revenue.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.270
I think that's a good diagnosis.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.750
And what's interesting, whenever
I go to a non metrics-driven

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.840
manager, whenever they have
an underperforming rep,

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.240
they usually say, it's
an activity problem.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.855
They just need to
do more activity.

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:40.410
And in this case, that's
far from the truth.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.050
This person in purple at the
top is doing the most activity.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.460
They're sourcing the most leads.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.100
They're doing the second
most calls on the team.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.750
But they're really bad at
getting them to the demo stage.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:52.979
And they're really bad at
converting them to revenue.

00:32:52.979 --> 00:32:55.020
And so we've got two
problems we have to work on.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.600
We have to work on getting
prospecting demands to the demo

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.100
stage.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.440
And we have to work on
closing demos to customers.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.950
And I personally like to
start as high in the funnel

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:04.654
as I see a problem.

00:33:04.654 --> 00:33:06.070
I can work on the
demo, but I just

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:09.180
don't feel like we have enough
at bat, as you pointed out.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.301
So I need to look at the
leads that are working

00:33:12.301 --> 00:33:14.300
and their effectiveness
at getting to the demos.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.660
And my first question always is,
can I learn more from the data

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.610
by double-clicking?

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.400
And in this case, I can
in this simple example.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.400
So it's either that they
are working lots of leads

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.050
but not getting them on
the phone, in which case, I

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:31.310
will see a lower connect rate
in the upper right-hand corner.

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.600
Or it's that they're
getting them on the phone,

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.895
but they are terrible
at breaking the ice

00:33:35.895 --> 00:33:37.770
and getting them to move
forward in the sales

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.445
process, in which
case, I would show

00:33:39.445 --> 00:33:41.640
a deficiency in the
bottom right chart.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.190
And this is an
important analysis

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:46.440
because my coaching's going
to be very, very different

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.990
depending on my finding.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.720
If I find that their
connect rate's low,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.530
I have to look at the frequency
of their voicemails and emails,

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.551
and the effectiveness
of that, et cetera.

00:33:54.551 --> 00:33:56.050
If they're getting
them on the phone

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.050
but just can't move them to
the next stage of the process,

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.214
that's not the problem.

00:33:59.214 --> 00:34:00.880
I have to listen to
their connect calls,

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.110
and see how they're building
trust, and breaking the ice,

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.360
and aligning their particular
goals with moving forward

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.110
in the sales process.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.321
So this is an example of
metrics-driven sales coaching.

00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:14.070
Very, very important
for us in our growth.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.250
And the more companies can
lean into this, I think,

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.350
it's effective in
developing that sale staff.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.059
So yeah, the book
is there if you guys

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:23.100
have grabbed your copies.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.639
One note I want to make
there, it did hit number

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:27.600
one in Amazon for
the sales category,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.830
which we're psyched about.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.670
But all the proceeds
go to build.org.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.380
Is anyone involved
in Build here?

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:39.530
I just actually did their
business plan contest

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.719
this Saturday.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:42.730
And what Build does
is, obviously, there's

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.920
some tough neighborhoods
here in Boston.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.190
Some kids were not born
into the opportunities

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.250
that we probably all were.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.500
And what Build does is
exposes these kids in freshman

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.930
in high school to
entrepreneurship,

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.230
and mentors them on how to
start their own company,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.740
and does it for the four
years of high school.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.740
And the kids from these
neighborhoods, they

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:11.390
probably have a 50% graduation
rate, maybe a 30% matriculation

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.505
rate into college.

00:35:12.505 --> 00:35:14.630
And the kids that go through
this program, I think,

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:19.310
have a 99% graduation
rate from high school,

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.420
and an 80% matriculation
rate in college.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.720
So I'm a passionate
entrepreneur.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.834
And to take entrepreneurship
and add value

00:35:25.834 --> 00:35:27.750
to these types of
environments is really cool.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.980
So an organization to check out.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.230
They've got an event coming
up later this month called

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.900
Tug, which is a
competition amongst nerds,

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.775
like volleyball, and
Nerf gun shooting,

00:35:37.775 --> 00:35:40.180
and that kind of stuff, if
you want to check that out.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.410
You guys are probably
already involved.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:43.840
All right, that's my show.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.490
So questions.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.170
AUDIENCE: Super
interesting and all,

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.040
the data-driven approaches.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.320
One thing that a lot of us
in the room do as salespeople

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.010
here is large customer sales.

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:03.790
Have you done any
research, any science

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.190
behind in-person
meetings versus phone,

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.290
virtual meetings,
and any correlation

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.590
between upselling and success
in terms of how often to be

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.040
in front of the customer?

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.040
MARK ROBERGE: I haven't.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.040
We didn't get as much into that.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.610
I know you guys, obviously,
that's a bigger driver for you.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.130
We did move into the
corporate/enterprise space

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.580
in the last couple of years.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.310
The trend I'm seeing
there, obviously,

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.590
is a lot more satellite offices
as opposed to putting people

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:36.460
in the territory themselves.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.360
But I haven't seen that.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.620
Obviously, there's
a lot more openness

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.540
from the buyer around
buying virtually these days

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.080
than say, 10 years ago.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.800
And I think a lot of companies
that are starting out

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.700
building sales teams
are, especially

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.131
when they hire a
seasoned head of sales,

00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:57.880
they probably don't
take advantage of that

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.180
as much as they could.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.610
But I'm sorry, I
can't give you--

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.923
I don't have any data-driven
approaches there.

00:37:02.923 --> 00:37:03.670
Sorry.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.417
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:04.417 --> 00:37:05.250
AUDIENCE: Hey, Mark.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.100
Thanks for being here.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:06.891
My name is Heather.

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:08.270
I'm a sales manager here.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:11.967
What is it like to have
Google Ventures invest in you?

00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:13.050
What was the process like?

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.550
MARK ROBERGE: Total
micromanagement.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.280
Worst VC to work with.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.270
No.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.430
It's awesome.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:21.825
Rich obviously has an amazing--
the great thing about Rich

00:37:21.825 --> 00:37:23.450
and, I think, the
Google Ventures folks

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:28.134
is they come with
operational experience.

00:37:28.134 --> 00:37:29.550
They've been
entrepreneurs before.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.050
They've had huge successes.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.220
And those are the
types of investors

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.230
I personally like to work with.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.890
There are some who are just
more from the finance side.

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:40.382
And they're putting
money to work.

00:37:40.382 --> 00:37:42.090
And they might look
at it in front of LPs

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:43.950
and that kind of stuff.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:47.740
But I like it when they
have those backgrounds.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.220
And Rich and Google Ventures
certainly falls into that.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:55.850
The other great thing is just
you guys are such a horsepower.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:38:01.860
And to be able to have
tapped into various resources

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.250
here through that
relationship has been great.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.410
I'll be quite frank, it's
more challenging to do that.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.510
I have a lot of friends at
Google and know Rich well.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:15.680
And often times, they
know just as much

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.990
as you do who you should be
talking to at the company.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:19.640
It's such a monstrosity.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.090
So it's becoming
more challenging

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:22.590
over the years for
the company to be

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.550
able to help the companies
from that standpoint.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.100
But certainly,
our ability to get

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.140
in front of the
right people, it's

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.880
easier when it comes from
a fellow Google employee

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.929
than it does cold for me.

00:38:36.929 --> 00:38:38.470
AUDIENCE: And just
a quick follow-up,

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.912
what kinds of resources
were you able to tap into?

00:38:40.912 --> 00:38:41.620
I'm just curious.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.690
MARK ROBERGE: In the
beginning, really around how

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.140
to build a great
engineering team, just

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.822
some of the best
practices on recruiting

00:38:47.822 --> 00:38:48.780
and that kind of stuff.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.155
That was really
important for us.

00:38:50.155 --> 00:38:52.180
We struggled with that
in the first few phases

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.980
of the business.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.510
Another example
recently was we're

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.860
making a big bet in the
sales software arena

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.890
and trying to go
heavy into freemium.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.544
We've started with
a Chrome extension

00:39:02.544 --> 00:39:04.710
and just getting featured
in the Chrome store, which

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.720
was huge for us in the
first phase of our growth.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.796
So there's a dozen
other examples,

00:39:09.796 --> 00:39:11.170
but those are the
types of things

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.790
that have been really helpful.

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.037
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:14.037 --> 00:39:14.870
AUDIENCE: Hey, Mark.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.510
To do a lot of the stuff
you mention in the book,

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:21.120
you have to have your
salespeople use CRM.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.770
And I know a lot of salespeople
don't like using CRM.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.170
So can you give
any strategies as

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.260
to how to-- and
realistic strategies--

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.050
as to how to get a sales team
to actually use it properly.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.390
MARK ROBERGE: Yeah, so
that's been the last two

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:39.720
years of my job, is taking us
into the sales software space.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.180
And this whole question
is the cornerstone

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:47.350
of our thesis on entry, which is
most sales software has really

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:51.730
been built for the sales leader
to do forecasts, and pipeline

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:54.080
reviews, and that kind of stuff.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.460
And the salesperson
has been left out

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.330
of the use case analysis.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.300
And as such, so
many sales leaders

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.530
are left in a
situation where they're

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:07.170
getting 30%, 50% adoption,
and the original utility

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:10.990
for the CRM purchase
is out the window.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.490
One thing that we did right
from the beginning was we

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.690
had a salesperson
first mentality

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.970
around the implementation
of our CRM.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.120
So there has to be a very
clear, what's in it for them.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.742
Like I knew that
I wanted to track

00:40:25.742 --> 00:40:27.200
the number of calls
that were made,

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.408
and when they were happening,
and that kind of stuff.

00:40:29.408 --> 00:40:33.030
But I also knew if I
told them to log that,

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.720
that wasn't going to happen.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.950
So by integrating
it, having the calls

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:43.440
being initiated from the
CRM, giving them the ability

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.590
to use Gmail to craft their
emails but automatically

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:51.420
logging those emails in the
CRM, to have the CRM go out

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:56.710
and find and append
to each account

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.210
data that can be found in social
media and online automatically.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.770
These are all examples of
things that the CRM should

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.580
work for the salesperson,
not the salesperson

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.820
work for the CRM.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.870
So if you're an
executive looking

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:15.090
to increase your
usage of CRM, you

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.820
have to figure out this really
strong what's in it for the rep

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.954
to drive that data collection.

00:41:20.954 --> 00:41:21.822
Good.

00:41:21.822 --> 00:41:22.690
AUDIENCE: Hey, Mark.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:23.189
Danielle.

00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:25.080
I work in the Tech
B2B vertical, so a lot

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.530
of what you're talking about
with marketing SLA and sales

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.760
SLA really hits home as
a lot of our clients,

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.860
like email marketing, are
very lead gen focused.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.870
Assuming that most
of our clients

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:37.230
aren't having these
conversations between sales

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.830
leaders and marketing
leaders in terms

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.200
of finding that right balance,
any recommendations for us

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.555
as consultative
and mostly having

00:41:44.555 --> 00:41:46.180
the relationships on
the marketing side

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.180
to go in and broker some
of those conversations?

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.329
And what are the points
that would really

00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:52.620
hit home into getting them
to think more in that model?

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.494
Because I think it would
really resonate well

00:41:54.494 --> 00:41:55.960
with some of our clients.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.835
MARK ROBERGE: Yeah, a
couple things in there.

00:41:57.835 --> 00:42:02.250
One is to try to attach the
effort to a higher level

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.940
business objective.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:08.150
Oftentimes, going to the CEO
or COO that oversees them

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.650
can be really effective
because they're there

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:14.140
to manage that misalignment.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.850
And if you can get
into their heads

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.149
as to what's on the
agenda for this quarter

00:42:18.149 --> 00:42:20.190
strategically, what's on
the agenda for this year

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.470
strategically, and how you
can get sales and marketing

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.550
alignment to solve
that, then that

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.430
will be more likely
to be pushed through.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.980
And the other thing is we
have the same problem where

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.180
we start with marketing,
we try to get to sales.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.760
In a B2B environment,
generically speaking,

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.340
the sales leader
politically tends

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.920
to carry more weight than
the marketing leader.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.460
So you have a little bit
of a disadvantage there.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.600
And the sales leader's going
to be less open to ideas

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.050
that originate from marketing.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:56.760
So what's important for us is
to restart that conversation

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.080
with the sales leader,
not necessarily build

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.830
on the foundation that
the marketer has given us,

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.230
but just do it
from-- the marketer

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.650
cares about lead gen, and
visitors, and awareness,

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:08.850
and conversion.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.890
The salesperson
cares about forecast,

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:15.160
and hiring, and demand
gen for their team,

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.660
and the quality of
leads, et cetera.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.180
So just re-having a conversation
with the VP of sales,

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.260
almost restarting
the sales process

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.610
to understand their desires.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.130
And then saying,
well, so it sounds

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:29.650
like if I could double lead flow
and the quality in XYZ areas,

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.830
this would be a very compelling
situation for you next quarter,

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:33.590
correct?

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.850
Would you like my
help in driving that?

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:38.430
So reframing it around
their terminology

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:39.389
has worked well for us.

00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:41.596
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
interesting because even a lot

00:43:41.596 --> 00:43:44.010
of the marketing, day-to-day
people that we deal with,

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.740
even when you ask
them what their goals,

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.860
and what their incentives,
and where their bonused on,

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.550
it's number of leads,
not quality of leads.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.450
And it's not driving through
to that final revenue.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:52.320
MARK ROBERGE: Yeah,
and the mistake

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.070
that so many of our
salespeople make

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.111
is they feel like
they've built trust

00:43:56.111 --> 00:43:58.610
and have this amazing champion
internally with the marketer,

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.080
and leave it to them to
go talk to the VP of sales

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.840
or go talk to the CEO.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.270
And I don't mean to offend
people in marketing,

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.140
but they're in
marketing for a reason.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.051
They're not used to selling.

00:44:11.051 --> 00:44:13.300
And that's really what it
takes when you go to the CEO

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.480
or you go to the VP
of sales, and you're

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.480
trying to make a change.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.820
It's a sales job.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.780
And so our best
bet as a sales team

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.405
is to get that direct interface.

00:44:21.405 --> 00:44:24.030
And if the marketer doesn't have
enough trust to give it to us,

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:25.480
then we are a sales coach now.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.479
And we're like, how are you
going to approach the CEO?

00:44:28.479 --> 00:44:30.270
And do you want me to
build a deck for you?

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.561
And can I coach you through it?

00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:33.882
So these are the tactics
that tend to work.

00:44:33.882 --> 00:44:35.268
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:35.268 --> 00:44:36.130
AUDIENCE: Hey, Mark.

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:37.770
Thanks for coming.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.724
My question was more on context.

00:44:39.724 --> 00:44:42.390
And so you look at these charts,
and they're beautifully simple.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:44.810
And I'm sure there's an enormous
amount of work and insight

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:45.726
that goes around them.

00:44:45.726 --> 00:44:49.310
But what was missing for me,
or at least the question I had,

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:50.740
was timeline, right?

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:54.090
You were the fourth employee
at this company, which--

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:57.090
a startup has a very
different set of pressures

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.672
than Google because
you're trying

00:44:58.672 --> 00:45:00.130
to get to the next
round of funding

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:02.800
and demonstrate
your business model.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.050
But then you have this
enormously clear set

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:07.760
of data which is related to CRM.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.180
So when you were building
the infrastructure,

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.380
what was the timeline of it?

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.700
This had to have
been a while, right?

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.160
So you had to deal with years
of frustration, probably,

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.570
not being able to answer
the questions you wanted.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.990
And maybe now you're there,
but just that journey.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.450
MARK ROBERGE: Yeah,
great question.

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:25.300
And to be honest, a lot of
the context from the book

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:30.200
skews toward the early
years, surprisingly.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.240
So you probably need to
start this stuff earlier

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.620
than you'd expect.

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.720
And for example, in the
hiring, literally, I

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.930
went through that exercise
before my first interview

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:42.550
with candidates.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:45.280
And yes, you're not going to
have a regression analysis

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:50.125
on your correlated criteria
after your first three hires

00:45:50.125 --> 00:45:52.180
and after your first
six months in business.

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.300
But the important
thing is you're

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.571
thinking in the right way.

00:45:56.571 --> 00:45:58.070
You're going through
that discipline

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:00.470
and you're setting yourself
up for that analysis

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.050
18 months down the road.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.660
And even having made four hires,
say, in the first quarter,

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.970
and watching them perform
for three or four months,

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.430
you have something to work with.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:14.470
You can go back and look at
that interview score sheet,

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:18.450
and reflect qualitatively
and make some adjustments.

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:19.640
So that was useful.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.180
On the demand gen
side with the SLA,

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.200
it doesn't take a whole lot
to generate a few hundred

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.800
leads a month.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.590
It doesn't take a lot for
a salesperson to make,

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:36.360
or a sales team to make
1,000 calls in a month.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.360
So you start
sitting on some data

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.890
relatively quickly even in the
early infancies of a company

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:42.660
development.

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.970
So good question on timeline.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:47.760
But a lot of these
things, I think,

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.670
need to be worked
on from day one.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:51.320
And I think, in
this day and age,

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.050
it's surprising how quickly
data-driven insights actually

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:56.180
surface.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.847
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:57.847 --> 00:46:58.680
AUDIENCE: Hey, Mark.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.180
Thanks.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:02.550
This has been very,
very informative.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.990
Question for you on
the approach that you

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.490
have with holding
marketing against revenue

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:10.012
targets from a demand
gen standpoint.

00:47:10.012 --> 00:47:10.970
I think it's brilliant.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.140
And most of my clients are,
they sell marketing SaaS,

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.410
and none of them do this.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:17.320
So they're behind
the 8 ball there.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:22.390
But where I struggle with it
is in the world of selling B2B

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.640
SaaS, a lot happens before
you pick up the phone and call

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.740
someone or are ready to talk to
someone, let alone see a demo.

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.320
So what happens when your
marketing-- so Mike's team--

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:39.220
sends a $400 white
paper download

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.660
lead over to a salesperson?

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.970
Is that even ready?

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:44.570
Or do you further bake
it before it gets there?

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.930
MARK ROBERGE: Yeah, in
part three or something,

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:51.220
there's a chapter on this, on
the right times to hand off.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.950
And I don't think I have
that in the appendix here.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:57.880
But you'd have to imagine
a matrix of the y-axis

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.780
being the different types of
companies, the demographics

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:02.739
that really are static.

00:48:02.739 --> 00:48:03.905
They're not going to change.

00:48:03.905 --> 00:48:05.160
It could be company size.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.120
It could be the industry
that they're in.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.360
And then the x-axis is the
engagement, their journey

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.030
down the buying journey.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.590
And so let's say it's enterprise
mid-market and small business.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:20.590
And let's say it's low
engagement and then really high

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:21.990
engagement.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:26.840
With the enterprise, those
are high-value leads.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.320
The minute they
touch our website,

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.010
without even giving
us a name, we

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.510
should have someone calling
them because we're probably cold

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.360
calling to that group anyway.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.680
The mid-market, that might be
more like when they give us

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.369
an email and phone number,
we should start calling them.

00:48:40.369 --> 00:48:41.910
The small business
community, we want

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:44.720
to drive them all the way
through inbound marketing

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.800
education, product
education, probably

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.180
get them all the way to
this group product demo.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.890
And whoever raises
their hand after that

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:53.820
will get a phone call.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.050
And that's very much
how we drive it.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:49:01.030
So you're being very
aware of the opportunity

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:04.180
size and the engagement cycle,
and differing that question

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:04.840
based on those.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.280
And then you could have many,
many analyses within there.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.110
For example, in the
enterprise segment,

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.570
you can do another buyer
persona, engagement level

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:16.220
based on the role.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:18.720
So if it's the VP of
marketing, well, heck, we've

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.970
got to get on them right away.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:21.764
If it's an IT
manager or an intern,

00:49:21.764 --> 00:49:23.680
maybe we want to nurture
them, but we probably

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.640
want to nurture them
with different content.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.320
So that's the framework you
want to set up, establish

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.284
some theories.

00:49:29.284 --> 00:49:30.700
And then depending
on that theory,

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.570
you can start analyzing
the conversion rates.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.547
And if there's a really
low conversion rate,

00:49:35.547 --> 00:49:37.380
if you're passing leads
to sales and they're

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:42.070
closing 0.1% of them, well,
you drew your line too early.

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:44.300
And you've got to take
advantage of automation

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.840
to push that line to the right.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.620
Versus if they're
closing 50% of them,

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:49.930
you've probably
sold yourself short.

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.682
And you should push
that line to the left

00:49:51.682 --> 00:49:53.640
because you're leaving
some money on the table.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.140
So that's the framework
that we went at it.

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:56.640
Cool?

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.640
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.799
Got some reading to do.

00:49:59.799 --> 00:50:00.590
AUDIENCE: Hi, Mark.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:01.340
Jillian Todd.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:04.070
I'm one of our sales
account executives here.

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:05.720
So I just went on
my mobile phone

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.030
to learn a little bit
more about HubSpot.

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:11.590
And I noticed that you
guys are running SEO.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:13.840
And actually, one of your
competitor's ad ahead of you

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.965
guys is pretty interesting.

00:50:14.965 --> 00:50:16.710
It says, "wait,
check us out first."

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:18.440
I thought that was
an interesting.

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.530
MARK ROBERGE: Who is it?

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:20.700
AUDIENCE: Multi-Touch Leads.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:21.574
MARK ROBERGE: Hm, OK.

00:50:21.574 --> 00:50:22.880
Interesting.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.909
AUDIENCE: So two
questions for you.

00:50:24.909 --> 00:50:25.950
So two questions for you.

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:29.490
So first of all, it sounds
like you guys are obviously

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:31.550
a very lead-driven
company, which

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.260
is very much the
same business model

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.384
as a number of our clients.

00:50:34.384 --> 00:50:36.180
So I would love to
better understand

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.902
how you think about Google and
how we're driving leads for you

00:50:39.902 --> 00:50:41.680
and how you assess value.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.320
Then the second
question is something

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.278
that we're challenged
with a lot of our clients

00:50:45.278 --> 00:50:47.430
is because they are
so performance-driven

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:50.610
and typically think of
Google as being just

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:52.510
a low-funnel acquisition tool.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:55.070
We're trying to help them
think about our inventory a bit

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.278
differently, and to think
about Search as a branding,

00:50:57.278 --> 00:50:59.826
and an upper-funnel and
mid-funnel play as well.

00:50:59.826 --> 00:51:02.200
So I would love to hear from
you if you guys have thought

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.390
about us in that same fashion.

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:07.700
And if you haven't, what
would resonate with you?

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.199
MARK ROBERGE: So
the second question

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:14.360
is do we get away from the
pure click, lead, sale,

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.740
and think more about
brand awareness?

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.092
AUDIENCE: Particularly
when using Search.

00:51:19.092 --> 00:51:21.050
So we're thinking about
SEM, upper, mid-funnel.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:22.200
MARK ROBERGE: Paid search.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:25.450
MARK ROBERGE: Yeah,
so the first part

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:29.220
is we've run a lot of
experimentation, paid with you

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:36.430
guys, with Facebook, et cetera,
without a ton of success

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.720
relative to our other campaigns.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.990
And part of me feels it's just
kind of like-- it would almost

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:46.590
contradict with our mission.

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:50.760
So I think there's a little bit
of a prejudice of the marketers

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.430
that join us.

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:54.569
And we're almost rooting
against the campaign in a way.

00:51:54.569 --> 00:51:56.860
And I think part of it's
actually like the team is just

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.840
so good at content,
and with the buyers

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.800
that we're trying to
reach being marketers,

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.260
it's such an effective
channel for us.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:10.140
So we've fairly invested
a decent sum of money

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:14.820
and actually hired SEM experts
to come in and do this stuff.

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.010
And it's just not an
enormous driver for us

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.240
because of that unique context.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.780
Now I will tell you
that's a little bit

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:25.140
different on the sales software
with a different persona.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:29.240
And we lean into
that a bit more,

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:34.640
both in the SEM as well
as the social media ads.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.070
For us there in
the freemium model,

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:42.340
we find that the
more sophisticated

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.640
the ad platform is, obviously,
in terms of getting us down

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.640
to the specific
filters we need, that

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.180
makes the world of difference
of the volume that we're doing.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:55.050
For example, knowing what web
browser they're coming from.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:59.220
When these ad
platforms can filter

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.660
on that, which some can
and some can't, that

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:06.160
will drive a huge ROI for us.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:14.282
In terms of the
branding piece, I

00:53:14.282 --> 00:53:16.740
could probably answer it for
us and then for our customers.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:18.605
Because for us, we're
just such on one end

00:53:18.605 --> 00:53:23.050
of the spectrum of just drinking
the Kool-Aid on inbound.

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:27.590
Not just even questioning SEM
driving our brand, but even

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:31.820
just PR, like how even bought
in we are to that as opposed

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:36.050
to just going out there and
building our own TV station,

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:38.280
building our own radio
platform, building

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:46.220
our own major conference and
trade magazine, et cetera.

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.510
That's just our notion.

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:53.140
For our clients, it's tough.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.780
I just think-- and
again, you're dealing

00:53:55.780 --> 00:54:01.260
with me being a quant guy
over from a quant company,

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.680
I don't like things that
I can't clearly measure.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.990
And I don't know enough
about the branding stuff.

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:08.742
There's probably
ways to measure reach

00:54:08.742 --> 00:54:12.070
and all that kind of
stuff and awareness.

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:13.860
But I'm sorry.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:17.240
I don't have a more
agreeable answer with you.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.910
But that's my honest truth.

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:21.510
I'm just not
psyched about things

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:24.290
that I can't clearly measure
to lead flow and revenue.

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:27.060
AUDIENCE: No, that
sounds familiar.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.090
Thank you.

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:29.890
MARK ROBERGE: Maybe
one more question?

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:31.219
Are we?

00:54:31.219 --> 00:54:32.260
AUDIENCE: It'll be quick.

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.470
MARK ROBERGE: Quick question,
sorry, and then we'll be done.

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:36.160
AUDIENCE: So when you're talking
about-- my name is Daniella.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.360
I'm an account manager
on the health care team.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:41.990
When you were talking
about key attributes that

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.030
went toward success,
you mentioned curiosity.

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:46.720
So I'm curious, how do
you measure curiosity?

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.220
MARK ROBERGE: Yeah, the whole
interview process is outlined,

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.820
I think, in Chapter 3.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.140
But it starts with the opening.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.660
When I walk in, greet
you in the lobby,

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:59.010
and if you're very awkward and
I have to ask questions of you.

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.140
Or if you've done
your research and have

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.680
a natural conversation.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.660
I like to start there.

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.300
Then I do a roleplay at some
point during the interview.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.990
And I just see, do
you start by show up

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:10.890
and throw up, as we
call it in the industry

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:13.360
and give me a five-minute
elevator pitch on HubSpot?

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.280
Or do you actually dive into
why I downloaded the white paper

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.887
and ask good follow
on questions?

00:55:17.887 --> 00:55:19.470
That's really how I
get my incentives.

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:22.360
And that's my
encouragement, often,

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.050
to people who are getting into
sales as a sort of fun exercise

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:28.280
on the side when you're
out on a Friday night

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:32.260
at a wedding reception
or a networking event.

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:36.470
Meet people and see how long
you can go asking them questions

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:39.680
without them feeling
interrogated or annoyed.

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.970
And it's something that
I just do naturally.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:44.740
I enjoy it because
hey, I know about me.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.050
I don't know about you.

00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:48.380
And I'll literally have
20-minute conversations

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.965
with people who, whenever they
ask me a question, I deflect it

00:55:50.965 --> 00:55:52.200
and immediate go back
to questioning them.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.320
And they know nothing
about me except my name.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.944
And they go off and
talk to their wife,

00:55:55.944 --> 00:55:58.660
and be like, that guy Mark,
he's a really great guy.

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.930
And all I did was ask
them a bunch of questions,

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:03.570
but those questions made
them think differently

00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.180
about the stuff
they were thinking.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.888
Because they were
asked so well, and they

00:56:06.888 --> 00:56:08.490
were truly genuine and curious.

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.395
Because I'm genuinely curious
about what you're doing.

00:56:11.395 --> 00:56:14.030
So that's how I
measure curiosity.

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:15.260
Thanks for the time, guys.

00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:17.410
Appreciate being here.
