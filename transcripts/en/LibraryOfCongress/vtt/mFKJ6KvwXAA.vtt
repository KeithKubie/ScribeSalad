&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.780
&gt;&gt; Hayden: We still have a lot
to learn and a lot to improve.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.580
So I'm going to say this
is a call to action,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.780
and if you have suggestions

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.020
on how we can improve the Library's
visitor experience for everyone,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:31.110
please contact Travis
[laughter] and all of us.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.980
He is our official person that
makes sure that accessibility stays

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.390 position:56%
in the forefront of all of our
planning and all of our experiences.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.960
Thank you, Travis.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.070
Now I want to introduce our
amazing lineup of speakers we have

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.850
with us today, and these are
people who are making it happen.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.560
Congressman Representative
Kevin Yoder

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.000
and Congressman Mark
Takano are the co-chairs

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.870
of the Congressional Deaf Caucus,
and we appreciate their time

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.780
and are honored to have them
here with us this afternoon,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.090
and then the esteemed President
of Gallaudet University,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.520
Miss Bobbie Cordano, who will
present to us information

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.610
about the state of deaf education
and the impact that EDA has had

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.650
on her life, and then she will
be followed by TEDx presenter,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.650
August Shitama, on
his passion for books

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.010
and what they have
meant for his life.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.790
I know you will enjoy the
presentations, and I just want

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.430
to thank you for being part
of this event and helping all

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.590
of us make sure that we
provide access for everyone.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.030
So remember, we can clap like this.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.330
[Laughter] Travis.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.120
&gt;&gt; Painter: Well, good afternoon.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.980
It's my honor to join this
esteemed panel and others

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.090
to help celebrate the 27th
anniversary of the passage

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.010
of the American with
Disabilities Act,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.470
and I appreciate Dr. Hayden's
opening remarks and her allowing us

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.800
to have this event in this
beautiful, historic facility

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.280
that she maintains for
Americans to continue to enjoy

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.470
and to celebrate many
historic events.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.540
Today is one of those chapters in
the great legacy of our country.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.200
I want to thank all of you
for your commitment to working

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.330
for disabled Americans, especially
those in the deaf community,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.800
in Congress, in Gallaudet
and the rest

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.400 position:56%
of academia, and the private sector.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.990
I'm proud to join all of you
in celebrating the Americans

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.420
with Disabilities Act today.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.680
As we know, our nation was founded
on the principle that all people,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.750
men, women, are created equal.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.820
The ADA is a landmark piece
of legislation that embodied

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.140 position:56%
that principle with its impact
making ripple effects throughout our

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.820
nation still today benefiting
countless disabled Americans.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.900
It has helped open up doors,
both literally and figuratively,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.420 position:56%
to employment and services for many
people with disabilities and ensured

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.360
that those with disabilities
are afforded equal access

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.620
to government services
and public accommodations.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.920
It's hard to think of our
country without the ADA.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.210
It's hard to think of
America before that period

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.650
and why that was ever the case.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.830
The ADA helped implement,
for example,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.890
in the deaf community
telecommunications relay services,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.790
making sure the deaf,
hard of hearing,

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.330
can have full access
to telephone networks.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.850
These reforms were important steps
towards making sure that no one

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.200
in America gets left behind and
everyone has equal opportunities.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.930
Now, I'm a Kansan, and Kansas has
a very special role in history

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.690
when it comes to the ADA.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.710
That connection continues
today with the legacy left

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.810
by a great statesman
known as Senator Bob Dole,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.190
who just recently had his
94th birthday, by the way.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.800
He was and still is one
of biggest advocates

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.160
for the disability community,
inspiring myself and others

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.300
to continue to carry the
baton and his legacy forward.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.980
He had such a special personal
story because as someone

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.620
with a disability stemming
from injuries sustained

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.480
in combat during World War II, he
was able to use his perspective

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.490
to help fight for others,
to help fight for all of us.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.450
He was instrumental in the passage
of the ADA, and he viewed it as one

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.430
of his proudest moments, and long
after Senator Dole and others,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.520
we've all passed in politics
his legacy, the ADA will pass

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.860
on from generation to generation.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.340
He had a lot of proud moments.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.980
He did a lot of things,
but saying it was one

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.590
of his proudest says a lot
considering his career.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.760
So his legacy is an inspiration to
me and many of our fellow Kansans.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.040
In my service in Congress, I
represent the Kansas School

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.040
for the Deaf in Olathe, Kansas.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.340
I have had a great opportunity to
work with many of the students,

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.990
teachers, and community members
who make up my constituents

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.070
and who are a very important
part of our community,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.200
and so what Senator Dole laid
forward is what I'm working

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.170
to fight for-to fight
for disability rights,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.300
and I think the Senator would agree
there's still more to be done.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.590
The difficult reality is that
in spite of the progress made

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.250
through the ADA, around
seven in ten deaf people

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.180
in the U.S. are unemployed
or under employed.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.260
We have a lot of work to do.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.970
This means that there are
33 million deaf people

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.490
who can't make enough money
to support themselves.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.420
This is just one symptom that
shows that our work is not done

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.670 position:56%
and there are clearly still barriers
between deaf people and quality jobs

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.600
and full involvement in society.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.070 position:56%
We've attempted to partner with many
employers throughout the country

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.040
to help them build
opportunities for employment.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.060
Just a few months ago there was an
event we had at the Kansas School

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.030
for the Deaf with Uber, and they
were showing they have specific

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.400
programs set up to help the deaf
community become Uber drivers,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.700
for example.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.940
So technology is also helping
us solve this problem along

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.710
with government policy, but
in recognition of the need

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.770
to keep advocating for
the deaf community,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.550
that was what led Congressman
Takano, my good friend

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.450
from California, and I to help form

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.570
and build the Congressional
Deaf Caucus.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.790
We've been joined by 18
other members of Congress

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.580
who are all dedicated to advocating
on behalf of deaf Americans.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.470
The Congressional Deaf
Caucus recognized

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.030
that the ADA was not the finish
line in disability rights,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.120
but rather one step as part of
an effort that needs to continue.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.860 position:56%
Now I also have another role in that
when I was first came to Congress,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.890
I was honored to be appointed
by the Speaker of the House

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:06.300
to the Gallaudet Board of Trustees,
and I am a proud Kansas Jayhawk.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.600
Don't get me wrong.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.700
I'm not switching allegiances, but
I'm also a proud Gallaudet Bison,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.450
and we're very proud of the
university here in Washington, DC,

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.360 position:56%
and it's helped me create a
connection between the Kansas School

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.170
for the Deaf as folks
graduate high school

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.290
in helping them understand the
value of Gallaudet University,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.290
as well as my colleagues

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.150
who in Congress may not know what
Gallaudet University is doing

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.930
in its powerful legacy
here in Washington.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.560 position:56%
It's the only university in the
world specifically designed for deaf

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.800
and hard of hearing students,
and I am glad to be a part

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.980
of this unique and
vital institution.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.520
It has been a privilege to serve
the university and learn more

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.500
about the deaf community
and the issues it faces,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.950
and President Cordano is leading an
outstanding school, and I'm working

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.870
to make sure that Gallaudet
has the resources it needs-

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.630
[Applause] All right, there we go.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.610 position:56%
I'm working to make sure that
Gallaudet has the resources it needs

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:05.490 position:56%
to continue educating deaf students,
and we were just discussing

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.330
that most recently the
Appropriations Committee approved a

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.920
bill that included a
$6.7 million increase

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.740
for Gallaudet University
in the coming year.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.220
In these very divided times we live
in, it's hard to turn on the news

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.740
without wanting to throw
your TV out the window.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.760
People are angry at one another.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.130
Gallaudet University is a
unifier in this Congress,

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.560
and to see a bipartisan
effort to increase support

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.890
in a significant amount
to me tells us

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.390
that there's still
hope for civility.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.970
There's still hope
for bipartisanship,

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.460
and the issue of support at
Gallaudet University is one

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.400
of those great areas
we can come together,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.240
and we know that those dollars,
if we can eventually get it signed

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.180
into law, will be served
and utilized very well

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.610
to help more students
fulfill their dreams.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:55.490
So, in conclusion, as we mark the
27th anniversary of the Americans

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.640 position:56%
with Disabilities Act, I hope we can
both celebrate the accomplishments

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.880
that have been made as well as roll
up our sleeves to continue the work

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.390
that still needs to be done.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.670
I want to say thank you to
everyone here who has contributed

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.850
to the fight for the rights
of the disabled Americans

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.290
and for the deaf community
in particular, and I am proud

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.740
to join you in this
effort as we work

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.860
to preserve the legacies of ADA.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.660
Thank you very much.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:26.550
[ Applause ]

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.860
&gt;&gt; Painter: Thank you so
much, Congressman Yoder,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.860
for your contributions and for
coming today and updating us

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.720
on a lot of the legislation
that's pending

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.400
and what there is more to do.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.800
So thank you so much.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.690
I would like to welcome
the other co-chair

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.740
of the Congressional Deaf
Caucus, Representative Takano.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.490
[Applause]

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.650
&gt;&gt; Takano: Thank you.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.920
Thank you.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.250
Good afternoon and thank you.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.750
Thank you for being here and thank
you to the Library of Congress

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.800
for inviting me to
this wonderful event.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.610
Dr. Hayden, it's always wonderful
and a pleasure to see you.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.450
I am truly grateful for
the work that you do,

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.010
and I promise to return
all of the overdue books

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.270
that I still owe to the library.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.230 position:56%
[Laugher] This week we celebrate the
27th anniversary of the Americans

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.710
with Disability Act, which
is a perfect time to reflect

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.590
on the contributions made
by so many deaf and hard

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.500
of hearing Americans
throughout American history.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:34.400
From serving in the peace corps to
working in the federal government

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.840
to becoming teachers,
lawyers, and doctors,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.890
deaf Americans have contributed to
the cultural and economic strength

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.300
of this nation, and your
influence is only growing.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.850 position:56%
I personally look forward to the day

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.430
that we see the first deaf
person elected to Congress,

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.780
and maybe it will be someone
who is in this room today.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.040
[Applause] My Riverside
California district is home to one

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.640
of two California schools
for the deaf,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.850
and that means I have the
honor of representing a large

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.510
and important deaf and
hard of hearing population.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:21.490
When I came to Congress in
2013, I was shocked to see

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.920
that there was very
little representation

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.240
for the deaf community.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.170
I decided to do something about it,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.410
and I joined with Congressman
Kevin Yoder from Kansas,

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:38.890
who we just heard from, to launch
the Congressional Deaf Caucus.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.640
It is a bipartisan group of
25 members who are advocating

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.150
for the deaf community, and new
members are joining every year.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.570
The Caucus is dedicated to
bridging the communication divide

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.080
between members of Congress
and their deaf and hard

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:02.010
of hearing constituents, and we
focus on empowering deaf and hard

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:06.900
of hearing individuals to engage
with their members of Congress

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.800
because our country
is built on the idea

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.460
that every person deserves
fair representation.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.160
So my office has taken the lead in
expanding internship opportunities

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.760
for deaf and hard of hearing
individuals on Capitol Hill.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.200
To date my office has
hosted seven deaf interns

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.810
from Gallaudet University
[applause]-thank

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.370
you-including Catherine.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.990
Catherine, would you
raise your hand?

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.050
And she's here with me today,
and I can say with sincerity,

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:46.240
and Catherine has just
taught me to sign this,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.290
they have been amazing
interns, amazing interns.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:59.280
[Applause] I still remember
Gallaudet, but I don't remember how

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.720
to do the university part.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.020
It's like-this two here.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.270
So it's half circle like this.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.650
Gallaudet, half circle like that.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.600
There you go.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.430
Go Buffalo, or is it bison?

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:18.260
Go Bison. [Laughter] How
do you do bison, Catherine?

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:23.200
This, like this.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.780
That's bison.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.610
All right, thank you.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.750
Building a strong coalition
of advocates for deaf and hard

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.880
of hearing individuals is
critical to making progress

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.240
on some key issues including
your right to serve your country.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.890 position:56%
A few years ago I introduced a Keith
Nolan Air Force Demonstration Act,

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.360
which would create a demonstration
program in the Air Force for 15

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.460
to 20 deaf and hard of
hearing individuals.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.460
It was named after a young
man who has been fighting

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.700
for the deaf community's
ability to serve.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.450
Keith Nolan's life goal is
to be a military officer.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.420
He enrolled in and completed the
first two levels of Army ROTC

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:14.570
at the UCLA Cal State Northridge
program, but he was not allowed

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.460
to continue due to the
Department of Defense rules

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.400
that exclude individuals who
are deaf or hard of hearing.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.840
He excelled in the ROTC program.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.700
Keith is entirely capable
of serving.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.110 position:56%
The more people we have in
Congress who will stand up for Keith

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.650
and for others like
him who want to serve,

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:40.360 position:56%
the better chance we will have of
expanding opportunities for the deaf

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.980
and hard of hearing community.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.440
Now as I conclude my remarks
today I want to recognize some

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.490
of the transformative
work being done here

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.270
in Washington, DC but
not in Congress.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.370
Now Gallaudet University is just
two miles from Capitol Hill,

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.420
and it was founded
during the Civil War

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.060
through a Congressional charter
signed by President Lincoln

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.550
to provide higher education
to deaf people.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.850
It is the only liberal arts
university in the world,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.760
in the world, that caters to deaf,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.920
hard of hearing, and
deaf/blind students.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.960
Not only does Gallaudet
provide a top notch education

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.210
for its students, it also
conducts ground breaking research

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.670
on language acquisition
and bilingual education.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:37.450 position:56%
As an aside, I learned on a visit
to the Riverside School for the Deaf

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:43.670
that an 18-month-old child has
a larger active vocabulary,

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:48.330
a greater ability to
communicate than a hearing child.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.770
There is so much the general
public does not know or understand

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.890
about deaf and the hard
of hearing community,

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.090
and we need to work
together to change that.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:02.240
I want to take a moment to
recognize a special guest

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.710
who has already been mentioned,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.050
but I wanted to just give
another shout out to her.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.050
We have her here today, and she's
going to speak in just a moment.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:18.320 position:56%
I want to say my own praises to
Gallaudet President Roberta Cordano,

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:26.010
who is the first deaf woman to lead
the school in its 152-year history.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.130
What an amazing thing that is.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.920
President Cordano, you are a
role model, not just for the deaf

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.870
and hard of hearing
community, but for every person

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.870
who has ever been told that
they can't do something

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.670
because of who they are.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.740
It is an honor to be with
all of you this afternoon.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.670
Thank you again for
inviting me to participate.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.170 position:56%
Thank you to the Library of
Congress and Dr. Hayden for the work

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:56.180
that you all do to ensure that
our history is fully accessible

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.420
to all Americans.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.550
My promise to you is that
I will continue to work

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.350
with Congressman Yoder, the
Congressional Deaf Caucus,

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.980
and all members of Congress
to ensure that deaf and hard

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.690
of hearing people have
a place on Capitol Hill.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.120
Thank you and good afternoon.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.420
Thank you so much.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.220
Thank you.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:24.240
[ Applause ]

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.280
&gt;&gt; Painter: Thank you so much.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.590
We have done an internship here
at the library as well and tried

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.890
to model it after Takano's,

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.040
Representative Takano's
internship program.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:42.050
So we definitely thank him for
that as well, and now everyone

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.470
in their speech so far has
mentioned, President Cordano.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.510
So now it is an honor to
welcome her to the podium.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:55.100
[ Applause ]

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.290
&gt;&gt; Cordano: Hello, everyone.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:01.730
Just checking on the microphone

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:05.880
to make sure we have
access to [inaudible].

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.200
First, I want to thank Dr.
Hayden for the very warm welcome

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.140
and my opportunity
to meet her today.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.560
I agreed with her that there are so
many possibilities for partnerships

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.970
between Gallaudet and
the Library of Congress.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.550
Secondly is Representative
Yoder, and many of you know he is

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.660
on the Board of Gallaudet
Trustees and a great supporter

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.090
of the university in terms
of our federal appropriations

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.150
that we receive yearly
from Congress.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.110 position:56%
We very much appreciate his support.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.950
We do have three public
trustees on the Board

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.790 position:56%
of Trustees at Gallaudet University.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:42.020
We have Representative Butterfield,
Senator Butterfield, and also,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:47.180
of course, Representative
Takano and Representative Yoder.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.630
On the Senate side, we
have a Senator from Ohio,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.040 position:56%
which is Senator Brown, representing

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.220
that Congress representative
on the Board.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.430
These folks are important allies to
us and the deaf community as well.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.840
So I want to thank the three
of you for your support

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.430
of our community and for Gallaudet.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.030
I'm truly honored to be here as
President of Gallaudet University

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.930
in the Library of Congress.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.190
So the first question I have is
how many of you have a Library

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.490
of Congress reading card?

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.250
Let me see a show of hands.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:25.430
Looks like three or four, maybe
five, six of you, seven, eight.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.480
Well, let me say, if you
don't have a reading card,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.400
I strongly suggest you come.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.360
There's a building right across
the street where you go in.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.130
You can sign up, get your
picture taken, and you get one

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.710
of these Library of
Congress reading cards.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.520
So you can come into the reading
room right here in the Library

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.570
of Congress, and it's a wonderful
way to spend an afternoon

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.930
on a weekend or an early
morning, just to come and sit

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.240
and research and do some reading.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.890
It's one of my favorite
things to do here in DC.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.210
I'd encourage you all
to go over there

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.630
and get one of those reading cards.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.480
It's probably the best thing you
can get here in this city and one

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.280
of the best things to do.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.060
I do want to thank the
Library of Congress

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.660
for recognizing this
27th anniversary

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.500
of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.490
We're here today to celebrate
that momentous occasion,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:14.000
and also it's important for all
of us to understand some context

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.770
and what's happened in the years
since the passage of the ADA,

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.050
the support that we've
received, and our civil rights

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.010
and freedom associated with that.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.950 position:56%
This is first the 200th year of deaf
education here in the United States.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.250
It was two hundred years ago at
the American School for the Deaf,

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.200
of which, of course there are
pictures up here in this room,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.390
that deaf education began
here in the United States,

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.940
and it's important because
it's the first time in history

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.220
that a school was founded
on this notion

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.440
that visual language was very
important in the instruction

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.970
of deaf children, and the School

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.960
for the Deaf using
American sign language

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.620
to teach deaf children is a
methodology that was first learned

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.500
and then brought over from France.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.940
We have a 200-year history
that we draw upon today.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.730
If it wasn't for that event 200
years ago that led to the founding

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.490
of a number of schools for the
deaf throughout the United States,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.010
those schools have since
produced, as you all know,

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.980
high school graduates, and it
was the beginning of the makings

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.110
of a middle class of deaf
people here in America.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.810
The son of Thomas Gallaudet,
who founded, of course,

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.110
the American School for the Deaf,

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.430
came to realize there
were opportunities

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.440
in providing deaf people,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.570
opportunities to get a college
education, and he worked

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:33.220
and then came to the DC area
to found the Columbia School

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.680
for the Deaf and Deaf Mute.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.410
There was an elementary
school here in the area.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.830 position:56%
It was decided that they would begin
a university, and with the help

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:44.520 position:56%
of Amos Kendell went on to found and
chartered through Congress signed

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.130
by Abraham Lincoln, the very
first and, as was mentioned

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:54.130 position:56%
by Congressman Takano, the first and
continues to be the only university

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.560
in the world that provides direct
instruction to deaf individuals

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.170
through American sign language.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.350
You know that experience continues
to be the only one like it

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:08.760
in the world, and that's what
makes this state even more special

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.200
and unique.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.210
It is for all of us a reminder
of our need to continue

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:22.210
to protect the language of our
community, and that is the right

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:28.590
that is protected by the ADA,
the ability to communicate

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.150
through this language
and to do so effectively.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.890
It's by no accident that Gallaudet
was part of the passage of the ADA.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:38.580
If you remember, here in
the halls of Congress,

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.580
it was at that time the ADA
was being discussed that DPN,

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.010
Deaf President Now protests began.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:48.560
Many of you in this room
were part of the DPN protest.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.860
Some of you were.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.680
I see here today.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.220
There's a part of an
alumni community

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.250
that also supported
the Deaf President Now.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.770
So there were seven what we call
ducks who were alumni supporters

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.840
of the Deaf President Now protest.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.710
So it was that protest that
really woke up Congress

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.020
and drew the attention on
Gallaudet and deaf people's fight

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.900
for civil rights and all that
came with this and then led

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.480 position:56%
to the passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, in a large part

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.890
because of the fire that was fueled
as a result of Deaf President Now.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.720
Had it not been for DPN, I
think everyone would tell you

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.790 position:56%
that the ADA would have never
passed, but DPN provided the energy,

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.580
the motivation, and the hope the
people could see, the deaf people,

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.650 position:56%
the disabled wanted to be able to
be part of a civic life around them,

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.160
and that hope was made
possible through the ADA, and,

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.570 position:56%
again it represented the hope of the
rights of people with disabilities

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:50.530
to be able to participate
fully in the civic life.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:54.500
The ADA is not just about access.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.080
It's about the right to
participate in community life.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.620
You know, we sometimes
forget that language.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.580
It's about our right to be members
of our community, to have access

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.750
to learning, to employment, to be
able to connect and participate

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.500
in community activities
and engagement and events,

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.710
to be able to go to movie
theaters, to be able to go

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:21.370
to theatrical productions, all
allowing for civic participation

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.210
in community life here
in this country.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.600
I wanted to go back
to something here.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.800
As I mentioned, you know,
it's the 200-year anniversary

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.500
of deaf education here
in the United States.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.280
We're also celebrating
something else.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:00.640
It's now, I believe, 58 years ago

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.710
that American sign language was
discovered to be a full language.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.480
That discovery was made
at Gallaudet University.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.780
It was the first time in
the history of the world

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.160
that sign language was
actually seen to be commiserate

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:21.140 position:56%
to any other language that was
used, be it English, French, German,

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.800 position:56%
Spanish, that American sign
language was given the same prestige

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.100
and recognition.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.240
It was just 60 years ago that this
was verified, rather 57 years ago,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.910
that this was verified to be the
case, and that is significant

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:38.020
in our understanding that
American sign language is still

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.370
in its infancy.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.670
ADA is 27 years old.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.660
American sign language is
only 57 years old in terms

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:52.710
of its recognition officially as a
language, and if we go from there

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.070
and understand that
from that understanding

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:59.560 position:56%
that there is an official language,
there must be a culture, literature,

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.980
a form of arts that's
very unique and specific

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.920
to an individual language, and
that was as well proven to be true

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.600
as we began to recognize
books created by deaf people

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.990
and that spoke to Americans
of heritage and that

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:19.470
if you foster a language and an
art, then students came together

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.190
to verify one other
thing, and that is the fact

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.600
that they have civil rights,
that we have civil rights,

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.750
and that civil right mindset
has allowed us to participate

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.820
in a movement that's
far bigger than our own.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.930
Minority rights in a country like
this has significant meaning.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.130
Understanding that we
may be a small community,

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.040
we're a part of a larger
community and how is it

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.310
that we can get the
representation that we need

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.520
within that larger majority
culture, and then, of course,

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.270
those questions led to the
Deaf President Now protest

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.020
and another protest
which occurred in 2006.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.260
I looked at that protest as
being a very significant one

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.350
for different reasons than
just being about this election

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.680 position:56%
of a president, but it was instead
a way for the community at Gallaudet

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.530
to be able to express its right to
self determination and the rights

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:11.380 position:56%
to be able to be part of a
process, to be engaged in a process,

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.580
the right to be included
in a process is what

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.200
that protest recommended.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.290
It happened to be about the
selection of a president,

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.750
but it really was about the
right to be a part of the process

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.190
which creates self determination
and another part of being part

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:28.450
of a free country and a democracy
that allows us to be part

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:32.180
of that process, and let us
never forget that is the case.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.770
So all of this to say still
leaves the question of language,

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.300
spoken language versus
sign language,

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.840
and that debate has been a long
standing one over the years

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.020
from Plato, you know, to
the 1880's, even to now,

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.540
people really advocating for, you
know, the use of spoken language

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.080
or the use of sign language.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.840
Research over the last 12 years
at Gallaudet has really come

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.280
to realize it's not an
either/or proposition,

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.250
and it never has been an
either/or proposition.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.610
It's more of an and proposition.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.740
If you develop a bilingual
brain in a deaf child,

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.100
that child's brain will thrive as
a result, and if that child is able

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.360
to produce spoken language,
that's fine.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.660
They can pick up English.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:21.960
That's still available to them.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.660
They can read or write English
if they can't speak English,

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.390
but having access to
a visual language

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.080
as well creates a powerful
opportunity for brain development,

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.660
and that's just extraordinary.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:41.020
And so finally we have
science catching up to what we

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.280
as a community has known all along.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.780
Science is now verifying the
fact that we have been saying

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:52.600
for a number of number of
years, and that fact, of course,

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.550
really is represented in the
beauty of our university,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.760
how we can have an
immersive experience

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.630
for people of our community.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.250 position:56%
That government and our country
have allowed people in our community

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.730
to have this opportunity
is significant

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:10.880
because there's no other
experience like it in the world.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:20.570
I want to shift a bit to talk
about the ADA and our Constitution

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:25.290
where it talks about the goal
to create a more perfect union.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:32.330
The ADA to me is one of the
first steps in that process

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.850
in this country to create
that more perfect union.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.180
And so I asked myself as
I prepared to come here,

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.590
what have we learned
in the past 27 years?

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.460
What have we learned?

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:54.150
And one of the first things that
comes to mind is that education

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:59.810
and learning that is really
honed in on the individual skills

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.430
of that child and the unique
approach that they bring

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:09.260
to the world is critical to the
success of every child in America,

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.960 position:56%
whether that child has a disability,
despite their skin color,

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.850
their religious beliefs,
their political affiliations,

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:27.260
religious beliefs, all of those
social constructs created by people

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:33.170
to label, to separate, and take
people from coming together united,

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.500
without paying attention to that
person's unique way of being

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.410
and what they uniquely
bring to the world.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:43.360
That is very powerful, and why
don't we teach to that strength,

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.940
that uniqueness that they bring
instead of to their weakness?

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.570
When we teach to the child's
weakness, their inability to hear,

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.510
we take away from what we can
give them, and we instead teach

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:56.390 position:56%
to their ability to have that visual
language, and why not do both?

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.080
Why not afford them both
that opportunity to speak,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.630
have access to that language
as well as sign language?

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.340
And ADA is an invitation
for us to engage

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.640
in that kind of a conversation.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.980
Moving on to employment.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.890
That's the key to a strong country.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.260
Deaf people's success in the
United States has been afforded

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.700
by their access to
employment opportunities.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:28.150 position:56%
Many Gallaudet graduates go into
the workforce, and strangely enough,

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.920
in the last 10 to 15 years,

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.090
our progress in the employment
arena is not been as great

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:39.660 position:56%
as it had been before the passage of
the ADA, and the question is raised

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.090
as to why that is the case.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.970
What's the fundamental
problem that we need

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.890
to address in order to change that?

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.730 position:56%
Minnesota and the federal government
in the past looked to the number

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.980
of people with disabilities and
saw that's over 20, 15 to 20,

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.910
30 percent of these
individuals-never 30,

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.590
but at least 15 to 20 percent
of the population is disabled.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:08.670
After 2007, after the recession,
the numbers began to drop off to 2

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:13.030
to 7 percent of the disability
community being employed,

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.340
and this creates the
future challenge for us.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.070
Our work is not done.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.020
We sit back and look to the
wonder of ADA, and, yes,

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.950
certainly we do recognize that,
but we also recognize the work

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.110
that needs to be done and what
we need to do in order to change

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:29.590
and improve our employment
outcome for all people

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:36.770
with disabilities,
not just deaf people.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:40.350
Learning and engagement in
the community is our right,

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.700
and that's a lesson that
we learned from the ADA.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.410
We have a right to learn and be
engaged in the community around us,

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:50.220
and that's what leads to us
being strong citizens-engaged

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.550
in the political process and
our communities and our schools

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.620
and our family units, and
our deaf organizations,

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.950
and a variety of other places.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.600
Access. If we talk about
access, it is public good.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.740
I mean don't think it
only being about you

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.200
as an individual having access,
but it is in overall public good

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.850
and applies to every single one of
our us-- our families, our friends,

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.160
our communities around us.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.460
Providing interpreters

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.720
and captioning is not
just advantageous

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.020
for people who are deaf.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.000
It's advantageous for
everyone in the room.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.150
It is about public good, and that
kind of language needs to change,

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.250
and that is the impact of the ADA.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.580
We must choose to broaden
the understanding

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.700
of the impact of the ADA.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:52.670
It provides access, and that
access is public good for all.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:58.860
And lastly, as we know at Gallaudet
we have students who enter,

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.320
and often what happens to
them, they thrive tremendously

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:09.140 position:56%
so because they can be fully engaged
in the life of the community there.

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.700
You know many of you
graduated from Gallaudet,

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.910
and I think most of
you I think have.

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:16.420
I think there are some who are
still working their way through

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.890
or in graduate school,
but what's interesting is,

00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:24.900
you know we continue the search,
the search for that perfect world

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.790
that is more broad than
the one where we live.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:32.330 position:56%
We seek to how we can have that same
feeling of having full engagement

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.630
in the broader world
around us and not just

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.780
within a localized community.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:43.170
Let us shift the conversation
away from hearing loss

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.200
to really understand a
multi-lingual community

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.660
that can thrive with us together.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:55.140
Think about the Spanish
speaking families,

00:34:55.140 --> 00:35:00.170
the Arabic speaking families,
the German speaking families,

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.840
the French speaking families, all
of them coming together with us,

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.760
thriving together in a
multi-lingual community.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.390
How can we make that happen?

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:14.350 position:56%
These are the questions that we have
to address over the next 27 years.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.700
These are our thoughts and
considerations that should lead

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:21.070
to action and leadership
in the next 27 years.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.560 position:56%
You know, we must rely on each other
to come up with these solutions

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.750
to improve the quality of
lives for everyone post ADA.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.060
Thank you for the invitation
to be here today

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.860 position:56%
and to be part of this conversation.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:43.630
[ Applause ]

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Thank you
very much for coming.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.990 position:56%
It's very fascinating to hear about
your contributions to the university

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:55.300
and to students and
about the challenges

00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:00.700
that you see there lying for us.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.590
Obviously you were involved
before the ADA passed,

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.630
and your perspective now
on how things have changed

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.710
and where they're going,
it was wonderful.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:11.010
So thank you.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:16.130
So we started this event

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:23.560
with Congressman Yoder
talking about legislation.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:31.760
We've had Congressman Takano
talk about deaf interns

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.610
and how they are helping the
deaf communities that they serve.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.850
We've had the President of
Gallaudet University talk to us

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.730
about deaf education and the
challenges that she's seen

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.850
in her life and those
she sees set before us,

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.190
and now I'd like to
wrap up the event.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:55.140
I'd like end with something
that's-someone who has grown

00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:03.980 position:56%
up without knowing a time before
the ADA, somebody who may have been,

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:10.810
who was not used to the challenges
of the past and can now show us

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.440
about his love for
books and for language.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:21.650
So I'd like to invite August
Kitama to the stage-Shitama,

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:33.980
a TEDx presenter, to join us here.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.280
&gt;&gt; Shitama: Hello, everyone.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.420
I first want to thank Dr. Hayden
for hosting this wonderful event.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:44.130
I also want to thank
Representatives Yoder and Tokano

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:49.580
and President Cordano for guiding
the way for us to become more equal

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.690
and for a brighter future
for the deaf community.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:57.840
I'm honored to be among people who
have been fighting in this fight

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.360
for the deaf community
here in this room.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.140
Because of their persistence and
because of their passion I am able

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.440
to stand before you today.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.990
So, you know, I have a dream to
become on the national stage.

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:20.750
I'm honored to be among you.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:24.730
One thing that I think
that I'm honored to be here

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.040
because this is the
Library of Congress,

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.830
and I have a severe love for books.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.630
So before I get going, I'm going
to ask the interpreter just

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:36.160
to silence his voice
for about 10 minutes.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.530
I'm just joking about not
having an interpreter.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.710
[Laughter] But let's
take a moment to reflect

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:53.590
about how it felt to
watch me signing.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.910
To know what I wasn't saying-to
now know what I was saying

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.630
without the interpreter voicing
for me, how did that feel?

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.080
How did it feel to
be left in the dark?

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.380
I'm sure it was awkward, right?

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.960
And then when you finally heard
the interpreter's voice again,

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.570
I'm sure you sighed
a bit of a relief.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.750
It was a light that sort
of went off in your head,

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:15.760
and that is what I
call the sort of agony

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.920 position:56%
and ecstasy of the human connection.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.930
We all want to feel a connection.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:28.380
That's natural, but that connection
is not something we can always see

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.460
or hear.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.390
It's something that we can feel.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.180
There's something that
we feel in our heart.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.660
It's a moment of clarity.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.140
I discovered this when I was a
wee lad learning how to read.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:45.240
Even though sign language is
how I prefer to communicate,

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.580
reading allows me to learn
more about the world.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.660
There's a lot you can
learn about the world just

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:59.220 position:56%
by hearing it somewhere, like on the
radio when you're driving to work,

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.750
or through the grapevine, which,
what I understand, is a polite way

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:06.460
of saying that you've been
shamelessly eavesdropping.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.760
[Laughter] I don't
have that privilege

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.120
to consciously absorb information
without actively pursuing it.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.870
That's not a burden for me.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:17.720
It's actually a blessing.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.990
What wasn't handed to me I've
wanted for myself with a passion,

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.620
and that passion started when
I was in pre-kindergarten.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:33.190
We had a customary naptime,
which was never my cup of tea.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.170
Luckily one day my teacher told me

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:36.900
that I didn't have
to naptime anymore.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.470 position:56%
Instead she took me into her office.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:43.620
She had piles of books, vocabulary
cards, and colorful pictures

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:47.960
of everyday things, but I
didn't know the word for it.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:52.790
I felt like the cartoon man
sketched above the word excited.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:58.410
I was right there in my teacher's
office when I learned how to read.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.140
Learning to read was
a fascinating process.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.110 position:56%
Unless you know someone who is deaf,

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.570
you've probably never considered
how an audible language can be

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:06.900
taught visually.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.880
It usually takes four steps.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.830
My teacher would show me a drawing
of a hairy beast, and then letter

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.420
by letter she spelt the
corresponding word in English

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.720
and ASL, and then showed the sign.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.130
So I made the connection between
the written word, the paper,

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.730
a finger spelling, and
ultimately a sign, and now I knew

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.030
that hairy beast was a dog.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.800
That was essentially the
foundation for my reading skills,

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:43.150
but there's one crucial
thing missing-my own voice,

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:47.690
and what I mean by this is I was
mechanically competent in writing,

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:52.210
but it was too precise, devoid
of any natural occurring humanity

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:56.160
that is so apparent in everyone's
voice, both spoken and written.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.120
What I craved was to be able to
express myself as authentically

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.450
as possible through writing,
which at that point was tricky

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.340
because I couldn't hear
organic conversations

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.690
and [inaudible] that organically.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:13.430
Fortunately, I discovered a book of
children's stories called "A Series

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:18.690
of Unfortunate Events" by Lemony
Snicket in the third grade.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:23.680 position:56%
It was about the Baudelaire orphans.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.270
They lost their parents
in a terrible fire,

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:31.610
and now their new guardian, Count
Olaf, is a vile egomaniac who lies

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:37.250
to get whatever he wants, including
the orphans' enormous fortune.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:43.950
Snicket's writing style
is quite distinctive,

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:49.340
which I would say means
easily recognizable due

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.690
to the author's affinity

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.060
for humorously defining
his large vocabulary

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.710
in the middle of the story.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:58.270
For me, it was love at first word.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:01.670
Here was this book written
for children that had words

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:07.200
like penultimate, standoffish,
words that you don't normally read,

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.950
and his tone was interesting
as well.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:12.190
It was very funny and familiar.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:15.230
It was something that I want.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:19.110
So as I started to read
more through the series,

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:24.180
I had a new dimension
added to my prism.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:34.150
One day I saw the world through
the eyes of a cynical New Yorker,

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.860
David Sedaris, where a horrible
incident could be recounted

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.840
as a darkly funny anecdote.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.830
The next day I'd see the world
through Atticus Finch's eyes

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:49.620 position:56%
as a place to never lose hope when
it comes to fighting the good fight.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.260
Eventually my perspective
became an amalgamation

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:56.810
of the books I read over the years.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.470
Reading the conversations
in these books was

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.800
where I found a natural rhythm.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:07.830
That rhythm fermented from reading
the close captioning on TV shows

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:13.230
like "30 Rock" and "Seinfeld" with
a cascade of rapid fire word play,

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:16.860
and that was the humanity
I longed for in my writing.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.330
With a solid understanding
of the art of conversation

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.410
in English, I found my voice.

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:27.700
Throughout this journey
I never stopped reading.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.650
I learned to read about the world.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:48.300
The value of reading comes
from the power of information.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:55.800
I read to rid myself of
ignorance, and I can tell you

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:01.350
that when you read only 140
characters, that's not enough.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.540
I don't want to come across as an
insufferable know-it-all but just

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.180 position:56%
to show you how much I want to know.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:22.570
It's when people struggle
to find meaning in life

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:24.330 position:56%
that I find meaning in the struggle.

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.510
I have a purpose.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:31.530
It's why I get out of bed every
morning lusting for novelty

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:34.040
where the adage goes "There's
a whole world out there waiting

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.580 position:56%
for you," and I started exploring
that world by remaining in one place

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.920
with the greatest ticket
ever, a book.

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:49.450
In addition to falling
in love with books,

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:54.380
because of the strides we made in
public education and civil rights,

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.440
that disconnection
from the world I felt

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.590
as a deaf person is
no longer tangible.

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:12.890
To rest on our laurels and take
all our progress we've made

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:16.860
in the last 20 years for granted
wouldn't just be a disservice

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.530
to the trailblazers.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.630
It would be a disservice
to our children

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.040
and our children's children.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:27.350
I'm here because I know
the world is bigger

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:30.380
than this extraordinary nation.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.260
I'm here because I
know we won't rest

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:36.140
until we leave the world a
better place than we found it,

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:40.770
and all of this starts with
a willingness to be a student

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:47.010
for life, and we can do that
just by opening a book and taking

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:50.220
in that first sentence
and keep reading.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.840
Thank you.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:47:03.040
[Applause]

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker: Thank you, August,
for your inspiring words.

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:13.410
I know your passion for books very
well and amazed to have you here.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:16.850
Thank you to all of you who have
come to participate in this event.

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:21.130
I hope that you've learned
something about a new perspective

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:29.500 position:56%
and seeing people who are deaf
signing present here at the library.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.900
We do have events that are ongoing.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.090
So it's nice to see a change,

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:44.220
to have our regular language being
replaced by American sign language.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.660
We are finished with the event
now, but I will remind you

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:51.260 position:56%
that we have exhibits along the side
of the room from our collections.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.370
Everything here on the tables
is related to deaf history

00:47:55.370 --> 00:48:00.040
in the United States, the
contributions of deaf people

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.430
across our history, and
Gallaudet University.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:09.570
So you'll see some pictures,
some letters from Helen Keller,

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:10.950
and other such artifacts.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:17.380
So if you'd like to start
looking at the chronology

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.210
of the collections we have-

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:21.920
&gt;&gt; Announcer: This has
been a presentation

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.860
of the Library of Congress.
