boat and your eyes are moving and
 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.330
boat and your eyes are moving and
register your boat and you're either

and your brain cannot deal with that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
and your brain cannot deal with that

almost everything to avoid uncertainty

so these assumptions keep us alive but

so these assumptions keep us alive but
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.040

they can also get in the way because

then we hold on to those assumptions

is to

is to
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.120
is to
not just admit but embody the fact that

not just admit but embody the fact that
 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.710
not just admit but embody the fact that
everything you do right now is grounded

that then you'll never create the

the next step is to then identify your

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
the next step is to then identify your
 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.310
the next step is to then identify your
assumptions because most of everything

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320
assumptions because most of everything
 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.990

that we do we don't know why we do what

that we do we don't know why we do what
we do and then the final step is to

we do and then the final step is to
 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.480
we do and then the final step is to
question those assumptions okay but

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490
question those assumptions okay but
 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.190
question those assumptions okay but
questioning assumptions is incredibly

questioning assumptions is incredibly
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.950
questioning assumptions is incredibly
difficult because to question

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960
difficult because to question
 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.260
difficult because to question
assumptions to doubt what you assume to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.630

they're doing is making a small step to

they're doing is making a small step to
 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.430
they're doing is making a small step to
the next most likely possibility based

on their assumptions but one someone on

on their assumptions but one someone on

the outside sees them doing that

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440
the outside sees them doing that
 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.900
the outside sees them doing that
thinking wow how did they put those two

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910
thinking wow how did they put those two

things that are far apart together and

things that are far apart together and
 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.740
things that are far apart together and
the reason why it seems that way is

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750
the reason why it seems that way is
 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.050
the reason why it seems that way is
because for the observer they are far

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060
because for the observer they are far
 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.240
because for the observer they are far
apart they have a different space of

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250
apart they have a different space of
 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.040
apart they have a different space of
possibility and in their space

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050
possibility and in their space
 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.240
possibility and in their space
possibility they exist way over here so

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250
possibility they exist way over here so
 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.010

creativity in this sense is only created

a logical next step the difference is
 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.070
a logical next step the difference is
that their space of possibility is

they might have a more complex space of
 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.000
they might have a more complex space of

they assimilated more complex

they assimilated more complex
 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.100
they assimilated more complex
