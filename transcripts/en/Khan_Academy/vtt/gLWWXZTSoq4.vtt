00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:02.403
- Teachers can play a
tremendously powerful role

00:00:02.403 --> 00:00:04.440
in creating a growth mindset culture.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.168
And there are a variety
of different strategies,

00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:08.044
and approaches they can use to do that.

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:09.635
One way the teachers can powerfully

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.256
role model a growth mindset,

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:13.301
is to really have a
growth mindset about each

00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:14.577
one of their students.

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.222
To really authentically believe
and communicate to their

00:00:17.222 --> 00:00:19.690
students that they
expect each and every one

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.244
of them to be successful.

00:00:21.244 --> 00:00:23.762
That they believe that
with the right strategies

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:25.298
and with the right effort,

00:00:25.298 --> 00:00:28.064
each one of their students can
be successful in their class.

00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:29.593
And reach really high levels.

00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:32.178
Just as important as
communicating that idea,

00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:35.357
is a teacher to communicate
the idea that they're there to

00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:36.923
support them in that process.

00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:40.721
Not that I believe you can
do this, and good luck.

00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:42.427
But rather I'm here to help you.

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:43.822
I'm here to help coach you,

00:00:43.822 --> 00:00:46.877
and to help you really learn how

00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:49.172
to grow and be successful in my class.

00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:51.626
I think another strategy
that teachers can use to

00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:53.247
create a growth mindset culture,

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:56.651
Is to focus on the process of learning.

00:00:56.651 --> 00:00:59.074
To focus not on the
outcomes, not on the grades

00:00:59.074 --> 00:01:00.922
that students get but rather on the

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:03.582
process of growing, and
what strategies they

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:05.148
can use to improve their work.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.806
But it can be really helpful
and encouraging for them,

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.221
they can build their
sense of self advocacy.

00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:11.510
And help them see that
they are in fact growing

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.208
even if they are not
getting the best grade.

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.209
If their teacher really calls out the

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.525
specific things they are doing well.

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:19.358
Now that can be challenging and
time consuming for teachers.

00:01:19.358 --> 00:01:21.397
That means really reviewing

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:23.552
the work that students are doing.

00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:27.117
To be able to recognize and
call out those good strategies.

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:28.738
But it can really pay off because it

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:31.239
directs students attention
to making sure that they're

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:34.620
using those good strategies
and help them see

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.180
success and whatever that discipline is.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.884
Whether it's math, or
science, or literature as

00:01:38.884 --> 00:01:40.928
a combination of learning and mastering

00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:42.664
these different strategies.

00:01:42.664 --> 00:01:44.850
And they can see themselves
growing and being acknowledged

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.313
for being successful in those
many steps along the way

00:01:49.313 --> 00:01:51.154
to becoming really great at that subject.

00:01:51.154 --> 00:01:53.533
I think another really
important way that the teachers

00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:56.428
can role model growth mindset,

00:01:56.428 --> 00:01:58.698
is through the way they
talk about themselves,

00:01:58.698 --> 00:02:00.448
about their own learning journey,

00:02:00.448 --> 00:02:02.529
and the way they approach mistakes.

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:04.902
Creating an environment in which mistakes

00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:08.345
are celebrated is really powerful.

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:09.637
An environment in which
students don't have to

00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:11.110
worry about making mistakes
because they understand

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.745
that their teacher
won't look down on them.

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:17.412
That in contrast those mistakes,

00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:19.963
if they pay attention to them,

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:22.452
are like important hints as to what

00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:24.790
they can do to ultimately improve.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.777
Some teachers will actually make a

00:02:25.777 --> 00:02:28.857
point to make mistakes themselves.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.949
They'll kind of inject mistakes
into their own teaching.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.948
In order for their students
to really be on the lookout

00:02:33.948 --> 00:02:36.854
for mistakes and then so
they can model how you should

00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:39.332
react when you do make a mistake.

00:02:39.332 --> 00:02:41.948
So for example, when their
students catch them making

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:45.499
a mistake the teacher
isn't defensive at all in

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.582
the face of that mistake.

00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:48.657
They don't try to sweep it under the rug.

00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:49.982
Instead they might say thank you,

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:52.059
you know thank you so much
for fixing my mistake.

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.002
Let's think about why I made this mistake,

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:55.747
let's think about what strategy I can use

00:02:55.747 --> 00:02:58.481
to prevent myself from
making that mistake again.

00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:00.454
And in that way the teacher
is kind of modeling,

00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:02.627
their providing the kind
of mental scaffolding

00:03:02.627 --> 00:03:05.312
that students ultimately
need to engage in themselves.

00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:07.928
That way when they make
their own mistakes,

00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:09.454
they'll understand what's a healthy

00:03:09.454 --> 00:03:11.954
way to react to that mistake.
