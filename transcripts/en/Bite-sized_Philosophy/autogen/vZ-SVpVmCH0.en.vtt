00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
so those are two possible means of

so those are two possible means of

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 align:start position:0%
integration and then I think what you're
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
integration and then I think what you're
doing<00:00:29.220><c> is</c><00:00:30.410><c> feeding</c><00:00:31.410><c> one</c><00:00:31.560><c> or</c><00:00:31.710><c> the</c><00:00:31.800><c> other</c>

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
doing is feeding one or the other
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.790 align:start position:0%
doing is feeding one or the other
constantly<00:00:32.640><c> and</c><00:00:33.410><c> I</c><00:00:34.410><c> think</c><00:00:34.649><c> you</c><00:00:34.770><c> probably</c>

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
constantly and I think you probably
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.270 align:start position:0%
constantly and I think you probably
choose<00:00:35.460><c> which</c><00:00:35.940><c> one</c><00:00:36.149><c> to</c><00:00:36.270><c> feed</c><00:00:36.510><c> I</c><00:00:36.780><c> think</c><00:00:37.410><c> that's</c>

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
choose which one to feed I think that's
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340 align:start position:0%
choose which one to feed I think that's
and<00:00:38.520><c> I</c><00:00:38.610><c> mean</c><00:00:38.760><c> that's</c><00:00:38.879><c> how</c><00:00:39.059><c> it</c><00:00:39.090><c> feels</c><00:00:39.690><c> that</c><00:00:40.110><c> way</c>

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 align:start position:0%
and I mean that's how it feels that way
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.100 align:start position:0%
and I mean that's how it feels that way
to<00:00:40.410><c> me</c><00:00:40.649><c> as</c><00:00:40.800><c> well</c><00:00:41.010><c> like</c><00:00:41.250><c> when</c><00:00:41.430><c> I</c><00:00:41.460><c> look</c><00:00:41.670><c> at</c><00:00:41.790><c> my</c><00:00:41.910><c> own</c>

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 align:start position:0%
defensive and that makes the fight way
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
defensive and that makes the fight way
worse<00:01:26.280><c> because</c><00:01:26.700><c> then</c><00:01:26.880><c> there's</c><00:01:27.150><c> no</c><00:01:27.210><c> damn</c><00:01:27.509><c> way</c>

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 align:start position:0%

you're<00:01:27.960><c> gonna</c><00:01:28.080><c> admit</c><00:01:28.409><c> that</c><00:01:28.439><c> you</c><00:01:28.770><c> actually</c><00:01:29.460><c> did</c>

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
you're gonna admit that you actually did

you're gonna admit that you actually did
that<00:01:29.670><c> and</c><00:01:30.150><c> so</c><00:01:30.720><c> things</c><00:01:31.020><c> do</c><00:01:31.200><c> go</c><00:01:31.380><c> to</c><00:01:31.439><c> hell</c><00:01:31.740><c> and</c><00:01:32.009><c> so</c>

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
that and so things do go to hell and so
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
that and so things do go to hell and so
so<00:01:33.390><c> here's</c><00:01:33.659><c> here's</c><00:01:33.960><c> an</c><00:01:34.110><c> ugly</c><00:01:34.380><c> little</c><00:01:34.500><c> idea</c><00:01:35.090><c> so</c>

it's a dopaminergic agonist and what

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
what dopamine does is two things it
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.420 align:start position:0%
what dopamine does is two things it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 align:start position:0%
makes you feel like what you're doing is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of neural circuits that
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of neural circuits that
are<00:02:01.380><c> active</c><00:02:01.890><c> and</c><00:02:02.130><c> then</c><00:02:02.340><c> they</c><00:02:02.909><c> get</c><00:02:03.060><c> a</c><00:02:03.119><c> hit</c><00:02:03.270><c> of</c>

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 align:start position:0%
are active and then they get a hit of
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.929 align:start position:0%
are active and then they get a hit of
dopamine<00:02:03.450><c> or</c><00:02:04.110><c> you</c><00:02:04.710><c> do</c><00:02:04.890><c> then</c><00:02:05.310><c> those</c><00:02:05.549><c> neural</c>

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
dopamine or you do then those neural
 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.869 align:start position:0%
dopamine or you do then those neural
circuits<00:02:06.329><c> get</c><00:02:06.479><c> a</c><00:02:06.540><c> little</c><00:02:06.780><c> bit</c><00:02:06.899><c> more</c><00:02:07.049><c> powerful</c>

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 align:start position:0%
circuits get a little bit more powerful
 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.630 align:start position:0%
circuits get a little bit more powerful
okay<00:02:08.879><c> so</c><00:02:08.940><c> it</c><00:02:09.209><c> it</c><00:02:09.420><c> has</c><00:02:09.690><c> a</c><00:02:09.720><c> rewarding</c><00:02:10.640><c> property</c>

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
okay so it it has a rewarding property
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.860 align:start position:0%
okay so it it has a rewarding property
which<00:02:11.819><c> is</c><00:02:11.970><c> that</c><00:02:12.120><c> it</c><00:02:12.209><c> makes</c><00:02:12.360><c> you</c><00:02:12.450><c> feel</c><00:02:12.599><c> like</c>

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 align:start position:0%
which is that it makes you feel like
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.450 align:start position:0%
which is that it makes you feel like
what

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 align:start position:0%
what
 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
what
doing<00:02:13.670><c> is</c><00:02:13.820><c> important</c><00:02:14.660><c> and</c><00:02:14.720><c> it</c><00:02:15.470><c> has</c><00:02:15.620><c> a</c>

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 align:start position:0%
doing is important and it has a
 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.650 align:start position:0%
doing is important and it has a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 align:start position:0%
reinforcing property which is it makes
 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.130 align:start position:0%
reinforcing property which is it makes
neural<00:02:18.650><c> circuits</c><00:02:19.100><c> grow</c><00:02:19.400><c> so</c><00:02:20.090><c> now</c><00:02:20.900><c> what</c><00:02:21.110><c> that</c>

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 align:start position:0%
neural circuits grow so now what that
 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.550 align:start position:0%
neural circuits grow so now what that
means<00:02:21.290><c> is</c><00:02:21.770><c> that</c><00:02:23.020><c> whatever</c><00:02:24.020><c> you</c><00:02:24.170><c> were</c><00:02:24.290><c> doing</c>

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
means is that whatever you were doing
 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.930 align:start position:0%
means is that whatever you were doing
just<00:02:24.590><c> before</c><00:02:25.100><c> you</c><00:02:25.520><c> took</c><00:02:25.970><c> cocaine</c><00:02:26.180><c> grows</c><00:02:27.940><c> okay</c>

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 align:start position:0%
just before you took cocaine grows okay
 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
just before you took cocaine grows okay
so<00:02:29.000><c> now</c><00:02:29.210><c> imagine</c><00:02:29.420><c> there's</c><00:02:30.050><c> a</c><00:02:30.140><c> bunch</c><00:02:30.350><c> of</c>

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 align:start position:0%
different things that you do just before

you<00:02:32.330><c> take</c><00:02:32.360><c> cocaine</c><00:02:33.040><c> but</c><00:02:34.040><c> there's</c><00:02:34.280><c> a</c><00:02:34.340><c> string</c><00:02:34.730><c> of</c>

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
you take cocaine but there's a string of

you take cocaine but there's a string of

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 align:start position:0%
because you know you're in trouble and

that decision point is well to hell with
 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.050 align:start position:0%
that decision point is well to hell with
it<00:02:46.840><c> okay</c><00:02:47.840><c> so</c><00:02:47.900><c> then</c><00:02:48.260><c> you</c><00:02:49.130><c> think</c><00:02:49.430><c> that</c><00:02:49.610><c> each</c><00:02:50.000><c> of</c>

it okay so then you think that each of
