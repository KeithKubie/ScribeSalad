WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.760
So the other thing is a same sex marriage.

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:04.590
There's the other thing that I think that we disagree with.

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.270
Well I we agree with the marriage thing,
right?

4
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.230
[inaudible] government should be involved.
They all,

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.410
I think where people should be protected is through assets and you know,

6
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:19.620
the contract.
Yes.
Yeah.
I think that that all makes sense to me,

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.880
that all that style in terms of like a alimony and child support and all those

8
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:28.170
things make sense to me.
And that then the idea that the community reinforces it,

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.780
which would then become the government reinforce and all that stuff.

10
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.630
That all makes sense to me.
I understand it.
But um,

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.990
why do you care if a two gay guys want to get married?

12
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.160
<v 1>Um,
so from a religious point of view,
sure.
Let's go from the legislature.</v>

13
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.350
So you want them to a secular point of view first.
So the,

14
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.370
the idea is not that I care deeply whether two gay guys want to get married to

15
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:48.701
each other.

16
00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:53.410
The idea is that it do I prefer traditional marriage to say to same sex
marriage.

17
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.560
<v 0>Okay.
Well,
let me,
let me phrase it this way.
What do you think a gay guy is?</v>

18
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.370
Do you think someone's there making a choice or do you think that this is how

19
00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:00.830
they were?

20
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.610
<v 1>So the religious point of view on this and,</v>

21
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.320
and I think this is actually just the general conservative point of view on

22
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:07.640
human action generally is,
I don't know,

23
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.980
meaning that for the vast majority of people,

24
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:13.520
I would assume that they have a biological drive to engage in that behavior.

25
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.670
But the traditional sort of we'll point of view is that biological drive does

26
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:22.670
not necessarily match up to the activity you ought to engage in.
Right.
Men,

27
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.070
for example,
have a biological drive to impregnate many women.

28
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.250
That's not something religion is cool with either.
All right,
so the,

29
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:30.084
the idea is that

30
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.540
<v 0>red balloon religion is cool with the man being with one woman and impregnating</v>

31
00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:37.600
her.
But you're not cool with a man being with a man.

32
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.130
<v 1>So I can give you the religious explanation than I can give you the secular</v>

33
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:41.970
explanation.
So they,

34
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.770
so the religious explanation is that there is something different about a woman

35
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.850
than there is about a man and a man is made better through his union with a

36
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:51.684
woman.

37
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.750
And that if you pervert the sex drive to pursue mere pleasure instead of a

38
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.870
lasting relationship upon which the basis of society is built,

39
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.460
then you are foregoing the proper use of your sex drive.
Right.

40
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.720
<v 0>I you wanted to step in and argue against that.</v>

41
00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:11.890
You would say that just because someone can't get pregnant doesn't mean that

42
00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:15.730
they don't have a loving relationship that contributes to society.

43
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.720
<v 1>Well that's true,</v>

44
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:21.721
but it is also for going the more productive relationship of being able to bear

45
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:22.960
and rear children and also,

46
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:25.520
and also we recognize that the sentence are not different right then and

47
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.710
recognizing all of the sexes are not the same.
So you know,

48
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.780
being with a man is in a relationship different than being with a woman.

49
00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:34.780
I would assume.
I mean the item,
that's why gay guys are gay.
If it weren't,

50
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.990
then I assume that they would be fine with being with a woman.
Right.
So that's,

51
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.120
so that relationship from a,

52
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.570
from a religious perspective is more valuable because women have different

53
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:47.080
qualities than men.
You round off each other's harsh edges,
it changes you.
I mean,

54
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.540
you're married.
Being married changes Amanda in a different way.

55
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:51.910
That being married to a member of the same sex would write,

56
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.010
but I don't want people to have to do it.
But if you're immediate,

57
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.110
we're not forcing anybody.
Right.

58
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.010
<v 0>But I want them to have the option.
If you're a gay person and</v>

59
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.800
<v 1>we sit tight,
don't know.
No,
I mean of course we agree,
right?
Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.770
Illegal and I keep making this distinction because whenever I talk about my

61
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:09.910
moral perspective on things,

62
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.090
then people immediately assume that I'm a theocratic fascist and I just want to

63
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.280
keep underscoring,
yes.

64
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.500
My personal views on Dave Rubin's marriage are of no consequence to public

65
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:21.670
policy in any way whatsoever.

66
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.260
But I agree with you on that and I don't think it should be a part of public

67
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.800
public policy and I think people should absolutely be allowed to marry and

68
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:32.440
divorce and do whatever the fuck they want to do no matter who it is.

69
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.060
But why do you care?
Like as a person who's a rational thinker,

70
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.650
it's pretty clear that people are gay and I don't really think that this is a

71
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.940
decision they make in term in terms of like I'm going to make a clear choice to

72
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.810
defy God and be gay.
I think they're just gay.
But again,

73
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.560
I think that's a confliction.
It's everyone.

74
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.770
It's a conflation of identity and drive with activity,

75
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.430
which is something that religion fundamentally reject,
right?

76
00:03:56.431 --> 00:04:00.190
So religion fundamentally rejects the idea that you are driven to do something,

77
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.160
therefore it is your identity.
Therefore he gets to participate in a behavior.

78
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.070
That's it.
That's a chain of thinking that religion,
religion,

79
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.650
if a man is gay in your religion,

80
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.960
if a man is gay and they're in love with another man,

81
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:14.680
they should just squash those thoughts and find a woman.
Well,

82
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:17.470
ideally they would be honest with a woman they marry and they're not like

83
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.140
bolusing would want.

84
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.860
Ideally you would still get married and have children in heterosexual

85
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.020
relationship.
If you're not up to that,
then you wouldn't get married at all.

86
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.100
When you describe this to a gay man,
they will tell you,

87
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.220
imagine Ben Shapiro,
someone said to you,

88
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.490
you should stop being with your beautiful wife and you need to now marry a man

89
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.870
because this is what God wants you to do,

90
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:45.630
so you're going to have to strip this man and he's going to stop you because

91
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.970
this is how the rules are set up so far.
This sounds pretty terrible,
right?
Well,

92
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.490
this is how it sounds to gay folks when you're telling them they have to find a

93
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.550
woman and like I like,
I'm not saying you have to find a woman.

94
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.890
I'm saying this guy.
I'm saying you can't do X.
Right?

95
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:00.700
I'm not saying you must but say can't,
but by whose determination?

96
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.310
If you decide to participate in this religion,
right?

97
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.490
Then there is a buy in to the precepts of the religion and the buy in is campy

98
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.330
gay?
Well,
no.

99
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:13.120
The buy in is that you can have whatever sexual orientation you please,

100
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:16.690
but there are certain activity you can't participate in,
so you can be gay,

101
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.380
but you can't have gay sex.
Correct.
That's that.
By the way,
that's what the Bible,

102
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:22.030
I mean,
if we want to go direct to the texts from the Bible,

103
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:23.650
it's what the Bible actually says,
right?
I mean,

104
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.100
even the parts of the Bible that people really hate those parts say that a man

105
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:29.740
shall not lie with a man.
It doesn't say a man can't be attracted to another man.

106
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:32.690
That's Old Testament,
right?
Isn't that right?
That's our stuff,
right?

107
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.490
New Testament.
It gets a little harsher in the new testament in some places,

108
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:40.660
Romans Corinthians,
but in any case,
you know,
again,

109
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.430
when it comes to this is what I'm puzzled by is the idea that this is a unique

110
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.570
area of human behavior that religion is supposed to treat differently,

111
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.890
meaning religion traits.

112
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.250
Virtually every human activity like this sin is a failure to abide by a

113
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.950
covenant.
That's what,
that's the definition of sin,
right?
Right.

114
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.640
When you commit a sin in Judaism and Avera and Judaism,

115
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.430
what you are doing is failing to do a Mitzvah,
which is a commandment.

116
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.540
You're violating a commandment.

117
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.410
Well there are lots of commandments that go directly against what people are

118
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.720
driven to do just because of the drive is stronger,

119
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:16.721
does not make it morally more morally non culpable to violate that commandment.

120
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.620
So w w when people pick this one out and they say,

121
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:24.300
well this one is particularly intolerant for example,
uh,
I,

122
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.650
I don't see why it's more particularly intolerant than saying to a man that you

123
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:32.570
have to marry one woman or saying to a Jew that you are not allowed to eat this

124
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:36.530
stuff.
Or you know,
like it's,
it may be harder.
I think there's any question.

125
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:38.150
It's harder to abide by those commandments,

126
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.610
but it is well within religious tradition,

127
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.130
like literally every religious tradition that there's a bunch of stuff you are

128
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:46.490
driven to do that you can't.
Now,
again,
you don't have to agree with my program.

129
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.670
I'm not trying to convert you is one of the nice things about my religion.

130
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.080
I don't give a crap whether people are Jewish or not.
Like we,

131
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.510
we actively discourage convert.

132
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.810
But if you're going to proclaim that you are abiding by traditional Judaism,

133
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.300
this is the buy in,
right?
There's lots of buy and you have to wear a funny hat.

134
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:04.520
Sometimes you have to,
you have to go to shul on Saturdays.

135
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:05.750
You have to keep Shabbat.
Like there's,

136
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.180
there's a lot of buy in and as long as I'm not bothering anybody else,
I,

137
00:07:09.181 --> 00:07:12.800
I frankly don't see what business it is legitimately anybody's what I think

138
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:15.410
about personal relationships.
I'm not imposing my view on anybody else.

139
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.690
<v 0>Well,
um,
I I do acknowledge that all the religions,</v>

140
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.610
Judaism probably makes it the most obvious.
They don't give a fuck what you do.

141
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.690
Go ahead.
Do your thing.

142
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.520
Like they're not trying to prove that you're doing your business side converted

143
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.070
and uh,
when he'd get very,
it was a grind man.
He had to learn a lot of shit,

144
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.360
like three years of a grind.
A long time.
Yeah,
for sure.
It's a long time.

145
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:39.100
So that was the religious

146
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.880
<v 1>perspective on the and the secular perspective when it comes to valuing</v>

147
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:45.280
traditional marriage over over a same sex marriage,

148
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.080
that's a very simple calculation,

149
00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:49.930
which is one type of marriage produces traditional children,

150
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.210
produces children need traditional biological way,

151
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:54.700
and then you have both parents in the house to take care of the kid,
right?

152
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.760
That's the value of marriage and I fully acknowledge that when the value of

153
00:07:57.761 --> 00:08:00.580
marriage shifted from,
it's about production and rearing of children too.

154
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:01.780
It's two people who love each other.

155
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.930
The case for same sex marriage against same sex marriage went completely out the

156
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:05.240
window.

157
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.050
<v 0>Right.</v>

158
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.490
So you are just sticking to your rigid ideology in terms of like what you

159
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:14.240
believe to be a sin and not believed to be a sin based on your religion,

160
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:19.241
based on this very strict moral fiber that this religion is operating in a

161
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:23.600
religious context.
Just to me it applies to my family.
It doesn't apply to you.

162
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.040
Right.

163
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.760
Is there any room for growth in that when people have a better understanding

164
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:33.350
about biology like it,
so if it was proven,
if there's proven like,
oh,

165
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.120
this is why a person develops blue eyes.
This is why a person is gay.

166
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.220
This is why this is nothing wrong with it.
It's just a very,
it's red hair,

167
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.940
it's freckles,
it's gay,
it's straight.

168
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.440
<v 1>Tell me that that homosexual orientation is 100% biologically driven and I will</v>

169
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.900
almost completely agree with that.

170
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:55.090
I think that there's some cases where it's not,
but those are rare,

171
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.520
but it's particularly true by the way.

172
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:59.430
The research tends to show that there's more sexual fluidity among females than

173
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.040
males.
Males.
It tends to be either heterosexual or homicide.

174
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.990
<v 0>Should I research is all done by dudes want their wife to hook up with chairs.</v>

175
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.360
Go on,
tell him,
tell him to stop you.
But let me just show you the paperwork.

176
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.740
But if I'm wrong,
but

177
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.340
<v 1>again,
that it's a question that I've always found actually not particularly</v>

178
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.530
interesting simply because it doesn't take into account the worldview generally,

179
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:27.330
which is that a biological drive does not equal excuse for behaving in a certain

180
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:27.820
way.

181
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.760
<v 0>But that's where it brings me back to this.</v>

182
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:34.140
Like is it possible that these laws in this religion were written when there

183
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:36.660
what?
I mean,
who do you think wrote the stuff?

184
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.840
Do you think people wrote the stuff or do you think God wrote?

185
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.840
<v 1>I think either way,
even if it were it.
I mean,
because I am a an orthodox Jew,</v>

186
00:09:43.841 --> 00:09:47.890
I believe that at the very least it's got inspired and God written.
Right?

187
00:09:47.891 --> 00:09:50.810
But even if I believed on a second level that human beings are at that stuff
too.

188
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:54.310
I think that people 3000 years ago had never seen a gay person before.

189
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.510
[inaudible] like the very reason to have a commandment is because certain people

190
00:09:58.511 --> 00:10:01.150
in your community are behaving in a particular way,
presumably.
Right?

191
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.490
There's no commandment not to take your head and shove it into meat grinder.

192
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.780
<v 0>Well,
this is also the argument against pork.</v>

193
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:07.570
It's because they didn't understand trick hypnosis.

194
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.450
Then understand you have to cook the meat to 145 degrees and pork parasites,

195
00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:13.290
which are very dangerous for people.
So

196
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.240
<v 1>I,
I'm,
I'm not a huge fan of naturalistic explanations for religion.</v>

197
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.560
Do I think that's a good one though for pork?
I mean,
I don't know.

198
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.150
Like I think you could make an argument maybe that

199
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.970
<v 0>died in India and there's horrific x rays of his head.</v>

200
00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:33.420
He had parasites from pork that had gotten into his body and they had a nested

201
00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:34.540
in his brain,

202
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.110
started developing all these cysts inside of his head and they couldn't do

203
00:10:38.111 --> 00:10:42.310
anything about it because it was so deep in his head that if they gave him the

204
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.240
antiviral antiparasitic medication,

205
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.130
it would cause swelling of the brain and then they're like,
it was,

206
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.240
it was so sad I feel about that far gone.
He held the story.

207
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.500
It's actually pig shit.

208
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:58.390
Apparently people accidentally coming in contact with pig shit produces this

209
00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:01.420
particular type of parasite.
Yeah,
that's not kosher.
It's more rare,

210
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.110
but trickle gnosis was pretty common for a long time.

211
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.180
<v 1>There are attempts to sort of paint back into the Bible's certain rationalistic</v>

212
00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:14.470
explanations like this where it makes sense though.
Um,
I,
I think,

213
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.670
<v 0>why else would you,
would it be bad?
He pigs,
like Jesus loves pigs.</v>

214
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.460
Is that what's going on?

215
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.390
<v 1>Uh,
well,
I,
I think that the,
the reversal of the kosher laws in the New Testament,</v>

216
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.100
you know,
from,
from a Jewish point of view,

217
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.510
or we don't believe in the divinity of Christ right there,

218
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.810
you can make an argument that the,
the Gospels,

219
00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:32.690
which were written profit and significant,
no,
no,
no,

220
00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:34.490
we don't even believe he's a prophet.
What do you think he was?

221
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.220
What are you guys doing?
I mean,
I,
what I,
what do I think he was historically,

222
00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:39.440
I think he was a Jew who tried to lead a revolt against the Romans and got

223
00:11:39.441 --> 00:11:40.160
killed for his trouble.

224
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.590
Just like a lot of other Jews at that time who were crucified for trying to lead

225
00:11:42.591 --> 00:11:44.240
revolted against the Roman and got killed for their trouble.

226
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.880
<v 0>So he became legend and story and it became a bigger and bigger deal as time</v>

227
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.470
<v 1>for followers.
And then that gradually grew.</v>

228
00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:55.260
And then do you think they were says rejected?
No,
that's not,

229
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.030
that's not a Jewish belief.
Okay.
I just want to check.
Yeah,
no,

230
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.900
or we're not into American stories.
No,
that's missing it now.

231
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.120
You don't have any miracles.
No,
not,
not.
Not by Jesus.

232
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.450
And they're the ones in the old testament.
Yeah.

233
00:12:06.451 --> 00:12:07.900
You've gotten most of splitting the sea and all that.

234
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.020
What do you think happened there?
What do I think happened there?
Yeah.
Well,

235
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:13.120
I'll go with,
to my mind at d and explanation that there was a,

236
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.370
I mean it says in the Bible there was a strong east wind,

237
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.490
so there's a naturalistic explanation for a physical phenomenon that makes

238
00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:21.221
sense.
I mean,
that's,

239
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:24.280
so that's what my mind is constantly trying to do is read nature back into the

240
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:24.680
Bible.

241
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.240
<v 0>Mm.
Yeah.
That,
that is the problem with these texts,
right?
Is it,</v>

242
00:12:29.241 --> 00:12:32.420
you're trying to decipher translations from original tax,

243
00:12:32.421 --> 00:12:36.350
which are written in h and Hebrew thousands of years ago and were told in oral

244
00:12:36.351 --> 00:12:37.690
tradition for longer than that.

245
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.150
<v 1>Right,
right.
I mean,
this is,
this is where,
you know,
my,
my book,</v>

246
00:12:41.151 --> 00:12:43.820
which I always hesitate to pitch my own stuff because it sounds Gauche pitch

247
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.640
away,
but the new book,
the right side of history,
number one,

248
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:47.980
New York Times bestselling man fiction books,

249
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.560
<v 0>wait a minute.
You got number one in the New York Times bestselling fee.</v>

250
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:52.211
<v 1>Really?
Yeah.</v>

251
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:54.850
We sold enough that we knocked Michelle Obama out of the number one slot for a

252
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.360
week.
So that was nice.
Is there a protest?
Uh,
well,
no protests yet,

253
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.030
but suffice it to say the New York Times book review or didn't like it,

254
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:02.680
but I'm not super shocked by that.

255
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:07.681
But the basic contention that I make is that Judeo Christian values on the one

256
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:11.770
hand and then human reason on the other Greek reason really,

257
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.550
that that tradition is attention and that that tension is where western

258
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:18.730
civilization lives.
That basically civilization is a suspension bridge.

259
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.940
It takes certain fundamental precepts of Judaeo Christian values on the one hand

260
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.030
and then takes Greek reason and they're pulling against each other and sometimes

261
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:26.740
reason feels like it's going to dominate religion.

262
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.020
And sometimes it feels like religion is going to dominate reason.

263
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.320
But in the best of all available worlds,
you have a bridge that is,

264
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:37.180
that is capable of building upon that where you can actually have a functional

265
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.860
civilization.
And if you lose reason in the name of theocracy,

266
00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:44.620
then you end up with tyrannical theocracy.
And if you lose,

267
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.690
if you lose religion in the name of reason,

268
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.630
you end up in some pretty dark places because human beings don't have a very

269
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:53.470
good track record of creating their own purpose,
creating their own meaning,

270
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.840
creating their own systems.
We tend to get very utopian very quickly,
right?

271
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.500
And things get really ugly,
which is sort of the story of the,

272
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.270
particularly the first half of the 20th century.

273
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.810
<v 0>So this is the benefit of sticking to the rigid ideology that's prescribed by</v>

274
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:05.311
religion,

275
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:08.770
is that you don't allow the human beings to keep updating it and changing it.

276
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:12.100
Because if you do,
they will eventually slide into chaos.

277
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.820
<v 1>Yes.
But there's there,
which is not to say there's not play in the joints,
right?</v>

278
00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:18.910
I mean there's certainly religion has morphed over time.
Of course,

279
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:21.190
Judaism as it was practiced originally,

280
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:24.790
probably in many ways does not resemble Judaism is practiced now.
Right.

281
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.280
And in fact,
the Tom Wood even says this,
I mean there's,

282
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:30.410
there's this kind of fascinating and counter intuitive section of the time I'd

283
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.470
wear,
um,
Moses is,
it's,
it's uh,
what is called the to tie,

284
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.490
which some of these stories that are just kind of put into the,

285
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.570
into the middle of the Telmate where Moses comes back and he's watching from on

286
00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:45.460
high as a bunch of rabbis in,
you know,
second century Palestine,
uh,

287
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.050
are,
are talking about Judaism.
And he's like,
I don't recognize any of this stuff.

288
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:51.500
Like I brought down these books,
the mountain,

289
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:56.330
and I do not recognize any of this stuff.
And,
and God says to him,

290
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.440
you know,
it,
God says to him,
right?
I mean,
this is how this is more often.

291
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:02.450
Moses is pleased.
In other words,
he's,
he's not.

292
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.020
Judaism has always had a common law tradition where you're using reason to try

293
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:10.460
and develop the ideas behind the commandments and then try and extend them or

294
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:12.290
broaden them.
And I think that's a good thing.

295
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.940
But you have to be careful not to completely undermine fundamental routes or,

296
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.660
or get rid of basic precepts.
In other words,
you have to,

297
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:23.270
you have to acknowledge there are certain fundamental truths that exist there.

298
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.540
And then there's play as far as how those are implemented.

299
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.620
<v 0>Does Judaism have one of those?
Pray the gay away traditions?
No,
that's not it.</v>

300
00:15:31.621 --> 00:15:34.020
That's not a thing.
I mean it's,
what do they want guys to do?

301
00:15:34.021 --> 00:15:36.950
Like what say what would you do if not better

302
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.580
<v 1>not to,
not to sin but again soon as a soon as a thing that everybody does.</v>

303
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.900
Meaning that masturbation is not,
is not okay.
According to Judaism,

304
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.810
I assume that a vast majority of young Jewish men,

305
00:15:48.811 --> 00:15:51.840
even the Orthodox are masturbating.
So people sit and I mean that's,

306
00:15:51.841 --> 00:15:56.400
that's a recognition.
It's always,
again,
I think I can speak on behalf of,

307
00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.250
I will audaciously speak on behalf of both Jews and Christians here.

308
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.930
I think that religious people are are told that when they say that something is

309
00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:04.530
a sin,

310
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.560
this means that they are looking at scans at the people who are committing the

311
00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:10.080
sin and that is not correct.

312
00:16:10.081 --> 00:16:15.081
I mean what Judaism and Christianity say is that we are all committing sins on a

313
00:16:15.271 --> 00:16:19.200
fairly regular basis.
Where we get uptight is when people start saying,

314
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.990
because I have a desire for the sin,
the sin is no longer a sin.

315
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.510
<v 0>Hmm.
Yeah.
The real problem is like what?</v>

316
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.600
Why is it a sin ACC who says it's a sin?
So again,
who again,

317
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:36.400
this these rules you were assuming are influenced by God,
right,

318
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.870
but clearly written by people.
Well,
the

319
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.620
<v 1>this one you would say if you're a fundamentalist or at least somebody who</v>

320
00:16:42.621 --> 00:16:43.430
believes in the,

321
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.270
the idea that the Torah was given by God was given literally by God.
But again,

322
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.450
that doesn't the logic behind the roles which you know,

323
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:55.340
people like my monities have tried to explicate.
The idea is,
as I said a second,

324
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.590
this you can do without God,
right?
This part he can do without God.

325
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.820
The human sex drive was made to procreate within a stable relationship in order

326
00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:08.600
to pro generate and have future generations of people misuse of that sex drive

327
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.261
in any way,

328
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:13.760
whether you're talking about from masturbation to homosexual activity is

329
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:16.040
therefore a diminishment of the use of that drive.

330
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:19.520
That's the natural law case against,
against homosexual activity.
And again,

331
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.490
I will reiterate for media matters for the 1000000th time,

332
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.520
I'm not in favor of any of this being encoded into American law because freedom

333
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:25.851
is freedom.

334
00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:28.130
People should be able to sit in how they choose so long as they're not harming

335
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:28.820
anyone else.

336
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.361
<v 0>Right?
No.</v>

337
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:33.810
But what about people that have had vasectomies and what about women that also

338
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.350
Judaism is not called this ectomies not cool with it,

339
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.530
but neither is Catholicism from what I understand.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
Well,

340
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:44.810
I'm not a big fan of that one either
then when I have more experience with.

341
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.270
But uh,
so if,

342
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.480
what if a man is in the woman's sterile,
are they allowed to have sex?

343
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:52.683
They both know.

344
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.740
<v 1>So yes,
because there are ancillary benefits to married couples having sex,</v>

345
00:17:56.741 --> 00:17:58.210
like relationship building.
Right.

346
00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:03.100
But that's not a generalized case against the favored view of sex.
Right.
Fit.

347
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.400
That's sort of like arguing that intersex people mean that there's no such thing

348
00:18:06.401 --> 00:18:07.840
as two separate sexes.

349
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.140
There are two separate Texas and also their intersex people who have a
condition.

350
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.210
Yes.
Right.
And that's the same thing here.
The,

351
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.750
the case in favor of heterosexual sexual activity does not change based on the

352
00:18:16.751 --> 00:18:18.820
fact that some people can't actually participate in that.

353
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:24.420
<v 0>What would you do if a young gay guy came to you for advice?
If someone said,
hey,</v>

354
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.030
Ben,
a,
I'm in an admirer of yours.

355
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.380
I love the way you think and follow your philosophies,
but I've got a problem.

356
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.790
I'm a young Jewish man and I'm gay and I don't know what to do.

357
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.200
What would you tell them to do?

358
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.170
<v 1>I mean I can't tell them to do anything.
Right.</v>

359
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.790
<v 0>Advice.
Would you tell?
Would you tell them to not act out on those feelings?</v>

360
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.140
<v 1>I would say you do the best you can as a human being and from my moral</v>

361
00:18:49.141 --> 00:18:51.780
perspective,
you try to avoid sin as best you can,

362
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.360
but everybody's sins.

363
00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.810
<v 0>The problem does that sin though it seems to me that it was defined by people</v>

364
00:18:58.811 --> 00:19:01.930
that didn't understand biology because they were dealing with humans that

365
00:19:01.931 --> 00:19:04.580
existed thousands of years ago.
No,

366
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.360
no understanding of why people were gay.

367
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.360
<v 1>Well,
I mean I again,
I,</v>

368
00:19:08.361 --> 00:19:11.610
I really don't think that biblical commandments are linked and religious

369
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:13.800
commandments generally are linked to a view of biology.

370
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.950
Meaning that you don't think so?
No.

371
00:19:16.951 --> 00:19:21.480
I think that all sin is a recognition that we have drives that we are supposed

372
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:23.990
to forego.
Okay.
That's pretty much,
I mean that's,

373
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.660
that's fundamental to certainly Judaism to Christianity as well.

374
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:30.000
I would say Islam even has,
has this basic precept,

375
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.210
<v 0>right?
When I think we can agree that there's some real benefits to discipline,</v>

376
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.280
has real benefits to having structure.

377
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.830
And it doesn't mean that you can't be creative.

378
00:19:38.831 --> 00:19:42.790
It doesn't mean that you can't be free and do whatever you want some of the time

379
00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:45.700
too.
But I think we can both agree that this is one of the,

380
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.680
one of the best benefits of an ideology and what hopefully a positive ideology.

381
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.090
<v 1>Right.
And one of the things that I,</v>

382
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.760
the reason I keep coming back to the governmental regulation point is because my

383
00:19:56.761 --> 00:20:00.960
view is that if your view of discipline is not my view,
discipline good on you,

384
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.550
right?
Like go,
go do what you want to do.

385
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.340
Like I've never had a conversation with Dave Ruben about,

386
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.050
about him being a gay guy.
Right.

387
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:09.420
But you did say that you like wouldn't go to his marriage.
Right?
Well,

388
00:20:09.421 --> 00:20:11.040
I see it right.
As a,
as a religious person,

389
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:14.670
I can't say I can't actively participate in something that I consider to be a

390
00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:17.030
sin,
but I would go out to dinner with Dave and his husband anytime,

391
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.090
like my wife and I would do that.

392
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.160
Of course we'd have over to our house with his husband.

393
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:20.621
<v 0>Does.
No,</v>

394
00:20:20.621 --> 00:20:23.800
you don't find any contradiction between your religious perspective and your

395
00:20:23.801 --> 00:20:26.470
personal perspective in that regard that you would do?

396
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.920
You wouldn't be there for religious reasons,

397
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.210
but that you would be there for personal reasons.
Like if it wasn't,

398
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.450
would you go to the after party?
Like if you wouldn't go to the wedding,

399
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.313
would you go to the APP?

400
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.040
<v 1>Anything that was a celebration of same sex marriage now.
Wow.</v>

401
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:46.760
So anything but like if we go to the party,
no,
I mean is it,
and that's it.

402
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.400
That there there's a barbecue the next day when a tag

403
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.470
and again like I'm not sure why I'm not a good party person,

404
00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:58.410
so I'm not sure why anybody would want me at their party.
Frankly.

405
00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.150
I'm kind of a buzzkill but haven't been to a party with you.

406
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:03.540
But I went to a dinner party with you.
That's true.
We had a great time.

407
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.800
That was a good time.
That was good times.
That's a funny picture,
man.

408
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.530
That is a wild,
don't know what the fuck to think about that picture.

409
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.700
That is certainly true.
Eric and Jordan and Sam,

410
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.340
you and I.
It's like,
what's your premise?
Just in one place right.
