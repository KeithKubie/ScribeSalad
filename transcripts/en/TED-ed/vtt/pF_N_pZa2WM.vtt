00:00:01.296 --> 00:00:05.624
I'm Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz and
this is "Three Months After."

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:14.635
To want to disappear is
different from wanting to die.

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:21.925
To disappear and to not have
to explain to anyone, to talk to anyone.

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:25.106
To move to somewhere where
no one knows you,

00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:30.406
where you don't have to look 
at a single laughing face.

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:32.686
To elope with this grief

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:34.785
who is not your enemy.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:38.723
This grief who maybe now is 
your best friend.

00:00:38.723 --> 00:00:41.726
This grief who is your husband,

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:47.006
the thing you curl into every night, 
falling asleep in its arms.

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:53.136
Who wakes up early to make you 
your cold thankless breakfast.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:58.378
To go to that place where 
every surface is a blade.

00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:03.596
A sharp thing on which
to hang your sorry flesh

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.737
to feel something,

00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:08.735
anything,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.814
other than this.
