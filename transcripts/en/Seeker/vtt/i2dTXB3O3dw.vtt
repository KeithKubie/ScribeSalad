00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.480
Earth LOOKS flat.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.680
It FEELS flat.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.180
The logical explanation is: the earth is flat!

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.180
Right?

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.180
#facepalm.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.840
But like, once you get past the crazytalk…

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.780
How do we know the Earth IS round?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.210
Welcome back my woke friends, Trace here for
DNews.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.260
If you follow the pervasive yellow journalism
online and elsewhere, you've probably heard

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.160
of Rapper B.o.B.'s beef with NASA, science
and specifically Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.140
astrophysicist and science celeb.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.239
In short, some pop culture peeps think the
Earth is Flat.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.600
Proving them wrong is simple, though it took
hundreds of years for science to figure it

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.600
out in the first place.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.600
how do we know otherwise?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.170
We know the Earth is round by observing it
closely.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.930
If you watch a ship as it disappears over
the horizon, the bottom vanishes first and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.649
then the top disappears later.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.249
It looks like it's sinking.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.400
That's because the Earth is curved.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.059
Using a stopwatch you can do your own experiment
to prove it.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.149
Watch the sun set over the ocean or a open
plain with a friend.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.360
If you stand, while they lay down, each will
see the sun cross the horizon at a slightly

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.543
different time!
how did we first realize the earth was round?

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:08.240
The Greeks first realized this 2500 years
ago, and spent hundreds of years attempting

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.360
to explain it.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.160
First, mathematician Pythagoras looked at
the moon and discovered a curve in the line

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.570
dividing light from shadow on its surface
-- called the terminator.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840
A flat moon would have a straight line!

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.160
The only explanation?

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.040
The moon must be a sphere!

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.390
Sometime later, Anaxagoras, while watching
the moon during an eclipse, realized the shadow

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.390
covering the moon must be from the Earth!

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.520
As that shadow is definitely curved, the Earth
must be round!

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.480
And still later in about 350 BC, Aristotle
noted that star constellations, visible in

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.220
Greece were hidden beyond the horizon in Egypt.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.310
His conclusion, yet again, was the Earth must
be a sphere, just like the moon!

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.550
Sidebar: Notice, humanity knew the Earth was
round 1800 years before 1492 when Columbus

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.550
Sailed the Ocean Blue.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.010
Just debunking some grade school crap.
how curved is the earth?

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.760
Once these great thinkers realized the Earth
was curved, they wanted to PROVE IT.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.820
A Greek astronomer named Eratosthenes figured
it out.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.770
On the summer solstice, the sun reaches a
peak at the top of the sky.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.310
Eratosthenes went to two distant locations
in Egypt on the Solstice and measured the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.220
angles cast by the shadows in each place.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.710
Then, using some geometry he could calculate
the curvature of the Earth between those places!

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.200
From there, he could extrapolate how many
degrees around the circle of the Earth he

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.250
had moved -- ultimately, revealing the circumference
and diameter of the EARTH!! Dang.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.100
Thanks to all these ancient humans we know
Earth is just a bit over 40 thousand km around

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.360
the poles (about 24,860 miles) (which is supported
by modern observations), and knowing that

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.470
we can determine how far the horizon is from
you -- which changes depending on how high

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.560
above sea level you are.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.390
The Earth is curved, and we know it.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.390
Why do these people think this?

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.340
In the end, the problem is Flat Earthers just
don't trust science.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.400
When the Flat Earth Society was founded in
the mid-1920s, the idea was observation trumps

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400
all.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.460
This is called the Zetetic philosophy.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.020
Many skeptics believe the same.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.890
If the Earth looks flat it must be flat.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.750
Often they cry "Prove me wrong!"

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.550
"Only trust your own observations!"

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.700
The funny thing about that argument is that
it was observation that showed us the Earth’s

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.350
curvature in the first place!

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.270
Pythagoras observed that shadow line across
the moon.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.660
Countless people have observed ships sailing
underneath the horizon.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.790
NOT TO MENTION the fact that we’ve gone
to space and observed a very spherical Earth

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.790
from above.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.420
And if you don’t believe all those people
for some reason, make your own observation.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.959
Climb a mountain, watch a ship sail away,
or watch the sun set with a friend.

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.490
And behold an inarguably spherical Earth.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.120
Your move, B.o.B.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.500
Conspiracy theories are just, the best, aren't
they?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.720
Have you ever wondered why people love 9/11
conspiracies?

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.520
Why are we so obsessed with the Illuminati
or which conspiracy theories might be actually

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
true?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.370
TestTube Plus is the podcast/show for you!

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.849
We cover…

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:17.310
Do y'all know anyone that we should make a
video debunking?

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.310
Comments.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.950
Do it.
