00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:05.550
ALAN SEALES: This show is
very unique, and partially

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.170
why I enjoy it so much is
because I feel like this

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.520
is more musicians on stage
versus actors more or less.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.570
I mean, do you guys find
a distinction in that?

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.120
ANDY TAYLOR: Somebody else talk.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.328
JOANNA CHRISTIE: It does
feel like playing in a band,

00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:21.270
for a lot of the show.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.300
But we're all pretty
much primarily actors,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.120
I think, really, that just
play instruments as well.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.680
So I don't know.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.940
There's no distinction.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.315
It's all blurred.

00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:36.190
We're doing what
the show requires,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.930
which is acting and
playing and singing.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.221
ARTHUR DARVILL: On my tax
return, I put actor/musician.

00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:42.240
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.417
JOANNA CHRISTIE: If that helps.

00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:47.000
ANDY TAYLOR: I have to say, I've
done a show-- if you're like,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.833
oh, it's so amazing.

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:50.250
There are shows where the
actors play instruments.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.180
I was in one that
won all the words.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.330
And it was Sam Mendes
who did "American Beauty"

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.380
and it was his "Cabaret."

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.810
And they're reviving
it actually recently.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.310
But that was much more like
a couple of hot Kit Kat girls

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.630
who quit playing
violin in fifth grade.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.390
And then they were
in the band later on.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.890
Whereas these guys
could all-- sure,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.240
we could all actually
play our instruments

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.280
pretty much before
we got the gig.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.260
We've learned to play other
things more, but we're actors,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.160
but all of us have had
that 10-year immersion

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.770
thing where we got
good at something.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.340
ALAN SEALES: So do you enjoy
playing your own instruments

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.150
on stage more than
playing with a band.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.630
ARTHUR DARVILL: Yeah.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.550
I've never been in a band
that's this big before.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.640
I've always had a dream
of having a massive band.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.610
And suddenly, I've got it.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.220
It's great.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.070
And it keeps it fresh and alive.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.720
It's slightly
different every night,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.067
because someone's in a bad mood
or someone breaks a string.

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:48.650
ALAN SEALES: Well,
what happens, then,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.774
if you guys break a string?

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:52.627
Do you just say stop the
show, I gotta' restring.

00:01:52.627 --> 00:01:53.960
PAUL WITTY: Well, we do theater.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.570
We do theater.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.010
We're used to it.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.590
Stuff goes wrong every night.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.110
The audience never realizes
it, but stuff is always

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.300
going wrong.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.530
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.330
PAUL WITTY: And like all the
little things that go wrong,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.704
we hear it, and
we see it, and we

00:02:06.704 --> 00:02:08.830
know kind of what's happening.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.170
But it's all about
improv-ing in that moment

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.646
and staying with it.

00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:15.020
BROWN SHIRT BACK: And there's
contingency plans for that.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.710
Like, if Arthur breaks a string
during the very first song,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.251
there's somebody
else that's assigned

00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:22.200
to pick up that song, to pick
up the guitar on that song.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.800
I mean, there's a
whole list of who

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.490
takes what when a string breaks.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.524
So for the sake
of the sound guys

00:02:27.524 --> 00:02:28.940
not going "who the
hell's playing?

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.906
Oh God," we have an
actual contingency plan.

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:33.875
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:35.500
How many of you guys
are original cast?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.350
Are any of you?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.266
BROWN SHIRT BACK: Yes.

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:42.080
ALAN SEALES: So you
recorded the soundtrack not

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.270
in isolation booths, right?

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.300
PAUL WITTY: Yeah, well, we
did it with Steve Epstein,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.700
was the producer of the album.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.350
And he had just done an album
with Yo-Yo Ma and Chris Seeley.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.790
He did the goat rodeo sessions.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.070
And the way they
recorded that album,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.040
it was like they did
it in like a farmhouse.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.980
And they all sat
in the same room

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.940
and played together, rather than
each being in isolation booth,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.570
listening with headphones.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.559
So Martin, our music
director and Steve Epstein,

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.100
kind of got together
and they decided

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.670
that that's kind of what
they wanted to do with this.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.450
And make sure that it
felt like we were all

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.830
playing together, rather
than playing to a track.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.380
And so hopefully, what
came off was a very kind

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.660
of raw session
sounding-like thing.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.540
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, that was
another question I guess I had.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.540
I was thinking about it.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.090
The music is so raw.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.960
And I think it's written and
designed to sound like that

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.780
and to come together
in that sort of thing.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.290
But it's well rehearsed and the
pre-show music, the pre-show

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.430
that you guys do,
you have set songs.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.790
Do you do the same songs
in the pre-show every time?

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.210
ANDY TAYLOR: Yeah, anybody else?

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.510
ADAM WESLEY BROWN: Well,
we have a rotating list

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.860
of about 20 or 30 Irish
and Czech folk songs.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.940
And part of the cool thing
about, like Arthur was saying,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.190
about being in a band is
that you come in every night,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.280
and right where you
sign in, they normally

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.619
have a list of the songs
that are going up that night.

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.160
So it's like you
come in and find out

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.743
what the set list
is before you go out

00:04:10.743 --> 00:04:11.890
and get on with the band.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.640
DAVID PATRICK KELLEY:
And when we started,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.420
we were asked to bring in songs.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.160
And so we contributed a lot
of them, the things we had.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.259
And you know, the thing
that's great about

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.550
is it gives-- you know,
there've been other shows where

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.761
musicians have played, but
it gives you ownership.

00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:30.510
You really feel like
you're participating.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.220
I know you here at
Google know a lot

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.240
about the strategy
of making people

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.600
feel like they're participating.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.390
And that really helps us.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.420
We own the songs.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.680
We help express the other
characters' emotions as well as

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.690
our own when we
step on to do it.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.550
But the songs, in particular,
in the beginning are meaningful.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.900
If you've brought them in,
and just by happenstance

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.860
they wanted things that
weren't such Irish cliches,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.680
and it comes from John Tiffany,
our director, and from Glen

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.319
Hansard, of course,
the pub culture, where

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.610
people would get in the pub
and if you couldn't express

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.850
your emotions through
words, you could sing it.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.191
And so that's the idea of that.

00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:14.440
ALAN SEALES: Oh, and we have
microphones in the aisles

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.330
if you guys want to ask
questions from the audience.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.455
ARTHUR DARVILL: We'll sing.

00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:18.525
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:05:18.525 --> 00:05:19.400
ALAN SEALES: Or sing.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.899
ANDY TAYLOR: (MOCK
DEEP VOICE) Well,

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:23.710
the problem with that is--

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.850
ALAN SEALES: The choreography,
as well, in the show

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.990
is very, very unique.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.570
And I haven't seen
anything like it.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.400
And I quite enjoyed
the choreography,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.920
How did that come about?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.610
It was a lot of improv
to start, right?

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.310
ANDY TAYLOR: Yes, Steven
Hoggett is our movement

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.670
director/choreographer.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.512
And why are you guys laughing?

00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:46.280
Zygo, why don't you
answer it, Zygo?

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.879
J. MICHAEL ZYGO:
Sure, in the process

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.670
of creating the show--
I'm one of them all.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.100
I feel like I'm hiding
behind everybody-- people

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.850
were asked to
contribute movements.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.640
And all of the movement
is based on the emotion.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.630
It's very rooted in the
motion of everything.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.870
And there's nothing like, you'll
see in "Newsies," where there's

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.715
pas de bourree, turn,
turn, turn, kick, you know.

00:06:06.715 --> 00:06:08.090
ANDY TAYLOR: We're
not "Newsies."

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.033
J. MICHAEL ZYGO:
We're not "Newsies."

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:10.880
ANDY TAYLOR: Cause no one could.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.242
We would put it in
if we could do it.

00:06:13.242 --> 00:06:14.700
J. MICHAEL ZYGO:
But yeah, it's all

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.620
meant to enhance and kind
of embellish upon the music.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.230
And so everything
is really cohesive

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.459
and works together,
so that you never

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:24.000
notice one thing
more than the other.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.259
And everything is just kind of
an accent to everything else.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.050
ANDY TAYLOR: Right.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.475
If I may, Hoggett
broke us up in Boston

00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:33.270
when we did this
workshop and not really

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.228
knowing what was going
to happen with the show.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:39.327
Hoggett broke us up into
groups and said, you're bored,

00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:40.410
you're sitting at a table.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.436
And we can just come up with a
story of a couple of gestures

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:44.810
that you could
teach one another.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.770
And so we would all do
it in our little groups.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.750
And those little pods of actors
came back and taught movement

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.010
to everybody else.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.630
And I'd say 60% or
70% of certain songs

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.020
are all extrapolated from
movement that people came in

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.230
within that little session.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.982
And they were
like, you're bored.

00:07:01.982 --> 00:07:03.940
It wasn't specific, but
then in the bank scene,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.030
when they're trying to
get money from this sort

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.980
of jaded old
banker, they awaken.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.920
Their little gestures that
they make that are very small,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.300
but they're very, very
powerful in capturing

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.460
the emotional essence of
the scene or the music

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.119
in a very simple gesture,
like a classic iconic move

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:22.660
or something.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.220
And it's all from the actors.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.370
ALAN SEALES: Is it all set now?

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.619
ANDY TAYLOR: It's all set now.

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:30.120
But it was found
material from the actors.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.240
Steven Hoggett's has
got a company in the UK

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.500
called Frantic Assembly.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.741
And I don't know, like
15 years or something.

00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:38.240
And it's really established and
really well known in the UK.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.560
And it's totally like
his signature, his style.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.100
If you see all their work
is really similar to this.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.650
It's all like what
Zygo was saying

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.297
about from an emotional place.

00:07:47.297 --> 00:07:49.005
It's not just move
your arm here and then

00:07:49.005 --> 00:07:50.520
it's all right, gut rolling.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.210
It's amazing to watch.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.418
J. MICHAEL ZYGO: And then
one of the other challenges

00:07:54.418 --> 00:07:56.570
was creating choreography
that people could do well

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.445
playing instruments,
like the end of Act One.

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:00.342
That song we just played "Gold."

00:08:00.342 --> 00:08:02.675
Every one of us who was playing
that song and singing it

00:08:02.675 --> 00:08:05.030
is also dancing.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.290
And I remember the first day
I got into rehearsal down

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.800
at the New York
Theater Workshop,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.080
I was the only new guy there.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.059
And they'd all already
established most of it.

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:13.850
And the first thing we
did on the first day

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.880
was started to learn the
choreography for "Gold."

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.020
And I was already intimidated,
but then I looked over

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.020
across the room,
and this guy's got

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.480
a cello strapped to his chest.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.340
And I'm like is that guy
dancing with a cello?

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.490
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.115
J. MICHAEL ZYGO: What
the hell is this?

00:08:26.115 --> 00:08:27.630
ANDY TAYLOR: Not well.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.580
I didn't have to do either
play, sing or dance particularly

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.520
well, obviously.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.630
ALAN SEALES: You
have a cello harness.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.419
ANDY TAYLOR: Yeah, we
kind of invented it.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.450
PAUL WITTY: I want to
tell the story about when

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.110
we were learning "Gold"
in Cambridge and all

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.289
in fear of losing our jobs
because we couldn't dance

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.370
and play instruments
at the same time,

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.054
and Andy was
particularly freaking out

00:08:46.054 --> 00:08:47.470
because he was
like, well, I don't

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.530
want to get cut
out of this number.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.750
He's like I got
a fricking cello.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.150
It's like what am I going to do.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.260
So he had a belt on, took
his belt off, wrapped it

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.460
around his neck and he
tied it to the cello.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.100
And I was like that is baller.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.080
It was so good.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.057
And I was like, all right,
if he can figure out

00:09:02.057 --> 00:09:03.640
a way to dance with
his cello, I think

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.598
I can figure out a way
to do it with my guitar.

00:09:05.598 --> 00:09:07.680
And it was inspiring
to see everyone

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.200
sort of rising to the occasion.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.140
It was a lot of new demands and
we fueled each other that way.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.340
You'd see someone sort of
rising to it, and like OK.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.620
Yeah, I should do that too.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.290
ARTHUR DARVILL: It's
great the moment

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.990
that you-- I'm looking
out towards the audience.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.780
You guys are all dancing.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.340
But as soon as
you start dancing,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.586
I see people just going, oh my
god, look [WHISPERING] doing.

00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:27.127
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
Oh, that's amazing.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.390
ALAN SEALES: You're
saying, the choreography

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.700
represents emotion,
and it represents

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.200
the meaning behind
the songs, right?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.060
So I mean every night,
like show after show,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.340
you do eight shows a week.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.930
I mean, it's got to be
very emotionally taxing.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.900
Because this is about
anonymous guy and girl,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.130
but the whole
ensemble-- you guys

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.690
are all very involved
and onstage constantly.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.240
ANDY TAYLOR: I think that's
an underrated tas-- I mean,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.040
it is trickier than it looks
to just night after night,

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.584
just be sort of detached,
be an audience member.

00:10:03.584 --> 00:10:05.750
ADAM WESLEY BROWN: I will
say that I think all of us

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.210
are big fans of not only
the story that is told,

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.610
but the movie that was a hit,
that won the awards, and also

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.010
Glen and Marketa's music.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.130
I know for a fact that
myself, when I first

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.020
saw the movie years and years
ago, it struck me in such a way

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.230
that I said if there's ever a
show or something like that,

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.640
I got to be a part of it.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.880
But I think it
fuels us each night,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.910
like we were talking about
with the pre-shows set list,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.780
But as well with this
company of people,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.160
I mean, we all love
what we do so much

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.723
and have so much damn fun doing
it that it really never-- I

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.306
mean, sure, It gets
tiring because you

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:42.170
do it eight show a week.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.045
And we hang out with
each other all the time.

00:10:44.045 --> 00:10:45.600
And we get on each
other's nerves.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.800
And it's like a family though.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.560
And it's really
lovely to go out.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.320
I think we're very
blessed in that we

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.410
get to go out every
night and tell the story

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.480
and sing these songs.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.720
And people are so
moved afterwards,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.220
that it kind of keep us going.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.300
I don't think there's
ever a time we go, oh, I

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.552
don't want to go
into work today.

00:11:03.552 --> 00:11:05.135
ANDY TAYLOR: Except
today, apparently.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.970
I mean, most of
the time, I agree

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.540
we usually are really
eager to get to work.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.790
ADAM WESLEY BROWN: Laugh it
up, laugh it up, fuzzball.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.212
Laugh it up.

00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:21.590
ANDY TAYLOR: Sorry, he missed
out on the tour of lunch.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.299
So he missed out.

00:11:22.299 --> 00:11:24.256
ARTHUR DARVILL: I was
going to say the guys who

00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:26.150
started the original
cost of this,

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.290
you've done over 600 shows.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.050
And it's like I've never
done that many shows a day.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.152
I've never done anything
that many times at all.

00:11:37.152 --> 00:11:39.360
DAVID PATRICK KELLY: Yeah,
it's a blessing, you know.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.710
As an actor, for 43 years you
can't-- when you're in a hit.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.104
It's so rare.

00:11:46.104 --> 00:11:48.270
And the thing about this
show is that so many things

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.150
came together, like an
aligning of the stars.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.830
As Joanna said,
Steven Hoggett had

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.252
this company Frantic Assembly.

00:11:55.252 --> 00:11:57.460
They did the same kind of
work with actors and tables

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.970
and chairs for many
years, 20 years or so.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.999
But it wasn't until this, until
something really came together

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:05.290
that was bigger than everybody.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.250
And they all have that
look on their faces

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.440
where we've discovered
something that nobody quite owns

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.700
but we all do beyond all of us.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.140
And Tiffany came when we
moved to Broadway, finally.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.080
We started in Cambridge
with 100 seats.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.150
And then when we were
moved to Broadway,

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.070
he, almost tears in his
eyes, came up to us,

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.840
and said we may close early.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.500
And it may not get very far.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.470
But we've come this far,
and it's really great.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.920
And nobody knew that we
would go on like that.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.550
ALAN SEALES: You
won Best Musical.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.070
DAVID PATRICK
KELLY: Say it again?

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.980
ALAN SEALES: And then
you won Best Musical.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.646
DAVID PATRICK KELLY:
Yeah, best musical.

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:39.650
But the idea of people
playing their own instruments

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:44.920
and telling a story that since
Elvis, since the Beatles,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.230
on and on, blues folks
forever, the drama

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.610
of holding your own instrument
and telling a story there

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.560
is really intense.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.150
And we've known it
for a long time.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.050
And it has this global impact.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.690
I see people on the
line afterwards,

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.160
when we're talking to folks,
from around the world.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.849
And some don't speak English.

00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:03.390
And they're still
moved, because they

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.140
know the iconography
of this images

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.580
there, all the
different characters.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:17.760
And so it's really the
thing that is beyond us all.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.010
ALAN SEALES: Oh yes, question.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.150
AUDIENCE: So, I apologize,
I haven't seen the show yet.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.780
Clearly, I have to go see it.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.822
MALE VOICE: Yes, you do.

00:13:22.822 --> 00:13:25.280
AUDIENCE: I notice it seems
like it's the kind of show that

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.975
would be the kind
of thing you want

00:13:26.975 --> 00:13:29.350
to do in a 100-seat theater,
with like an intimate thing.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.500
What was it like
moving something

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.180
like that, where you're
breaking the fourth wall so

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.596
much, to Broadway
where you've got

00:13:33.596 --> 00:13:36.060
this-- all these people and
all this stuff going on.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.840
DAVID PATRICK KELLY:
Well, we were scared.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.300
We had to have workshops
when they had workshops

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.910
with the vocal coach
to fill that theater,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.000
to try to bus it up.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.250
And once we're relaxed and
got into it, we understood.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:45.790
It was OK.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.150
It was a natural thing.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.520
That's amazing that it really
didn't change that much

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.470
from 100 seats to
this big theater.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.010
It really did not
adjust that much.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.390
A few lines came and went.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.250
Things like that.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.655
But it just sort of
blossomed all along the way.

00:13:58.655 --> 00:14:00.400
And you just had to
adjust a little bit.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.108
PAUL WITTY: At New
York Theatre Workshop,

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:03.430
it was a 200-seat house.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.980
You know, it was very intimate.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.600
And in Cambridge, even less.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.200
I think it was about 100
in that little place.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.230
And so, I mean, all of us were
quite worried about the move

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.070
uptown and into an 1,100-seat
theater and what that was going

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.160
to do to the delicacy and
the intimacy of the show.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.110
But I think, in fact, it
had the opposite effect

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.530
that we felt it
was going to have.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.480
Rather than the show sort of
overwhelm New York Theater

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.200
Workshop, it overwhelmed that
200-seat house, because there

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.550
was so much sort of
happening on that stage,

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.300
even thought it was a
very delicate story.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.130
And I think in the bigger space,
it feels much more delicate.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.667
It feels ooh, look at that
little thing up there.

00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:42.750
ALAN SEALES: I think there's
more energy to share.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.130
Because when I watch it, even
in like the sound check earlier,

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.850
I was stressed out, herding
all you guys together,

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:49.500
straggling in.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.958
And I sit and then all of a
sudden, you guys start playing.

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.295
And I'm captivated by the
energy coming off the stage.

00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:55.060
ARTHUR DARVILL: The
nicest thing about the way

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.729
the play works as well.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.270
I mean, you guys
haven't seen-- well,

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.770
you watched it the other day.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.630
You haven't seen it, but I
watched before I was in it.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.560
And I was amazed by-- you
go to a Broadway show,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.750
and you're like, oh wow!

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.150
It's very funny-- it's
very different to London.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.650
I walked in and the ushers were
like (CARNIVAL BARKER TONES)

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.640
welcome to the
show of your life!

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.780
And you're like oh wow.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.280
OK, great.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.650
We're going to have
a riot in here.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.210
And then you sit down, and this
very, very quiet show starts.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.840
And you're like is
meant to be humming?

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.830
And then you're just
completely sold.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.550
It's mesmerizing.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.050
It's an amazing
thing to be part of.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.540
We kind of play
with that on stage,

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.230
bring you down as far as
we can without people--

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.190
but it's amazing.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.720
You see people just lean in--
you can hear a pin drop--

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.220
and listen.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.530
And when it works-- there's
moments when it really works--

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.875
it's amazing to be--- yeah.

00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:51.750
ALAN SEALES: We've got
time for one question,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.990
then we got to get out
of here unfortunately.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.630
AUDIENCE: This is a question
for Joanna and Arthur.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.660
Just wondering what
I was like coming in

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.797
and being replacements
for the original cast.

00:16:01.797 --> 00:16:03.630
What it was like, if
you had the opportunity

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.497
to reinvent the
characters yourself.

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:07.330
I've seen the show a
couple different times,

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.560
so I know it's a little
different with you

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.680
guys as the leads,
and great, I may add.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.640
JOANNA CHRISTIE: We
had total freedom.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.580
We barely rehearsed.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.080
ARTHUR DARVILL: We
barely rehearsed.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.680
We just learned it and did it.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.625
JOANNA CHRISTIE: John Tiffany,
our director, was amazing.

00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:23.750
We learned and rehearsed
the music back in England,

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.916
while we were waiting for
our visas to come through.

00:16:25.916 --> 00:16:28.500
And then we got two
days notice that we

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.359
were coming, that we
were actually flying.

00:16:30.359 --> 00:16:31.900
So they called us
on Friday and said,

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.310
we booked your
flights on Sunday.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:33.977
We were both OK.

00:16:33.977 --> 00:16:36.268
And then they're like, and
your first show's on Friday.

00:16:36.268 --> 00:16:37.250
We were like what?

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.695
ARTHUR DARVILL: We had two
rehearsals, one [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:38.695 --> 00:16:39.760
JOANNA CHRISTIE: We had two
rehearsals with these guys,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.843
and then the dress rehearsal,
and then we were on.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.080
John Tiffany's very
clever, I think,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.835
because actually we both
found that liberating,

00:16:47.835 --> 00:16:48.595
as opposed to scary.

00:16:48.595 --> 00:16:48.920
We found it freeing.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.640
ARTHUR DARVILL: That's also
like John's very, as a director

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.520
that we had some-- hey.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:08.215
As a director, John is amazing.

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:10.589
I don't know if any of you've
seen "Glass Menagerie" yet.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.050
If you haven't, go and see it.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.880
It's the most amazing--
and it's the same team

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.260
who put together this.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.865
And I said to John
after, so I said,

00:17:18.865 --> 00:17:21.730
how did you get those
guys to act so well?

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.282
And he was just, I
just let them get

00:17:23.282 --> 00:17:28.329
on with it, which is him
doing himself down completely,

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.560
because it's not
as easy as that.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.140
But he has this way of
just empowering actors

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.810
to make you feel like
you can do anything

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.060
and that you can be confident.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.268
JOANNA CHRISTIE: And also
he didn't try and replace--

00:17:39.268 --> 00:17:41.590
I mean, obviously we're both
so different from Cristin

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.790
and Steve anyway.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.880
And I think he was clever
in not trying to just

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.310
find reincarnations
of them as actors.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.480
He just started
from scratch almost,

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.547
and just looked for the
relationship between the two

00:17:56.547 --> 00:17:58.880
characters, as opposed to
trying to find another Cristin

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.380
and find another Steve
and see if it works,

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.550
because it just wouldn't.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.600
And when we were
auditioning-- so

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.450
we flew over here for
our last audition.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:10.974
And we saw the show, which could
have been a horrendous mistake,

00:18:10.974 --> 00:18:12.640
as I was watching
Cristin being amazing.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.580
And I was like, oh God, I've
got to try and do this tomorrow.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.600
But John came to me
before my audition

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.470
and he said, just do
what you did in London.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.190
And so it gave me
the confidence to go,

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.900
OK, I can't try and be Cristin.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.830
I can't do that.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.050
So I just have to have
faith in what I do.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.950
And so, yeah, we were
given a lot of freedom.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:31.950
And that was liberating.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.450
ARTHUR DARVILL: Yeah, the
material can be [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.430
And the character's called Guy
and Girl, you know what I mean?

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.810
I'm really excited about
coming back in 10 years

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.620
time and watching
other people do it.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.560
And I think it's those kind of
part-- you'll still be there.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.242
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:18:47.242 --> 00:18:49.325
ANDY TAYLOR: I'm the only
one with three children.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.549
ALAN SEALES: Well,
we are at time.

00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:57.340
And unfortunately, we
have to wrap this up.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.550
But the show is currently
playing at the Jacobs Theater

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.310
here in town.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.590
Go to OnceAMusical.com
to get your tickets.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.139
And everybody go please see it.

00:19:06.139 --> 00:19:06.680
It's amazing.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.160
The whole show was incredible.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.746
Thank you guys so much.

00:19:09.746 --> 00:19:21.554
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
