00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.650
The First Man to Walk in Space Almost Got
Stuck Out There

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:19.300
That lucky individual was Alexei Leonov, who
was born in the Soviet Union on May 30, 1934.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.699
He was one of the twenty Soviet Air Force
Pilots to be chosen for the first cosmonaut

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.699
group.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.050
Originally, his historic walk was supposed
to have happened on the Vostok 11 mission,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.980
but as that was cancelled; it was later performed
on the Voskhod 2 mission instead.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.280
After eighteen long months of training for
the event, Leonov was ready to become the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.540
first person to walk in space.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.190
The Voskhod 2 launched on March 18, 1965.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.010
In addition to Leonov, Pavel Belyayev was
on board to man the ship while Leonov attempted

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.190
the space walk.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.280
It was the first trip into space for both
of the crew members.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.740
Once in orbit, Leonov strapped on an EVA (extra-vehicular
activity) backpack to his spacesuit.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.420
It provided him with just 45 minutes of oxygen,
which would allow him to breathe and keep

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.080
cool; meanwhile, heat, moisture, and carbon
dioxide would be vented into space via a relief

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080
valve.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.420
VoskhodBelyayev pressurized the inflatable
airlock, which took seven minutes to fully

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.420
inflate.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.979
Everything went smoothly at first and Leonov
spent a total of 12 minutes and 9 seconds

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.380
out on his space walk.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.999
He described the experience by saying he felt
“like a seagull with its wings outstretched,

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.979
soaring high above the Earth.”

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.820
Unfortunately, all good things must come to
an end, and he needed to get back inside the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.439
spacecraft before he ran out of air.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.810
But getting back inside proved to be a problem.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.520
He maneuvered himself back to the airlock,
but then realized that his suit had become

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.700
incredibly stiff.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.759
Due to the lack of atmospheric pressure, it
had bloated with oxygen.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.830
His feet and hands had pulled away from his
boots and gloves, and he knew it was going

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.799
to be incredibly difficult to get himself
back into the ship safely.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.700
There was only one way to do it: wriggle in
head-first while bleeding off the oxygen in

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.700
his suit.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.719
I knew I might be risking oxygen starvation,
but I had no choice.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.310
If I did not reenter the craft, within the
next 40 minutes my life support would be spent

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.310
anyway.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.990
Leonov thought about contacting mission control
about his predicament and let them know about

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.650
the risky thing he was about to do, but decided
not to.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.129
He knew that he was the only one who could
do anything about the situation and he didn’t

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.200
want to worry the people on the ground.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.900
As he released oxygen and exerted himself,
his suit began to heat up dangerously with

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.069
his core body temperature rising 3.2 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.8 degrees Celsius), as he slowly

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.709
clambered into the airlock inch by inch.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.430
Once he was finally in, he had to let even
more air out so he could curl his body around

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.290
to close the hatch, which he eventually accomplished.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.060
At last with the hatch sealed, Belyayev was
able to pressurize the airlock again and Leonov

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.780
made it back inside the spacecraft after the
heart-stopping few minutes of struggle.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.700
On the ground, people had watched the very
first spacewalk, though Leonov’s struggle

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.260
to get back inside the spacecraft wasn’t
televised.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.300
At the first sign of trouble, the transmissions
shown on televisions on Earth “randomly”

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.159
stopped with no explanation, with most assuming
technical difficulties with the broadcast

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.159
feed.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.230
Leonov was thankful they didn’t show his
re-enty, “My family was therefore spared

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.020
the anxiety they would have had to endure
had they known how close I came to being stranded

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.409
in space.”

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.560
Unfortunately, this was only the start of
the problems.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.590
Just five minutes before they were scheduled
to begin re-entry, the crewmen discovered

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.780
that the automatic guidance system wasn’t
functioning.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.680
They would have to land the spacecraft manually
and were also dangerously low on fuel to maneuver

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680
to boot.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.200
To do the necessary maneuvers, Leonov stated:

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.060
Pasha began orienting the craft for reentry.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.560
This was no easy task—in order to use the
optical device necessary for orientation,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.980
he had to lean horizontally across both seats
in the spacecraft, while I held him steady

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.420
in front of the orientation porthole.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.909
We then had to maneuver ourselves back into
the correct positions in our seats very rapidly

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.209
so that the spacecraft’s center of gravity
was correct during the reentry burn.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.249
The difficulty of the landing was compounded
by politics.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:15.920
They had to land on Soviet soil; if they overshot
and landed in China, which had very poor relations

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.019
with Soviet Russia at the time, a potential
international incident could have ensued.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.610
They also had to choose somewhere without
many people.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.460
Thus, Leonov chose Perm, a sparsely populated
area far from China.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.319
It seemed like a safe bet.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.570
However, additional problems started as they
entered the Earth’s atmosphere.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.840
The craft began spinning uncontrollably.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.880
Why?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.710
The orbital module was still attached to the
landing module.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.590
The modules hadn’t fully detached when they
were supposed to, due to a thick communication

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.100
cable connecting the two.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.900
Not only did it throw the landing location
off significantly, but the two craft spun

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.460
around one another, subjecting the cosmonauts
to as high as 10 G’s of force.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.410
So much, that Lenov said that the “small
blood vessels in our eyes burst”.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.050
At around 62 miles high (100 km), the cable
burned up and they were able to stabilize

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.740
and land successfully… in two meters of
snow in Solikamsk on the outskirts of frigid

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.810
Siberia.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.330
Upon attempting to open the hatch, they further
had difficulty after the explosive bolts blew.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.870
Rather than the hatch opening, it was stuck
shut:

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.520
Looking out of the window, we could see the
hatch was jammed against a big birch tree.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.750
We had no alternative but to start rocking
the hatch violently back and forth, trying

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.630
to shift it clear of the tree.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.720
Then, using all his strength, Pasha managed
to push the hatch away from the remains of

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.240
the bolts, and it slid back and disappeared
into the snow.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.520
At this point, Leonov and Belyayev’s families
were told that the two had landed safely and

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.660
were resting before returning to Moscow.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.010
However, Soviet officials hadn’t picked
up on the rescue signal, and had little idea

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.520
where they’d landed or even if they were
still alive.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.699
Lucky for the cosmonauts, a cargo plane did
pick up on the signal and the word of their

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.610
location spread around.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.340
Initial attempts at rescue were made by civilian
aircraft, with helicopter pilots and others

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.030
throwing the two down supplies, including
wolf skin boots and cognac.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.569
(Note: contrary to popular belief, drinking
alcohol in such a situation would make hypothermia

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.539
significantly more likely, rather than it
heating your body.)

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.690
In the end, they ultimately had to spend the
night in a place packed with wolves and bears

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.020
during mating season- when they’re most
aggressive- and where the temperature dropped

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.759
to -22 degrees Fahrenheit (-30 C) according
to Leonov.

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.780
They also had no way to re-seal the landing
module, so simply had to hunker down and endure

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.120
the night.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.340
The temperature problem was compounded by
the fact that their suits had sweat sloshing

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.650
around up to their ankles, along with being
soaked through the inner layers.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.889
We had to strip naked, take off our underwear,
and wring the moisture out of it.

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:53.690
We then had to pour out what liquid had accumulated
in our spacesuits.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.389
We went on to separate the rigid part of the
suit from its softer lining—nine layers

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:03.199
of aluminum foil and a synthetic material
called dederone—and then put the softer

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:07.960
part of the suits back on over our underwear
and pull our boots and gloves back on.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.740
The next day, a rescue crew arrived traveling
via skis, while another came a day later and

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.870
chopped down trees, making a log cabin and
a huge fire to keep the team and cosmonauts

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.870
warm.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.840
They then all traveled nine kilometers by
ski to a clearing where a helicopter was waiting

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.840
for them.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.340
Upon arriving in the town of Leninsk, they
had one last duty: to report on their mission.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.080
Leonov said simply,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.409
Provided with a special suit, man can survive
and work in open space.

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:34.979
Thank you for your attention.

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:37.520
He didn’t go into detail about his brush
with death.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.819
It’s possible that he was told not to; details
of the harrowing mission weren’t released

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:52.319
until much later.
