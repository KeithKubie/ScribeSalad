00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:08.130
There’s a lot of chatter right now in the
physics world that we may have evidence that

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.620
dark matter is Sterile Neutrinos.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.909
Finally I can stop disinfecting my hands every
time I touch Neutrinos.

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:20.880
Hello there viewers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.179
There has been no direct evidence of dark
matter, only things that strongly suggest

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.529
it must exist.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.960
But now however, we may be on to something.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.250
The European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton spacecraft
has noticed an unusual spike in X-ray radiation

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.480
coming from the Andromeda galaxy and the Perseus
Galaxy cluster.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.140
As our own Dr. Ian O’Neill explains in this
article, Atoms and baryonic particles give

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.230
off distinct electromagnetic spectrums, but
this spike doesn’t correspond to any we

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.230
know about.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.930
So something hitherto unseen must be the culprit.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.330
While the discovery is fascinating, I want
to take a minute to explain in depth what

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.280
he means by baryonic particles, because it’s
something that links the very small to the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.740
super-massive.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.850
Be warned, I’m going to have to explain
the basics of quantum mechanics, but learning

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.700
this will make you cool and interesting at
parties.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.140
So subatomic particles are divided into Bosons
and Fermions based on their spin; the Bosons

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.480
have an integer spin, and the ones we’ve
discovered are either 0 or 1.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.280
There are Gauge bosons which carry force;
Gluons carry the strong force, Z and W Bosons

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.460
carry the weak force, and our old friend the
photon carries the electromagnetic force.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.250
Then there’s the Higgs Boson, which comes
into existence when the Higgs field is excited.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.120
It proves that the Higgs field exists, and
the Higgs field explains away some problems

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.480
of the standard model.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.540
With me so far?

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.740
Good, because it’s about to get weird.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.380
That brings us to Fermions, which have half-integer
spins.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.560
Fermions are divided into Quarks and Leptons.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.060
We’ve discovered Quarks have 6 flavors;
Up and Down, Charmed and Strange, and Top

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.060
and Bottom.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.850
How these quarks are combined gives us different
composite subatomic particles, some of which

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.850
you already know.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.880
For instance, two Ups and a Down make a proton,
while two Downs and an Up make a neutron.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.240
These are called baryons, and they react to
all 4 fundamental forces; the strong force,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.149
the weak force, gravity, and electromagnetic
radiation.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.829
Because of that last one, we can observe baryonic
matter directly.

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.019
That brings us all the way back to dark matter;
the theory is that since we can’t see it

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.480
but we can observe its gravity, maybe it’s
non-baryonic.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.129
Now if you were keeping fastidious notes you’ll
notice the Fermion group I haven’t explained

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.250
yet are Leptons.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.629
We’ve discovered 3 charged leptons, one
of which is the electron, and 3 neutral Leptons,

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.450
which are 3 different flavors of the neutrino.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.670
Neutrinos have no charge and very small mass,
making them extremely hard to detect because

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.299
they hardly interact with anything.

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.569
In fact every square centimeter of your skin
gets hit with 65 BILLION neutrinos per second.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.359
But they just pass right on through, like
listless vagabonds.

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.900
It’s been proposed that there is a 4th flavor
of Neutrino, the Sterile Neutrino.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.309
It’s called that because it would ONLY react
to something through a gravitational pull.

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.150
They don’t even react weakly with other
matter like their 3 cousins.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.480
They’d be almost impossible to detect.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.870
But if there’s enough of them, they could
account for the gravity that keeps entire

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.760
galaxies from flinging stars off into space.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.919
And maybe, just maybe, some sterile Neutrinos
are decaying and causing this weird spectrum

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.430
of x-ray radiation.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.840
Or maybe they don’t exist at all and I just
spent the last 5 minutes scrambling your brain

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.059
for nothing.

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.379
If you want to take a step back and review
the 4 fundamental forces again so you can

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.829
get your head around some of this, Trace and
I cover that in this video here.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.079
If you’ve got questions or thoughts on Dark
Matter, I’d love to hear them in the comments.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:39.779
