&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.910
&gt;&gt; Everyone, thank you for coming.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.120
I'm just going to lift
this up a little bit.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.660
Happy Halloween, first of all.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.570
But more importantly,
Happy Founders Day Weekend.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.990
My name is Cait Miller, and I'm
a music reference librarian here

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.090
in the Music Division, and with
Founders Day happening this year

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.330
on a Friday night, we've been
lucky enough to kind of extend it

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.840
into a whole weekend of activities,
featuring both Meredith Monk

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.210
and her ensemble last night, which
I hope some of you were here for,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.090
and today's performance
of music by Pomerium,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.050
which will be very fun
happening this afternoon.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.090
But the fun thing this year
is that the celebration

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.480
of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge
goes beyond two days even.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.620
We're celebrating it all the
way through the end of January,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.730
and that's because of the Music
Division's current exhibit

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.760
on display in the performing arts
reading room across the street.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.230 position:56%
If you haven't been yet, it's on the
first floor of the Madison Building.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.960
Just walk across the street.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.870
It's worth the little walk.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.210
It's called Chamber Music
, the Life and Legacy

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.440
of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.460
I'm up here speaking to you right
now because I was lucky enough

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.420
to get to co-curate the
exhibit along with Robin Rausch,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.010
another music reference librarian,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.560
who is going to join me
up here in a little bit.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.900 position:56%
But when we talked about what we --
I mean, so it seemed perfect, right,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.470
that we would do some sort of
pre-concert lecture this weekend,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.260
and Robin and I talked about it
would be fun to do a little talk

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.560 position:56%
about sort of the difficulty of
taking such a great, impressive life

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.440
and condensing it into an exhibit
where we could only feature

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.210
about 50 pieces and trying
to decide what we would show

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.800
and what we couldn't
fit into the exhibit.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.780
So when we found out about it and
we started mapping out our plan,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.020
Robin and I did discover a
short documentary had been made

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.880 position:56%
in the '90s about Mrs. Coolidge, and
we knew right away after watching it

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.640
that we had to feature it in the
exhibit somehow, and it became sort

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.430
of the centerpiece of the
exhibit across the street.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.740
We got in contact with the
filmmaker, Marjorie Short,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.470
and we're so happy that, A, she
let us use the documentary, B,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.410
that she was willing to let us
put it in the online exhibit,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.520
which is on the Library's website

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.940
so that everybody can enjoy
it wherever you are, and, C,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.950
we're so happy that she was able to
join us today, and she's also going

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.030
to be joining in a
conversation in a few minutes.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.020
So we're going to show
the video because --

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.350
has anyone seen the video yet?

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.570
It's been playing -- was
playing last night, and -- great.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.090
So most of you haven't.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.240
So we need to show
it, and that's great.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.370
But first, I just wanted to give
you a little bit more information

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.880
about Marjorie and how
she came to join us today.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.630
Marjorie Short is an Academy
Award nominated producer,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.260
director, and writer.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.530
She studied literature and drama at
Trinity College, Oxford University,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.640
studied film at the legendary Orson
Wells Film School in Cambridge,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.930
and has an MS in film from
Boston University's School

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.580
of Communication.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.140
She's a graduate of the AFI
Conservatory's Directing Program.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.780
Her short documentary, Kudzu, was
nominated for an Academy Award

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.590 position:56%
in 1977, won 13 awards, and was
screened at numerous film festivals,

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.350
including Cannes and the
New York Film Festival.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.600
With over 30 years' experience,
Marjorie has worked extensively

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.280
in Boston, Hollywood,
and Washington, D.C.,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.440
and she has credits in
television, commercials,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.890
award-winning corporate films,
documentaries, and features.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.050
In 1995, Marjorie was looking
for work in Washington, D.C.,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.770
and she was doing research
at the Library of Congress

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.950
for a new project on
historical music performance.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.690
One of our music librarians,
actually Ray White,

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.940
whom many of you know, suggested

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.540
that she contact a woman
named Cyrilla Barr.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.420
Cyrilla was a professor of
musicology at Catholic University,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.980
and she was ten years
into a biography

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.470
of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge
at the time, the great patron

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.750
of chamber music, who we're
celebrating this weekend.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.240
Marjorie had never heard of
Mrs. Coolidge at that point,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.700
but she was captivated by her
story, especially when she learned

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.170
that Coolidge had commissioned
Aaron Copland's much-loved ballet

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.240
from Martha Graham,
"Appalachian Spring".

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.920
Cyrilla Barr enjoyed the
support of the Music Division --

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.310
of then Music Division
Chief John Newsome,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.080
who believed in the
importance of Coolidge's story

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.690
and wanted it to be told.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.460
She arranged for Marjorie
to meet John Newsome,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.580
and all three discussed
the possibility

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.870
of a documentary film
on Mrs. Coolidge.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.980
Newsome commissioned
Marjorie to write --

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.300
to create an eight-minute
documentary promotional video

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.880
and a proposal and budget
for an hour-long documentary

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.800
on Mrs. Coolidge's life and legacy.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.030
The brief biopic was
completed in 1996,

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.620
and a longer documentary
still awaits funding.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.120
So we're going to play the
film now, and after the film,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.380 position:56%
Robin and Marjorie are going to
come up here and have a conversation

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.010
about the difficulty of
whittling down such a great life

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.080
to an eight-minute video
or a 50-piece exhibit.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.380
So let's watch.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.140
[ Music ]

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.240
&gt;&gt; Appalachian Spring, considered
one of the greatest works

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.820
of 20th Century American Music.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.950
Its premier catapulted
composer Aaron Copland

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.090
and choreographer Martha
Graham to fame.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.210
This magnificent treasure, among
many others, would not exist

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.090
without the greatest benefactor
of chamber music in our time,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.120
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.940
Who was this complex, extraordinary
woman, and what led her

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.510
to become what some call
the great lady of music?

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:11.100
[ Music ]

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.490
Born to Nancy and Alfred
Sprague in 1864, Elizabeth grew

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.380
up on Chicago's prosperous
Gold Coast

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.740
in a family whose fortune was made
in the wholesale grocery business.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:29.490
She was a cherished child,
whose parents firmly believed

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:36.260
in fiscal responsibility and using
one's wealth to support the arts.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.420
Her childhood was spent
surrounded by music and musicians.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.230
She studied piano with Regina
Watson, who was herself taught

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.510
by a protege of Franz Liszt.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.040
[ Music ]

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.690
Young Elizabeth performed
in recitals and longed

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.510
for a professional music career.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.040
[ Music ]

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.200
But she was an upper
class Victorian girl,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.510
and such a public life
was out of the question.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.230
[ Music ]

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.800
Music remained her passionate hobby

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.760
as her parents groomed
her for marriage.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:20.820
Elizabeth was 24 when
she met and fell in love

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.510
with Frederick Shurtleff
Coolidge, a Harvard graduate

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.510
and orthopedic surgeon from
a prominent Boston family.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.290
[ Music ]

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.960
In 1891 at the age of 26,
Elizabeth married Fred in a wedding

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.510
that was the social event
of the Chicago season.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.040
[ Music ]

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:51.520
In 1894, the birth of their son,
Sprague, added to their happiness.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.510
The Coolidge family seemed blessed,
but their joy was short-lived.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:04.040
[ Music ]

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.570
A year later, Fred cut himself
during orthopedic surgery

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:14.240
on a syphilitic patient and became
infected with the dread disease.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.630
He also contracted tuberculosis
and suffered multiple strokes.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.870 position:56%
For 20 years, Fred submitted bravely
to harsh treatments at clinic

frantically sought the latest cure.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.210
[ Music ]

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.100
For 20 years, Elizabeth experienced
the heartbreak of losing the love

of her life inch by inch.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:46.110

As an added blow and an
especially cruel one,

Elizabeth began to lose her hearing.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.550
Ignoring her disability, she
immersed herself in music,

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:07.150
which provided her only solace
throughout Fred's illness.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.850 position:56%
She performed privately with small
ensembles, studied music composition

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:18.800
with respected tutors, and opened
a music school at Upway Fields,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.770
her Pittsfield, Massachusetts home.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:30.340
And then the darkest
period of her life began.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:39.710
Between January 1915 and March
1916, Elizabeth lost her father,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.490
her mother, and her husband.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:52.770
What should have been a joyful
event, her son's spring graduation

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.490
from Harvard and his marriage,

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:01.210
resulted in Elizabeth being
left completely alone.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.740
She was 52 years old and no one
would have questioned her right

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.620
to retreat back behind the
walls of her home and greave.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.810
But Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge was a survivor.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:24.800
Following the example set by her
parents, Elizabeth took control

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.600
of the Sprague fortune,
estimated to be between three

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.860
and four million dollars.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:39.410
One week after her father's death,
she set up a $100,000 pension fund

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:44.140
for the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra in his name and matched

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.240
that gift after her mother died.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.780
Then she donated the family
homes and money to philanthropic

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.930
and educational adventures.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:12:00.940
All as memorials to her
beloved parents and husband.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.250
Because music had sustained
her throughout adversity,

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.010
Elizabeth devoted every day

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:11.790
of her remaining 37 years
to repaying that debt.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:17.680
It became her personal mission
to support music and musicians,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.510
building musicians living quarters,
founding the Berkshire Quartet,

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.840
organizing the first Berkshire
Festival, a competitive arena

live radio broadcasts, free lectures

and universities throughout
the US and Europe.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:48.490
To ensure that her work would
survive after her death,

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.430
Elizabeth perused a unique alliance
with the federal government.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.000
It took an act of Congress
but she prevailed.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.290
that all styles of
chamber music must be heard

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.510
by as many people as possible.

[ Music ]

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:04.240
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge
transformed a modest fortune

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.780
into a lasting endowment.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:17.130
More than that, perhaps,
was her ability

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.300
to transform tragedy into triumph.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.940
And her vision and determination
transformed silence into language

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.510
that needs no translation.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.920
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.770 position:56%
I am Robin Rouche, a music reference
specialist in the music division

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:21.240
at the Library of Congress
and it's my great pleasure

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.050
to finally get to meat
Margery Short.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.450
The film maker whose film
has been leaving people tears

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.340
over in our reading room.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:38.330
Welcome. I wanted to start today by
talking about the biographers craft

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.890
because both your film
as well as Kate's

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:45.420
and my exhibit are
forms of biography.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.750
And the challenges that came

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.780
with doing a very short
telling of a life.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.940
Your film was eight minutes,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:00.390
our exhibit was a little
under 50 items, I think.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:12.300
And how you are -- are able to tell
a story in such a confined way.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:19.810
Biographers are -- what do I want
to say -- the art of biography.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:25.240
It's your subject's life
but it's your story.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.580
You're the one who is
selecting what stories

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.000
to tell and what to leave out.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.820
So, tell us a little bit
about telling the life

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.080
of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.670
&gt;&gt; Well, I, first of
all, owe everything

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.420
to Cyrilla Barr, who
is the biographer.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.680
Who spent, all told, 14 years
researching Mrs. Coolidge's life

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.920
here at the Library of Congress
and also went to Europe and all

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.890
over the US to meat and interview
people that she had worked

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.830
with in the past and
research and archives there.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:04.260
So, Cyrilla -- It was a -- it was
a challenge because, first of all,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.490
John Newsome wanted this film
to be made about Mrs. Coolidge.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.430
So, we started with the eight
and a half minute video.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:17.890 position:56%
And so, Cyrilla and I had to look at
what where the most important things

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.710
about Mrs. Coolidge that
we want the world to know.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.840
If you knew nothing about
her, which I knew --

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.470
I was in that position when I --
Cyrilla told me about Mrs. Coolidge

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.010
and this book that she
had been researching.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:38.600 position:56%
So, we still trying to find the most
important things that, you know,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.000
she experienced was a challenge.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.520
It was a real discipline.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:51.040
We came up with a skeleton
outline covering the major points.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.390
You know, came up, where she was
from, her parents, her background,

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:01.840
her love of music and we built
from there but we also knew

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.790
that this was going to be a video
and that we would need images.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.960
So, we spent weeks at the art --

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:17.590
at the Coolidge collection across
the street looking through boxes

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.990
without white cotton gloves
on and with the help of one

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.260
of our retired -- what's his title?

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.560
Kevin? Is his title?

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.860
&gt;&gt; Kevin Lavine.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.160 position:56%
He was a music reference specialist.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.460
&gt;&gt; A music reference specialist.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.860
So Kevin was our guide
and we would --

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:38.320
were looking for image that we
could use in this little video.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:45.510 position:56%
So we were, unlike your challenge of
having objects, we had to use things

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.650
that could be photographed
-- could be filmed.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.480 position:56%
Either they were already photographs
or they were music manuscripts

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.160
or they were other
objects like music programs

00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.520
and whatever; letters, documents.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:06.600
We spent that time
researching, looking not just

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.020
for the short documentary
but for the long documentary.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:16.130
And we found things that
hadn't been cataloged yet.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.650
They were -- it was
like found objects.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:23.290
It was like "OH my god, look at
this!", and in the process of,

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.540
you know, doing this, Mrs.
Coolidge came to life.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.860
It was like the real
flesh and blood person.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.900
The real living person and her
real relationship with her parents,

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:40.330
especially her mother, who was such
an important character in her life

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.290
and her parents and the wonderful
home and the great background

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.000
that she had through them.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.100
So he was looking for the story,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.770 position:56%
looking for how can we communicate
this and so we came up with a script

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.660
as well, and I actually worked
with a writer on the script.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.700
That was very challenging.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.840
That's where the rubber
really met the road.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:10.690
We're -- okay, have an x number of
minutes, so it's a minute per page.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.330
So we have only so many words
we can put into this script,

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:19.890
and each phrase had to be
anchored to something visual.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.190
So it was challenging.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:26.250
And then -- but this -- but in
our case, I think the discipline

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:33.300
of having that really very
constricted timeframe helped us.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.190
It was like writing a short story,
as opposed to writing a novel.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.750
And people frequently say that
short story writing is the most

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.330
challenging of writing
forms because you have

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.630 position:56%
to squeeze a lot into a small space.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.970
The other thing is that I
knew that with the budget --

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:58.120
the actual budget for this, the
production portion of it was $7500,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.940
which doesn't cover much.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.110
That does not cover much.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.490
John Newsome actually -- the whole
commission was much more than that,

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.620
but the rest of it had to go to
pay me for my time and the effort

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.040
and the work on creating a proposal

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.890
for the hour-long documentary
and the budget.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:24.270
So I was thinking, well, how
am I going to construct this?

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:28.720
So I felt that "Appalachian
Spring" was her most famous,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.430
well-known work.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.180
She commissioned hundreds of works,
but that was the one that was --

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.270
that drew me to the project.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:40.830
And so, I decided to use the
music from "Appalachian Spring"

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:45.190
as the soundtrack of this video.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:52.120
And so, I had to listen to it
many times -- am I -- good --

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.750
and come up with sections
that would work.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:02.060 position:56%
So that was really time consuming
and took -- that was very difficult.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:09.220 position:56%
But that to me was, you know, the --
what I thought would draw people in,

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.670
into this, into her story.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.870
So I think it's just, in
summary, you have to kind

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.450
of know what your parameters
are and what your audience is,

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:25.340
and then you just have to whittle
away at everything until you get it

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.010
down to something that works
and something that fits.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.530
&gt;&gt; And I think using
"Appalachian Spring"

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:39.010 position:56%
as the anchor was really a brilliant
idea because most people don't know

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:43.730
who Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge is,
which is a challenge unto itself.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.860
But they do know what
"Appalachian Spring" is.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.840
So that worked really well.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.250
But you also used other
musical examples too,

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:57.780
and the way that you segued from
one to the other was just seamless.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.320 position:56%
Talk a little bit about how you
selected what other musical examples

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.280
to use in this.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:13.220
&gt;&gt; I think, as I remember back,
Cyrilla was really important

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.460
in that decision process.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:23.570
She's a musicologist, and
we -- she knew, of course,

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.770
Mrs. Coolidge's commissions, you
know, backwards and forwards,

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.220
upside down and inside out.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:32.910
And she also knew what they all
sounded like, what all the works --

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.760
she pretty much had seen
all the manuscripts.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:44.210 position:56%
So we kind of wanted to show a
variety of different styles of music

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:50.010
because Mrs. Coolidge believed that
all types of music should be heard,

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.890
and it -- she didn't
limit her commissions

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.210
to her own personal taste.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.300
She was very committed
to contemporary music

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.650
that at the time was considered
contemporary music, Hindemith

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:08.570
and Poulenc and all the other,
you know, composers that we chose.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.870
So we chose a mixture of
people from the spectrum

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:19.270
of her commissioning
work, and of course --

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.620
and then with "Appalachian Spring",

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.920
but we wanted to have
a variety of sounds.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.300
So I think we discussed
which pieces she thought --

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.610
Cyrilla thought would be
appropriate to consider.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.500
And then we listened to
them, and then we picked --

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.380
actually, we tended to
pick the section that was

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.590 position:56%
at the beginning of the manuscripts.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:48.730
So the manuscripts we also hunted
for in the Coolidge collection,

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.930
and that was an amazing thing too,
to see the actual handwritten,

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:57.340
sometimes cut and pasted
manuscripts.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.640
There they were.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.940
It was amazing.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.780
So what I wanted to do most --

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.760
I think mostly from what I remember
is we picked the opening theme

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.060
of each piece.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:12.000
And so, when the camera panned
across the musical staff,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.850
you're hearing what's written.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:20.300
So then the editing process took,
you know, place, where you --

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:25.150
we faded into -- from one to the
other and also did cross fades

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.700
with the musical scores, just
to kind of give a feeling

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.540
of [excited noises] so much
music, oh, my God, oh, my God.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.440
And even if you can't, like,
read the names of the composers

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.780
or see their photos,
it was like layers.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.410
It was layers.

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.960
That was to give you the
feeling of how much there was,

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.850
and you were only seeing just
a few of the many hundreds.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:53.350
So it was a combination of
coming up with variety and things

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.780
that would work well with
each other that could segue,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:04.710
that wouldn't be abrupt and just,
you know, unpleasant to listen to.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:09.060
&gt;&gt; Okay. I know one of the
manuscripts that's in the exhibit

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.060
across the street is George Crumb's
"Ancient Voices of Children",

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.210
which was written in
1970, which was long

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.600
after Mrs. Coolidge had
already passed away.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.850
But it's been very amusing that
people are fascinated by the white

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:27.490 position:56%
out on that manuscript because
white out is like so retro nowadays.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:28.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:33.210
&gt;&gt; So I know you aspire to continue
with your longer documentary

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.890
about Mrs. Coolidge and that you
have conducted some interviews

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.200
with other people who were --

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.370
who either knew her or
were influenced by her.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.270
You want to talk a
little bit about that?

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.570
&gt;&gt; Sure. Okay.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:49.750
The first one was the
widow, then living widow

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.870
of the French composer
Darius Milhaud.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.290
You've probably -- probably
not familiar with his name,

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.030
but he was a part of
a group in Paris in --

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:02.040
at the early years of the 20th
century called Les Six, The Six.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.250
And they were kind of
rebels and rabble rousers,

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.640
and they kind of shook up
the French music scene.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:16.300
And he was a Jewish composer, and
Mrs. Coolidge commissioned a number

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.870
of works by him and became
friends with him and his wife,

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.860
as she did with numbers
of her composers.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.550
They became her friends.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:30.640 position:56%
And Darius Milhaud has been deceased
for some time, and back in --

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:36.780
after I finished this video, I
started thinking about Mrs. Milhaud

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:41.470
because Cyrilla had mentioned her,
and she was living at the time

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.740
and was 97 years old in Paris.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.660
And so, I -- John Newsome
gave -- got a small grant.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:53.070 position:56%
It was only $2500 to go -- for me to
go to Paris and shoot an interview

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.170
with Mrs. Milhaud while
she was still with us.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:01.080
So I did that, and she talked
about Mrs. Coolidge and how she

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.330
and Darius became acquainted
with her and her impressions

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.500
of Mrs. Coolidge and
some stories about her,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:14.730
and especially how Mrs. Coolidge
enabled them to survive the Nazis

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:21.480
because being a Jewish composer,
he and his wife fled France

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.270
after the Occupation of Paris,
made their way down to Lisbon,

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:29.150
and got onto a freighter, and
made their way to New York.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.020
And Mrs. Coolidge got him a job

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.920
at Mills College outside
of San Francisco.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.290
So he was able to get a Visa
and work during the War.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:44.230
So not only did he survive the
War, but he taught other --

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.950
his students, and one of
them was Dave Brubeck,

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.950
the great jazz composer who just
died recently a couple years ago,

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.950
and he was like 99 years old
or something at the time.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.410 position:56%
Because Darius Milhaud was a --
kind of a [sic] iconoclastic film --

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:05.680
music composer, he wrote music that
had a lot of folkloric elements

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.540
and sort of jazz elements.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.790
So -- and also different
musical rhythms --

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.440
so when you think of Dave
Brubeck, you think of Take Five,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.230
which had the 5/8 time,

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.410
and different mixtures
of time signatures.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.610
But you could sort of -- it's
an interesting connection.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.950
So that was one interview,
and the second one was --

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.170
we're going to see over
here in a minute --

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.750
Gunther Schuler, the late
Gunther Schuler from Boston.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.050
I don't know.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.350
Has anyone heard of
him, Gunther Schuler?

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.650
Yeah? Okay.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.550
Okay. So Gunther Schuler
was, as you know,

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:39.170
a great self-taught
brass music player.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:43.680
He was actually on the classic
jazz album "The Birth of the Cool",

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.140 position:56%
believe it or not, with Miles Davis.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.670
This is like a classic, you know,
record-breaking jazz recording.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:55.260
But he also was a composer and a
conductor, and he's been an author,

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.010
and he was involved with New
England Conservatory for years.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.430
He was the last living person
to receive a commission

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.180
from the Coolidge Foundation.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:06.630
So back in 1997 I asked him if
he would be on my advisory panel,

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.710
which he agreed to do, and then
for the film -- the hour long film,

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.010
which hasn't happened yet.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.080
So, I kept in touch with him
and about four years ago,

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.400
I thought 'Hey, I get to get back
working on the feature again".

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.970
So, then a couple of years
ago, I became very aware

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:29.500
of Gunther's advanced age and I
had this inner voice telling me,

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.980
'You've got to get this now'.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.570
So, a year ago February I
went and paid out of pocket

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.600
to shot this interview with him.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.310
Hired a videographer and he
just passed away at the end

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.200
of June, very, very sadly.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.950
He was in his -- you know, 89
years old and he died of Leukemia.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:50.110
So, when you see him over
here, he's quite emaciated

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.620
and he didn't know -- I don't
know if he knew he was ill

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.120
but he knew something was wrong.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.420
He said, "Oh, I don't
know what happened.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.020
I lost 30% of my body
weight and I'm --

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.600
all my clothes are
hanging off of me."

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:04.120
But we did capture some of
his thoughts of Mrs. Coolidge,

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.740
and I think -- are we
going to look at that know?

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.190
&gt;&gt; We're going to play
a couple minute clip

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.360
of this interview with
Gunther Schuler.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:32:05.690
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I think she was
a very positive [inaudible].

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:14.550
She was -- she didn't
want any praise for this,

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:23.330
and I know that on the other side
[inaudible] to look up to her.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:27.810
I wondered how they
would [inaudible].

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:40.750
I had even seen her at some of
the concerts, including my own,

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.110
[inaudible] work that
she commissioned.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:52.440
I can't even say that
I met her there.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.910
But it could be.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:33:20.350
[Inaudible] getting
a little bit full.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:21.670
But she was -- she did all this
just for the [inaudible] of music

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:23.350
because she was a very good
musician, and what's so remarkable

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.650
about her is that -- and we're
talking now about [inaudible].

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.950
First of all, there was
not a [inaudible], yes.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.250
There were certain
foundations that --

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.550 position:56%
one foundation famous for publishing
works is the Guggenheim Foundation.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.850
They [inaudible] for me, you know?

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.150
And so, now we have so many
publishing [inaudible].

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.450
But anyway, what was
so wonderful about her,

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:33.750
she decided to commission
the music [inaudible].

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.050
When there are [inaudible],
it was [inaudible],

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:36.350 position:56%
as if that was the only [inaudible].

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:37.650
And she played so much
chamber music in her career

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:38.950
as a pianist, she [inaudible].

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.250
But she said, "Well, [inaudible]."

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.550
So that's why she became
the first great commissioner

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:42.850
over [inaudible] years of
chamber music [inaudible]."

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:44.150
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.450
That's great.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.750
She was also one of the
first, if not the first,

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:52.310
important commissioners of dance
music when you look at the dance

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:59.040
that she commissioned, largely from
Martha Graham and Martha Graham --

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.010
the Martha Graham companies
going to be back here

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:05.120
at the later part of our season.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:13.800
But she also commissioned
Stravinsky, Sepal in 1928 was that?

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.890
Yeah. So, she was very important
to dance in America as well.

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:22.030
There is a wonderful letter
that Martha Graham wrote

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.150
to Mrs. Coolidge that's in
the exhibit where she talks

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:31.790
about how important she is
to American modern dance.

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:39.220
I think we're about ready to
move on into what we weren't able

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.000
to include in our exhibit.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.830
So, were going to turn this back
over to Kate and she is going

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.600
to talk to you about some of
the things that we brought

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.970
to put on display over here.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:59.070
&gt;&gt; So, adding onto what
Robin said earlier today.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:02.560
She said that when you're working
on something like an exhibit

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.110
or like Margery's film, you are
selecting what stories to tell

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.650
and what stories will not get told.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:12.900
So, one of the fun things
about doing this project

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:18.130
with Robin was the myriad of
stories that could have been told,

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:22.900
so many important commissions,
so many important performances,

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:27.020
etc. Etc. so what we thought we
would do is put together a little

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.320
display and we have
done that for you today,

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.570
featuring just a couple
of those stories.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.530
So, what I'll do is I'll run
through a couple of those stories

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.020 position:56%
that we did not tell in the exhibit.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:42.260 position:56%
And then I think we'll have a little
bit of time for questions for me,

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.890
Robin and Margery and we'd
love for you to come up

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.580
and take a closer look
at what we've pulled.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:54.350
So, I'll kind of start at the front
of the table and work my way back.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.100
This is one of my favorite things.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:01.290 position:56%
That does show up in the exhibit
but it didn't get quite the emphasis

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.100
that we had first imagined.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.960
Oh and let me bring out my.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.850
Okay. So, I'll change
it in a second.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:28.050
Thanks. The -- we have a collection
called the Prentice Taylor

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.580
Collection that I'd never heard

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.300
of before I started
working on this project.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:37.970
And Prentice Taylor was
a DC born artist who went

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.920
to the Corcoran, studied there.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.570
He spent some time in New York City
during the Harlem Reissuance era.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:49.820
He was friends with Carl Vanvectin,
who actually took this photograph.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.930
He was friends with Langston
Hughes and Aaron Copland.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:57.450
So he had some -- he was friends
with big names in the arts world,

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:02.730
but he was also a regular concert
goer here in Coolidge Auditorium.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:07.510
He came -- we have a
collection of his programs,

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:13.400
and the ones we've brought out are
largely from the 1940s and '50s.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.270
Where -- the fun thing
about these programs is

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.240
that he would actually come
to the concerts and sketch

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.600
out the performances
as they were happening,

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:28.970
and because of that we
have this program here.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:31.930
These are programs that did
make it into the exhibit.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:36.750
This is actually a program from the
1944 festival were Martha Graham's

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.710
dances, including "Appalachian
Spring", were premiered.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:45.240
And that is actually
on the lower right.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.150
That is his depiction
of "Appalachian Spring".

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.720
And above you get Herodias.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.180
It's another Martha Graham ballet.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:58.110
There is that and my favorite
piece, maybe in the whole exhibit.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.110
This is the back of a program.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.100
So you can't see a
title or anything.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.690
This is actually the premier of
Samuel Barber's Hermit Songs,

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.930
and right there is his sketch
of Samuel Barber at the piano

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:14.280
and Lanteen Price [assumed
spelling] premiering the work,

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.170
which just makes me smile
every time I walk by it.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:22.810
But there are plenty of other
programs with similar sketches.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:27.010
Sometimes he turned them
into more finished works,

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:31.230
and he actual gave some of
his sketches to Mrs. Coolidge.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:36.370 position:56%
We have some correspondence were he
expresses how much he loved what her

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.550
concerts brought to Washington,
you know, cultural life for him,

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:46.260
and he wrote an article about his
experience coming to these concerts

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.340
for an American university
publication.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.690
So, that's one story.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:56.180
We kind of envisioned including
many more of his programs,

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.900
but here you get to see them today.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:03.720
The second one will stand out at
you if you look over at the tables.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:09.420 position:56%
There is a charcoal portrait of Mrs.
Coolidge that was done by none other

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.740
than John Singer Sargent.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.120
That is from 1923.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.420
She sought out the work from him.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.310
I was 1923, this was
before she was involved

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.890
with the foundation
here at the library.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.990
He said -- She actually
wanted a painting originally.

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:35.130
And he said, "At this point
in my life I'm not really able

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:38.330
to work on a painting like that.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.810
I do offer charcoals now."

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:45.860
And he said -- you know, and he
listed his price, 100 pounds.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.430
She paid him 105 pounds.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:51.490
We have the correspondence
in the Coolidge Collection,

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.040 position:56%
and it's one of our favorite pieces.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.710
We did not feature
that in the exhibit,

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.320
which seems like kind of a go to.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.170 position:56%
But when you're planning the
exhibit out, it's about so much more

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.440
than just what we want
in the exhibit.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:09.440
You're incorporating a
designer and the, you know,

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.520
interpretive program's office
here, who is, you know,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.260
worried about balancing all
the different parts we have.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.090
But that's kind of an
impossible piece not to leave

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:22.740
out of a display on Mrs. Coolidge.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.970
So we're happy to bring
it out today,

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.480
and last night we had
it out as well.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:32.280
Oh, and the other thing I wanted
to say about this and how it fits

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.100
into our current exhibit, this
is a letter that if you go

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.580
across the street,
you'll see in the exhibit.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.430
This is from Carl Angle.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:45.520
He was the Chief of the Music
Division when Mrs. Coolidge kind

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.030
of came on the scene in
the '20s, and they started

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.320
up this partnership
working on commissioning

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.610
and taking care of the foundation.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.870
But it really developed into
this wonderful friendship too.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.240 position:56%
They both had great senses of humor.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.760
They had nicknames for each other,
and one of the nicknames that came

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:08.750
about comes from the slogan
for Michelin Tire Company.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:12.140
Their slogan was "Il
boit l'obstacles",

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.870
French for "It eats obstacles,"
and he said, "You eat obstacles.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:19.800
I think this describes
you perfectly."

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:25.420
So she would call him Michel,
and he would call her Lina,

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.840
so it's kind of this Michelin.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.890
And right here, we have a
letter that he wrote to her,

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.840
and he drew a little
portrait of both of them

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.980
as little Michelin Men figures.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:42.890
And next to it, it actually says,
"Almost as good as Sargent."

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:46.080
But you will have no idea what
that means if you just come

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.050
to the exhibit because
you don't see the Sargent.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:52.490
So you get an insider peek at that.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.230
Then on the table, we wanted
to acknowledge today's concert

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.080
and the programming of early music.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.130
If you were at the concert
last night, you know,

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:07.080 position:56%
that celebrated Mrs. Coolidge's
interest in new voices and new work.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.180
But we also acknowledged
before the concert began

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:15.140
that she was very much, you know,
in love with early music too.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:21.350
In 1925 at the first ever
Festival of Chamber Music, a group,

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:26.130
the English Singers, that
specialized in early English music,

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.990
she invited them to come perform.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:32.540
So we have a signed photography,
which is lovely, next to it.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.090
We have some correspondence,
some telegrams,

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:39.040
kind of making the financial
arrangements for this visit.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:44.860
We have the check that she wrote
to the English Singers for $998

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:50.220
for a two-week visit to
the States and the program

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.340
from that concert as well.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:57.830
Next to that, I also
included an advertisement

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:01.810
for a lecture series
by Edmond Fellows.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:07.500 position:56%
If you don't know Edmond Fellows, he
was a British -- he was a clergyman.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.740 position:56%
He was a member of the -- or
clergyman for the Church of England,

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.940
but he was also a renowned
music scholar,

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.310
and his emphasis was early music.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:19.650
And he often worked with groups
like the English Singers.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:23.870
In 1927, Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge invited him to come

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:29.980
and give the first ever musicology
lecture in Coolidge Auditorium,

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.710
and that's another story.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:36.750 position:56%
I mean we didn't really touch on the
early music interest in our exhibit.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:40.440
That's kind of another story
that gets overshadowed a lot too,

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:47.230 position:56%
is that is the contribution she also
made to music scholarship as well.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:52.170 position:56%
When Oscar Sonic, another, you know,
early Chief of the Music Division,

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:57.730
when he passed away, he was really
passionate about American music.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:03.270
And she set up a scholarship
fund for American music research.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:08.580
So again, another story that
won't come out in the exhibit,

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.910
but is worth more exploration,
and Cyrilla Barr has an article

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:16.730
about that -- about
that strain as well.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.830
Then at the very end, we also
included some programs of some

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.570
of the concerts that the
foundation did sponsor overseas.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.690
It wasn't just all
happening in Washington,

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.770
D.C. She would not have liked that.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.510
She wanted as many
people as possible

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.980
to enjoy the benefits
of chamber music.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.090
So that meant going
across the country.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:42.300
It meant going to France, Germany,
Mexico, et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.250
So we have some of those
on display as well.

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:48.130
Let me check on time.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:53.390 position:56%
Okay. So I think we have a few
minutes to open it up for questions.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:58.240
If anybody has questions for
Marjorie about the film or Robin

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:02.070
or me about the exhibit,
we would be happy to do --

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.680
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I have
a question [inaudible]

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.950
&gt;&gt; I think there's a
mic coming for you.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:10.880
&gt;&gt; I have a question that's
totally out of ignorance,

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.600
but where you informed
about her through diaries

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:21.100
or mostly letters back
and forth over the years?

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:26.950
Who, kind of gathered or made
sure that that was all saved?

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.250
Was that her son?

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.570
&gt;&gt; Who gathered the collection?

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:37.480
Do you want to speak to that?

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:43.020
&gt;&gt; Once the foundation was
set up here at the library,

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:46.590
there is Coolidge Foundation
papers but her --

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:49.330
Cyrilla Barr, who wrote
Mrs. Coolidge's biography,

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:52.560
worked very closely
with family members.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.840
And in fact after Cyrilla's
biography was published,

00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:00.290
Cyrilla gave us additions
to the Coolidge collection.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:02.190
And so it's --

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:04.310
&gt;&gt; [ Inaudible Comment ]

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:07.480
&gt;&gt; Things that were actually
written by Mrs. Coolidge.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.780
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:18.320
&gt;&gt; Correspondence is
in the collection.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.620
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.810
&gt;&gt; Hi. I just think that we
should acknowledge that we have

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.430
in the audience here two

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:27.380
of Mrs. Coolidge's
great granddaughters,

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.460
Peg and Josie Windship.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.760
Who are here.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:38.540
I hope they're getting an idea
of how revered she is for us.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.280
And I was wondering whether they
wanted to share any reflections

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.620
or stories of their own
about their great Grammy.

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:46.920
&gt;&gt; Oh please.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.220
Please.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.520
&gt;&gt; Before that, we
are soaking this up.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.820
It's incredible.

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:52.120
I mean, I just learned
something, Marjorie,

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:56.370
in the film that I had no idea.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:58.930
So, and I -- thank
you for that question

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:00.830
because I actually
had a similar question

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:03.240
because I know actually my cousin,

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.310
another great grandson,
a photographer.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:09.300
He donated a lot of
photographs, I think.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.880
So, when she gave the commission,

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.540
all of her papers were
-- that was part of it.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.650
Granting all of her papers or.

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:25.550
&gt;&gt; Part of the deal with the
foundation commissions was

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:30.690
that the music manuscripts we would
get a copy of the music manuscript

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.110
by these composers
in their own hand.

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:38.190
So, those were coming to us
into our collection that way.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:41.030
That speaks to the music
manuscripts themselves.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:44.140
&gt;&gt; And her personal
letters, probably.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:48.710
&gt;&gt; And the correspondence
around the commissions as well.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:52.040
And a lot of that was
done by the current chief

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.680
of the music division at the time.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.410
There is actually.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.710
&gt;&gt; Many avenues.

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.010
&gt;&gt; There's actually
related correspondence

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.010
in other collections that we have.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:04.320
&gt;&gt; And more can trickle in from us
because I have an incredible dress.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.430
So, that's got to be
part of it, with silk,

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.650
beautiful pink silk
slippers, the whole thing.

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:11.950
It's just amazing.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.760
But I had a question before
giving it to my sister.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.700
Marjorie, how do you want to expand

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:21.060
and hopefully you will
be able to soon?

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:27.080
&gt;&gt; Well, the funding comes first.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.570
Well, hopefully I'll get some --

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.190
enough funding to go and shoot
the interview with Cyrilla.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.220
Cause she is quite
elderly now and not

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.680
in good health and
living in Wisconsin.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.640
So, I'm just going to be doing --

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.770
capturing the interviews with the
important figures including you

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.070
family members.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:47.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I was thinking more thematically.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:48.590
I mean, yeah.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:50.970
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, thematically,
I'm just going to be --

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:54.600
put Cyrilla first to gather
everything she's got, you know,

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.940
that she can put on video.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.090 position:56%
And then I'm just going to go
around and use this as a frame work,

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.590
my eight and a half minute film.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:10.310
Do a like a kind of a
strait forward, I think,

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.270
chronological telling of the story.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:18.360
And I have this == I have
outlined specific things I want

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.440
to cover in my proposal.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.630
So, this, you know, the basic --

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:28.990
everything that was in
here fleshed out and more.

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:35.610
More stories about, you know,
her life and people that knew her

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:41.460
and her importance as a female,
as a woman patron of music.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.890
Which there are very few and
why she is not more known.

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:52.950
And, yeah, I'm going to just
basically flesh it out, you know.

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:54.540
And I'm trying to think
of what else.

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:59.840
Yeah, that's kind of it.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.140
Yep.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:05.510
&gt;&gt; And if someone wanted
to contribute to your,

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.630
you know, how would they do it?

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.600
Do you have a -- would
it be through?

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:14.910
&gt;&gt; Well, I have a -- I'm in
the process of getting a 501c3.

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:18.710
I have a 501c3 organization
for my other music project

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:20.390
but I don't have one for this.

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:22.240
So, I'm in the process
of setting one

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.720
up because this would be
considered non-profit funding.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:30.550 position:56%
So, for people to get a tax
deduction for a charitable donation,

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:33.440
it has to go through a 501c3.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.470
So, that's in the works.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.600
&gt;&gt; Good. I just wanted to add.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.830
Growing up knowing about this huge
figure, our great grandmother,

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:50.740
what most impressed me was that
coming from you know wealth,

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.280
and then going through the tragedy
of all the death she experienced.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.300
Her husband and her
parents and that --

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.890
that she set it up and was really
serious about it being free.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.060
That everyone who came
would have, you know.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.020
So that, you know.

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:12.440
I just know -- have always been
impressed and proud that she wanted

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.300
to share music with
absolutely anyone,

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.960
no matter what their
economic situation.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:25.030
&gt;&gt; She was also really adamant that
the Coolidge Auditorium be wired

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:30.330
for radio broadcast because she
wanted the concerts to be heard

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:32.220
from everyone's living room.

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.990
Yu didn't have to be
here to listen to it

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.160
and that was met with opposition.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:42.270
But she fought for it and she
won and we have a transcript

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:47.020
across the street in the exhibit
of a little speech she gave

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:50.260
on the radio before a radio
broadcast and she said,

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.930
"I have two things to say
to all of the, you know,

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.790
listeners who've written.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:57.090
Thank you."

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:58.390
And she says this lovely thing.

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:02.720
She says, "To NBC, I
say, 'I told you so'."

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:07.380
&gt;&gt; The other story we heard
growing up was that she would sit

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.610
in the Coolidge Auditorium
with a huge;

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:13.200
I don't know what you would call
it, a trumpet thing to her ear

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.790
because she was practically deaf.

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:18.060
You know, then she
would sit in the front.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:20.560
She was quite a figure
sitting there.

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:27.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; One thing that my mother told me,
which I don't know how true it is.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.380
I know Cyrilla touched on it
but which really impressed me.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.950
She actually did not --
my mother said this now,

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:37.180
it needs to be verified.

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.920
She really didn't like
contemporary music, Chamber music,

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.720
really didn't like it, but
said you have to invest;

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.030
you have to support the art form.

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:52.100
And I've heard people say that
she was called the fairy godmother

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.400
of chamber music.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:58.660
I think, I don't know where and
if -- how broadly that was used.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:02.980
But -- and I was her -- because I
have some of her musician friends,

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:06.970
who were just blown away
by what they played so many

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:12.170
of the compositions she had done
and she really saved chamber music

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:14.790
by supporting the new art form.

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:16.400
&gt;&gt; I'll add two things to that.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.800
At this letter at the
top it says DFQ

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.380
and that stands for
Dear Fairy Queen.

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:27.130
And then the other thing about
new music, we include this quote.

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:29.870
It's my favorite quote that
I found in doing the research

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:32.250
and this is included in the
introduction across the street,

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:35.900
but Mrs. Coolidge wrote
and said in a speech once,

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.530
'My plan for modern music is
not that we should like it,

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:43.110
not necessarily that we
should even understand it

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:47.670
but that we should exhibit it as
a significant human document'.

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.850
I think that's pretty amazing.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:56.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah, can ask about maybe
addressing you two as well as,

00:53:56.730 --> 00:54:02.010
I guess, Greg was your grandfather
than, about the music in the family

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:07.850
and what the legacy of the music
actually, you know, playing and.

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:12.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thanks.

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:17.230
My sister and I play
the guitar and sing

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:20.960
but I grew up folk music and yeah.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.920
I really had no classical
training what so ever.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.220
I grew up hearing it.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:30.080
My grandfather and his wife, my
grandmother, played quartets all

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.120
of the time and would meet
with people, informal quartets.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.560
He -- I was told -- couldn't
judge it at the time.

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.620
He was a scientist, a
chemist, at Harvard.

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:42.920
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.180
&gt;&gt; Oh, we'll talk.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:49.120
&gt;&gt; And he apparently played
like a scientist, very exact.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.030
He was really quite a ridged guy.

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:56.340
I think, you know, another side
of Mrs. Coolidge is she sent him

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.270
to a school when he
was really young.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:03.100
Not sure how much nurturing he
got, I'm sure he was loved but,

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.680
you know so, anyway,
that's my memory.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.980
Do you, Joe?

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:11.600
&gt;&gt; Well, I want to
leave a few minutes.

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.150
So that you all can come up and
see some of the display up close.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:20.150
I just want to say thank you to Peg
and Josie Windship for being here.

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.760
Thank you to Marjorie
for being here.

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.430
Thank you to Robin
for working with me.

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:32.700
And my last thing is please go
see the exhibit across the street.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:36.030
It's up and until January
23 and then it will go

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:39.740
to LA Walt Disney Concert Hall.

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.880
So, if you're in LA you
can go check it out too

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.550
but come here while it's here.

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:44.850
So, thank you all.

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:49.550
We'll be by the tables if
you have more questions.

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:53.210
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
