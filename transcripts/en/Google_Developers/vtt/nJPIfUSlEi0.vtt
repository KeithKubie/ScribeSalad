00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.890
PAUL SAXMAN: Hello everybody.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.770
Welcome to this week's Google
Maps developers office hours

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.610
or Google Maps Developers
Lives.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.440
I'm Paul Saxman and--

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.880
MANO MARKS: I'm Mano Marks.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.700
PAUL SAXMAN: And this week--

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.840
yep, Mano you don't need an
introduction because we were

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.150
just talking about you
are the face of maps.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.130
But in any event, so this week
we're going to just rattle

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.240
through a bunch of updates this
week, or actually that

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.480
happened over the
last few weeks.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.720
There's been a lot of things
going on in the Google Maps

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.680
Developers world.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.390
And we just want to make sure
that you guys are well aware

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.860
of everything that's
been going on.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.580
Just to kick things off and get
going, very first thing is

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.770
the More than a Map.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.130
Last week we talked about
it at the Google

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.980
Maps Developers Live.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.070
Luke and Chris were here to
give a talk about the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.430
technology behind it.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.200
If you haven't seen the site,
it has a lot of great

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.920
information for developers.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.080
Particularly, if you go
to the site you can

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.100
see quite a few demos.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.310
Now we have demos of
a lot of the core

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.080
features of the Maps API.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.610
Including things like Satellite
Imagery, Street

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.740
View, the routing of places,
and data visualization.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.100
Each of these has a really
nice feature set

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.520
that you can go over.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.730
In this case, in Places API,
you can see searching in

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.760
different locations.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.330
You can search on different
types of information.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.500
Everything is centered around
a certain geographic area.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.380
So I don't think this
demo does it.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.160
But switching my search
type I can find--

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.610
this one does still
say centered--

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.790
but restaurants, lodging.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.930
The Places API has quite a few
different place types.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.310
Other samples that we have in
here, other demos that we have

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.520
in here, we can go over
to satellite imagery.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.070
Really, really interesting
site, if you

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.440
haven't seen it already.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.160
The cool thing that Luke and
Chris talked about last week,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.840
if you weren't there, was that
this actually uses one map for

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.090
actually all of these demos.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.740
So that's a really nice tid
bit for developers to know

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.440
about, because you can actually
reproduce the same

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.450
thing instead of re-loading the
map every time somebody

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.840
accesses the page.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.920
You can actually keep it running
in JavaScript in the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.255
background.

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:28.620
MANO MARKS: They don't want us
to tell you this, but that

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.150
reduces your map loads.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.030
MANO MARKS: Oh yeah,
that's the implicit

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.580
benefit of all that.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.970
So in addition to the demos,
be sure to check out the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.980
developer stories.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.510
These are actually pretty
inspiring stories.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.145
I'm not going to run any of them
now, but they're really

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:46.230
good stories about developers
using the Maps products and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.820
doing things benefiting their
community, and what they think

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.730
about the APIs.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.910
So the site is morethanamap.com,
if you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.290
haven't seen it yet.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.620
Next up we have--

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.660
actually I'm going to
go off my tabs--

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.430
the Google Places API
Developer Challenge.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.560
Just today, actually,
we updated the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.460
timeframe for the challenge.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.780
We've actually gotten quite a
few good submissions so far,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.435
and I think--

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:22.540
well, actually I didn't
mention it

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.080
last week at the GDL.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.970
But yeah, we've gotten quite a
few good submissions but we're

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.550
looking to actually collect
a few more.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.890
Some of the feedback we got from
developers was that they

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.080
just need a little
bit more time.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.680
So the new time frame is
November 30th for getting the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.480
applications submitted.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.430
And the voting is actually
bumped into December.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.750
So December 12th through
the 31st is going to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.660
be the public voting.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.110
We will have a website
up for the public to

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.890
actually use to vote.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.320
The important part about this,
as a developer, if you're

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.340
submitting something to
the challenge you

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.580
need a YouTube video.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.530
So be sure to put a quick
YouTube video together and get

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.280
your submissions in.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.090
Voting by the judges continues
through the first of the year,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.230
or January 11th.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.300
And then the winners will be
announced at the end of

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.000
January next year.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.630
So if you're not familiar with
the challenge, I think we

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.290
talked about it last week and
a couple weeks before.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.355
But check out the
developers at

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:21.800
google.com/places/challenge.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.010
All the links, More than a Map,
Places Challenge, all the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.600
other stuff we're going to talk
about today we'll put

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.580
them in the comments in
the YouTube stream.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.100
So don't worry about
writing them down.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.750
Next up, couple events
coming up this week--

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.000
actually, this upcoming
weekend.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.180
Actually, me and Brendan
Kenny are going to be

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.200
at the DevFest West.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.060
And that's this Saturday and
Sunday at, actually, the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.800
Google Campus.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.510
If you want to attend, it
appears that there's still

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.770
quite a few tickets available,
six tickets.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.080
They're $5 a piece.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.780
Seems like a pretty good deal
to come hang out with us on

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.270
the weekend.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.355
Brendan and I are going to be
talking about big data and

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:05.180
Google Map.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.060
So how do you get large amounts
of data on a map.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.950
Specifically that's going to
be talking about heat maps,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:20.420
symbols, and canvas layer,
which is a library that

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.500
Brendan and Mano have
been working on.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.410
We had a GDL a few
weeks ago talking

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.550
about the canvas layer.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.850
It's a really cool technology
for using WebGL

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.100
on top off a map.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.210
And Mano, you're going
to be someplace else?

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.580
MANO MARKS: I'm going to be
at DevFest Silicon Valley.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.980
Which will be Friday
and Saturday.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.570
I'll be there on Friday.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.680
I think they're still updating
their schedule.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.170
That's more of a hackathon
focused DevFest.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.990
I'll be talking about basically
the same stuff.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.760
I think I titled it differently,
like the new

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.480
advanced features
of the Maps API.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.970
But it's basically the
visualization and canvas

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.900
layer, heat map, symbols
that sort of stuff.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.660
So that kind of stuff I think is
really exciting, and really

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:20.060
makes Maps API in the browser
just so much more useful.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.260
If you can get to DevFest
Silicon Valley, I will be

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.770
there on Friday.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.480
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, so there's
registration right here, big

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.340
green button.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.740
And looks like it's--

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.890
MANO MARKS: Looks like
there's still spots.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.460
PAUL SAXMAN: Still slots
available, so yeah.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.250
So Brendan and I are
on Saturday.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.320
I think it's at 10:30 AM
at the DevFest West.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.350
And you're going to be talking
on Friday at--

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.830
MANO MARKS: I think it's
going to be 2 o'clock.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.740
PAUL SAXMAN: 2 o'clock, cool.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.230
All right, moving on.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.750
What do we have next?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.150
Google Developers Academy.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.000
MANO MARKS: So Google Developers
Academy launched

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.900
right around I/O this year.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.510
And we now have four courses in
Google Developers Academy

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.510
for Google Maps.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.110
We haven't really done any
big announcements about

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.570
this up until now.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.900
So we're pretty excited
to show that off.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.870
There is a course on getting
started with the

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.120
Google Places API.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.030
One on customizing Google Maps,
changing the color,

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.750
styles, marker, customer
markers, that sort of thing.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.750
We have one on importing data.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:41.750
So essentially how to use JSONP
and XML HTTP requests to

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.900
bring in your own data.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.030
Some very basic JavaScript
stuff, but really essential

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.490
for people who are learning both
JavaScript and the Maps

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.650
API at the same time.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.610
Which is a pretty
common thing.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.360
And then finally, there's one on
the visualization using the

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.110
symbols and heat maps that
we've been talking about.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.440
So these are some
great courses.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.050
We'll put links up to
them in the comments

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.950
on the YouTube video.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:20.600
And yeah, so check these out.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.330
These are kind of unknown.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.200
We haven't gotten very many
hits, because we haven't done

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200
any advertising yet.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.810
But they're up and ready
for you to go on.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.740
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, and as Mano
mentioned, actually I did the

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.460
Google Places one before
I was actually on the

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.590
Google Places team.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.840
That was around I/O time.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.960
Actually, I got a lot of
questions when I was joining

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.470
the team about using the auto
complete service with the

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.360
Android application.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.760
So we do have an Android
sample in there.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.660
And really another interesting
thing, so

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.540
the visualizing data.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.390
If you can't make it to one of
the talks that we mentioned

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.910
earlier that's going on this
weekend, you probably want to

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:02.480
check this out.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.970
Because there's going to be
a little bit of overlap.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.440
But definitely if you can make
the talks, we'd definitely

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.020
love to have you there.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.120
And actually these other ones,
I should probably read a

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.630
couple of these.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.900
I'd probably learn
a thing or two.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.260
So moving on.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:19.710
So yeah.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:20.970
So the other thing--

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.510
I think it was two GDLs ago--
we talked about some updates

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.220
to the Google Places API.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.990
Specifically, we have
query auto complete.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.990
So Query Autocomplete, it's an
autocomplete service like the

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.510
pre-existing autocomplete
service where you

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.250
provide an input box.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.180
And as the user types into the
input box, the service

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.670
actually will display up to
five autocomplete results.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:53.700
And the existing autocomplete
API returned only addresses.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.770
Or actually, you could
specify types.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:01.350
So you could return addresses,
places, or the like.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.040
The new service actually, the
Query Autocomplete, this is an

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.310
extension beyond the
existing service.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.010
It actually includes search
terms as well, or query terms.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.800
Let me zoom this guy
in a little bit.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.030
So a classic example that we
always have is pizza, because

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.610
a lot of people search
on pizza.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.820
So you can see here
that we have--

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.510
actually this is just
a query term.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.140
So pizza is the query term.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.280
We actually have places
returned.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.590
And actually it looks like these
are also terms as well.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.303
So we interweave popular query
terms with popular places so

00:10:33.303 --> 00:10:35.870
you can put these in an
autocomplete box.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.370
The results, actually, that you
get back from the service

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.600
is a list of places.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.380
So these are places that matched
the key word pizza, as

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.650
opposed to matching a
particular place.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.580
So it looks like here we all
have restaurants, but wonder

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.840
what's a good search term that
would be both restaurants and,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.260
let's say, grocery stores.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:55.460
MANO MARKS: Well,
I don't know.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.050
But you are looking in Sydney.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.780
So I don't know if
kangaroo would?

00:11:02.608 --> 00:11:04.880
PAUL SAXMAN: No, looks like
they don't have many.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.030
In any event, we'll see if we
can come up with a good demo.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.350
Take a quick peek at the code.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:14.710
Let me just switch over
to my IDE here.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.160
So the codes are pretty
straightforward.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.860
Just like you the autocomplete
service, you

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.150
provide your input box.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.580
So here's where we're actually
getting the input target down

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.100
here, the text input.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.130
You actually pass that to the
search box service, or the

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.560
search box class or object, and

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.160
provide a callback function.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.570
So as the user types this in
the callback functions--

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:46.150
or actually as the user submits
the search, your

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.420
callback function is
made or called.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.490
And here you can see we're
just creating markers and

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.950
we're placing the markers
on the map.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.570
The interesting thing about this
is it is actually using

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.780
the place image.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.900
So the places service returns
images for places.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.310
And that's based on the little
icons we saw earlier.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.470
And it's also positioned
by the geometry

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.650
of the place itself.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.860
So pretty straightforward.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.890
I mean, this whole sample that
we saw is 84 lines of code,

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:25.550
including the map code.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.110
The other addition to the Google
Places API that we

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:36.950
released recently was the
autocomplete data service.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.140
So this actually works a lot
like the autocomplete box or

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.480
the search box.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.830
Except that you actually get
access to the data before it's

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.920
actually rendered into
the input box.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.490
So previously, with the search
box or the autocomplete, is

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.230
you just provided a text area
and it does the actual

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.100
rendering of the selection
last or the list of

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.480
predictions.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.200
Here, you actually
get to render

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.320
the predictions yourself.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:11.300
So if I do, let's say, 1600.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.090
So here you can see this looks
a little bit differently.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.930
That's because this
is actually being

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.820
rendered by our code.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.150
And all we did here is we just
highlighted the search term in

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.690
the Query Autocomplete
results.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.770
So the nice thing about this is
A, you can actually do what

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.570
we're doing here highlighting
the code.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.760
You can actually control
what the prediction

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.740
selection looks like.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.570
But B, you can also interweave
your own results.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.250
So if you have information
that you think is more

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.550
relevant to what we're
returning, or you want to

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.600
actually include that in the
autocomplete results, you can

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.200
feel free to do so.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.750
Code for that is, likewise,
pretty straightforward.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:53.670
I had these backwards.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.850
Data service.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.820
So again, this time you create
the autocomplete service.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.870
And you provide a callback
listener.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.260
And that callback actually gets
the list of predictions.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:11.970
So the predictions are the list
of places, essentially.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.230
And then you actually
can display

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.880
those however you like.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:21.250
And here, so all we're doing is
we're taking the callback

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.610
or the results and we're
highlighting and putting them

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.720
in the div to display them.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.950
What else is interesting?

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.800
This one the sample is a
little more complex.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.270
I think it just has a
little more styling.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.885
We had to go through all
the styling of the

00:14:34.885 --> 00:14:35.930
autocomplete box.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.610
And then also, you have to
control what happens when the

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.260
user clicks on the prediction.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.610
But pretty straightforward.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.910
We'll post the links to both
of these samples in the

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:52.520
comments or in the description
for the YouTube video.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.700
And Mano, you're up.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.590
MANO MARKS: So we had
two more launches.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.360
The first one here
is time zones.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.570
So this is a new web service API
that allows you to query

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.770
Google servers.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.980
You pass it a UTC timestamp and
a latitude and longitude.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:17.060
And it returns back to you
information about what the

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.170
actual time was at
that location.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.780
So I've got a couple
of links here.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:27.330
If you click this particular
one, for instance, it shows

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.860
you what the offset is
from Standard Time.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:36.390
So this is Los Angeles
and the raw offset is

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.000
in seconds, I guess.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.870
So you just pull that,
divide by 60, and you

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.860
get number of minutes.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.310
And then 60 again, you
get number of hours.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.250
So this is a common request.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.070
So that's what it looks
like in JSON.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:57.210
And then you can also get it
back in XML if you like, if

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.150
you prefer that.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.000
You see the information there.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.480
And of course, we also
pass back to you

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.130
the time zone names.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:12.900
So we decided to do this
because we got a lot of

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.430
requests for it.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.380
People want to know what
the time zone is at

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.610
a particular location.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.840
And it's fairly complex, because
time zones have lots

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.660
of different rules,
and they change.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.170
When daylight savings time is,
or whether they even support

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.500
daylight savings time, and what
not, and in all sorts of

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.090
different ways.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.320
And then there's crazy little
townships that don't support

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.220
daylight savings time.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.770
So when things shift, that one
town stays an hour later or

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.660
earlier than somewhere else.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.910
So we just keep track
of all that for you.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:55.800
And like most web services,
it's limited to

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.240
2,500 calls a day.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.130
And if you have Maps API
for Business, it's

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.720
100,000 calls per day.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.810
PAUL SAXMAN: That's an
interesting point I should

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.730
have brought up about the Query
Autocomplete and the

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.957
data services is that actually I
think those were a couple of

00:17:11.957 --> 00:17:16.700
the top developer requests
that we picked off and

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.950
implemented.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:23.980
So one thing I always think is
always a little curious about

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.569
our services is we actually
don't JSONP wrap our results.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:29.650
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.680
PAUL SAXMAN: So what
do you do for that?

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.260
Is this also part of the
JavaScript library

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.240
for the Maps API?

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.640
MANO MARKS: No, I don't
believe time zones is

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.030
currently in the JavaScript
library.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.570
It's web services only.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:48.450
But you can run it server side,
and pull it, and then

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.230
send it back.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.340
PAUL SAXMAN: And potentially
also put your own wrapper

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.550
around it so you if you want it
in your JavaScript code put

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.520
a JSONP call around it.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.210
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.980
So the other thing that
we launched--

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.840
and this is for enterprise
customers only--

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.450
we added traffic conditions
to driving directions.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:14.730
So if you take a look here, I
don't know if you can actually

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:23.616
zoom in on the traffic
conditions.

00:18:23.616 --> 00:18:26.091
PAUL SAXMAN: You drive.

00:18:26.091 --> 00:18:28.550
You drive on our driving
directions.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:35.020
MANO MARKS: So basically the
section I'm highlighting here

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.250
just says about one hour and 22
minutes or one hour and 26

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.460
minutes in current traffic.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.680
This sample happens to be in
Australia, so there's not a

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.330
lot of traffic there
right now.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.560
But it gives you, based on
current and historical

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.540
traffic, estimates.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:55.000
Whether if we're getting current
traffic conditions or

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.920
based on what we know
about that at a

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.470
particular time of day.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.710
So it's pretty powerful.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.690
And actually the code for
it is very simple.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.630
The same standard creating a
driving directions, which is

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.710
available to everybody for your
enterprise customers.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.465
And then you create a driving
directions service and pass it

00:19:16.465 --> 00:19:18.880
a request with a bunch
of options.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:25.000
And you'll see here, all you
have to do is highlight one

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.670
particular option here.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.990
You add in this duration
in traffic true.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.905
And it passes that
back to you.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.300
That's traffic.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.390
And I think that wraps
up our wrapping up,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.710
our round up here.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.560
We're super excited.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.570
If you want to see more of these
things as they're being

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.240
launched follow our Google
Geo Developers blog.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.850
And also, we announce things
on our Google+ page.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:07.330
And usually something goes out
on our Twitter feed as well.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:08.870
That's all I've got.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:09.660
PAUL SAXMAN: That's
everything.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.600
So check the description.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.820
We're going to post
all the links.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.030
And if you guys have any
questions, also you can post

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.670
in the YouTube comments and
we'll see if we can get back

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.570
to you on those.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.020
MANO MARKS: Right, or post
on the Google+ page.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.820
And we'll answer
those as well.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.390
All right.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.030
PAUL SAXMAN: Thanks
for joining.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.280
MANO MARKS: Thanks for joining.
