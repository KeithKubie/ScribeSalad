00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.860
Hmm, I’d say mine is pretty short, but thick.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.150
Sometimes textured...

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.150
Talkin about the HAIR, people.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.520
Hey there, hairy humans, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.519
There are so many different types of hair
– wavy, straight, fine, thin, thick, curly,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.630
bushy, wiry…

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.679
Some people’s hair is easy to comb, while
others are constantly battling a tangled mess.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.939
But is there really an advantage to having
a certain type of hair?

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.440
We’ve talked a bit about why we have hair
at all in another DNews video, but needless

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.440
to say.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440
We have it.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.710
Fur and hair is the same thing.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.000
All mammals have hair, including us.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.210
Hair is composed of keratin, a fibrous, resilient
protein that gives hair its strength.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.710
The keratin protein is made up of long chains
of amino acids bonded together, the most abundant

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.710
of which is “cysteine,” which is able
to form strong bonds with itself, called disulfide

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.710
bonds.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.890
That’s important because where these bonds
accumulate on the hair shaft influences the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.480
shape of the hair!

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.410
For example, in curly hair, the protein builds
up more on one side of the hair, causing it

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.330
to curve, whereas in straight hair, it’s
distributed more evenly throughout.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.110
There’s even a condition called “uncombable
hair syndrome” involving a gene mutation

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.500
that doesn’t allow keratin to bond to the
hair shaft correctly causing extremely dry,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.680
frizzy hair and endless tangles.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.760
But, keratin isn’t the only thing that changes
hair type, the shape of the hair follicles

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.630
--- the structures in your skin that grow
your hair -- influence its shape and thickness.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.180
Larger follicles produce thicker strands of
hair, smaller follicles thinner strands…

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.180
makes sense.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.560
But, if the follicles are say, oval-shaped,
or asymmetrical, then the hair that comes

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.930
out of them won’t be perfectly round; instead
it bends to one side, producing curls.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.390
Think about it like gift-wrapping ribbon---when
you run scissors along one side, it’ll curl.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.110
It’s a similar principle with an asymmetrical
follicle – one side is flat, the other curved,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.980
resulting in ringlets.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.590
Frizz and texture are often associated with
curly hair because natural oils secreted by

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.720
your scalp can’t move down the hair as easily.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.840
Those oils trap moisture in the hair -- which
is why humidity makes curly hair even more

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840
frizzy!

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.970
But there’s definitely one advantage of
having curly hair – and it’s not what

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.220
you think.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.230
Curly hair actually tangles LESS than straight
hair.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.230
Yep!

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.720
A study published in the American Journal
of Physics found that the angle at which straight

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.440
hairs bump into each other is most likely
to cause tangling.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.590
See, the outside of your hair -- called the
cuticle -- consists of a series of overlapping

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.080
keratin cells, like shingles on a roof.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.810
If the hairs meet at a sharp angle, the cuticles
hook onto each other.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.810
Although straight hairs meet less often than
curly hairs overall, when they do, they tend

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.940
to meet at steeper angles and thus are more
likely to hook and tangle than curly hairs.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.120
We all have different hair, but there’s
not a hard evolutionary reason why.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.280
Though there are a bunch of hypotheses as
to how we got it.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.500
Like one 2013 study in the journal Cell which
found a specific gene mutation that causes

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.550
thicker hair.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.200
It emerged 30,000 years ago in central China,
later spreading to Africa and Europe.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.040
That same gene mutation also had other effects,
such as increasing the density of sweat glands.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.130
The researchers believe that high humidity
in East Asia at the time may have given people

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.880
with the mutation an advantage because they
could sweat more efficiently, and perhaps

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.720
thicker hair simply propagated as a side effect
of the gene.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.940
Another study in the American Journal of Human
Genetics identified two genes which cause

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.300
curly hair in European descendents, but even
they say the exact point when curly hair evolved

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.599
is unknown.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.910
More research is needed to see what other
factors could have been involved.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.640
But whether you’ve got stick straight strands
or corkscrew curls, hair is completely individual

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.520
– so embrace what nature gave you!

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.930
And remember: it’s the size… (of the follicle)
that matters…

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.340
I hated my hair for a long time until I figured
out how to take care of it.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.920
It was a process, but now, I love it!

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.050
Or, what’s left of it…

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.670
Want to know more about hair?

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.060
Here are five weird uses for it...besides
just keeping your head warm.

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.939

with patients.
