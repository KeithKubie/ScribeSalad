Ohm J. Gore

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.920
OHM: This is Ohm Gore from the United States,
a global change maker here on behalf of the

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.650
British Counsel. I am confident that global
growth will be restored in 2009 because growth

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.289
and effective economic performance is a measure
of confidence. With old leaders and old ideas,

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.590
we didn't have much confidence; well we did,
but now we lost it. We have, in my country,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.099
in the United States, we have a new administration.
An administration that's ready to fund infrastructure

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.210
projects, pump cash into the econonmy, but
also have regulations that both insure that

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.270
executives are not able to swindle markets
as they have in the past, but also insure

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.430
that the American people, in fact the citizens
of the world, feel more confident about what

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.200
their govenment is doing, what's going on
on Wall Street and in their local economies.
