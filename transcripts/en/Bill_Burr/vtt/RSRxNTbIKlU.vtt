00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.040
you haven't those fucking conversations. Oh,

12
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:48.840
the holidays are over and it's back to the grind. Sit in traffic.

13
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:52.140
Go into your cubicle. I think I'm going to kill my boss

14
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.700
<v 2>if I don't drive into the wall. Um,</v>

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.160
and I actually had a fucking panic attack. Not as semi panic attack.

16
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:03.210
Sorta like I fucking nose dives into a bit of a depression. Yes.

17
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.810
They just stick another fucking year. Here we go. Here we go again.

18
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.380
Here we fucking go again. Uh, we have a,

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.980
a mechanical problem with the aircraft.

20
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.710
We're just going to pull over here or the, uh, tarmac.

21
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.240
We have a landing light that is uh, in operable at this moment.

22
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.160
We're going to sit tight here and wait till a, the mechanics come out here,

23
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:32.350
which I do not have a estimated time on at this point, but a well,

24
00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:33.830
we will get some better information. We'll act,

25
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:36.440
get back to you as soon as he can add dad till then.

26
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:40.070
Now it's getting me apologize for the delay at a, uh,

27
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.050
just trying to sit back and like, especially kid a,

28
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:43.310
I've got to try to keep the air on.

29
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.840
I apologize if it gets a little hot back there now the fucking year or that

30
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.460

31
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.770
It's the getting the, getting to the shows. Um,

32
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.530
oh God. People taking their fucking shoes. I look,

33
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:03.140
if you take your shoes off and you have socks on, I fucking get it. All right.

34
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:05.300
Just don't rub your feet together. I've talked about it.

35
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.110
Perform [inaudible] can you not rub your fucking feet together? Foot, foot,

36
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.340
foot, foot, foot, foot. It fucking drives me nuts. That just,

37
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.870
I just want to punch the back of the fucking chair. Um, anyways,

38
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.150
<v 0>uh, what is going on with me? I'm going to be on the cow calling</v>

40
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.190
I'm going into Netflix today and we're going to do our little song and dance and

41
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:36.191
pitch them our season arc for a season two.

42
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.250
Basically. Uh, that's what you do after you do the first one. And they go,

43
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:43.640
hey Yo, we're pretty good. Pretty good, but now where are you going to go?

44
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.310
Where are you going?

45
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.180
<v 0>Go with it now and then you've got to get on the IEE yet. Dah, Dah, Dah.</v>

46
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.130
I want to do the doodle. He does this. She does that.

47
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.100
Give it some more fucking money please.

48
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.300
<v 2>And they go, we'll think about it then. Yeah. Everybody walks out going,</v>

49
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.230
I think they look, you think we're good? I think we're good. I don't know here.

50
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.150
When should we? Here? Tuesday, Wednesday at the latest.

51
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.570
We wanna thank everybody for a rat flat, a friend of Sky's here today.

52
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.921
Fortunately,

53
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:16.840
we're adding a little bit of weather in the Dallas Fort Worth area.

54
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.130
Who number 72 in line. Um,

55
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.560
unfortunately is really nothing we can do here. Be patient,

56
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.530
we try and make up some title in the air. You'll trust Loulou faster. Um,

57
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.210
part a little more fuel. We can try and put her own hole in the ozone layer,

58
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:41.740
you know, another year of that. But you know what else?

59
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.120
You know sometimes, you know, I don't know.

60
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.370
Every once in a while I just fucking drive down the street.

61
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:49.120
I just see a homeless guy laying on the sidewalk sleeping, you know?

62
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.060
And as much as uncomfortable as it, you just looking, just like, you know,

63
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.040
I would fucking love to do that right now.

64
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.030
Just pull over and lay down on the ground and take a fucking nap.

65
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:59.800
Now I don't want to live outside.

66
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.430
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

67
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.000
<v 2>And granted,</v>

68
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.990
I know that that homeless guy is sleeping during the day because at night that's

69
00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:07.940
when the people come up out of the sewer drains,

70
00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:11.630
like in fucking a escape from New York, you know,

71
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.960
cause they have to feed. So when you're homeless, you gotta be up at night.

72
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.220
You know,

73
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.070
a lot of people is Bob taking a nap in the middle of the fucking afternoon.

74
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:24.020
That's because at night, right, he's having like a fucking,

75
00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:26.720
you know, a two by four fight fighting off.

76
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.420
Right. He's dealing with that shit. So, uh,

77
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.790
but I liked the nap part of it. I'm actually looking at the homeless guy's life,

78
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:44.770
the way a woman looks at a man's life. Like, that looks fine. I want to do that.

79
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.020
I don't want to pay the price for it, but I'd like that in my life.

80
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.540
Equal rights. Oh,

81
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.110
I am in a fucking mu. I'm

82
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.970
alright. I go on Facebook because I'm an old white guy. I love,

83
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.380
I love the Facebook. I absolutely love it. I didn't give a fuck.

84
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.820
Even if I delete my account,

85
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:14.821
they never deleted because of that creepy [inaudible] who I judged by the actor

86
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.110
who played him. I don't even know what the real Zuckerberg looks like.

87
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.750
Said his name. Oh, I fucked up the other day.

88
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:25.380
I said Lamar London instead of Lamar Hunt. He was the original owner of the,

89
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.820
of the, uh, Dallas, Texas. Lamar Lundy was part of the fearsome foursome.

90
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.840
And what's funny is that's the fucking name I can never remember.

91
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.890
You know when they go name the first and force them, I'm always like,

92
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:41.130
Oh I Rosie Greer, Merlin Olsen.

93
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.920
Aww. Deacon Jones.

94
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.933
<v 3>Okay.</v>

95
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.090
<v 2>And</v>

96
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.973
<v 3>yeah,</v>

97
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.550
<v 2>Lamar Lundy's like the bass player in a huge band. Right.</v>

98
00:05:56.551 --> 00:06:00.380
You can never the bass player, you know, unless they're really, if they're,

99
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.800
unless they're like one of those front man bass players like Steve Harris,

100
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.460
you know, Billy sheen and you know,

101
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.750
back in the day John and to whistle, you know,

102
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.920
or they play in a trio cause then you only have to remember three names.

103
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:17.780
But if they play in a band of four or more people,

104
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:22.760
you just can never remember the bass player's name. You know Lamar Lundy.

105
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.640
Is that alright? What's,

106
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.300
what's the front floor for the Steelers? I don't think I could name that was me.

107
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:33.140
Joe Green LC. Greenwood. Dwight White,

108
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.410
Eh, uh,

109
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.080
<v 3>yeah.</v>

110
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.160
<v 2>And the Bass player. What the fuck was his name? It's a great name too. Oh,</v>

111
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.960
it's a fucking shame. I'm, I'm going to have to look that up.

112
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.500
I have to look that up. Like you can't disrespect the fucking 70 Steelers.

113
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.600
They went forward. Oh, and titles. You can't, you can't disrespect the team,

114
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.720
you know, clues. Fan Base. I'm not going to get into an area where we goes,

115
00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.673
<v 3>okay.</v>

116
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.350
<v 2>Steeler's front for, there's a bunch of people in fucking, uh,</v>

117
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.640
is a bunch of people in Pittsburgh right now screaming at their fucking

118
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.520
the steel curtain. Who were they?

119
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.070
<v 3>Okay.</v>

120
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.770

122
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.630
Ernie Holmes. It just got me down in I, Ernie Holmes. You know,

123
00:07:30.631 --> 00:07:34.650
he's going to be at least six, five. Um, anyways,

124
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.650
they don't have any man's names left anymore, do they?

125
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.060
This is coming from a guy named bill. Won't you come Home Bill Bailey?

126
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.003
<v 3>Okay,</v>

127
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.130
<v 2>let's go back here. What did I want? Oh, here's what I wanted to talk about.</v>

128
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.240
The, uh, the Los Angeles Rams.

129
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.300
It's a St Louis Rams slash Los Angeles rams slash

130
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.680
Cleveland Ramps. Hi. Slash Cleveland Rams.

131
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:04.580
They're coming back.

132
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:08.750
They're coming back.

133
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.240
I'm so psyched that they're coming back.

134
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:16.241
I'm so psyched that it was the rams and not the chargers or the Raiders there.

135
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.710
Aes. I'm so fucking excited. Okay.

136
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.990
La does not need the chargers or hey,

137
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.580
we don't need a stay away. Okay.

138
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.050
La needs the rams.

139
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.143
<v 3>Okay.</v>

140
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.180
<v 2>Blue and yellow. The Rams, the Los Angeles Rams.</v>

141
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.740
That's what they need. They don't need, they don't need the fucking,

142
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.590
they don't need to bring the Raiders. But if you bring the Raiders back,

143
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.250
the city of Los Angeles, if you bring the Raiders back,

144
00:08:50.251 --> 00:08:54.660
you're basically signing off on the fact that someone's going to get stabbed or

145
00:08:54.661 --> 00:08:56.490
shot. It's just, it's a fact.

146
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.400
Just watch the 30 for 30 on the fucking Los Angeles Rams, the one that ice cube,

147
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.860
uh, narrates the way he's talking and all that shit. It's fucking,

148
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:10.560
it's actually inadvertently like hilarious.

149
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.830
It's just the level of like,

150
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:16.510
<v 3>okay,</v>

151
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.300
<v 2>La doesn't need you, don't, you don't fucking need it. Somebody's to like,</v>

152
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.580
they can't handle, they can't handle those colors.

153
00:09:21.581 --> 00:09:23.380
They can't handle the pirate on the side of the,

154
00:09:23.381 --> 00:09:27.220
keep it in fucking Oakland where people just dress up like it's going to be a

155
00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:31.600
musical. And even then somebody got shot at a fucking 49ers. Raiders,

156
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.620
like a pregame thing. You don't need it. You know, it's funny,

157
00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:39.460
everybody always talks about the Philly fans and how east coast fans. Oh,

158
00:09:39.461 --> 00:09:42.700
Yankees, red sox. It's nothing compared to out here. People die out here.

159
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.380
Guy went to a fucking Dodgers game with this kid and head on a giants Jersey and

160
00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:50.380
he had, he has brain damage for the rest of his fucking life.

161
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.300
Cause this fucking two,

162
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.290
two guys jumped up while his kids sat there and watched.

163
00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.990
That was in a fucking baseball game. The rams.

164
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.790
That's it. Hi. Where are the rams? Perfect.

165
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.860
<v 3>Okay.</v>

166
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.060
<v 2>You don't need the autumn wind was a raid.</v>

167
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.470
You don't need to bring that to the inland empire.

168
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.620
[inaudible] you don't need to do that. I'm telling you.

169
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.540
And I'm charge charger fans on the one fucking charger game that I fucking went

170
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:24.030
to add. Um, I'll, you know,

171
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.770
me law had almost got into a fight when we were there and I was rooting for the

172
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:33.690
chargers. I just had a patriots hat on. It was an old school patriots had,

173
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:34.920
it was all fucking beat up.

174
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.270
They will play in the fucking colts on cheer in the chargers. That alone,

175
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.730
I mean I expected to get a little bit of shit right, a little bit of Shit,

176
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:48.510
but to get to the point that it's going to be a physical confrontation and

177
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:51.720
somebody dumps a beer on you and that type of shit. All my bad,

178
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:54.360
but they did it on purpose like yeah, fuck that.

179
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.680
Keep those fucking animals where they're at. Keep them where they're at.

180
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:02.070
Like just, you know, keep the rocky horror picture show in the end zone.

181
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:06.060
Keep that up and fucking Oakland plus it's the Oakland Raiders. That's their,

182
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.850
fuck it. I'm kind of giving it inadvertently given Oakland Shit.

183
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:12.210
I don't mean to do that. It's the Oakland Raiders. All right.

184
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:13.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

185
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.050
<v 2>They came down here before they tried to make it in Hollywood. They couldn't,</v>

186
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.220
you know, they got a couple of guest stars on the fall guy, you know.

187
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.120
Then they did an episode of full House and then it just sort of dried up for,

188
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.140
and then they, they put their tail between their legs. They went back home,

189
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:34.490
they took over their dad's business. I don't understand why they coming back.

190
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.913
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

191
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.020
<v 2>and why everybody all at once. All of a sudden everybody wants to come here.</v>

192
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.690
We've been sitting here for 20 fucking years without a team.

193
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:45.150
Now all of a sudden everybody wants to come back.

194
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.980
The Ram should come back there. Los Angeles is team. All right.

195
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.740
Now I know the charges started here in la, la,

196
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.910
like their first or first year or two on the AFL. But uh,

197
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.580
yeah, keep it down to San Diego. You know, it's Shitty.

198
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.020
You don't want to stand by. Standing with Santa Ana is a great place.

199
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.670
It's one of them met most mellow, great places. When you go down there,

200
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:13.180
you're like, this is everything that La should be. It's chill,

201
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.390
it's fucking relaxed. You've got the weather. This is great.

202
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.130
It's not the grind of La.

203
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.030
That's what San Diego feels like when I go down there and fucking love it.

204
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.070
But then for whatever fucking reason,

205
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.030
you go to a sporting event and these people turn into fucking maniacs,

206
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.890
not [inaudible] games just to charge your games. They just did fucking animals.

207
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.980
Um, I don't know.

208
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.980
Maybe if they built them a nicer stadium and then they gave them a mascot.

209
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.400
I have no idea. But I do think it's really fucked up that, you know,

210
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.440
the Raiders are going to leave, you know,

211
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.210
and the charges are going to leave and St Louis is leaving basically because

212
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:56.410
they don't like their stadiums and the throwing a fucking temper tantrum. It's,

213
00:12:56.411 --> 00:13:01.210
the NFL is so fucked up man. But sports in general that they do that to people.

214
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.480
It's like, dude, it's your league. It's your fucking business.

215
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.940
You know what I mean? You don't like your fucking place of work, but you know,

216
00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:13.960
build another one. I don't know.

217
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.630
There's, but there's no way to organize people to get them just to,

218
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.020
to stand up to owners. Right.

219
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.800
Like I remember hearing when I was working in Indianapolis in Indianapolis,

220
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.610
you know, they played at the, I was at the Hoosier dome or whatever. Um,

221
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.970
when they were building that Lucas oil field,

222
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:35.530
this taxi driver when I was there was telling me that, that the city will,

223
00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:38.860
they weren't even done paying off the RCA dom or whatever the fuck they called

224
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:40.840
it. They weren't even done paying that off.

225
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:44.710
And then they had this fucking thing. If you've never been to Indianapolis,

226
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:47.440
I don't know if, uh, the are the Hoosier dough MRCA Dome,

227
00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:49.450
whatever the fuck it was called, if that's still standing.

228
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.500
But when they've were fucking building Lucas oil field and it was right next to

229
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:56.050
the, uh, the old one, which I believe is torn down,

230
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.510
you could fit like two of those inside the new one and stack two on top of each

231
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:02.740
other. Um,

232
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.880
the size of this fucking new one island can only imagine how much tax payers

233
00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:08.980
have to pay for that shit. It's fucking stupid.

234
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.720
The whole thing's fucking stupid. I,

235
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:15.040
I really believe that once you make a stadium that should be a stadium and you

236
00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:17.320
just keep fixing the fucking thing up the way.

237
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:22.090
I'm fixing up my shed hall of a house. Sorry,

238
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.330
I just discovered something else that was fucked up with my house.

239
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:28.930
But you know what? All right, now I'm the stubborn German Irish guy in me.

240
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.610
I'm just like, you know what? Bring it up.

241
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.610
Sink every fucking dime I have into this goddamn

242
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.420
taken on water. Shit hole of a boat. I'm done. I'm fucking done. Like,

243
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.010
uh, I'm having somebody come over today to look at my garage. And uh,

244
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.150
somebody built off of, uh, my office here,

245
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.660
they built this closet and they extended this room itself.

246
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.130
And I don't know who's friend of a friend built this fucking thing,

247
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.370
but it literally sits, uh,

248
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.200
right above my garage and on these two wooden, like,

249
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.460
I don't even know what the terminology is. They're not two by fours.

250
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:12.170
Was it four by six is whatever.

251
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.030
It's wood that's always bothered me. And then down,

252
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:18.740
I talked about this in the last podcast,

253
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.250
but beneath that is my garage.

254
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:27.251
And in my garage right underneath that wood is a steel beam that goes across the

255
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:28.251
garage.

256
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:33.251
There's a steel beam going down one side and not on the other cause there's a

257
00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:35.120
window there. So they said, well,

258
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:38.030
forget supporting the entire fucking structure.

259
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.470
Let's put a window here so I can look at my neighbor's house that's fucking six

260
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:47.090
inches away. Yeah. One of the first things I did when I bought the houses,

261
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.560
I put a shade up and pulled it down and I've never brought it back up again

262
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:55.210
until the other day when the guy looked. Um, so anyways,

263
00:15:55.211 --> 00:15:58.690
I think when you get like a stadium, like just, just fix the fucking thing up.

264
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.120
Just fix it up and keep fixing the fucking thing up

265
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:10.330
and that's it. What do you do? Have you ever,

266
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.550
ever gotten tickets into a luxury box? It sucks. It sucks.

267
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.850
The food socks. You're 9 million miles away from the game.

268
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.440
You now the upper deck is further away from the game. It fucking blows.

269
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.800
I wish you guys, you young people out there,

270
00:16:25.801 --> 00:16:29.070
I wish back in the day you could have gone to like, uh, like

271
00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:35.560
the Boston Garden Mei belief garden. Um, I mean, I never went to a game there.

272
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:38.260
I took a tour of the place, but I, I'll just go with the ones that I went to,

273
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.160
the old fucking Boston Garden, dude, you are on top of the fucking game.

274
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.870
It was like Thunderdome when you were,

275
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.370
you were in the upper deck of those fucking stadiums. Dude.

276
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.850
You literally felt like if you lean too far forward,

277
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.600
you're going to fall down and you would hit the ice. That's how steep it was.

278
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:57.980
But now they're like the fire code and you know,

279
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.660
to get the fucking elephants out, you know, it's got to be fucking more chill,

280
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.400
you know, a relax grade. I don't know, I'm not into it,

281
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:10.220
but I'm psyched that the rams are back. I feel like the ram should be there.

282
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.200
I feel like San Diego should be in San Diego.

283
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:13.880
I feel like Oakland should be in Oakland, you know,

284
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.040
like the way it was when I was a kid. Um, and that's it.

285
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:22.220
And I know I was kind of fucking rough on fucking la fans, but it's true.

286
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.180
And I'm, I went down to Anaheim one time, we would share it on the red sox. We,

287
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.300
and on our red sox shit, you know, but we weren't conscious about it.

288
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.250
I used to wear red shocks,

289
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:34.910
suck stuff into a Yankee Stadium and people would break my balls,

290
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.660
chance some shit and point at me when I laughed it off and they saw that I was a

291
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:40.880
good shit or whatever. Then they, then they would say,

292
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.520
well how long are you down here in New York? I live down here. I really,

293
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.560
but blah blah blah blah, you know,

294
00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:48.320
and then they'd score and they'd fucking laugh at me and give me shit or

295
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:51.240
whatever and you know, and if we score one won the game,

296
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.220
I wouldn't fucking point at him and stuff. I wasn't a, I wasn't a dick.

297
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.100
All right. Cause this is my thing. If you go to a stadium with the other jersey,

298
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.960
you got to expect to get some shit. All right.

299
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.470
But like once you demonstrate that you're not going to be a fucking obnoxious

300
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:06.810
ass, people should leave you alone. You know what I mean?

301
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.890
You're just making a road trip.

302
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.650
You show in the other stadium respect that you wanted to come. And see it.

303
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:11.910
And that should be the fucking end of it.

304
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.060
And that was my experience when I was living in New York.

305
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.890
I came out here and it's just like, no,

306
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.330
I'm going to stab you in the fucking neck. So,

307
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.040
well actually, you know, I'm always bitching about the population problems.

308
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:29.010
You know what? Fuck all that. Fuck the last 18 minutes of this podcast,

309
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:30.600
bring their aid. It's bring them down here.

310
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.510
Maybe some people will fucking die and it'll be a couple less people

311
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.500
procreating, you know, build it. You really have to take it to there. Yeah,

312
00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:40.230
I think I did. Um, all right.

313
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.320
You know what they kind of reminds me of though is the, uh,

314
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.000
these fucking people who are baiting Trump supporters. Now, I'm not,

315
00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:50.820
I'm not going to, you know, get into politics here, but you know,

316
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.580
you gotta call a spade a spade here. I mean, the,

317
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.820
those people are mouth breathing morons. Uh,

318
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.900
and Trump is up there not saying anything and getting them to go absolutely

319
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:05.850
fucking nuts. Uh, and it's actually,

320
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.043
uh,

321
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.560
it's like watching a movie where they're kind of warning you about,

322
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.430
I dunno how when I watched Trump and I listened to what he says it,

323
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.700
it reminds me of like, I, there's some couple of Hollywood movies that I've seen

324
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:27.030
and the person running for office is just so over the top and ridiculous.

325
00:19:27.031 --> 00:19:29.160
It just reminds you that you watching a movie, you just like,

326
00:19:29.161 --> 00:19:32.430
why did they go that far? If they just fucking dialed it back a little bit, I,

327
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:35.820
this could be a little more believable and, uh, you'd have a much better,

328
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.420
much better movie. And then along came Trump and, uh, you know,

329
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.840
I owe all of those, uh, movies and apology,

330
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:46.260
but I do have to say this, the fucking nerds who went to the,

331
00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:51.120
one of the latest Trump rallies and had a sign,

332
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:55.900
Obama is a good president. This country already is great, but they,

333
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.770
you just went in there, you know,

334
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.330
you went in there to pick a fight and then they videotaped it.

335
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:06.180
And when they tore up your signs, which you knew they were going to do,

336
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.620
you get to be like, Trump's support is his hit a new low.

337
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.160
I guess the reason why they're doing that right now,

338
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.280
which is really what that is, is basically entrapment.

339
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.180
That's like they throw drugs at your feet. Oh, what's that? Um, no,

340
00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:25.560
that's actually not so well, what if like some smoking hot chick,

341
00:20:25.561 --> 00:20:28.170
he just walk up to some fatty and she's just like, Hey,

342
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:32.400
you want me to fuck your Dick? Give me 20 bucks. And he's like, okay,

343
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.080
let me finish this muffin. And the cops just come in. You can't fucking do that.

344
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.990
You can't temp. You can't tempt somebody like that.

345
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.330
And I feel like that's kind of what they did with them. But, um,

346
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.220
having said all that, yeah. Um, that Trump thinks stopped being funny,

347
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:50.770
like a good four to six months ago and she just like, wait a minute,

348
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.830
it's just going, going to get the nomination. You know,

349
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.350
all I'm begging for is just give me two reasonable human beings,

350
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.980
two sane, reasonable human beings.

351
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.100
You know what I mean? That, that, you know,

352
00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:11.280
on either fucking side and then give me that third fucking option.

353
00:21:11.281 --> 00:21:14.490
Just be fucking reasonable. Don't walk around.

354
00:21:14.491 --> 00:21:17.430
I'm going to bomb the shit out of. So it's the fuck is wrong with you.

355
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:19.500
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

356
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.480
<v 2>it's always the guys who don't have to go over there and do, Oh,</v>

357
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.590
do you know I'm fuck, I'm the tough guy behind the fucking desk. Um,

358
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.670
I can't believe nobody slept at wig off yet, you know? Um, all right, let's, uh,

359
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.110
let's plow ahead.

360
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.040
As somebody who's trying to keep up with both hockey and basketball,

361
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.120
this is what ends up happening.

362
00:21:39.121 --> 00:21:42.510
You just end up watching your own teams and you don't know what the rest of the

363
00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:43.171
League is doing.

364
00:21:43.171 --> 00:21:46.530
And that's what's going on with me because I used to check in with the Dallas

365
00:21:46.531 --> 00:21:50.850
Stars and uh, in the, uh, the Black Hawks and the, um,

366
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.050
<v 3>yeah.</v>

367
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.950
<v 2>And the La Kings are just teams I really like watching and I haven't had a</v>

368
00:21:55.951 --> 00:21:59.280
chance to, so I just been watching the Bruins fucking lose, lose,

369
00:21:59.281 --> 00:22:01.500
lose on this road trip. We lost a jersey.

370
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.240
Then we lost to a fuck. Did we lose? No,

371
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:11.140
we beat Jersey, right? We beat Jersey and we've lost three in a row.

372
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:15.370
We lost two. The fliers, the rangers and Ottawa.

373
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.200
I will say auto was the,

374
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:21.280
was the most enjoyable loss because it's my belief that the best thing in sports

375
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:24.160
right now is three on three overtime hockey.

376
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:27.730
Even if you fucking everybody who bitches about hockey, this is the hockey.

377
00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:31.720
You want to see no fights racing up and down the ice in someone's can basically

378
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:35.860
going to score within five fucking minutes. You'll love it. Um,

379
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.000
I don't know if there's any youtube videos you could watch the whole fucking

380
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:43.010
overtime. They, the Ottawa Bruins over time it was, it was, it was,

381
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.360
we lost and I was, I almost stood up and applauded.

382
00:22:46.361 --> 00:22:49.600
It was that fucking enjoyable to see. Um,

383
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.710
was incredible. It's almost like when you watch it, you're like, you know what?

384
00:22:55.711 --> 00:22:58.290
Maybe there's too many people playing professional hockey.

385
00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.820
I want to take anybody's job.

386
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.180
But if it was three on three from the get go of Jesus Christ,

387
00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:06.750
the whole fucking game, you know, what happened? Somebody would die.

388
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.480
The cardio would just be off the fucking,

389
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.650
has anybody interviewed a NHL player yet to say like, what is it like,

390
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.170
what's it like to, to, to, um,

391
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:23.010
to take a shift or like three on three overtime versus when it's a five on five,

392
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:27.490
not including the goaltenders. Okay. For all you fucking number nerds out there.

393
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.020
Like what is that like? Are you more winded? Is there an unbelievable freedom?

394
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.790
Because you don't have to worry about getting checked.

395
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:37.960
It's going to be fucking incredible feeling like you're playing pond hockey.

396
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.060
Um, anyways. And then the fucking Celtics, they finally won last night.

397
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.680
Of course I missed the Goddamn game.

398
00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:48.770
I just saw them to fucking lost to the Knicks do that Porzingis guy.

399
00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:53.120
Holy Fuck. He's like a 10 foot Larry Bird.

400
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:56.570
He was looking like that in the first quarter. This guy was just hitting one,

401
00:23:56.571 --> 00:23:59.390
three after another and then he took one shot, three point shot.

402
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:02.000
This guy's like seven foot two or three or something.

403
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.190
He took a 3.0 from like fun.

404
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.690
It looked like he was like eight feet behind the arc and it just won't wash.

405
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.810
And what's funny is it's each three that he hit the fucking noises that the

406
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:20.030
crowd was making. Like basically this is the guy, I think this is the guy.

407
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.220
Like he'd hit one, they like, they cheer,

408
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:26.020
but you hear like underneath the chair here. Oh, then he hits a second.

409
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.720
Then the third one I like freaking the fuck out

410
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.830
and you can tell, uh, mellow loves fucking play with them. They're past,

411
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.720
knew each other. It was fucking great.

412
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.180
So I'm sitting there watching it going like, all right,

413
00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:45.200
if we're going to lose these guys, at least I get to watch, you know,

414
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.960
the oldest star having fun with the new kid. Um,

415
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.190
you know, it was, it was just really fun to watch the two of them playing.

416
00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.060
And uh, Jesus Christ, God help the League if they get a fucking point Garda,

417
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.630
well not the whole league, but I mean they could fuck with the Cavaliers,

418
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:06.320
couldn't they? Maybe. I don't know shit about hoop. I'm going to shut up.

419
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:09.580
But I enjoyed watching them play and everything's going great. And I guy,

420
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.630
so you know what, I'm going to watch the rest of this fucking game.

421
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:16.970
And who knows? Maybe I'll watch one of these guys put up 40. Right? Who knows?

422
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.000
And uh, and then I'll send it all went to shit.

423
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.320
Maloz backing up the fucking court. The refs standing there,

424
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:27.890
he steps on the refs 40 turns his fucking ankle and then that's it.

425
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:33.080
It's fucking it. He tried coming back out after the half and then he just said,

426
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:36.140
fuck it left. I'm out.

427
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.220
I dropped my fucking 20 for the evening. I'll see. And he fucking leaves.

428
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.480
I saw the other night,

429
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:45.290
he's still not fucking playing cause he stepped on the ref's foot so he fucking

430
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:48.560
leaves. So I'm like, all right, let's see if the kid can lead the team here.

431
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:49.311
And then next thing you know,

432
00:25:49.311 --> 00:25:52.430
he's got like five fucking files and he sitting down,

433
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.270
and this is funny, this funny thing is we still lost the Goddamn game.

434
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.910
I actually love the Celtics. They young and everything, but they uh,

435
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.490
they love scoring like 35 in the first quarter, you know,

436
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.830
and going up by 10, 12, 19.

437
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:12.490
I watched him lose the Memphis to having a 19 point fucking lead and uh,

438
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:14.983
I don't know,

439
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.900
I still like them and if think it just fucking hang onto what God damn lead.

440
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.120
I could enjoy it a little bit more. But by the way,

441
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.900
it's the last night they were playing the paces and um,

442
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.560
one of the fuck most fucked up things ever.

443
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:31.880
I was sitting there looking at the pacers wearing these uniforms and like where

444
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:35.300
do I know those uniforms from? And I looked it up online.

445
00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:38.840
They were wearing the uniforms, the same uniforms that they wear in that movie.

446
00:26:38.841 --> 00:26:42.800
Hoosiers, right. My correct in assuming that,

447
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.200
let me look this up before I make fun of them for actually doing that Hoosiers

448
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.180
movie.

449
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.413
<v 3>Okay.</v>

450
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.430
<v 2>Images. It's all going to be gene Hackman's face, right? Yeah.</v>

451
00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:00.660
They were wearing those things. Do you realize how fucked up that is?

452
00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:03.250
<v 3>Okay.</v>

453
00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.510
<v 2>Hey black guys, why don't you put on these uniforms?</v>

454
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.140
That white pill we used to wear when you weren't allowed to play?

455
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:09.923
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

456
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.500
<v 2>I thought I wanted to say lines of way. Those are fucking what? It was.</v>

457
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:20.250
Fucking a white whitey verse. Whitey. The all white days, right?

458
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.291
Look at the pictures.

459
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:25.020
A picture of the fucking team in black and white that they were doing.

460
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.700
All right. Number 43 white number 15 white number 53 white,

461
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:33.720
25 white, 13 white, 12 white, 14 white. The other guy can't read his number.

462
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:40.590
They're all white. Why would a, why would you have them wear those?

463
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.220
When did one of you going to have the uh, the color barrier?

464
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.720
Broken uniforms one day this year? I don't know.

465
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.380
It seemed like an odd fucking choice to me. However,

466
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.540
Indiana has such a weird fucking such a weird fucking state, you know,

467
00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.840
it's really just like a, you know, just odd.

468
00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:05.540
Golly Gee. Aww shucks white people slash

469
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:06.870
<v 3>okay.</v>

470
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.470
<v 2>Astoundingly racist. You know, like as much shit as Boston.</v>

471
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:13.170
Like the only places that gets shit for being racist. Basically.

472
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:17.760
It's the south and Boston, Massachusetts. And now having been on the road,

473
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.890
I dunno about how fucking long she kept this weekend. A

474
00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:23.893
<v 3>okay.</v>

475
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.190
<v 2>We, yeah, no, there's no new versus when the, uh, when you're still at the gate,</v>

476
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.060
they're just like

477
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.850
<v 0>touching everybody on American Airlines flight one, nine or seven,</v>

478
00:28:33.851 --> 00:28:37.150
six to Albuquerque. Um,

479
00:28:37.151 --> 00:28:40.660
we're still waiting for our flight crew to show up.

480
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.970
So it's probably going to be another 40 minutes if you'd like to get something

481
00:28:45.971 --> 00:28:47.740
to eat, but don't want it too far.

482
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.573
<v 3>That shit.</v>

483
00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:56.030
<v 2>I don't even know why I just went into that. Um, I don't even fucking remember.</v>

484
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.470
You know what I've been,

485
00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.080
I've been doing this long enough to just say fuck that idea and I'm just going

486
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.420
to continue on. All right.

487
00:29:02.421 --> 00:29:06.830
So we got a patriots verse the chiefs this weekend in playoffs,

488
00:29:06.831 --> 00:29:10.820
football playoffs. Um, and I think that, uh,

489
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.340
we could possibly win that game by the skin of our teeth.

490
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.850
It all depends on who comes back. Uh,

491
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:20.090
but if we do not have an offensive line, then uh, our,

492
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.170
our goose is cooked because our starting running back,

493
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:29.830
I can't even remember his fucking name. He's been out for so long. I, I,

494
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.680
you know, I really need to just pick a sport. You can't fucking watch 'em off.

495
00:29:32.681 --> 00:29:34.270
That's what I'm trying to do. I'm watching the Patriots,

496
00:29:34.271 --> 00:29:36.580
Bruins and Celtics and I don't even know anybody's fucking name.

497
00:29:36.581 --> 00:29:38.830
Any mice know the fucking lines or the Bruins. I don't even know.

498
00:29:38.831 --> 00:29:39.664
I'm just sitting there.

499
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.453
<v 3>Okay.</v>

500
00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.220
<v 2>You know what it is it, this is my fucking, I don't know what the,</v>

501
00:29:45.221 --> 00:29:47.860
that the psychological term is like, oh, I'm going to, I'm going to get them.

502
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:49.850
I'm going to watch the Bruins much all the Bruins game,

503
00:29:49.851 --> 00:29:51.680
so much all the Bros Games and then Thursday comes out.

504
00:29:51.681 --> 00:29:53.750
I'll get the basketball coach, I'll start it.

505
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:59.800
And I'm just fucking sitting here binge watching this shit like a maniac.

506
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:03.610
I think I need to step back for a second and get my priorities in order and

507
00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.420
realize that the Patriots are in the fucking playoffs and the Bruins and Celtics

508
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.390
is still in the regular season. I are just be paying attention to the Patriots.

509
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:11.224
Right.

510
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.323
<v 4>Um,</v>

511
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.580
<v 2>I dunno. I think, uh, I think c, I think it's Seattle. I think Seattle,</v>

512
00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.950
they had their fucking little, you know,

513
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.280
when you went again the way Seattle won last week,

514
00:30:23.281 --> 00:30:26.730
which is basically the other team basically screws the poach.

515
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.960
You got to start to feel like you kind of a team of destiny. Right?

516
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.540
And I know one year the Patriots, you know,

517
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.470
the ravens missed a field goal and that got us into a Superbowl. But uh,

518
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.480
that one made me feel like we backed in. But like, I really think like Seattle,

519
00:30:42.481 --> 00:30:46.950
if it wasn't fucking nine degrees out or 10 below zero,

520
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:51.330
I thought that was really in the vikings favor kind of slowed them down a little

521
00:30:51.331 --> 00:30:55.980
bit, even out the field. And I can say that knowing nothing about the vikings,

522
00:30:55.981 --> 00:30:57.870
I'm going to shut the fuck up right now. How about that?

523
00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:02.520
Would that be all right? Um, anyways,

524
00:31:02.521 --> 00:31:06.570
well that's the half hour here. I got to, uh, I gotta go fucking, uh,

525
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:11.610
put on my monkey suit here and makes sure that I look like I'm from Indiana when

526
00:31:11.611 --> 00:31:15.990
I go in to go pitch the second season here. So anyways,

527
00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.430

You come home after a long exhausting day at work and all you want to do is sip

583
00:34:34.411 --> 00:34:37.560
a glass of wine and relax, but unless you've planned ahead,

584
00:34:37.561 --> 00:34:39.540
you probably don't even have a bottle in your house.

585
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.480
You already spent enough time wandering around the grocery store.

586
00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:43.980
Don't get lost in the wine aisle.

587
00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.710
You just end up picking out a bottle based on the label.

588
00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:51.360
You don't really get it. You get home and it sucks, right? You don't need that.

Club Debbie. I know Donald Rumsfeld, he actually ran.

B U R r. Now back to some throwback podcast. She

662
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:50.613
<v 1>[inaudible],</v>

663
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.770
<v 2>I don't know if they up the cock blocks all been defined,</v>

664
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:02.960
like the different kinds of cock blocks.

665
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:06.350
I don't know if there's this names thrown, but I got a new,

666
00:40:06.351 --> 00:40:08.370
I got a new cock block for you. Uh, this will,

667
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.990
this cock block is very special in a very obvious one.

668
00:40:11.991 --> 00:40:15.410
And I think like this happens all the time,

669
00:40:15.411 --> 00:40:18.790
but for some reason I've never heard anybody name it. So I'm, I'm gonna,

670
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.600
I'm gonna kick off the creative process. I call this guy the announcer.

671
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:28.220
That's the, uh, that's, that's the name of this cock block.

672
00:40:28.221 --> 00:40:31.100
This is what happened to me. I was,

673
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:35.120
I did a Gig in Jersey and at the end of the night,

674
00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:39.680
these two girls who waited to be at the back of the line came up and they said,

675
00:40:39.681 --> 00:40:42.890
hey, you want to go out and get banana pancakes? You know,

676
00:40:42.891 --> 00:40:45.710
making a reference to my joke saying if I wanted to go out and hang out with

677
00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:50.210
both of them. Right. And the second day said it, I was like,

678
00:40:50.211 --> 00:40:54.080
Holy Shit, here's a fucking, here's something I never had.

679
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:59.160
Here's a two on one and I can't fucking do it cause I'm with Nia. Who's kidding?

680
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.550
No. Cool. Not because I'm with Nias because everybody's got a cell phone,

681
00:41:01.551 --> 00:41:02.870
fucking camera. And I get caught.

682
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.020
<v 5>Honesty.</v>

683
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.100
<v 2>Um, no, I couldn't deal with the guilt. Um, but I gotta I'll be honest with you,</v>

684
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.630
and I would say this, if Nia was here,

685
00:41:14.631 --> 00:41:18.830
if two fucking tens came up to me and said, let's do this. I, I, you know,

686
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:24.410
yeah, fuck it. Let's do it. I never did it. You know, fuck it.

687
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.280
So anyways, so they said, hey, you want to get a,

688
00:41:28.281 --> 00:41:30.950
you want to go on and get bananas and pancakes or something like that.

689
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.420
And then this fucking guy like 10 feet or way just goes like,

690
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.350
<v 1>oh, what's going on over here?</v>

691
00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:42.550
<v 2>You know those guys, like if a girl just comes up to you, just like, you know,</v>

692
00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:46.660
you know I've always loved guys in green shirts and you're thinking raise your

693
00:41:46.661 --> 00:41:48.670
thinking like, holy fuck, this is going to happen.

694
00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.440
There's some other guy like five minutes.

695
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.560
<v 1>Hey, now why?</v>

696
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.500
<v 2>And just makes the whole fire the whole fucking room. Look over at you.</v>

697
00:41:57.501 --> 00:41:59.300
The fucking announcer.

698
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.750
Fucking cock block mother fucker. You know who would do that?

699
00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.860
If I was standing there and I heard two girls say to a guy, I'd be like,

700
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:13.310
God damn, it's going down right side of my mouth at blocky mother fucker.

701
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:15.103
I wouldn't,

702
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.050
<v 1>oh</v>

703
00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:17.360
<v 3>yeah,</v>

704
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.260
<v 1>she wants the funnier mouth. Raleigh, other one watches. I mean,</v>

705
00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:22.460
why would you do that?

706
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.090
<v 2>The fucking announcer. And if you have a friend like that, all right.</v>

707
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:30.840
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

708
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.020
<v 2>The only way you can still hang out with them is if he goes out.</v>

709
00:42:34.021 --> 00:42:35.760
If you guys are going out trying to meet women,

710
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:41.330
he has to wear one of those old ABC bright yellow Monday night football sport

711
00:42:41.421 --> 00:42:42.254
coats.

712
00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.553
<v 3>Okay.</v>

713
00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.770
<v 2>And if the girls, why is he wearing that? You'll see. You'll see.</v>

714
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.133
<v 3>Okay.</v>

715
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.620
<v 2>And that'll be the, that would be the funniest fucking thing ever.</v>

716
00:42:50.621 --> 00:42:54.190
Like if somehow if he couldn't figure out the joke and he just thought the coat

717
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:59.290
look good and just the whole night you just saw him. Anytime you heard a in the,

718
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.830
you know, 10 feet away.

719
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.770
<v 1>Yeah. What's this all about?</v>

720
00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.230
<v 2>He does look over and you'd see this guy dressed like Howard Cosell.</v>

721
00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.660
You'd be like, oh, that's the announcer. He's the, he's the,

722
00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:17.220
he's the guy he can cock block from. Like, he's almost like a sniper.

723
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.600
If he wasn't so fucking loud, he's at the same distance as a fucking marksman.

724
00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.490
But uh, he kills it with, uh, with loudness. Oh my God.

725
00:43:26.491 --> 00:43:29.520
Did that guy fucking annoy me? Hey Mia, come here. Come here.

726
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.560
She just came and shaking her head.

727
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.150
What I am beyond the come on over here.

728
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:39.270
I was just telling him that story with that Guy Cock blocked me with those two

729
00:43:39.271 --> 00:43:43.320
chicks out in a Jersey where they would just go cock blocked you.

730
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:44.910
I told you this story.

731
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.150
No but you making it seem like you were going to do something and mean. No,

732
00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.500
no I wasn't going to do something.

733
00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:52.950
This is the thing but I just admitted general cock blocking. Yeah,

734
00:43:52.951 --> 00:43:56.710
but this is what I did admit. If they were both tens I would've, I would've,

735
00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:57.903
I would've done it.

736
00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:01.620
I never had a fucker two on one and you know some that would you be that mad if

737
00:44:01.621 --> 00:44:04.860
they were both smoking hot and the cell phone video got out.

738
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.530
The video is even need to get out when you got the announced today.

739
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.680
The guy he just literally goes like yeah,

740
00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:13.970
we'd like to get it in pancakes as dod. He said something like wow,

741
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.620
<v 1>what's good on over there?</v>

742
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:23.700
<v 2>Nothing. You're a jack. Why am I a jerk? So pajamas. Huh?</v>

743
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.300
You are talking about cock blocking and two one one.

744
00:44:28.301 --> 00:44:30.870
So what kind of podcast is turning into, you know,

745
00:44:30.871 --> 00:44:35.610
what turned into a very honest podcast. I was very honest. I said, this is good.

746
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.840
This is the thing I said I couldn't, uh,

747
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.750
I couldn't deal with the guilt unless if they, if,

748
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.020
unless they were both tens, if they're both fucking tens, give me a break.

749
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.390
Let me tell you something. If you hooked up with Brad Pitt,

750
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.620
there's only so mad I could get. It's fucking Brad Pitt. Okay.

751
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:57.060
Yeah. Okay. Well you know what that would, that if I just,

752
00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:00.480
if I just said some generic good looking guy.

753
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:04.170
If I just said some generic good looking guy and you, and you just said that,

754
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:05.010
that would have scared me.

755
00:45:05.011 --> 00:45:07.350
But the way you just acted like you had Brad Pitt's phone number,

756
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:09.750
that doesn't scare me. Oh really? Okay.

757
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.890
It's going down like the regular guy version of Brad pen.

758
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.570
Is that okay?

759
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.780
Like he's just as good if you want to go live out on the street and get the fuck

760
00:45:18.781 --> 00:45:20.220
out of this house. Absolutely.

761
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:23.880
But you're allowed to have some sort of crazy two one one. Yes.

762
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.860
That's bull said. No it isn't. If he just, you know,

763
00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:30.810
cause you're thinking on it on like, like a, a very basic level.

764
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:34.170
But if you really, if you really think about it, just think about it.

765
00:45:34.171 --> 00:45:35.640
It makes sense. Bill.

766
00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:39.510
You're not going to try to mind fuck me into thinking that it's okay for you to

767
00:45:39.511 --> 00:45:41.910
have some sort of two on one and I can't, that's not, no,

768
00:45:41.911 --> 00:45:44.970
it's not going down like that. Yeah, but God, women are beautiful.

769
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:48.720
We lust after you a totally makes sense. You guys find like Dick's are weird,

770
00:45:48.721 --> 00:45:51.810
they're gross. It's all hanging out there. It's disgusting. You don't want that.

771
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.360
You know nothing about you. You don't want that,

772
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.640
which has been proven time and time and again,

773
00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:01.080
and your stand up and on your podcast. But that's a, that's another discussion.

774
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:02.220
You know what you,

775
00:46:02.221 --> 00:46:05.190
you just set yourself up like you're gonna make some huge point and then you

776
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:07.970
just tapped out. You know nothing about women but didn't.

777
00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.670
But that's just another discussion and I just don't want even to get into that.

778
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.400
So now what, you just gave me the face. What are you doing today? Lazy. Huh?

779
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:24.030
Nini? Kubrick on my short film over the weekend. Screw you.

780
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.560
I'm working hard while you're in here in your pajamas talking about two on ones.

781
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.010
Yeah. Well I have to do an hour's worth of shit here. I'm coming up on it.

782
00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:37.190
Fill it up. Let me go an hour and two minutes an hour.

783
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:42.000
Two minutes. Do you have your emails yet? Yeah, I did.

784
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:45.990
Listener emails. You did that already. Oh, cause you want to chime in?

785
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:49.530
I don't know. I already did it. I already did it. What about overrated?

786
00:46:49.531 --> 00:46:53.670
Underrated. Didn't do it. They didn't have any this week. Oh, okay. Look at you.

787
00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:57.090
I think you're a fan of this podcast. No, I'm not.

788
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.790
Listen, it didn't go down. All right.

789
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.740
But I'm telling you right now, Nia, if two tens come up to me,

790
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:13.350
it's going down. Okay. All right. Well I'll just be prepared for the retaliation

791
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.390
game set match. Really? You're going to deny me that?

792
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.490
Can I just buy you some stuff? Wow. Really? Yes.

793
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:31.090
Really not some sort of fucking basketball that can be placated with material

794
00:47:31.091 --> 00:47:35.440
things to a point. Yeah, exactly. If I'm going to be fucking honest here,

795
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:39.190
come on, this gotta be something that I can buy. You know something.

796
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:42.520
This should be our Valentine's Day. All right. For the guy,

797
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.020
the Guy Valentine's Day,

798
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:48.130
this is what Valentine's Day should be every year is the guy gets a two on one

799
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:52.750
and then you get some nice stuff. Well why can't I have a two on one?

800
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.830
Cause you don't like that. What do you mean? What do you know?

801
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.510
Women don't like sex?

802
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.230
You don't find like when you guys fantasize,

803
00:48:05.231 --> 00:48:08.680
you think about the guys in your life. You don't think about other things.

804
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:16.900
Um, come on Nia. Just one. Just give me one. You get one and I get one.

805
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:21.160
No you don't. You don't because you don't want one. What do you mean?

806
00:48:21.161 --> 00:48:24.070
I don't want you just being childish. No I'm not. Yeah, you are.

807
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:27.250
[inaudible] you think you think you want to hook up with,

808
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:32.230
with Jake Gyllenhaal in a bread face, whatever the fuck his name is, Brad Pitt.

809
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:37.270
Brad Fred face pit. You just think you do. See,

810
00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.940
you know what to think about me is like you have to hook up with somebody

811
00:48:39.941 --> 00:48:43.600
famous. I'm actually just regular people. See I'm down to earth with this shit.

812
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.710
See that's what I'm saying. You like stuff you like shiny, shiny things.

813
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.450
This is deal. I get a two on one and you,

814
00:48:50.451 --> 00:48:55.451
you get some some cracked up face old man in Vegas like Robert Redford.

815
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.250
Like I used to be good looking when Nixon was in office. No,

816
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.150
that's not how negotiating works.

817
00:49:01.151 --> 00:49:03.430
Now you've got to come with something else here. No,

818
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:07.090
I think we should both get an equal opportunities thing going on.

819
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:11.300
This isn't an equal relationship. Why? Why is it not an equal relationship?

820
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:12.221
Because I wanted to,

821
00:49:12.221 --> 00:49:15.640
I could pin you down to the ground right now and tickle you until you passed out

822
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:18.620
and there's not a fucking thing you can do about it. What did that,

823
00:49:18.621 --> 00:49:21.360
that has nothing to do with anything. That's how the world works in here.

824
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.330
Why do you think America's on top? Because we're right or because we co because,

825
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:29.890
because we can blow you up more times. So it's your, your physical presence.

826
00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:32.530
That's what makes it like an unequal relationship. Yeah.

827
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:35.650
Cause I can beat you down. Well, maybe you're physically stronger,

828
00:49:35.651 --> 00:49:38.950
but I'm mentally stronger than you. Oh, snap.

829
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:44.260
I'm smarter than you. Yeah. So whatever physical power. Let me ask you this.

830
00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:48.550
What is you have are trumped by my mental fucking Goliath Nus.

831
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.560
Suck on that red.

832
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.690
<v 1>Why do you think you're smarter than, Oh, that was good though. Oh,</v>

833
00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.090
you got a good one in. Now you're storming off. I taught you. Well

834
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:28.723
[inaudible]

835
00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.710
<v 2>let's get to the complaints this week. Everybody asked,</v>

836
00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.840
some lady just absolutely lost her mind.

837
00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:03.070
Hates my guts now and won't listen to this podcast anymore and I'd apologize to

838
00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:04.750
her, but she said she's not listening anymore.

839
00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.880
There's no way that she's listening.

840
00:51:06.881 --> 00:51:10.320
Despite that she wrote like a five page email that I'm now going to read. Um,

841
00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:15.100
she has a huge problem with me. Everybody. So settle it. Want me to wait?

842
00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:18.030
You want to go down to the break room? Go get yourself a little coffee cake.

843
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:22.030
I'll, I can wait. I'm on vacation. I got nothing better to do. Go ahead.

844
00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.273
I'll wait.

845
00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:30.550
Fucking dog's been farting all day today. I don't know what his deal is.

846
00:51:30.551 --> 00:51:32.980
And it keeps looking at me like, dude, you got to help me out.

847
00:51:32.981 --> 00:51:34.270
And I keep going and take it outside.

848
00:51:34.271 --> 00:51:37.870
And then it just sniffs the grass and then I bring it back in and starts farting

849
00:51:37.871 --> 00:51:39.340
again. And it keeps looking at me like, dude,

850
00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:43.300
I'm really trying not to shit on your rug. Like, I mean,

851
00:51:43.301 --> 00:51:46.270
that's how I'm reading her face. I think that's what she's saying.

852
00:51:46.271 --> 00:51:49.510
I have no idea. So anyways, uh, so anyways, there we go.

853
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:57.160
Um, subject. Your podcast is hate speech. Oh, geesh. Bill,

854
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:59.560
you probably won't read this or if you do,

855
00:51:59.590 --> 00:52:03.550
you will just dismiss me as a stupid contour, but no matter,

856
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:06.970
see it right there. She's already draped herself in the arm.

857
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:10.300
Brave and I'm going to plow a head flag. Um,

858
00:52:10.301 --> 00:52:13.600
your podcast as of late has morphed into hate speech.

859
00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:18.430
He used to be funny and I could brush off your hateful comments with the cringe

860
00:52:18.431 --> 00:52:22.960
and a shrug. Now wait a minute if it will,

861
00:52:22.961 --> 00:52:26.470
if they were hateful right along, why would you add? Okay. Let's just plow him.

862
00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:30.400
But now you've gone too far for me to feature a segment on your podcast,

863
00:52:30.401 --> 00:52:34.090
devoted to the deplorable behavior of women is intolerable.

864
00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:39.670
For those of you new to my podcast, uh, I've been doing this segment,

865
00:52:39.671 --> 00:52:44.671
which I think is hilarious and needs to be done just to get you caught up before

866
00:52:45.311 --> 00:52:49.810
this lady gives me both barrels here. Cause believe me, she does. Um, you know,

867
00:52:49.811 --> 00:52:52.660
there's a bunch of, there's a bunch of shows out there that, that,

868
00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.550
that shine a light on men who beat their women, those pieces of Shit, right?

869
00:52:57.551 --> 00:52:59.740
Trying to stop them from that behavior.

870
00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:03.910
There's a bunch of shows out there that we'll talk about how, uh,

871
00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.820
who were these guys, you know,

872
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.130
to say what a woman could do with their body.

873
00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:10.930
They'll talk about the glass ceiling,

874
00:53:10.931 --> 00:53:14.530
the old boys network and all that type of stuff and they shine a light on all of

875
00:53:14.531 --> 00:53:17.920
that. Okay. Which they should,

876
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.180
because that is guys doing things that they should not be doing.

877
00:53:22.181 --> 00:53:26.780
That is not fair to women. Okay. But my,

878
00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:28.560
so my problem is not that they do that.

879
00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:31.110
My problem is that they never shine a light on shit that,

880
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:34.290
that women do that is not fair to men. So recently,

881
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.540
um, if I can rate Mike Drake myself in some sort of brave flag,

882
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:43.080
I've been reading these stories about guys who are married,

883
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.860
their wife goes out, cheats on them, has unprotected sex,

884
00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:49.920
has a kid with another fucking guy,

885
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:53.070
doesn't tell their husband and that by the time he figures it out,

886
00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.500
he has to pay child support for a kid that is isn't even his and it's totally

887
00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.380
legal.

888
00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:03.360
And then I had the audacity to say that a woman who would do that to her husband

889
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.260
is a cont.

890
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:10.140
Evidently that's hateful speech towards all women according to this person.

891
00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.920
All right, because she continues and Oh, does she ever continue

892
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.840
to feature a segment on your podcast devoted to the deplorable behavior of women

893
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:19.710
is intolerable.

894
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:23.400
How is that any different than someone spending 20 minutes a week on a different

895
00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.720
podcast featuring the deplorable behavior behavior of black people?

896
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.010
Why do they always go to black people? That's always a,

897
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.840
that's just like calling me the n word.

898
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:37.250
This is no different than slavery though.

899
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:42.000
That's people in other groups always do that. Always do that. All right.

900
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.070
Give me a goddamn break. All right. That she, she goes,

901
00:54:47.071 --> 00:54:51.030
women are, I mean, how is that different? I'm how was,

902
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:56.010
how was what I'm doing any different by by featuring a segment of women who are

903
00:54:56.011 --> 00:54:59.010
doing something absolutely reprehensible demand.

904
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:03.810
How is that any different than a show that focuses on men doing anything

905
00:55:03.811 --> 00:55:08.100
reprehensible to women when they show wife beaters? I don't look at that like,

906
00:55:08.101 --> 00:55:10.380
oh my God, they're saying I'm doing it too.

907
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:13.230
I think you know something.

908
00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:16.740
I really think you're being really selfish here and the fact that you could sit

909
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:21.270
here and listen to my podcast for this, long as I've gone off on fat people.

910
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:22.980
I mean, Jesus Christ want to talk about hate speech.

911
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.320
How much shit have I talked about Peyton Manning,

912
00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:28.500
despite the fact I can't even throw a football. You know,

913
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:29.910
if he sent me an email,

914
00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:34.230
I would understand and I bet it wouldn't even be as crazy as this. She says,

915
00:55:34.231 --> 00:55:38.280
women are treated like second class citizens all over the world.

916
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:39.570
When did I ever say they weren't?

917
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:44.910
And even still in this country yet you have no problem inciting further hate and

918
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:48.270
discus towards your fellow human beings on this earth.

919
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:53.720
How am I inciting hate when when shows show wife beaters is that inciting hatred

920
00:55:54.481 --> 00:55:58.830
towards men? If you look at those shows and that makes you hate all men,

921
00:55:58.860 --> 00:55:59.880
then you're a moron.

922
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:04.530
So basically what you're saying is that I'm a moron and that all my listeners

923
00:56:04.531 --> 00:56:07.920
are morons. That if I call a woman who cheats on her husband,

924
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:10.770
has a baby with another guy and makes her husband pay for that,

925
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:15.600
if I call her a cunt, that means I'm calling all women cunts, you know?

926
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:19.260
Is that what you're saying? Are you saying we're all that stupid? She said,

927
00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:22.410
right now there are men and that is written in capital letters, men,

928
00:56:22.411 --> 00:56:27.411
men in country still capital s t I l l discussing whether or not women should

929
00:56:27.881 --> 00:56:30.580
have the right to contraception and abortion. Yeah, I understand that.

930
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:31.690
And those people freak me out.

931
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.520
Those people freak me up and I am a guy and I've never said that a woman

932
00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:38.860
shouldn't have a right to that. So I don't know what you're talking about.

933
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.120
This has nothing to do.

934
00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:44.470
I'm talking about these fucking whores that cheat on their husbands.

935
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:46.870
Ma'Am. You know what I love about all this?

936
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:49.390
How come you don't address what I talked about?

937
00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:52.220
How come I can't hear what,

938
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.760
what do you think about a woman who would do something like that?

939
00:56:55.300 --> 00:57:00.300
I saw a stat the other day that said 13% of kids in this country are not with

940
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:06.730
their biological father. Meaning that not just like,

941
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:11.170
you know, that, that their wife got like divorced and uh,

942
00:57:11.171 --> 00:57:12.430
and then remarried.

943
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.570
They mean like there's a guy either knows or doesn't know.

944
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:19.450
Like the woman had a kid with somebody else while they were married,

945
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:24.910
like 13% of kids. I mean, that means 80% of women are on the up and up.

946
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:27.010
All right? God bless them. They're angels.

947
00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:31.600
But that 13% needs to be taken to task. I mean, I, I mean,

948
00:57:31.601 --> 00:57:32.830
how many guys have beaten women?

949
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.320
I would guess there'd probably be right around that same, you know,

950
00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:39.310
maybe a little higher. I have no idea. Let's just, let's say it's 20 plus,

951
00:57:39.311 --> 00:57:43.840
say 20% of guys beat their women,

952
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.770
should they not be called out and be called cowardly pieces of shit,

953
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.060
you know, and if you call them cowardly piece of Shit, what?

954
00:57:52.061 --> 00:57:55.360
I have a right to sit there and look at that and be like, well that's,

955
00:57:55.361 --> 00:57:59.800
now you're, you're inciting further hate and disgust toward all men.

956
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.480
You're being really selfish here, man, because I go off on everybody.

957
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:07.090
This podcast is over the top and it's crazy.

958
00:58:07.091 --> 00:58:12.091
I call guys cunts on this podcast and you're being really selfish right now and

959
00:58:12.761 --> 00:58:13.430
now you know,

960
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:16.570
you make this big long speech and then you're going to take your ball and go

961
00:58:16.571 --> 00:58:19.870
home. I look at this, look at all she's bringing up here.

962
00:58:19.871 --> 00:58:23.380
Women are still earn only 70 cents for every dollar a man earns.

963
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:25.450
I think you guys should make the same amount,

964
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:28.180
but I also don't think that that that number is accurate.

965
00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:32.500
$77 77 cents for every dollar that a man or is,

966
00:58:32.501 --> 00:58:35.290
because if you include divorce settlements, a,

967
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:39.790
you get to keep your 77 cents plus his 50% his 50 cents.

968
00:58:39.791 --> 00:58:43.060
So then he's down to 50 and then you're up to a dollar 37

969
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:49.960
that's what I'm talking about right there. Go Fuck Yourself.

970
00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:53.440
You're over-sensitive Jackass. Good Lord.

971
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.340
Go buy a bigger bra. I don't know what your fucking problem is.

972
00:58:57.970 --> 00:58:59.110
I hope that bugs you too,

973
00:58:59.111 --> 00:59:01.870
that I said that that was deliberately supposed to be offensive. All right,

974
00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:06.340
so go fucking write a letter to a fucking cut hair.com cause I don't give a

975
00:59:06.341 --> 00:59:07.870
shit. All right? In short,

976
00:59:07.871 --> 00:59:12.400
we are still not equal to our male counterparts and we will forever be labeled

977
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:17.050
the weaker sex. While with that attitude, of course you will. You know,

978
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:20.590
I don't think you're the weaker sex. I think that that's all a myth.

979
00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:23.630
I think that actually makes you stronger. You know,

980
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:26.690
because guys are fucking idiots and they think because they can do more pushups

981
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:29.660
than their woman, that they're actually, you know, that makes them smarter.

982
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:35.330
You know, I dunno. Ah, my fucking doorbell's ringing. Are you serious?

983
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.491
Hang on a second.

984
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:40.670
I got to go up here and then I gotta I gotta read the rest of this. Hold on.

985
00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:42.290
<v 7>Okay.</v>

986
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:45.910
<v 2>All right. So I'm back. Little winded, but I'm back. I'm back. So anyways,</v>

987
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:51.010
Blahblahblahblahblah it just keeps going on and on and on and on. Um,

988
00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:52.323
where the hell is it?

989
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:54.100
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

990
00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.120
<v 2>Where the hell was I?</v>

991
00:59:55.121 --> 00:59:59.050
A weaker sex and then she tries to break me down psychologically,

992
00:59:59.051 --> 01:00:02.770
but my mom not hugging me. If that's the case,

993
01:00:02.771 --> 01:00:05.080
then I'm sorry for you. I hate when people do that.

994
01:00:05.081 --> 01:00:07.240
It's like you're not sorry for me. You hate me right now. Okay,

995
01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:09.370
so stop acting like you're really sorry for me.

996
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:12.010
And you're showing some sort of empathy. You're not showing empathy,

997
01:00:12.011 --> 01:00:16.910
you're being really selfish. Like I said, I go off on everything here.

998
01:00:16.911 --> 01:00:20.870
I've never said that a woman shouldn't make the same amount and hours a guy.

999
01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:23.690
I never should said that a guy should be able to hit a woman.

1000
01:00:23.691 --> 01:00:24.710
I've never said that.

1001
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:28.370
What the thing I'm trying to shine a light too is that some of these divorce

1002
01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:32.300
settlements are absolutely fucking ridiculous and,

1003
01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.420
and that when a woman cheats on a guy and has,

1004
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.360
has a kid with another person and then the poor sapele married or has to pay for

1005
01:00:39.361 --> 01:00:40.680
that, you don't think that's fucked up.

1006
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:43.080
How would start just did a great story on it. Uh,

1007
01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:44.970
last week somebody sent me an email,

1008
01:00:44.971 --> 01:00:49.971
he did a story about a guy who was in that situation and he refused to play,

1009
01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.340
pay the child support and they said, we're going to send you to jail.

1010
01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:58.770
He's going to go to jail because his wife cheated on him, had unprotected sex.

1011
01:00:58.771 --> 01:01:03.570
Hey to hell with aids. Let's roll the dice with my husband's life. Right.

1012
01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.970
Has unprotected sex, has a kid.

1013
01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.530
He doesn't realize it figures it's his cause. It's his, his wife's pregnant.

1014
01:01:10.531 --> 01:01:13.710
Why wouldn't you think that it's somebody else's? He starts making the payments.

1015
01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:16.980
Next thing you know, he's such raising the kid figures out it's not his kid.

1016
01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.450
And as a natural reaction, I don't want to pay for that. And the like,

1017
01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.340
the law is just like, no, you have to pay for it. Let me ask you this, ma'am.

1018
01:01:23.341 --> 01:01:24.510
Do you have any empathy for that?

1019
01:01:24.511 --> 01:01:29.400
You seem to have all this empathy for women and women's issues and like somehow

1020
01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:34.610
I'm supposed to still respect you despite the fact that you could give a fuck if

1021
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:36.810
there's injustice is done on the other side.

1022
01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.560
It doesn't make any sense and I want to see like,

1023
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:42.200
<v 7>okay,</v>

1024
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.710
<v 2>this is like focusing on this issue. This is an issue.</v>

1025
01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:50.060
For some reason that is just not talked about whatsoever.

1026
01:01:50.061 --> 01:01:51.530
It's just sort of accepted.

1027
01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.030
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

1028
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:55.840
<v 2>and I think it's an absolute, I think it's absolutely deplorable.</v>

1029
01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:59.410
I think it's deplorable. So I, I have the right to talk about it.

1030
01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:00.641
You know what I mean?

1031
01:02:00.641 --> 01:02:04.570
And if you want to get offended and you want to be selfish and just be like,

1032
01:02:04.571 --> 01:02:05.440
well that isn't fair.

1033
01:02:05.441 --> 01:02:09.580
What if I had a whole segment every week and all I did was talk about wife

1034
01:02:09.581 --> 01:02:11.950
beaters. You know what? You'd probably send me an email.

1035
01:02:11.951 --> 01:02:16.450
I just want you to tell you I love your podcast even more. It is just, it's,

1036
01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:17.800
you are just,

1037
01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:21.740
you are a hero to hear a man out there just,

1038
01:02:21.741 --> 01:02:26.610
just letting these, these, these cowardly pieces of shit know that it's,

1039
01:02:26.611 --> 01:02:29.990
you be fucking over the motorbike. Okay.

1040
01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:33.930
But now all of a sudden I'm talking about women who are doing shit that you're

1041
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:34.800
not even doing.

1042
01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.490
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1043
01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:39.740
<v 2>At what point in any of these stupid fucking rants that I [inaudible] done.</v>

1044
01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:43.250
Have I ever said that all women are doing this? I never have. I never said that.

1045
01:02:43.251 --> 01:02:47.090
All women cheat on their husbands and an advocate out of wedlock. I didn't.

1046
01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:51.950
All right. Do I make generalizations? A fucking Lilly, it's a comedy.

1047
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.070
I paint with a broad brush. I'm fucking around. Okay.

1048
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:58.490
Jesus fucking Christ up being so God damn selfish. Okay.

1049
01:02:58.491 --> 01:03:00.260
And if you don't want to listen to my podcast,

1050
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:05.300
don't listen to my podcast anymore. And uh, other than that, you know,

1051
01:03:05.301 --> 01:03:08.540
I mean go fuck yourself. I, I don't, I don't,

1052
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:13.040
I don't know this, what she's doing is, is, is a,

1053
01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:17.540
is a pet peeve that I have. Um,

1054
01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.160
like that happens to me. Like,

1055
01:03:19.161 --> 01:03:21.410
sometimes when I do shows and at the end of my shows,

1056
01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.400
some will come up to me and just be like, look, you know,

1057
01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:29.600
I have a good sense of humor, but, but subject, whatever,

1058
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:33.920
my fucking phone, they'll just be like, you know what? That's never funny.

1059
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:38.000
That is never, oh the lovely Nia. Everybody, hang on one second.

1060
01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.360
Hang on one second. Hello.

1061
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:46.760
Hey, I'm taping my podcast right now. Is this urgent?

1062
01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.720
Are you on the side of the road? We got AAA

1063
01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.913
<v 8>already.</v>

1064
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:56.870
<v 2>No, no. I, I, the dog was farting and I thought I'd had to shit in the house.</v>

1065
01:03:56.871 --> 01:04:00.440
So I took it outside and then it just sniffed around and peed. Yeah,

1066
01:04:00.441 --> 01:04:03.140
it was a pain in the ass. So I'm going to get back to the podcast. All right.

1067
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:08.160
All right. I'll tell you in like a half. Alright, bye. Um,

1068
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:13.620
anyways. Oh, then she goes on to say that the terms I use will then,

1069
01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:17.670
cause you know, people to use the, you know, it's,

1070
01:04:17.671 --> 01:04:19.200
I fuck around and use these terms.

1071
01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:22.440
She then thinks that people are gonna use them seriously. You know what I mean?

1072
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.240
And I'm sure a few will, but that's not on me. Somebody who does that,

1073
01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:31.680
it's because you're a moron and like it's not my responsibility to fucking

1074
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:34.110
babysit anybody once they're an adult.

1075
01:04:34.111 --> 01:04:37.500
If you don't know not to call women these terms. Okay.

1076
01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:41.160
Although I will tell you this, if, uh,

1077
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:47.310
you know, there is a time to call a woman a cunt, okay?

1078
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:51.480
And then that's when you find out that your son is not your son and you still

1079
01:04:51.481 --> 01:04:54.780
have to pay for it. There's a reason that that word does, it does exist.

1080
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:58.890
All right. All right, this sweetheart. So I hope you come back to the podcast.

1081
01:04:58.891 --> 01:05:01.380
I hope that you actually listen and will respond.

1082
01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:04.830
And I don't want to hear another fucking word out of you unless you tell me what

1083
01:05:04.831 --> 01:05:08.040
you think about those kinds of fucking women who do that. Okay.

1084
01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.660
And stop bringing up slavery and all this other shit and try to drag all this

1085
01:05:12.661 --> 01:05:17.010
other crap into it. All right? You stay in your own goddamn lane, sweetheart.

1086
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:18.483
All right?

1087
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:19.420
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1088
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.320
<v 5>Good Lord.</v>

1089
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:21.840
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1090
01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.460
<v 5>So to compare yourself not being able to vote to being enslaved.</v>

1091
01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:27.803
Really.

1092
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.530
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1093
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.200
<v 5>That's another one that gets, that's a whole nother fucking topic.</v>

1094
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:35.610
Every fucking person out there just tries to fucking jump on that,

1095
01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.753
<v 7>you know?</v>

1096
01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:41.880
<v 5>That's our Edward Gow. Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

1097
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.493
I'm Eddie.

1098
01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:53.190
I can't believe you just did that. Why did you flick that big right in my face?

1099
01:05:53.191 --> 01:05:56.160
You burned off two eyebrow hairs. That's my trend.

1100
01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:30.680
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
