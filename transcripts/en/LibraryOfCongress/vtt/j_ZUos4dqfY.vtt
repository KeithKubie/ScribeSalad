00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.050
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.530
Can you all here me all right?

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.020
I'm Ted Widmer, I'm
the brand new Director

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.400
of the John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.980
I want to welcome you all to LJ119
on a day in which we will talk

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.860
about history, we're also
experiencing some history

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.160
across the street.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:45.550
I just checked my laptop and the
Health Bill just passed 217 to 213.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.110
There was a quote last night from a
wavering Republican, Thomas Massie,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.030
Congressman of Kentucky who said,
"This bill is like a kidney stone.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.530
The House doesn't care what
happens to it as long as it passes"

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.190
and it just passed, so if
you hear yelps of pain coming

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.590
from across the street that
may actually be Senators

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.790
because it's now heading
over to their side

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.530
of the Capitol, but
it just happened.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.190 position:56%
We have a very exciting event today.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.040
We will be considering
Church and State,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.880
Moments of Crisis in
American History.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.610
Before we get underway, I
want to say a few words.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.480
First of all, if you can
silence your cellphones

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.180
and other electric devices,
these proceedings will be filmed

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.040
for the Library of Congress and
the Kluge Center websites as well

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.420
as for our YouTube and
iTunes U channels and I want

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.510
to also mention a few
upcoming talks.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.680
On May 16 at four, our
Burkhardt Fellow Shaden Tageldin,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.240
from the University of Minnesota
will be speaking here towards a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.980
transcontinental theory of
modern comparative literature.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.580
On May 18, downstairs in the
Coolidge Auditorium, Elaine Chao,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.640
the Secretary of Transportation
and Reed Hastings,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.880
the CEO of Netflix will be leading
a very interesting conversation

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.180
on service and idealism.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.020
That's part of a tribute
to the Peace Corps

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.960
and to the 100th anniversary
of the birth of John F. Kennedy

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.200
so that's Coolidge Auditorium
at 6:30 on May 18th and then

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.880
on this room again on May
25th, Professor Jose Casanova

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.840
of Georgetown who was until
very recently Kluge Chair

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.270
in the Countries and Cultures
of the South, will be speaking

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.170
on early modern globalization
through a Jesuit prism.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.450
The Kluge Center was
created in the year 2000,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.880 position:56%
17 years ago through a generous gift

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.960
from the philanthropist
John W. Kluge.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.610
Every year it brings nearly
100 scholars to these rooms

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.600
to do research in the
great library here.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.660 position:56%
True to the original founding letter
that created the Kluge Center,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.380
we bring in the words of James
Billington, the former Librarian

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.430
of Congress, "Doers and thinkers."

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.480
We have a rich community
of scholars who come here

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.060
but we also are doing a great deal
to reach out across the street

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.200
to Congress and I'll be talking
about that more during our meetings

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.500
with the Scholars Council
over the next two days.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.140
Among other things, we
award the Kluge Prize.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.400
We're anticipating an
awarding of that prize in 2018,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.340
it's the major prize offered
by the Library of Congress.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.820
Previous recipients include
Fernando Enrique Cardozo,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.540
the former President of Brazil
in 2012, and John Hope Franklin,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.510
the great African-American
historian in 2006.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.430
I mention the Scholars Council and
they are among us today and we're

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.520
so happy to welcome them.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.860
I went this morning to
a history presentation

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.290
at the White House Historical
Association in Lafayette Park

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.500
and the topic was the
early influence of France,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.910
in the very beginning even
before the White House was built

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.530
in the administration of George
Washington and there was a feeling

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.670
that gravitas was much needed in
the early years of the republic.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.150
And so, George Washington and
Martha Washington would have levees

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.200 position:56%
in which they would invite prominent
intellectuals to just settle things

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.080
down when politics
weren't going that well,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.170 position:56%
and that's a tradition we keep going
here at the Library of Congress

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.640
with our Scholars Council
and we're so grateful to them

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.970
for coming literally from around
the world to bring us their wisdom

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.280
and their connectivity
to the outside world.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.370
They bring us a great
deal of prestige.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.070
We have former winners of the
Pulitzer, the Holberg Prize,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.480
the Balzan Prize, the Guggenheim,
Fulbright, many other prizes

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.380
and they also bring many tangible
ideas that we put into practice

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.360
and I want to thank today two
members of our Scholars Council

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.490 position:56%
who will be leaving after this year.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.870
One of them, Roger Louis, I'd like
to thank later tonight but I want

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.060
to mention Pauline Yu who is
among us, because she is flying

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.730
out immediately after this
panel to go to Bloomington,

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.150
Indiana where she will be
the commencement speaker

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.240
at Indiana University and is
receiving an honorary degree.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.820
She's the President of the American
Council of Learned Societies,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.310
an organization that unites
74 scholarly organizations

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.160
and unites them often
far more successfully

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.900
than the federal government unites
the 50 states and she's brought

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.640
so many ideas to the Kluge
Center including in 2008,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.170
she brought the idea of
the Burkhardt Fellowships

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.370
and we've had 11 in disciplines
ranging from law to literature

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.490
and history and they're
a wonderful contribution

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.100
to our community so
thank you Pauline.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.380
I know Dan Turello is here and he
has a gift from the Kluge Center

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.600
to Pauline Yu on behalf of
all of us so please join me

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.510
in thanking Pauline
Yu for her service.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:25.410
[ Applause ]

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.950
&gt;&gt; I mentioned at the beginning

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.930 position:56%
of these remarks what an exciting
day it is in politics in Washington.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.360
We're going to study
another form of public debate

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.390
that has roiled the republic
since its earliest days,

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.510
how religion touches
our daily life here

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.160
in Washington and around
the country.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.140
It wasn't that much noted
in the media this morning

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.530
as they were rushing to
cover today's healthcare vote

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.640
but it's also a day in which
President Trump is asking for well,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.200
he's issuing an executive order

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.800
that will relax the
so-called Johnson Amendment,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.270
which was a law passed by
Lyndon Johnson in 1954,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.550
prohibiting religious organizations
from overt political activity

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.690
for fear of tax consequences
if they did that

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.280
and that is also changing today.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:30.560
Today is the National Day of Prayer
at the White House and last night,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.270
President Trump met with his
evangelical advisory board

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.630
and that's a group of people who
only a year ago were not very happy

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.390
with the candidacy
of President Trump.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.800
These things change very
quickly and at the meeting I went

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.040
to this morning about
the very early republic,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.140 position:56%
it was clear that what we might
call evangelical in the first decade

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.690
of the republic was really
coming from New England

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.770
and from the supporters
of Vice President

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.490
and then President John Adams,

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.640
so these alignments change
substantially from generation

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.510 position:56%
to generation and we're very lucky
to have three leading thinkers today

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.480
to help us consider three
different moments when religion

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.090
and politics intertwined.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.590
We will begin with Sally
Barringer Gordon, who will tell us

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.180
about the way James Madison was
thinking about the separation

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.050
of church and state even before
the famous first amendment

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.570
to the Constitution.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.470
Sally is the Arlin M. Adams
Professor of Constitutional Law

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.650
and Professor of History at
the University of Pennsylvania,

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.820
an expert on religion in American
public life and the law of church

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.880
and state, especially how
religious liberty developed

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.160 position:56%
over the course of American history.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.690
Her current book project, Freedom's
Holy Light, Disestablishment

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.500
in America 1776 to 1876, is

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.750
about the historical relationships
among religion, politics, and law

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.500
and I'm expecting, I have not
quite been able to announce this

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.890
but she will soon be
joining our community

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.740
as a member of the Kluge Center.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.030
Next, Peter Manseau will be
speaking on the year 1860,

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.270
and the forgotten voices of
American religious diversity.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.970
He's the Lilly Endowment Curator
of the American Religious History

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.690 position:56%
at the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.150
the author of six books including
the memoir Vows, the novel Songs

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.810
for the Butcher's Daughter,
the travelogue Rag and Bone,

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.950
and the retelling of America's
diverse spiritual formation,

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.490
One Nation Under Gods.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.260
I only just met Peter but I feel
an immediate kinship with him

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
because during a fellowship
he held in Chesterton,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.660
Maryland he lived in
my former house.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.230 position:56%
And last, we're really lucky to have
a member of our Scholar's Council,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.670 position:56%
John Witte, who will be speaking on
the year 1947, and the Supreme Court

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.640
in the modern era of
Constitutional religious freedom.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.730
John is the Robert W.
Woodruff Professor of Law

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.740 position:56%
and McDonald Distinguished Professor
and Director for the Center

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.690
of the Study of Law and
Religion at Emory University.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.990
He's a specialist in legal history,
marriage law and religious liberty.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:22.040
He's the author of 26 books and 220
articles, that's not a typo, 220.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.390
His writings have appeared in 12
languages, he's received honors

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.570
around the world and he's
a former holder of the Cary

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.410
and Anne McGuire Chair in Ethics
and American History so each

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.570
of these three panelists
will speak for 20 minutes.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.380
At 4:20 roughly, we'll
take a five minute break

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.560 position:56%
and then we will open it to audience
questions so thank you again

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.460
for being here today
and why don't we begin

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.490
by welcoming Sally
Barringer Gordon to the stage?

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.290
Thank you.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:11:09.130
[ Applause ]

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.670
Is this too loud, okay, good?

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:19.070
Okay well my talk today, I'm sorry
to say it's not about Madison

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:26.260
but it is about religion and
slavery in 1785, and it does focus

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.240
on Virginia and Virginia,
as many people here know,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.140
has long been considered the
most important jurisdiction

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.890
to disestablish in
the early republic.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:42.900
I hope to persuade you that a
single anti-slavery Methodist

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.450
and many pro-slavery
Presbyterians were actually crucial

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.180
to disestablishment in Virginia.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.830
I explore two streams of political
activism among lay Virginians

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:01.990
that have not previously
been studied together.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.760
My story centers on two preachers.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.810
Church men are not the only, or
even the only important actors

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.810
in the story, but through
their sermons, lectures,

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:19.170
and journals we can learn about the
common folks who's traces otherwise

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.310
don't appear in the
historical record.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.760
First is this guy, who I described
on the way up as an upstart Brit.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.980
The cherubic little
man, Thomas Coke,

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.110
who was born into a prosperous
English family in 1747,

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.160
educated at Oxford, and
ordained as a Priest

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.390
in the Church of England in 1770.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:46.240
He came under the influence of
John Wesley's evangelical Methodism

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.590
in 1776 and Coke began
preaching in fields,

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:57.320
a good sign in North America,
a very bad sign in Britain.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.120
Influential parishioners
at his church objected.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.260
A new Priest was secretly hired.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.630
Coke was suddenly dismissed
while standing up to preach

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:14.110
on Easter Sunday 1777, and
he was wrung out of church

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.010
like being drummed
out of the military.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:22.040
He strode down the center aisle as
the bells pealed and was greeted

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:28.460
by a mob outside who were already
drunk on cider but he rebounded.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.420
He became John Wesley's confidante,
drafted much of his correspondence,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.290
and all the Methodist
petitions to Parliament.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:43.290
In September 1784, Wesley
ordained Coke as a Bishop

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.630
for the rapidly growing
American branch of the movement.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:52.320
Coke left quickly for America
when his fellow clergy accused him

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.360
of exercising undue influence
over a senile Wesley.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.940
In December 1784, he arrived
in America and began the work

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:09.060
of organizing a new, separate
Methodist church here.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.510
In early 1785, Coke
drafted new rules

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.280
for the church in a
book of discipline.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.500
Coke's rules were designed
to eradicate slavery.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.720
He included provisions that copied
Virginia's Manumission statue

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.600
that allowed masters to free
slaves in the Commonwealth.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.970
That statute had been enacted
in 1782, and by early 1785,

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:41.550
had produced Manumissions
but also dedicated opposition

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.410
from a pro-slavery majority.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.450
Coke took Manumission
a step further.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.530
He required that all church
members manumit their slaves

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:57.840
within two years or be denied
communion and eventually expelled.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.400
After the church was formed
and its discipline written,

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.510
Coke left on a preaching
tour of Virginia.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.720
From February to April 1785,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.640
he sermonized against the
unchristian act of slave holding.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.590
He reported in his
journal repeatedly

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.080
that he was greeted by
outrage and violence.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.600
When he preached near Norfolk
and here I'm quoting from him,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.560
"A high headed lady offered 50
pounds to anyone who would give

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.370
that little Englishman 100 lashes."

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.520
At another house, Coke debated
slavery with a Colonel Bedford who,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.740 position:56%
"Used some threats" and as Coke's
reputation spread, doors were closed

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.580
against him, he was
indicted for sedition

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:49.680
and at least one plan was formed
to murder him but he left the state

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.480
in May, before the law or the
assassins could catch up with him.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.370
But he left behind an
antislavery petition,

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.770
which he gave to itinerant
Methodist evangelists

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.460
to carry around Virginia.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.520
In the petition, Coke
called for the legislature

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.830
to abolish the grand
abomination of slavery.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:17.650
He argued that slaveholders acted
against the most fundamental goal

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.490
of Christianity, the
return of the Messiah.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.360
He said that enslavement made it
virtually impossible for a slave

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.640
to receive the noble
principles of the Gospel meaning

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.650
that slaveholders actively
prevented Christian progress.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.960
The boldness of Coke's claims
might well cause an uproar

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:45.450
because he argued that anyone who
owned a slave was anti-Christian

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:50.520
and the tone deaf Coke added
another insult, a political one.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.730
As an Englishman, he should
have known that his opinions

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.990
on the American Revolution might
not be well received in Virginia.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.780
None the less, his petition
claimed that, and here I'm quoting,

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.220
"The oppression exercised

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.450
over slaves exceeds the
oppression formerly exercised

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.180 position:56%
over these states by Great Britain."

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.910
These were fighting
words and William Graham,

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.780
our second preacher,
picked up the gauntlet.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.770
Graham was born in 1746,
in Paxton, Pennsylvania.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.600
His family were Scott's Irish
covenanters, that is Presbyterians

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.460
who still remembered the
brutal British suppression

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.530
of the Scottish rebellion
in the 17th century.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.730
Graham hated the British and
maintained a lifelong sympathy

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.950
for populist vigilante movements.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.270
In many senses, this guy
Graham was Coke's opposite.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:52.150
He was hatchet faced and
lanky, not a gifted speaker.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:57.570
His sermons were monotonous and
he was a strict disciplinarian.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:03.490 position:56%
His congregations tended to be small
but he excelled as a schoolmaster,

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.220
where his discipline was
imposed on less powerful objects.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:13.810
The school he founded was first
known as the Liberty Hall Academy

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:17.290
and now Washington
and Lee University.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:22.850 position:56%
It was successful, but it never
made him much money, which brings us

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.010
to my next point, the
question of minister's salaries

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:32.090
and how the debate over tax support
for preachers eventually blended

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.440
in to the backlash
against Thomas Coke.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.060
In December 1784, Patrick
Henry proposed a bill

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.940
that would require each taxpayer
to designate a portion of his taxes

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.080
to a Christian minister
of his choice.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.590
This general assessment bill, as it
was called, seemed like a good idea

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.680 position:56%
to Henry and others, who worried
about a decline in church attendance

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.000 position:56%
and the closing of schools
maintained by the established Church

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.930
of England clergy, many of whose
churches had been looted during the

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:12.020
revolution and whose tax support
had been suspended since 1776.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.650
By 1784, the church
was in free fall.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:22.060
Presbyterians were
actually sympathetic.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.290
Graham often wrote petitions to the
Virginia General Assembly on behalf

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.520
of the church and now he
co-authored an endorsement

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.820
of the assessment bill.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.670
Graham had been dismayed by
enlightenment deism which I'm sorry

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.810
to tell you Ted, he
called the French Principle

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.960
but equally important, Graham's
income had suffered terribly during

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.000
the revolution even though
he was an ardent patriot.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.990
He was so patriotic that one
Sunday sermon he used to call

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:58.080
for volunteers to fight
against the British and he wound

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.090
up keying himself up so
much he volunteered himself.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.860
He never saw action but he boasted
of his service to the revolution

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.890
for the rest of his life.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.800
Yet, the conflict impoverished him
because all his students went off

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.880
to fight and the end of the war
only brought a deep recession.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.520
Patrick Henry's general assessment
bill gave him the prospect

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:28.570
of a steady income but Graham soon
learned that the Presbytian laity,

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:33.000
his congregants, would not
stand for a general assessment.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.510
They had been used to controlling
the salaries of ministers

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:43.360
and they objected that Henry's bill
would free clergy from lay control.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.620
Graham was not known to
back away from a fight,

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.100
he was quite a pugilist, and he
might well have stood his ground

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:55.090
on the general assessment bill
but slavery entered the picture.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.280
Coke appeared on the scene just

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.050
after Graham's pro-assessment
petition was submitted.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:06.020
Coke of course, was British,
elite, arrogant, plump,

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.890 position:56%
tailor-made to be Graham's chew toy.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:13.800
The threat to slavey from
Coke affected Graham directly.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.330
He owned six slaves, according
to the census of 1790,

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.350
and his school Liberty
Hall also owned slaves.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:27.190
By the mid-spring of 1785, in
other words coinciding exactly

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.930
with Coke's tour, it sounds
so funny Coke's tour right,

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.720
because there's a [inaudible]
but it's a different Coke.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.730
By the mid-spring of 1785, Graham's
about face on disestablishment was

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.610
so complete that Presbyterians
selected him once again

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.250
to draft a petition, this one,

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:53.860
a full-throated call
for disestablishment.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.390 position:56%
Now, Graham argued that patriots had
fought against British oppression

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:03.490
in spirituals as well as temporals,
that it was a religious war

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.980
and that continued establishment
would be a fatal symbol

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.350
of what he called abject slavery.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.250
For the first time, a
religious organization,

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.990
the Presbyterian Church,
directly called for passage

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:21.550
of Thomas Jefferson's bill for
establishing religious freedom,

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.270
which had been kicking
around the legislature

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.250
for years without much support.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:32.120
All of a sudden, in
1785, popular support

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.710
for disestablishment took off.

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.250
The traditional explanation
(gesture to Ted) is

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:45.130 position:56%
that smart Parliamentary maneuvering
by James Madison deserves credit

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.220
but I want us to think about
another side of the story,

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:53.630
the missing link is Thomas
Coke's anti-slavery campaign,

00:22:53.630 --> 00:23:00.650
which convinced Graham and others
of a link between pro-slavery

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:05.210
and pro-disestablishment or
anti-slavery and pro-establishment,

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.640 position:56%
they're flip sides of the same coin.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.660
Graham explained how
separation of church

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.820
and state would protect slavery.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:19.830
He also became the first clergyman
and the first academic leader

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:24.180
to speak out in favor
of slavery and he did

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.730
so clearly in response to Coke.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.360
In a lecture that Graham
gave at Liberty Hall starting

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:37.940
in the mid-1780s, he explained why
Virginia must embrace both slavery

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.900
and disestablishment and how
each reinforced the other.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:48.180
Not only had the revolution been
fought to secure slavery he said,

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:52.700
but now a tool of the British
administration meaning our pale

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:58.570
Coke, had undertaken to reverse the
American victory, hiding his plot

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:03.630
to destroy the country
behind the veil of piety.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.900
Graham answered Coke in an
equally religious register.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:13.170 position:56%
The word of God, Graham said,
directly contradicted the Methodists

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.680
and as Coke's petition was
carried around the Commonwealth

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:22.590 position:56%
by Methodist itinerants, Graham and
pro-slavery petitions outpaced them,

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:35.050
drawing many hundreds, about
1,500 evangelical signatures

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:42.150
and dwarfing the few dozen
on the anti-slavery petition.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:46.200
The pro-slavery petitions track
Graham's lecture almost word

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.500
for word.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.140
The central argument was that
Christian scripture did not

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.700
in any sense condemn
slavery and that any attempt

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.120
to interpret either the
Old or New Testaments

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.240
as anti-slavery would
pervert the word of God.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.060
Instead, scripture instructed that
religious status such as conversion

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:13.820
to Christianity in no way altered
civil status such as enslavement.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.420
The liberty conferred by Christian
faith was an internal freedom

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.720
from sin and the devil
rather than any change

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.940 position:56%
in the believer's outward condition.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.750
Paul's First Letter to the
Corinthians established

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.410
that even Christian
slaves were to remain loyal

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.500
and obedient to their masters.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.280
Colonial statues had written
this into law as early as 1677.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.740
Conversion was not a
ticket to emancipation.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:48.770
In other words, spiritual freedom
and bodily coercion belonged

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:53.850
to two distinct spheres, the
first inward and religious

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.630
and the second outward
and political.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.910
These scriptural arguments
were made with new force

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.620
to counter the Methodists,

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:08.460 position:56%
who charged that bondage affected
the spiritual health of slaveholders

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.070
and urged changes in the
secular law to save the souls

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.000
of masters as well as slaves.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.820
The danger to slavery was apparent
and Graham and others realized

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:25.210
that antislavery religion had
been let loose in Virginia.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.820
Under the general assessment
bill, just to give one example,

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.100
tax dollars could well flow to
antislavery ministers either

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.740
because the individual taxpayers
directed the funds to preachers

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.860 position:56%
who opposed slavery or the ministers
who received tax funding acted

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.230
at the behest of church
leaders like Coke.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:51.260
A religious establishment
therefore posed a danger.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:56.550
Separation of church and state in
Virginia was built on this distrust

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:02.230
of clergy, who were not dependent
directly on local congregations,

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:07.460 position:56%
set them free from their congregants
and who knows what would happen.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.850
Evidence for this overlap
in commitments to slavery

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.510
and disestablishment is
found in the signatures

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.920
on both sets of petitions.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.840
That is, pro-establishment
and proslavery.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.780
We can trace the political
actions of the laity

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.570
through this unique resource.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.430
Five of the six counties
that memorialized in favor

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:35.340
of slavery also sent
pro-disestablishment petitions.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:39.760
Common signatures are found in
about 40 percent of the total,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.760
a remarkable convergence of
religious and political activism.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.030
In his convergence, religious
conviction was painted as private

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:55.180
and personal while enslavement
rested firmly on the political side

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.460
that is, with the legislature.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:03.070
One might think of this
resolution as a kind of compromise,

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:08.100
proslavery evangelicals apparently
believed they could buy peace

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.460
by parking slavery in
the political realm.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.060
They told themselves that they
were neutral or apolitical

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.160
on the question even as their
doctrine of the division

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.110
between religion and politics
clearly protected a proslavery

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:27.870
status quo and the system worked.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.570
It silenced antislavery voices
quickly and effectively.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:38.680
Thomas Coke conceded in 1787,
that it had been ill judged of him

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.780
to preach antislavery from
the pulpit and in 1791,

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.820
the Hanover Presbyterian
(we saw a picture

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.000
of their beautiful church) decided

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.780
that enslaved persons could be
married in the sight of God,

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.840
even though the civil law would
not recognize their relationship.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.620
But if one of the spouses
was sold away from the other,

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:04.740
then the marriage was dissolved
as if the other was dead.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:09.150
Baptists also endorses a death
or removal standard saying

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.260
that any other policy might
yield unpleasant things.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.630
Such marriages were a
potentially enormous issue.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.000
One study concluded
that one out of three

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.890
of all slave marriages
was terminated

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.870
by the internal slave
trade, that's a lot.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.840
Acceptance of the divide
between freedom of the spirit

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.480 position:56%
and the physical coercion of slavery
also spread among the Methodists.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.600
By the mid-1790s, they
had backed away

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.790
from their emancipatory
rules saying now

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.360
that they hoped Christian faith
would sweeten the bitter cup

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.930
of bondage.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:52.730
Some white evangelicals objected
including one Methodist minister

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:58.100
in the 1790s who said that human
laws could not wash away the guilt

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.110
of an act prohibited
by the word of God.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:06.910
But his son, also a Methodist
minister, became a slaveholder.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:12.390
So where does this story of
freedom and coercion leave us?

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:15.160
It's a different picture
of disestablishment,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.410
maybe a little less heroic
but believable in light

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.460
of religious history and
political reality and of course,

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.210
there's the question of Jefferson.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.510
What did he think?

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.690
He was out of the country in 1785,

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.880
but he also followed
the debate closely.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.990
Did he accept the divide
between freedom and coercion?

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.870 position:56%
It looks like he did 20 years later.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:45.710
A clue from 1815 is found in a
letter he wrote to a correspondent

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.810
who had sent him a book of sermons

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:51.180
by the Reverend Alexander
MacLeod of New York.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.840
MacLeod called for
preaching on politics,

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.710 position:56%
especially in opposition to slavery.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.890
In his letter, Jefferson thanked
his correspondent for the book

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.350
but then said that MacLeod
had breached the contract

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.340
that underlay religious freedom

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.250
by discussing public
affairs in the pulpit.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:14.870
He advised ministers to avoid
such topics as the construction

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.180
of government or the
characters or conduct

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.440 position:56%
of those administering it otherwise,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.750
they would violate the
terms of disestablishment.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:30.810
We're seeing a similar debate
today right, flipping that.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:35.210
But despite Virginia's outsized
importance in the early republic,

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:39.950 position:56%
it didn't actually control how other
jurisdictions interpreted their

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.580
own law.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.140
The Virginia model, as it was
called in the 19th century,

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.600
never governed separation of
church and state as perfectly

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.600
as Virginia's secular thinkers

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.170
and proslavery Christians
hoped it would.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:32:00.370
Instead, the mandate to
consign concerns about slavery

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.460
to the political sphere began
to create its own politics.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:10.270
Those who could not stand the
constraint often left and many

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.540
who had no other choice
were sold away.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.770
Some found their way
to freedom and those

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:20.790
who had left voluntarily
still resented the strictures.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.930
Over time, the strict
divide between religion

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:28.580
and slavery began to
work its own undoing.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:33.610
The end of that story is beyond the
scope of my talk today but one way

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.760
to summarize the trajectory
is to note that the first wall

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.840
of separation was all about power,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.490
but it wound up not
being all powerful.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.290
Thank you.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:33:00.270
[ Applause ]

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:04.560
&gt;&gt; Thank you Sally, that
was somewhat mind blowing

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.440
and thank you Ted, for
the earlier introduction.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.960
It's wonderful to be here with you.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.710
My name is Peter Manseau.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.970
I work down the road at the
National Museum of American History

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.640
where I'm the Curator of
American Religious History

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.910
and this is my first time
speaking in a building

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.460
where I've done quite
a lot of research

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.510
so it's truly an honor to be here.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.950
I would like to speak with
you a bit today about religion

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:35.950
in America before the
Civil War and one way

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:39.070
in which the subject is often
addressed has a lot of resonance

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:44.440
with Sally's talk, it
often is explored as a way

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.640
of exploring the tensions
among Christians

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.170
about the place of
slavery in scripture.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.840
How was it that some religious
people saw it as an abomination

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.030
like our Reverend Coke we just
heard about, while others argued

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:00.280
as Texas did in its
causes for secession

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.270
that African servitude was
authorized and revealed

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:08.120
by the revered will of
the almighty creator?

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.610
Well, that religion can be
used to argue both sides

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.350
of an issue will not be a surprise
to anyone here today I imagine

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.280 position:56%
and so instead of pursing that
dimension, I'd like instead to focus

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.640
on a lesser known aspect of
religion in America in the middle

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.430
of the 19th century and that
is the struggle and endurance

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:29.560
of forgotten forms of
American religious diversity.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.680
The landscape of American
religious difference

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.600
in the US changed dramatically
in the 1860s.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.500
Some of this had to do with the
war and some of it simply had to do

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.640
with the ways in which the lines
between religious traditions tend

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:50.800
to blur over time yet before
I get there to my main topic,

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.320 position:56%
since this is my first time
speaking in the Library of Congress,

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.390
I can't resist telling you
one of my favorite stories

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:01.510
about a disagreement
concerning religious differences

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:02.980
in American history.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.690
It's a story that actually
has to do with the founding

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.490
of this great institution.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:11.880
As many of you will likely
know and as I heard someone,

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:16.720
a tour guide giving a tour about
this just as I was walking in,

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.420
the founding collection of
the Library of Congress came

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:25.120
from Monticello to Washington 202
years ago this spring in the form

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:30.360
of 6,487 books that
Thomas Jefferson had sold

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.890
to the federal government near
the end of the War of 1812.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.690
Congress had a reference
collection before that of course,

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.100
but it was a little
less than half the size

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.340
and those 3,000 books
had gone up in smoke

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.950
when the British burned
Washington in August of 1814.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.440
Jefferson had been retired
for five years by then

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.760
and so he didn't get a briefing
on the fact that the White House,

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.670
the Capitol and other
federal buildings had been all

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.970
but destroyed.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:02.990 position:56%
Instead, he learned about it as many
of us might have, he read about it

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:07.540
in the newspaper and apparently
one of the first things he thought

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:11.230
about when he learned of the
destruction were all those books

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:16.060
in the Capitol, all that
paper that fueled the fire.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:19.300
Wondering what he might do
about it and perhaps considering

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.780
if this sad turn of events
might also free up some space

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.130
in his own over-burdened
bookshelves, Jefferson wrote

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.440
to a friend on the
Congressional Library Committee

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.440
and he basically said, so I
hear you might need some books.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:37.580
What he actually wrote was this,
"I learned from the newspapers

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:42.370 position:56%
that the vandalism of our enemy has
triumphed at Washington over science

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:46.260
as well as the arts by the
destruction of the public library

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.480
with a noble edifice in
which it was deposited.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.400
I presume it will be among the
earliest objects of Congress

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.740
to re-commence their collection."

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.130
Jefferson was beating
around the bush a bit here.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:01.840
He was clearing his throat before
making Congress an offer he hoped

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.140
they could not refuse.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:07.090
As he then explained,
like a true salesman,

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:10.940
the books he had available
were the best in the land.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.250
They were the best because
only he had had the resources

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.790
and the time throughout his
life to do the kind of research

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:22.620
and travel necessary to acquire
a significant collection.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.000
He proudly noted that he had spent
much of his time as US Minister

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.100
to France shopping for books.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.360
While residing in Paris, he
said, he devoted every afternoon

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.880
to examining all the principle
bookstores, turning over every book

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:43.310
with his own hands, apparently
unconcerned if anyone would wonder

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.890
if he was also doing his job,
Jefferson sent this letter off

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:53.440
to Washington and those 6,487
books soon followed on 10 wagons

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.610
that traveled more than
100 miles over bumpy roads.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.010
But their journey from
that Virginia hilltop

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:04.230 position:56%
to Capitol Hill was far from simple.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:08.390 position:56%
In between Jefferson's letter in the
fall and the loading of the wagons

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:13.810
in the spring, his books became
the focus of a remarkable debate.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:17.850
It raged in the press and
in Congress for months.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:22.600 position:56%
It's subject was the possibly
atheistical character of the library

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.430
and of the man who had acquired it.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:30.410
It was said that Jefferson's
books were full of infidel ideas,

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.720
ideas that might infect the
nation if they were allowed

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.360
into the halls of government.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.490
With the smoke of British arson
still lingering over Washington,

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:44.570
some members of Congress even
discussed burning the offending

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:46.640
titles in Jefferson's library

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.900
to avoid potential
spiritual contamination.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.590
This campaign was led by a
federalist representative

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:58.110 position:56%
from my home state of Massachusetts,
Representative Cyrus King,

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:03.170 position:56%
who argued that evidence Jefferson's
collection contained "Many books

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:07.130
of irreligious and immoral
tendency could be found not only

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:10.320
in the character of the man who's
assembled it, but in the fact

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.140
that he had done so in France."

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.730
Other congressmen found King's talk
of book burning too much to take.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:22.190
Representative James Fiske of
Vermont, a democratic republican

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:25.710
like Jefferson, reminded his
colleagues that King came

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:29.540
from a state once known for hanging
witches and he wondered whether

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:33.150 position:56%
that practice might be reintroduced.

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:36.040
Maryland's Representative
Robert Wright asked King

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.160
if he wanted to start
an inquisition.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.560
To this charge, King replied
that he had no such intention,

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.020
at least not while his
party was in the minority.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.320
In the end, party politics
ruled the day.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.230
By a slim margin, the democratic
republican majority approved

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:56.090
the purchase.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.040
Now, I mentioned this story
first of all as a reminder

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.280
that Americans have been struggling

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.120
with overheated rhetoric
surrounding religious difference

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:09.130
for a very long time and maybe
we should count ourselves lucky

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.900
that we don't hear much talk

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.310
of hanging witches or
burning books lately.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:15.610
Not lately.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.920
Yet the truly fascinating thing
to me about this moment is this,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.500
while in Washington, Jefferson's
tastes seemed eclectic to the point

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.630
of being threatening, in fact
they barely scratched the surface

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:32.440
of the actual religious diversity
that existed beyond the Capitol.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.660
While government was arguing over
religious ideas, it was oblivious

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:41.110
to many forms of religious
practice then found in the US.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:44.780
For example, among the
best known books included

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.940 position:56%
in that original Jefferson
collection which came to the Library

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:56.960
of Congress was this one,
Jefferson's 1734 edition

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.320
of the Koran, which remains
here in the library today.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.320
Now, Jefferson's Koran is often
put forward as a symbol of some

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.590
of the founding generations
curiosity about a variety

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.830
of religious perspectives and
on the one hand it's appropriate

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.130
to see it that way.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.160
Jefferson bought the book while
he was a young man studying law

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.350
and he may have read it as
a way to make himself aware

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:24.010
of Islam's influence on some
of the world's legal systems.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:29.020
Yet, viewing Jefferson's Koran
only as an American engagement

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:35.630
with far off exotic beliefs
obscures a crucial fact.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.620
To many people living then
in Jefferson's young nation,

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.960
this book meant very much more.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.970
As Jefferson's library rolled
north and his Koran went with it,

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:56.370
this man was a 45-year-old resident
of Fayetteville, North Carolina.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:57.670
His name is Omar ibn Said.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:03.650
In 1815, he had been in this
country just eight years,

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.660
all of them under the yoke of
a master he called a cruel man

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.860 position:56%
and a kefyr, which means an infidel.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:14.380
After he was recaptured following
an attempt to escape from slavery,

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.010
Omar ibn Said was locked
inside the County Jail

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.970
in Cumberland County,
North Carolina.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.930
By this point, it was
no longer legal

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.880 position:56%
to directly import human beings from
Africa and so for many residents

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.730
of Fayetteville, it may have been
unusual to see a man who maintained

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.350
so many of the traditions of
the land where he was born.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:37.810 position:56%
Now, while locked in his jail cell
in Fayetteville, Omar ibn Said began

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:43.440
to draw a crowd first for his quiet
and some said mysterious demeanor,

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:48.840 position:56%
then for the strange way in which he
prayed five times a day and finally,

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:53.980
for the graffiti that he began
to put on his jail cell walls.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.250
Apparently, he had found some
coals from a warming fire

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.300
that were large enough to
write with and he began

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.850
to fill his jail cell
walls with Arabic script,

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.550
most likely it was
verses from the Koran.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.540
As his story became known,

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.400
it emerged that he had once
been a religious teacher.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.710 position:56%
He had been 37 years old when he was
captured in what was now Senegal.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:21.550
After his time in jail, Omar
ibn Said became the property

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:25.070
of a prominent local political
family, which encouraged him

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.490
to convert to Christianity
and soon persuaded him

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.310
to write an account of his life.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.640
Through the decades that followed,
this family was successful

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:39.260
in publicizing their successful
conversion of their enslaved man

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.420
and they placed articles about
him throughout the United States.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:47.480
In 1825, a Philadelphia Christian
paper told the story of his time

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.300 position:56%
in jail, which recounted his filling
the walls with Arabic graffiti

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.430
and it also relayed how he had
been brought to his new faith.

00:43:54.430 --> 00:44:00.880
In 1837, an article in the Boston
Reporter hailed him as a convert

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.930
from Mohammedism and it
devoted two full columns

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:06.980
to his Christian virtues.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.740
In 1854, a reporter
wrote that he had,

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.230
"Thrown aside the blood
stained Koran and now worships

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.180 position:56%
at the feet of the Prince of Peace."

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:22.290
In all of this, it was claimed
that though he was still enslaved,

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:27.120
he wore no bonds but those
of gratitude and affection.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:33.970
Yet, a very different story was
told by Omar ibn Said himself.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:40.680
He originally wrote the account
of his experiences in Arabic,

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.300
which those taking credit for his
conversion could not read very well

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.360
and in fact, his original
account was not translated

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.950
for a full I believe it's 17 years

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:53.640
after he wrote his
account in Arabic.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.370
And if they had been able to
read his original account,

00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:01.800
they would have seen his adoption
of Christianity stated sincerely

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.030
but also in very practical terms.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:11.040
"In freedom" he said, "He had
prayed as a Muslim but now,

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.820
enslaved he would say
the Lord's Prayer."

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:18.780
He also filled his text with
prophetic declarations directed

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.860
at those who had enslaved him.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:27.270
"Oh people of America, oh people of
North Carolina," he wrote in 1831,

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.830
"Do you have a good
generation that fears Allah?

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:35.160
Are you confident that he who is
in heaven will not cause the earth

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.740
to cave in beneath you
so that it will shake

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.040
to pieces and overwhelm you?"

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:46.430
Even after his conversion, Islam
continued to shape his experience

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:50.380
of his enslavement and in
this, he was not alone.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:55.220
An estimated 20 percent of the
enslaved men and women brought

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.640
to the Americas were Muslims.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.730
Some plantation owners made
it a point to add Muslims

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.480
to their labor force,
relying on their experience

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.390
with the cultivation
of indigo and rice.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:10.160
Muslim names and religious titles
appear in slave inventories

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.540
and death records and all
of this, I should add,

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.530
was fairly common knowledge
at the time.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:20.310
Every so often in the 18th
and 19th century press,

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:24.200
other enslaved Muslims
became celebrities of a sort,

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.620
most often because they
were discovered by white men

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.460
who were struck by their erudition.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:34.240
The earliest known example of this
was a man who at the time was known

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.740
as Job Ben Solomon and
he's now known more often

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:43.870
as Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, who was
enslaved in Maryland in the 1730s.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:49.030 position:56%
After an escape attempt, he was like
Omar ibn Said, put in a jailhouse

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:52.710
and there he met a local judge,
who was so taken with him

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.620
that he wrote a book
about their encounter.

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:03.750
This is the Memoirs of the Life of
Job 1734, by Judge Thomas Bluett.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:09.950
As the judge wrote, "He showed upon
all occasions a singular veneration

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:13.440
for the name of God, and never
pronounced the word Allah

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.360
without a peculiar accent and
a remarkable pause and indeed,

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.030
his notions of God, providence,
and a future state were

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:24.670
in the main very just
and reasonable."

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:27.740
The most famous of these enslaved
Muslims who found their way

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:31.390
into the American press
was probably this man,

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:35.590
a man named Abdul-Rahman Ibrahim.

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:42.520
In the press of the 1820s, he
was known as the Moorish Prince,

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.150
and he came from an important
political family in his homeland

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:47.350
of Timbuktu, now in Mali.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:50.030
His plight drew wide
attention in the 1820s,

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:56.770
with newspaper stories
written around the country.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:59.890
Eventually, several well placed
supporters including Secretary

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:03.750
of State Henry Clay and through
him, President John Quincy Adams,

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:08.780
helped win his freedom and his
eventual relocation to Liberia.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.650
Now, before he left, he offered
a pointed critique of religion

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:16.170
in the country in which he had
been enslaved for 40 years.

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:19.410
As one newspaper account
noted, "He had read the Bible

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:23.830
and admired its precepts but
added his principal objections are

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:26.460 position:56%
that Christians do not follow them."

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.050
The story of Islam in early
America is not merely one

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:33.490
of isolated individuals however.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.520
Even being conservative in
counting their population,

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.360
we're talking about tens
of thousands of people.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.390
To compare them to other
religious minorities at the time,

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:46.670
we might consider that around 1800
there were some 40,000 Catholics,

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:49.280
there were probably four
or five thousand Jews.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.740
It's entirely possible that
there were more individuals

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.700
with a connection to Islam at
that point in American history

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.360
than Catholics and Jews combined.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.860
Now, some of this community
tried to preserve the traditions

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.120
in which they were raised in
hope of establishing communities

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.530
with the same beliefs and practices

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.710
that had sustained them
before enslavement.

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:16.190 position:56%
Evidence of this can be seen in this
religious text, written in Arabic

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:20.360 position:56%
in Georgia early in the 19th
century and if I'm permitted a plug,

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.570
I should say that opening this
June at the National Museum

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:26.400
of American History our exhibit,

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.630
Religion in Early America will
feature this document along

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:32.430
with the story of Omar ibn Said.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:36.490
The author of this document is
a man named Bilali Muhammad and,

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:41.980 position:56%
like Omar ibn Said, he was born in
West Africa, most likely around 1770

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:45.160
and he arrived in the
Americas in his 30s.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.210
He was purchased at Charleston,
South Carolina and brought

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:52.700
to a cotton plantation on Sapelo
Island off the Georgia coast.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:57.010
Literate and multilingual,
Bilali rose to a trusted position

00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.810
on that island, even being
allowed to train other enslaved men

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:05.940
with muskets for defense of the
island during the War of 1812.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.710
He seems also to have played a
role as a religious leader there.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:14.060
This 13 page document was once
thought to be simply his diary

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.550
but recent scholarships suggest
that it actually outlined some

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:20.460
of the very basics
of Islamic practice.

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.030
This is how we wash our
hands before prayer,

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:25.380
this is how we wash
our feet before prayer,

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.810
these are the times
at which we pray.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:32.620
Unlike Omar ibn Said, who in
his dislocation from anyone

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:36.440
who shared his faith, in that
dislocation he became open

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.340
to conversion but Bilali
Muhammad, against all odds,

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.300
seems to have been part
of a religious community.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:47.280
Not only were there other Muslims
on Sapelo Island who looked to him

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.760
as their leader, he had 12
sons and seven daughters,

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.280
all of whom were said
to pray by kneeling

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.230
and bowing facing east
on woven mats.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:00.950
It may have been for
those 19 children

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.150
that he wrote these
instructions and a further note

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:06.880
about these instructions,
scholars who work

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:12.620 position:56%
with the document today suggest
that the way he uses language speaks

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.690
of a person who is in the process
of forgetting, who is fighting

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.420
against that forgetting by
writing what he can remember.

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:24.790
There are short excerpts from known
texts, there are repeated lines,

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.740 position:56%
and he's trying to get down on paper

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.730
for the following generations
everything he could

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.740
possibly remember.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:35.020
Yet, despite these best efforts
to pass along his traditions,

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:40.690
Islam did not long endure there
or anywhere else and a clue

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:44.780
to what happened can be found in
the words of a missionary traveling

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.480
through the south to preach on
slave plantations in the middle

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.790
of the 19th century, a missionary
named Charles Colcock Jones.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:56.290
"Many Muhammed and Africans"
he noted, "had found ways

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:59.350
to (his word) accommodate Islam

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:03.250
to the new beliefs
being imposed upon them.

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:07.690
God say they is Allah and
Jesus Christ is Muhammed.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:09.440
The religion is the same

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.090
but different countries
have different names."

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:17.010 position:56%
Now, this missionary considered this
to be evidence of Muslims inability

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:21.630
to recognize the importance of
religious truths but in fact,

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:25.020
it seems to prove exactly
the opposite.

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.740
They understood that their
faith was important enough

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:31.380
that they should listen for it
everywhere, even in a country

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.590
so distant from the places where
they had once heard the call

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:38.430
to prayer, even in a nation
where only non-Muslins

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:42.040
like Thomas Jefferson
were able to own a Koran.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:46.720
I mentioned at the outset that
this mostly forgotten dimension

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.810
of American religious
diversity changed dramatically

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:52.950
around the year 1860.

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:55.660
One reason for this is simply time.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.130
Omar ibn Said and Bilali Muhammed,

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:01.270
the two of the four figures
I mentioned who remained

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:04.920
in this country, they
both died around 1860.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:09.110
A number of dates has been
given for the death of each,

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:12.870
some before the war and some
after but it's clear that neither

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:16.120
of them lived to see freedom.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:19.320
They were among the last of
the enslaved with memories

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:22.640
of their birth countries
and so direct connection

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.210
to the religious traditions
they had brought

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.540
with them passed with
that generation.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:30.240
A second reason for the
disappearance of Muslims

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.700
at this point in US
history has to do

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.820
with the consequences
of the Civil War.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.050
After emancipation establishment

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:42.340
of Black churches throughout
the south begins in earnest.

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.340
Houses of worship become
focal points

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.470
for newly liberated
communities while missionaries

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:52.700 position:56%
from free Black denominations of the
north arrive both to provide support

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:57.130
and to convert those who were
still outside of the church.

00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:00.800
Through the decades that follow,
Christianity becomes broadly

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.490
and irrevocably one of the
most significant elements

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:06.860
of African-American life.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.620
The many religious expressions
that have been brought together

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:13.240
by slavery were now subsumed
within a single faith.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:18.490
Yet, the important thing to
remember is that the disappearance

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:21.600
of religious traditions
doesn't always mean the end

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.490
of their influence.

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:27.520
We can hear echoes of early
American Islam in fact

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.450
in early American Christianity
and even today,

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:35.610 position:56%
and even in our broader culture,
particularly in musical styles borne

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:40.470 position:56%
of the ritual known as the ring
shout, the primary ritual experience

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:44.440
of early African-American
religious observants,

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:50.020
which bears some resemblance to
Muslim ceremonies and is thought

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.690 position:56%
by some scholars to have contributed
not just to the common style

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:57.400
of worship but to the
blues and to jazz.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:02.170
Now, in conclusion, I'd like to
say that I focused on Islam here

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:05.700
because it provides a real stark
example of the way religious

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.230
and cultural practices
can be forgotten even

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:12.700
if they were once common knowledge
but we could tell similar stories

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:20.670 position:56%
of many other traditions and I like
to think that like those 6,487 books

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:25.280
that were planted here, that have
grown into a library of millions,

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.180
we should believe and we should
remember that all the beliefs

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:33.830
of our past, even those
that have been forgotten,

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.230
they're part of our common history.

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:38.030
Thank you.

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:48.800
[ Applause ]

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.400
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a joy to be back
here at the Library of Congress

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:55.260
and the Kluge Center and to
learn from Ted, and from Sally,

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.700
and from Peter in these
wonderful lectures.

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.850
I was instructed to give
some informal remarks

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:04.330
and I guess my distinguished
colleagues heard the same

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:07.690
instruction but, as good scholars,
they have given formal papers.

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:12.040
I have come with my bumpkin tuba
solo to talk with you a little bit

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:17.190
about the period 1940 to
1947, which is the period

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:20.940
in which the United States
Supreme Court created the modern

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:24.650
constitutional law of religious
freedom on the strength

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:28.500
of the first amendment and its
guarantees of no establishment

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:33.590
of religion and no prohibition
on its free exercise.

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:40.530
Before 1940, between 1791 and
1940, only 23 cases arising

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:44.180
under the first amendment religion
clauses reached the United States

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.220
Supreme Court and in not one

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:50.390
of those cases did the court
find an establishment of religion

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:53.850
or a violation of free
exercise rights.

00:56:53.850 --> 00:57:01.130
After 1940, 183 Supreme Court cases
were heard on the religion clauses

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:05.110
of the first amendment and
attendant statutory protections

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:09.930 position:56%
of religious freedom, more than half
of which were findings of violations

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:14.220
of either the establishment clause
or the free exercise clause.

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:19.610
Clearly, something changed
dramatically in the 1940s and I'd

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:22.170
like to use a couple
of minutes informally

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:28.560
to explore a bit what changed,
why it changed, how it changed,

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:33.590
and then what the significance of
that is for us in the 21st century.

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:38.920
So, three main changes occur in
this period from 1940 and the case

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.980
of Cantwell versus Connecticut to
1947, and the Supreme Court case

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:47.380
of Everson versus Board
of Education.

00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:50.830
The first change is that the
Supreme Court, for the first time,

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:55.660
applied the first amendment
religion clauses directly to state

00:57:55.660 --> 00:58:01.640
and local governments and created
a uniform and universal law

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:06.280
of religious freedom
enforceable by the federal courts.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:11.630
Secondly, the Supreme Court read
the establishment clause guarantee

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:15.870
and the free exercise
clause guarantee rigorously

00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:21.100
and attached rather substantial
scrutiny to the actions of federal,

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:24.020
state, and local government
when they were challenged

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:28.240
under either the establishment
clause or the free exercise clause

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.680
and that scrutiny gave rise to wins

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:35.820
and those wins encouraged ever more
litigation in the federal courts.

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.580 position:56%
And the third thing that happened is

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:42.580
that the Supreme Court proved
itself unusually solicitous

00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:49.360 position:56%
to marginal groups, highly unpopular
religious groups like Witnesses,

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.550
and Adventists, and pacifists,
and atheists and others,

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:57.150
who had not fared well
at all in state courts

00:58:57.150 --> 00:59:02.000
or in state legislatures and found
very little recourse and protection

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.650
from the US Congress as well.

00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:08.530
Three major changes
and it's not accidental

00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:14.460 position:56%
that these changes occurred in the
1940s as we move toward the creation

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:17.330
of a universal national law

00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:21.450
of religious freedom
enforceable by the federal courts.

00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:25.880
In the first place, we are
moving toward a national project

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.900
in the mid-20th century.

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:32.450
Already in the 1930s during the
Great Depression, as Congress

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:36.980
and eventually the United States
Supreme Court after 1937 moved

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:42.110
to try to create a national law on
many questions of health, safety,

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:46.530
welfare, and even morality, even
in the face of countervailing state

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:49.160
and local governmental concerns.

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:52.310
World War II and the
budding Cold War underscored

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:56.800
that national consolidation
project even more as Congress

00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.630
and the White House and the
Supreme Court together took leads

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:05.900
in reaching national consolidation
on the fundamentals that needed

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.400
to be enforced even in the face

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.630
of countervailing state
and local interests.

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:14.780
But most importantly to our project

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:20.530
of religious freedom was the
1940s discovery in horror

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:27.170 position:56%
of Hitler's death camps and Stalin's
gulags, where all sense of humanity

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:30.630
and dignity had been
betrayed and a recognition

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:34.510
that local bigotry run amuck
and unchecked can yield

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:39.590
that massive barbaric treatment
of a particular religious

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:43.790
and cultural people, in particular
the Jews, but not only the Jews,

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:46.640
gypsies and many others as well.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.400
And in response, the
United States of America

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.680
and the international
collection of states

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.170
in the universal declaration
seized anew on the idea

01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:02.440
of religious freedom as a
universal good, a fundamental right

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.590
to be enjoyed by every
person, by every people,

01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:07.930
in all contexts around the world.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:12.080
It became one of the greater four
freedoms that Roosevelt lifted up

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:17.340
and it was considered essential to
the organization of a good society

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.900
and a democratic policy to
have universal protection

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:25.830
of religious freedom for all,
especially for minorities,

01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:29.660
especially for those that were
unpopular, especially for those

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.910
that held religious views that
had been locally vilified.

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:38.580
It was critical that especially
the outsiders felt welcome

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:42.610
and had the constitutional
protection of the first amendment

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:45.790
that they could call upon
in the federal courts

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:48.080
and it was especially
considered important

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:52.550 position:56%
that a person could be guaranteed
the protection of the federal courts

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:57.830
under the first amendment
regardless of where she/he lived

01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:04.790
and therein lay the rub,
because we run four square

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:08.410
into the constitutional
protection of federalism,

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:11.580
built into the US Constitution
itself as you know,

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.170
with its division of enumerated
powers amongst the federal

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:19.760
government but also the guarantee
of reserved powers to the states,

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.040
guaranteed in the 10th amendment,
guaranteed in Article IV,

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.170
and jealously maintained
in the century

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:32.170
and a half between 1791 to 1940.

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:36.130
But furthermore, the first
amendment itself was problematic

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:40.470
in this regard because
it singles out Congress.

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:45.460
It says Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:48.970
of religion or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof.

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:51.280
It says nothing about the states.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.250
It's not even in the
passive voice like the second

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.420
through ninth amendments
where we talk

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.380
about there should be no
illegal searches and seizures

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:03.300
or no unjust taking of property
which could be read generically

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.030
to apply to any government,
federal or state.

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:09.680
Here, the Congress was singled
out by the first amendment,

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.640
Congress shall make no law
violating religious freedom.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.230
And whatever the intention
of the drafters

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:21.010
of first amendment religion
clauses in 1789 happened to be,

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:24.390
or the ratifiers in
1791 happened to be,

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:27.680
that language was taken
universally to mean

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.630
that the first amendment religious
freedom guarantees applied only

01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:35.840
to Congress and the federal
government leaving the then 48

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:41.360 position:56%
individual states to govern religion
and religious freedom in accordance

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.330
with their own local
state constitutions.

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:48.630
Some states were generous in their
protections of religious freedom

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:53.240
but many states maintained forms
of religious establishment,

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.980
preferencing particular forms of
faith, putting in place policies

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:03.950 position:56%
that enacted by coercion certain
forms of religious identity, belief,

01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:08.000
and practice and at the same
time put in place a number

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.650
of encumbrances and abridgements

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:13.560
and sometimes deeply
prejudicial actions towards

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.470
religious minorities.

01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:20.750
So here was the problem, how
to create a universal law

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:24.700
of religious freedom when the
text of the Constitution itself

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.890
and the very federalist structure

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:30.900
of the Constitution
seemed to stand in the way.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.360
And to accomplish that end,
the United States Supreme Court

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.700
in this fateful set of
cases from 1940 to 1947,

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.710 position:56%
performed a constitutional magic act

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:46.450
that we lawyers call due
process incorporation.

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:50.610
This will be technical for
30 seconds, check your email.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:55.490
The court looked to the 14th
amendment, passed in the aftermath

01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:59.200
of the Civil War, ratified in 1868,

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:04.690
which has as its first guarantee
no state shall deprive any person

01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:09.690
of life, liberty or property
without due process of law.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:11.610
We call that the due process clause

01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:15.510
and the courts said
interpreting this term liberty,

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:18.930
what is part of the
body, the corpus?

01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:22.490
What is incorporated
into the idea of liberty?

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:25.720
Well, the first place we
will go is to look elsewhere

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.670
in the constitutional
text in the Bill of Rights

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:32.300
and other rights provisions set
out in the instrument as a whole

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:36.540
and among other things, there was
a guarantee in the 14th amendment

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:40.770
of religious liberty, and what
does religious liberty entail?

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.560
Religious liberty entails
no establishment of religion

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.590
and no prohibition on the
free exercise of religion

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:53.830
and that little poof you
just heard is the completion

01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:57.700
of the constitutional
magic act because suddenly,

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:02.830
what is read as Congress shall make
no law in effect becomes government

01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:04.730
of any sort, federal, state,

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:08.850
and local government shall make
no law establishing religion

01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:11.900
or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof.

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:16.460 position:56%
The first amendment applies directly
to Congress and by extension,

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.970
other branches of the
federal government.

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:21.380
The first amendment
applies indirectly

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.900
through the 14th amendment
due process clause to state

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.010
and to local governments alike.

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:30.970 position:56%
You can stop checking your email and
now we can get back to the story.

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:32.760
Why is this important?

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:37.750
All of a sudden not only have we
structurally changed the first

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:41.870
amendment so that it becomes
the universal law that seemed

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:47.080
to be necessary in the 1940s in
the face of local bigotry run amuck

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:52.830
in a highly civilized nation like
Germany, but we also now have

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:56.080
through rigorous interpretation
of those two guarantees,

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.590 position:56%
invited the federal courts into the
conversation about religious freedom

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:05.080
in a way that had never taken place
in the prior century and a half

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.540
of the republic and
unfurling in the 1940s forward

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:14.550
for the next half century was the
rigorous law of no establishment

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:18.030
of religion, separation of
church and state being one

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:22.310
of the organizing axioms as the
Supreme Court addressed questions

01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:26.480
of religious teachers, and texts,
and ceremonies, and Bible readings,

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.390
and symbols in public schools,
striking virtually all of them

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:35.820 position:56%
down as a violation of establishment
norms perhaps permissible

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:39.840
under earlier state constitutions
but now under the glaring light

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.430
of the establishment clause of the
first amendment, no longer tenable

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:47.230
in a nation dedicated to religious
freedom amongst other things,

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.470
through separation
of church and state.

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:53.160
Likewise, governments role
in religious education,

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:57.040
the traditional symbiosis
between the two is now severed

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.530
through a separation of
church and state logic.

01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:02.880
Religious schools are permitted to
exist, they provide opportunities

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.620
for education, but they must do
that on their own without aid

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.310
or cooperation or involvement

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:11.820
by government officials
beyond basic accreditation.

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:16.350
At the same time, the free exercise
clause and free speech clauses

01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:21.470
and sometimes attendant additional
constitutional provisions protect

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:26.910
people, especially the unpopular
in their activities in public life,

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:30.240
Witnesses going door to
door, going into public parks

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.580 position:56%
and public streets, broadcasting the
message of Jesus Christ and seeking

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:38.570
to win those over to their
faith, Adventists and others

01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:41.000
who had Saturday Sabbatarian
concerns

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.500
that were not being
accommodated by legislatures

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.430
but now are being accommodated
under the free exercise clause,

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:51.000
Amish living in small agrarian
communities who did not want

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.250 position:56%
to subscribe fully to the mandatory
school attendance laws now protected

01:08:56.250 --> 01:09:00.910
in their distinctive identities and
allowed to pursue their activities

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:06.150
without encumbrances by the state
and one could multiply examples.

01:09:06.150 --> 01:09:12.940
From 1940 to 1990, the United
States Supreme Court put in place

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:17.990
for the world a massive,
massive record of how

01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:24.540
to protect religious liberty
aggressively, zealously, for all

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:29.040
and vindicating the idea that
Mahatma Gandhi made popular

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.120
that a nation's dedication to
religious freedom is measured

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.910
by how it treats its most hated
minorities and in some sense,

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:42.920 position:56%
that record of a half century stood
tall and remains an important source

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.080
of inspiration and instruction
to jurists, and judges,

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.660
and courts around the
world to this day.

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:55.260 position:56%
Interestingly, some would say sadly,
the Supreme Court in the last decade

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.920
or two has retreated substantially

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.040
from that aggressive
protection of religious freedom.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.600
The court has made it
harder to press cases

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.150
through toughened standing
requirements, when you can stand

01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:11.820
at the bar to press your case
has gotten harder to achieve.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:15.900
The court has allowed splits
in the lower federal circuits

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:20.320
to linger a lot longer with a great
deal of confusion amongst parties

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.110 position:56%
as to how they're going to be
protected in their religious freedom

01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:27.180
if they live in the third
circuit versus the ninth circuit.

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:33.790
The court has strongly encouraged
state legislatures to take

01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:36.600
over religious freedom
questions through statues

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.480
and changing those statutes
as needed in accordance

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.910
with local political
custom and fashion.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:46.650
The court has shown strong
separation of powers logic

01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:50.710
to again defer to Congress and
let Congress do a lot of the work

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:56.360
in religious freedom and the court
has reduced the free exercise

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.360
and the no establishment
clauses effectively to guarantees

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.740
of neutrality on the face of the
statute itself and neutrality

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:08.620
and general applicability in
application of the statute.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:12.700
Since 1990, under the free
exercise clause and since 2002

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.480
under the establishment clause,

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.660
both of those constitutional
guarantees are now wimpy.

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:24.770
Justice Thomas on the
bench has suggested

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:28.530
that these are all
perhaps steps along the way

01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:34.240
to disincorporating the religion
clauses from the 14th amendment.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.440
Four times in dicta, always
in concurrence or dissent,

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:43.470
Justice Thomas has said quite
boldly it is time for us to go back

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:46.180
to a literal reading
of the first amendment,

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.330
especially under the
establishment clause

01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:51.830
that says Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:53.130
of religion.

01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:55.740
We don't have jurisdiction
to hear cases coming

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.640
out of the state and
local governments.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.310
So far, no justice has signed
on to Justice Thomas' opinion

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:07.890
but I give you a small anecdote
to signal perhaps a danger.

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:13.560
A few years ago, I was one of the
lectures at the Fifth Circuit Court

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:19.480
of Appeals in Alabama
and Justice Scalia was

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:25.610 position:56%
in the audience (that's his circuit)
and we happened to sit together

01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:29.080
at dinner and we had a
nice, long conversation

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.770
about the original understanding
of the first amendment

01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:37.500
and we fussed back and forth about
texts that he knows remarkably well

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:44.140 position:56%
and we had a few drinks, and in the
course of the evening I said to him,

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:49.420
"Justice Scalia, is there anything
to this argument of your brother

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:53.350
on the court Justice
Thomas, that we are thinking

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:57.230
of selectively disincorporating
the religion clauses

01:12:57.230 --> 01:12:59.810
from the 14th amendment?"

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:07.940 position:56%
He raises his glass and says, "We're
one vote away", which is interesting

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:12.000
and it's also in my
view deeply troubling.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.750
There was a reason in the 1940s to
worry about local bigotry run amuck

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:21.900
and there is a reason in
the 21st century to worry

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:25.160
about local bigotry run amuck.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.540
We are now awash with
xenophobia and nativism.

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:33.840
We are now awash with
islamophobia and anti-Semitism.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.560
Religious communities Christian

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.240
and non-Christian alike are
now facing enormous pressure

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.400
about the propriety
of their existence,

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.950
their special claims
on religious freedom.

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:47.120
There's a worry about leaving
these things to statutes,

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.550
leaving these things
to state legislatures.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:52.840
There's a worry about letting
one of our universal goods

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.620
of human nature simply disappear
through political calculus.

01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:02.050
That, from any person of good
faith and good will, is troubling.

01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:03.850
Thank you.

01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:15.060
[ Applause ]

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you John,
thank you Peter, thank you Sally.

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:22.020
I know I promised a five
minute stretching break but I'd

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:27.960 position:56%
like to rescind that offer if no one
objects because these eloquent words

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.030 position:56%
and thoughts are so in our minds now

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:34.810
and I think we also would lose
some organization coherence

01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:36.160
if we all went out and stretched.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:42.450 position:56%
So if no one objects, I think we
should talk a little bit as a panel,

01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:45.290
five or 10 minutes and then
open it up to questions.

01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:47.540
I'm sure you all have them.

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.660
Three spectacular talks,
thank you so much,

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.140 position:56%
I learned so much from each of them.

01:14:54.140 --> 01:15:00.010
I want to say a few questions
first and then I'll keep talking

01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:04.960
and I want to end with a
question for John but for Sally,

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.940
I will never think about
disestablishmentarianism

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.670
in Virginia the same way.

01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:16.390
Thank you, that was
profoundly enlightening.

01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:19.810
I thought during your
lecture about New England

01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:22.190
and I don't think the
same paradigm holds-

01:15:22.190 --> 01:15:23.490
&gt;&gt; No.

01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:24.790
&gt;&gt; In New England.

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:27.870
Gordon may want to enlighten us
on that topic but it seems to me

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:32.110
to the extent there is
proslavery thought in the pulpit

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:36.210
in New England it's more from
the established urban churches

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:38.520
and that the radical evangelicals

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.850
of rural New England
are pretty antislavery

01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:45.090
so that's something
we might get into.

01:15:45.090 --> 01:15:50.090
With Peter, I have done
research in exactly this topic.

01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:53.340
I've looked at Jefferson's
copy of the Koran here,

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.640
which is a fascinating
volume to hold including its

01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:02.600
so beautifully preserved, the pages
are so pristine that one comes away

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.780
with some curiosity about whether
he ever actually opened his copy

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:09.950
of the Koran, because it
doesn't look like he did except

01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:15.760
for the little ownership
markings and I wanted to ask

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:19.540
if new digital means of
scholarship are helping you

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:23.460
to find these little
known Islamic examples,

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:27.300
because you found newspaper
clippings and we are seeing,

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.670
we've seen in science for some time
but more and more in the humanities

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:36.590
that the power of very powerful
searching tools are just throwing

01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:40.730 position:56%
out more and different kinds of data
that don't fit with our big theory

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:43.460
so maybe we can come back to that.

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:48.010 position:56%
But then with John, and I'm sorry
to do this in kind of reverse order,

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:55.520 position:56%
I learned so much about the 1940s
from you and about the four freedoms

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.820
and those four freedoms have
always been very strong in my mind

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:02.640
as a former presidential
speech writer

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.460
and in the Clinton White House
we certainly looked to FDR

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:08.530
and to Eleanor Roosevelt
as very important examples.

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:13.460 position:56%
In the 1990s, we were reliving a lot
of the 50th anniversaries of events

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:18.040
in the 1940s and I remember
writing the remarks for the 50th

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.980
of the universal declaration of
human rights but I'm wondering,

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:26.770
a more narrow scholarly question
for our scholarly audience

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:31.280
which is did scholarly
work on Thomas Jefferson,

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:38.250
which he was in a very positive
light in these decades in the 30s

01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:42.290
and 40s more so I would say than he
has been in, in the last 20 years,

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:47.290
but was that affecting the
thinking of the Supreme Court,

01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:56.130 position:56%
did Frankfurter and Brandeis in
particular lead this intensification

01:17:56.130 --> 01:18:03.330
of protection of different
kinds of religions on the court,

01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:07.930
and was there some vestigial
memory of the problems in the wake

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:13.280
of World War I, the government's
heavy hand suppressing different

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.250
kinds of minorities in the
late teens and early 20's?

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:22.650
Did memories of all those flavor
the courts thinking in the 1940s?

01:18:22.650 --> 01:18:25.530
That was more than 20
years since those events,

01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:28.620
but here in Washington people
remember things for a long time,

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.590
so can I begin with that question

01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:35.100
and then I hope you
two will jump in also.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.160
&gt;&gt; I'll defer to Sally because
she's written a book on this

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.910
but I can say a word or two
while she warms up her answer.

01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:44.860
I think among the justices
of the bench,

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:50.260
Justice Black is probably the one
that was most enamored of the story

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.310
of Jefferson, Justice
Jackson as well.

01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:55.430
Justice Black and Jackson,

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:58.360
very different ways
were reading Jefferson,

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.950 position:56%
were reading about the letter to the
Danbury Baptist Association of 1802,

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:05.660 position:56%
were reading some of the narratives,
rather panegyrical narratives

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:10.470
about Jefferson of the day and
saw him and saw the Virginia story

01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:16.690
so ably told by Sally Gordon, saw
the Virginia story as prototypical

01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:21.170
of and indeed representative of
the story of the first amendment

01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:24.630
and Justice Black in his long
recitation in Everson v Board

01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:28.300
of Education and the majority
opinion and then repeated opinions

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:32.200
over the next 25 years repeats
that Virginia story and sees it

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.630
as emblematic of the necessity
of a new way of thinking

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:40.020
about the establishment clause
as a strict separation of church

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.480
and state guarantee, and
a new way of thinking

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:46.430
about the federal courts role
in insuring separation of church

01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:50.240
and state even at the micro level
of a local school board's decision

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.580
about how they're going to
teach in their classroom

01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:56.610
and it was quite clearly thought
to be a necessary condition

01:19:56.610 --> 01:20:00.230
for the protection of
religious freedom and it had

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:06.380
as its complimentary guarantee
the free exercise clause,

01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.040
which at the same time was
being rigorously protected.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.500
Not to forget, that the
bill for the establishment

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:17.170
of religious freedom is mostly
about free exercise protection,

01:20:17.170 --> 01:20:19.390
freedom of conscience,
and freedom of expression,

01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:22.880
and freedom of movement, and
freedom from all matter of coercion

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.460
and that side of the Jeffersonian
puzzle is also very much part

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.760
of the jurisprudence.

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.700
Justice Black is only
one of many on the court,

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:35.240
Justice Brandeis clearly is an
important figure in that story too

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:41.080
and we see this string of cases,
17 in total from 1940 to 1953,

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.600
where the Supreme Court using
Jeffersonian separatists

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:50.020
and free exercise logic is in the
business of creating this new law

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:53.380
of religious freedom in
direct and dramatic ways.

01:20:53.380 --> 01:21:01.310
People debate back and forth where
Justice Black got his separatism,

01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:07.260
whether Jefferson is simply window
dressing for preconceived ideas

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:12.440
that he received as a member say of
the Ku Klux Klan where separation

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.920 position:56%
of church and state was a mantra,
people worry a little bit about some

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:20.780
of the nativist inspiration for
that appetite for separatism

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:24.970
and the anti-Catholic ways in
which it was being directed.

01:21:24.970 --> 01:21:28.610
There's no evidence in Justice
Black's opinions in my view,

01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:33.140
to warrant those suspicions but
there's a lot of speculation

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:36.080
in the biographies about him.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.230
Philip Hamburger's
Separation of Church

01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:41.200
and State book is a good
recent example of that,

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.250
which makes folk a little anxious

01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:50.430
about the easy story that's
generally told about Black, Everson

01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:52.340
and the separationist project

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:55.560
but Professor Gordon will have
much better things to say.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.730
&gt;&gt; I don't think so,
that was pretty amazing.

01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:03.250
The smoke going up as Black's
children burned his papers

01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:08.780 position:56%
after his death, at his instruction,
have always raised suspicions

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:12.180
but I totally agree with
exactly what John said.

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.480
The one thing I would add is

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:18.660
that Frankfurter was not especially
solicitous of religious minorities

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:24.510
in fact, quite the opposite and his
opinion in a Jehovah's Witness case

01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:28.140
in 1940 was called his
Fall of France opinion.

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:33.120
He was so worried about making
Americans civically unified

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.380
that he tossed the Jehovah's
Witnesses under the bus

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:41.220
and it should be noted that
several thousand Witnesses died

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:47.300
in concentration camps in
Germany, Austria and so on as well.

01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:53.410
And then three years later when
his decision, the majority decision

01:22:53.410 --> 01:22:59.240
in the first case was reversed
in an opinion by Justice Jackson,

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.650
Frankfurter was so brilliant.

01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:05.740
He literally wrote a list of
the stuff that was going to be

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:08.430
on the table if we allowed theology

01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:11.810
to change the way we
ran the legal system.

01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:15.350 position:56%
School prayer, Bible reading,
funding for parochial school I mean,

01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:18.590
you just go through the laundry
list and he got it all right,

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:25.480
and in 1991, Scalia's '91 Smith?

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.780
&gt;&gt; 90.

01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:33.670
&gt;&gt; 90, he quoted Frankfurter's
dissent in the Barnett case

01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:37.470
and the majority in
Gobitis extensively

01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:40.950
for justifying throwing this
all back out to politics

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:46.140
so it's really interesting to watch
the way the Holocaust certainly

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:49.160
and World War II played out
in Supreme Court doctrine,

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.800
it could go in such
radically different ways.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.950
&gt;&gt; Am I off base in
thinking about the memory

01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:57.740
of post-World War I dissent?

01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:01.480
I mention it because of the
big World War I exhibit here

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:05.340
which you'll see tomorrow but
is that too distant a memory

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.980
in the 40s, does too
much water float

01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:11.130
under the bridge by that point?

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:13.650
&gt;&gt; Certainly Jackson
and the biographers

01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:17.770
of Jackson make pretty
clear that he was inspired

01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:21.880
to do something constitutionally
in response.

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.550
Clearly, Justice Cardozo
in the Palko

01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:31.150
and subsequent cases before 1940,
that the groundwork for Cantwell

01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:35.790 position:56%
and its progeny, he was concerned
about protecting fundamental liberty

01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:40.320
as he called it, against these
national and local intrusions

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.320
and he educes especially
in the Palko opinion some

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.530
of these instances of oppression,
even by the national government.

01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:50.740
And clearly, as we're thinking

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:56.630
through the post-incorporation
case law, it was not uncommon

01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:59.670
in amicus briefs and
sometimes in direct argument

01:24:59.670 --> 01:25:03.180
to remember the travesties
against the outsiders,

01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:07.400
to remember the [inaudible], to
remember the internment camps

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.020
in Hawaii and elsewhere that
were not part necessarily

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:13.720
of the National Press Register.

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:16.290
There's certainly no political
favor in bringing those up

01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:18.670
but they were part
of the inspiration.

01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:23.260
Bigotry was not a theoretical
concern that was driving the court,

01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:27.160
it was real, it was palpable, it
was tragic, and it was not going

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.780
to be countenanced
in the United States.

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.450
&gt;&gt; Peter, maybe I can
repeat the question I asked

01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:36.450
and then didn't quite give
you the chance to answer

01:25:36.450 --> 01:25:38.700
but what about data methods?

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:42.670 position:56%
How are you finding these incredibly
interesting newspaper articles

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:43.970
and life stories?

01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:48.630
&gt;&gt; Well, the book that I wrote
that I drew much of this research

01:25:48.630 --> 01:25:50.510
from is the book you mentioned

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:52.710
in your introduction,
One Nation Under Gods.

01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:54.700
It retells American history
from the point of view

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:58.990
of religious minorities
and the beginning

01:25:58.990 --> 01:26:02.280
of my research process
were newspaper archives

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.060
and specifically digital
newspaper archives

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:07.720
because you can find an
incredible amount of material

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:11.570
in a very short time as
compared to microfiche.

01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:13.240
I love to come to the
Library of Congress

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:16.500
but it's much more convenient
to find these things at home

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:20.450
so that was really the beginning
of my process, reading newspapers

01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:25.430
through the 18th into the
19th century and I mentioned

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:31.930
in my closing statement that you
can find many other stories similar

01:26:31.930 --> 01:26:34.670
to the story of Islam
in early America

01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:37.380
and the newspapers are
a great place to start.

01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:42.570
They often warrant stories being
written with future scholarship

01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:45.830 position:56%
in mind so there's a lot of
reading between the lines that needs

01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:47.700
to be done but you can
find these accounts,

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:51.020
you can find these individual
lives and build out from there.

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:54.620
So for example, in addition to
finding a great deal of information

01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:59.110
about these celebrity
early Muslins in America,

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:04.190
I found what I believe is the first
dedication of a Chinese temple

01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:07.140
in San Francisco in 1852.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:10.540
I believe that during the
research of that book,

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:13.320
I unearthed that for the
first time, and you can't find

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:18.340
that unless you go back and
read history as it was written

01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:24.650 position:56%
at the time in the press, so it's
really, for my work I couldn't do it

01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:25.970
without it both in my written work

01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:28.370
and now the work I
do for the museum.

01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:32.050
So many resources are also
fully digital now and available

01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:36.650
to find them including for
example, the wonderful collection

01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:39.260
of the Library of Virginia
where I was able

01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:44.620
to find the famous Virginia 10,000
name religious freedom petition

01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.750
and then make arrangements
to include

01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:49.100
that in our upcoming
exhibit as well.

01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:52.060
&gt;&gt; Those used to be at the
Library of Congress website.

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:55.510
They migrated about six
months ago, devastating.

01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:58.090
&gt;&gt; Did you begin your research

01:27:58.090 --> 01:28:02.710
in the Chronicling America
database of American newspapers?

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:06.020
&gt;&gt; I believe that it's
America's Historical Newspapers,

01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:11.420
as far as I remember the name of
the database and I actually began

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.920 position:56%
that research at Washington College.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.670
While I was there, I
had the good fortune

01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:20.770 position:56%
of being a Patrick Henry Writing
Fellow at Washington College in 2011

01:28:20.770 --> 01:28:25.210
to 2012, when I was able
to fully devote myself

01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:26.510
to researching that book.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:34.510
&gt;&gt; Is there still a leaky sink on
the second floor of my old house?

01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:39.210
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:28:39.210 --> 01:28:40.510
&gt;&gt; There's a microphone.

01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:42.190
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for
the contributions,

01:28:42.190 --> 01:28:43.950
which I have enjoyed enormously.

01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:50.760
I also write this topic with
respect to Africa so I want

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:56.280
to set this conversation in a
large comparative perspective

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:58.450
and in doing so, I
will flip the coin

01:28:58.450 --> 01:29:03.440
on these representations,
I will go another route.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.370
First, I'll argue that
in spite of the rhetorics

01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:17.870
and division this is not messy
enough, this is not messy, messy,

01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:23.750
not as troubling when you set it in
a comparative perspective, Sudan,

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:28.670
India, Nigeria, so this
is not messy enough.

01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:36.220
I have not seen enough blood and
killing and that so that's one set

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:43.030
of argument when we set this
conversation in a big umbrella.

01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:48.090
Then comes the second
one, what is driving what?

01:29:48.090 --> 01:29:51.200
The way the conversation
is set up is it politics

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.600
that is actually driving
the religion,

01:29:53.600 --> 01:30:03.750 position:56%
not the religion driving the
politics or we can make the argument

01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:09.550
that that kind of division is
problematic that I've just made

01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:13.140
because we can do it that way.

01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:19.090
But my third biggest issue
is how, when we set it

01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:24.740
in comparative perspective, from
the [inaudible] of India, Nigeria,

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:32.380
Sudan and others, they attribute
the success of this country

01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:36.460
to the [inaudible] values
of religion and language.

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:39.390
That's the way we read
it from the other side,

01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:44.340
that this place is very successful
because there's a commonality

01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:48.890
around the use of English,
around Christianity,

01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:50.450
around the framing of an identity.

01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:56.000
It is much easier to frame an
American nation's [inaudible]

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.450
around some kinds of notions
of religious consensus

01:31:01.450 --> 01:31:05.460
which you won't find
say, in Nigeria.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:10.850
That's the way we frame it on
the other side of the Atlantic

01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:15.980
that you people are so successful
and so lucky because you agree

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:20.760
to certain, this is not about
[inaudible], that you agree

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.540
to setting [inaudible] values,
that you can have some small fights

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:29.360
but there's at least a consensus
that you'll speak English,

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.170
that you are Christian,
and that there's a template

01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:35.820
for capitalism to function.

01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:39.460
There's a function for the
nation state to function.

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.440
There's a template
for the legal system

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.250
that you described to function.

01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:47.680
[Inaudible] Sharia there will
be no justice, no Supreme Court

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:52.460
that can resolve some of these
things that you've just resolved

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:58.140 position:56%
so I'm just trying to take your data
and look at it from the other side

01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:00.170
of the coin, not that I'm trying

01:32:00.170 --> 01:32:03.910
to make any sense reading
it differently.

01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:07.970
Thank you.

01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:21.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for your
comments and for inviting us

01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:27.260
to be messier when we take
things in a wider perspective.

01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:33.880
We extraordinarily underestimate
the luxury we have in this country

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.150
to be able to broker
our hardest disputes

01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:40.750
through generally peaceable
legal means

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:44.000
and when we have fundamental
questions that are at stake,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.660
we have authorities to whom we can
turn to help resolve those disputes

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:51.260
and methods by which
recompense can be done,

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:55.650
reconciliation can be achieved,
and parties can go on and we take

01:32:55.650 --> 01:32:59.770
that for granted in a way that
many places around the world,

01:32:59.770 --> 01:33:07.480
even sophisticated cultures of much
greater ancient pedigree don't have

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:11.510
that same luxury and we look
around the world to the 110,

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:14.840
to the 198 nation states

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:19.030 position:56%
and independent territories have
high levels of religious persecution

01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:23.170
of some, whether Christians, or
Muslims, or indigenous peoples,

01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:25.660
or groups or sects within the same.

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:29.570
We have 149 civil wars
going on around the world,

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.580
according to the Carter
Center, many of them never,

01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:34.040
ever each the headlines

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:37.660
of the national papers let
alone the international papers,

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:40.970
people being savaged so your
point is very well taken.

01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:44.900 position:56%
We have an extraordinary luxury here
that we shouldn't underestimate.

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:49.970 position:56%
Secondly, we should also recognize
that one of the critical foundations

01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:54.780
for the protection of democratic
order, constitutional law,

01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:57.490
democratic governance
more generally is

01:33:57.490 --> 01:34:02.160 position:56%
that we protect religious freedom
not just for Christians, but for all

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:05.590
and in some ways religious
freedom once protected provides the

01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:09.240
foundation for the protection
of many other kinds of freedoms

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.520
for individuals and groups,
speech, and press, and assembly

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.620
and various kinds of associational
rights that a person can have

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:19.190
and the protection of religious
groups whether Christian

01:34:19.190 --> 01:34:22.330
or non-Christian, provides
the foundation for the variety

01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:25.740
of other associational protections
and I think it's critical

01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:29.370
that we recognize religious
freedom as a first freedom,

01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:32.910
a foundational freedom
whose evaporation

01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:35.920
in some sense is a chiseling
away of the cornerstone

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.010
of many other constitutional
rights that we enjoy.

01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:41.900
And the third thing I would
say is, with due respect,

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:46.510
that we have never
privileged Christianity.

01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:49.650
It's interesting that we have
had the establishment clause

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:52.690
that says no establishment
of any religion

01:34:52.690 --> 01:34:56.500
and we've always had pluralism
as in some sense the genius

01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:00.090
of the American experiment and the
recognition that even at the time

01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:04.590
of the founding, that Catholics,
and Protestants, and Jews,

01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:07.660
and others who had slaughtered
and slandered each other

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:10.210
with a vengeance in prior
decades were welcome

01:35:10.210 --> 01:35:13.220
into the Constitutional
Convention discussion and welcome

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:16.030
into the ratification of the
Bill of Rights and welcome

01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:18.730
in the deliberation about
what religious freedom means

01:35:18.730 --> 01:35:20.030
in the courts.

01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:23.320
There are now more than 1,240
registered religious groups

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:29.590 position:56%
in the United States, increasingly
diverse in their non-Abrahamic form.

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:33.660 position:56%
I think that's to be celebrated, not
to be lamented and I think it's part

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.720
of the genius of what the
American experiment has

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:38.390
unleashed constitutionally.

01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:40.410
&gt;&gt; Gordon and then Manuel next.

01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:43.990
&gt;&gt; I might add the luxury that
we might have was the consequence

01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:47.580
of 200 years of pretty
bitter fighting in the west

01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:50.870
where the 30 Years War was
just as bloody as what's going

01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:53.350
on in the Sudan or elsewhere today.

01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:56.130
I had two points, one
has to do with Jefferson.

01:35:56.130 --> 01:36:00.060 position:56%
He was very important in 1943,
because it was the 200th anniversary

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:06.230
of his birth and the memorial that
is on the tidal basin was built

01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:10.600
with great democratic support and
FDR was in love with Jefferson

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:16.200
so that becomes part and of course,
I think in the 1947 decision,

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:20.150
I think it's Black who first
time uses Jefferson's words wall

01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:21.890
of separation if I-

01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:23.190
&gt;&gt; No.

01:36:23.190 --> 01:36:24.490
&gt;&gt; No?

01:36:24.490 --> 01:36:25.790
&gt;&gt; 1879.

01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:27.090
&gt;&gt; 1879 is the first?

01:36:27.090 --> 01:36:28.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:29.690
&gt;&gt; Doesn't Black use
it in '47 though?

01:36:29.690 --> 01:36:30.990
&gt;&gt; He does.

01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:32.290
&gt;&gt; Right and so it gets
picked up because of Jefferson

01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:33.890
but I have a question
for Sally, or a point.

01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:37.520
You know, I think the
situation in the 80s

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:40.480
and early 90s is a little bit
more ambiguous than you're making.

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:41.780
I think there's an awful lot

01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:47.530 position:56%
of proslavery thinking among the
lower orders but at the elite level-

01:36:47.530 --> 01:36:48.830
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:52.810
&gt;&gt; I'll give you one piece of
evidence which is very confusing.

01:36:52.810 --> 01:36:58.960
The Board of Visitors in 1791
to the College of William

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.930
and Mary offers an honorary
degree to Granville Sharp,

01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:07.830
who is the leading British
abolitionist at the time.

01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:13.260
Now, why would all these
slaveholding plantars honor

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.740
Granville Sharp in that way?

01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:17.790
I think that raises a problematic,

01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:22.900 position:56%
I think by after the Haitian
Revolution, then everything changes.

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:24.200
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.710
&gt;&gt; But up to I think in the late
80s, middle 80s and early 90s,

01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:32.870
I think you still have
a lot of the plantars

01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:35.350
who are aristocratic slaveholders.

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:39.520
&gt;&gt; That's a great point and if
only I could point to the stuff

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:46.560
on the cutting room floor but one
of the key elements behind say,

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:51.410
Presbyterian and eventually
Methodist proslavery was their

01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:56.910
distrust of the Church of England,
especially Granville Sharp,

01:37:56.910 --> 01:38:04.590
Beilby Porteus, so Sharp's
support of Somerset's case,

01:38:04.590 --> 01:38:10.830 position:56%
of course Somerset was taken from
Virginia by his owner Stewart and so

01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:16.270
that was very personally felt
in Virginia and then second,

01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:23.300
Beilby Porteus gave this amazing
antislavery sermon in 1783,

01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:29.080
at Lambeth Palace and that was
reprinted everywhere in Virginia

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:33.910
so part of Coke's problem was
that they thought he was a Church

01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:36.430
of England Priest which in fact,

01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:39.630
he was and then he also
became a Methodist Bishop

01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:44.300
which made him a schismatic
member of two, anyway.

01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:50.560
But yes, very definitely they did
not trust the Church of England

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.490
and William and Mary is, and
Granville Sharp, were Anglicans

01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:59.040
so there's this class
level of distrust

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.260
and you're absolutely
right, I take your point.

01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:06.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I think wall of separation was a
phrase also used in the 17th century

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:10.470
by Roger Williams in our
state, well, not yet.

01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:12.630
&gt;&gt; The garden in the,
you mean Rhode Island?

01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:13.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:15.880
&gt;&gt; Well, it comes out of the Bible.

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:17.180
&gt;&gt; It does.

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.940
&gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:14,
wall of separation,

01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:26.790 position:56%
and it has a long exegetical history
in pre-American settlement theology

01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:30.950
so it's not a phrase
that's invented by Jefferson

01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:32.840
or Anabaptists or others
before them.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.980
&gt;&gt; I think he's using it as
he's trying to define his-

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.280
&gt;&gt; As a legal term.

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.890
&gt;&gt; As a legal term, right.

01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:43.630
Manuel did you-

01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:48.820
&gt;&gt; First of all, let me thank all
of you for this incredible panel

01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:54.180
that shows how wonderful
scholarship can be in a time

01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.700
where scholarship is doubted.

01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:00.060
Mm-mm, here it is.

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.850
Now, I want simply a very
small point to convey

01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:07.380
to John particularly, the comment
that is usually heard in Europe,

01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:10.010
particularly France
but not only in France

01:40:10.010 --> 01:40:15.380
that while America has developed
starting in the 1940s not before,

01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:19.790
a very important comprehensive
system

01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:24.790
of protecting religious minorities,
on the other hand in the practice

01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:31.560
of everyday life meaning workplace,
political institutions, civic life,

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:36.770
not so much protected the right
to have no religion meaning

01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:43.370
to declare oneself atheist and
not have any religious practice.

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:47.900
This has been sanctioned in
terms of not providing jobs,

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:54.990
in terms of marginalizing people
sometimes violently attacking,

01:40:54.990 --> 01:40:59.060
so the right to atheism which
by the way is the majority

01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:03.880
of the population of France
is either agnostic or atheist,

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.770
is not so respected in America

01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:09.370
because by definition America has
always been a religious country

01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:11.450
from the very beginning
of American history.

01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:14.720
So, what is your reaction
to this kind of opinion

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.730
that I hear all the time?

01:41:16.730 --> 01:41:19.780
&gt;&gt; It's the law on the books and
the law in action, to be sure.

01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:23.190
We're very generous in respecting
the religious freedom of all

01:41:23.190 --> 01:41:25.850
but there are certain groups
that we constantly vilify,

01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:29.860
Native American Indians,
Scientologists, Wiccans,

01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:35.900
increasingly today Muslims,
intermittent episodes

01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:37.990
of anti-Semitism, anti-Judaism.

01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:40.850
We do have our laundry
list of social pariahs

01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:45.040
and sometimes the courts
are blind to their plight.

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.800
I will say with respect to atheism,
the Supreme Court rather early

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:54.190
in a case of 1961 called
Torcaso versus Watkins,

01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:59.500
upheld the free exercise
right of an atheist to refuse

01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:02.500
to swear an oath that educed God.

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:06.680
He could give an alternative form
of demonstrating his veracity,

01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:09.380
the court concluded and
did so on the strength

01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:14.160
of the free exercise right of
that individual and the worry

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:19.880
about establishing a theism from
which he would become a victim.

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:25.540 position:56%
And so the court rather early was in
the vanguard really around the world

01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:28.000
in thinking of western
constitutional values

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.200
of protecting atheism
but that's a hard sell

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:35.070
when the Cold War logic
was very much

01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:38.030
about we are the great
Christian nation

01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:41.400
and those atheistic communists
out there are doing their thing

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:47.600
and that case gets lost in the
ensuing decades of Cold War logic,

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:54.580
but it's early for many
important signposts

01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:58.930
of a generosity towards people
of faith and of no faith

01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:02.630 position:56%
and the protection they should
enjoy under the free exercise clause

01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:07.360
and increasingly, I think in
the 21st century we've come

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:10.500
to recognize demographically
that the nones

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:13.910
on various religious demographics,
the nones are getting bigger

01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:18.010
and bigger especially in the
younger generation and their plight

01:43:18.010 --> 01:43:20.770
and the protection of their
plight, I think is going

01:43:20.770 --> 01:43:24.390
to be an important part of
our story going forward.

01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:30.890
The hard question I think, that
we have to face is whether atheism

01:43:30.890 --> 01:43:33.350
and none are the same thing.

01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:35.550
It's one thing to have
an affirmative belief

01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:38.790
in the non-existence of
God as an atheist has,

01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:41.760
it's another thing
simply to be abstaining

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:46.650 position:56%
from any religious participation and
any religious involvement or ideas

01:43:46.650 --> 01:43:51.360
and the European Court
of Human Rights has,

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:55.770
under the European Convention
Article IX, the notion of thought,

01:43:55.770 --> 01:43:58.860
conscience and belief and
it's a grab gab that allows

01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:04.030
for the religion of atheism
and the none to be combined

01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:07.800
in zealous protection for what
we would call religious freedom.

01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.440
We don't have that textual
luxury in the United States

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:16.680
and we have religion and we are
jealous about protecting sincere,

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:21.210 position:56%
good faith idiosyncratic, newly
acquired understandings of the faith

01:44:21.210 --> 01:44:24.000
but there is a presumption
of faith there

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.540
and I think the hard question
becomes well, is the protection

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:33.210
of religious freedom as
Jefferson himself said to Madison,

01:44:33.210 --> 01:44:35.410
is the protection of
religious freedom as soon

01:44:35.410 --> 01:44:40.740
as you establish one form of
faith, you automatically begin

01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:44.380
to disenfranchise those
of non-faith.

01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:47.080
And the analogous questions
now are beginning to emerge,

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:49.790
does the protection of religious
freedom, the privileging of those

01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:54.800
who have faith inevitably begin to
compromise the status, the rights,

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.990
the entitlements that those
who have no faith don't enjoy.

01:44:58.990 --> 01:45:00.920
Now, there's a couple
of answers to that.

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:06.370
One is that free exercise of
religion rights are also balanced

01:45:06.370 --> 01:45:11.040 position:56%
by a no establishment guarantee that
says yes, there is free exercise

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.390
of religion but you're going
to have to do it on your own.

01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:17.460
We cannot establish religion
but we can establish nones.

01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:21.970 position:56%
Number two, there is free speech
and free association and free press,

01:45:21.970 --> 01:45:25.470
and general equal protection
and due process liberty rights

01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:28.320
that folk of no faith can enjoy.

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:32.640
Folk of faith can enjoy them too
and the question is, is that enough

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:35.690
for those who do not have a
faith claim along the way?

01:45:35.690 --> 01:45:38.550
Those are big questions that
we're going to have to face

01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:43.000
in the next 25, 30 years as
we think through the balances

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.300
of free exercise or religious
freedom jurisprudence

01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:50.650
and interestingly, the Supreme
Court has deferred those questions

01:45:50.650 --> 01:45:55.080 position:56%
to the political process by making
free exercise rights effectively now

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.240
statutory rights, the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act,

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.420
the Religious Land Use and
Institutional Persons Act,

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:03.710
and then the 21 states that
have their own Religious Freedom

01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:08.110
Restoration Acts and there,
there's a little bit more fuzziness

01:46:08.110 --> 01:46:12.970
about what gives you the ground
for pressing a religion claim

01:46:12.970 --> 01:46:16.140
and already there, we're both
politicizing the question

01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:20.120
and we're dealing with
slippery linguistics.

01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:24.890
&gt;&gt; On the question of
veracity of original sources,

01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:27.220
I believe John Quincy
Adams is the only President

01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:28.850
who did not use a Bible.

01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:31.600 position:56%
He put his hand on the Constitution.

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.490
&gt;&gt; Right, great that
you mentioned that.

01:46:33.490 --> 01:46:35.550
&gt;&gt; I didn't see you, I'm sorry.

01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:38.880
&gt;&gt; A great history book
just newly published

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:43.490
by Leigh Schmidt called Village
Atheists about the history

01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:45.310
of persecution and
protection of atheists

01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:47.230
in the US, really fun to read.

01:46:47.230 --> 01:46:51.490
&gt;&gt; If I could add one note on the
nones, I think it's this phenomenon

01:46:51.490 --> 01:46:55.090
of the religiously unaffiliated
that we're living in now,

01:46:55.090 --> 01:46:58.770
part of it is we're in a
moment of shifting categories.

01:46:58.770 --> 01:47:01.290
You look at the huge
numbers on the nones

01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:04.470
and the religiously unaffiliated,
many of them believe in God

01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:07.190
and so I've often wondered if none
should actually be called some

01:47:07.190 --> 01:47:09.630
of this, and some of that, and
some of that because they are

01:47:09.630 --> 01:47:14.990
in the process of redefining the
affiliations they're choosing

01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:18.730
and the existing categories
often they don't belong there.

01:47:18.730 --> 01:47:22.030
What comes of that we'll
know in a generation.

01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:23.330
&gt;&gt; Yes?

01:47:23.330 --> 01:47:25.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much
for a great panel.

01:47:25.150 --> 01:47:28.050
I had sort of a more
specific question.

01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:31.580
Was there any discussion
of disestablishment

01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:34.990
or free exercise during the
debates of the 14th amendment

01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:38.020
and did they call on
any of those debates

01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:43.110
when discussing the due process
incorporation in the 1940s,

01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:46.030
and were there discussions in
Congress, were there discussions

01:47:46.030 --> 01:47:48.240
in the ratification
debates, or is this something

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:52.300
that just was not part
of the discussion at all?

01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:56.630
&gt;&gt; It really didn't appear.

01:47:56.630 --> 01:48:02.700 position:56%
There was tons of concern about
women voting, about lifting the veil

01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:09.130 position:56%
of the marriage bed, about all kinds
of things but no, life, liberty

01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:13.310
and property were not
infused with religious.

01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:15.630
It's really, really interesting.

01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:16.930
Great question.

01:48:16.930 --> 01:48:19.790
&gt;&gt; Why don't we take you
and the Samiara [phonetic]

01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:22.830
so two final questions and
then we'll call it a day.

01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:28.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you all for
a wonderful panel.

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:40.470
A couple of comments [inaudible],
on the 1815 letter from Jefferson,

01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:46.680
I would suggest that his
primary association at that stage

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:51.630
of his life on clergy and politics
would not have been anything

01:48:51.630 --> 01:48:52.930
Virginian, it would
have been the influence

01:48:52.930 --> 01:48:58.420
of the New England clergy
during the 1790s and especially

01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:00.500
in his presidential campaigns,

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:05.780 position:56%
that would have been his deeply felt
frame of reference at that point.

01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:08.720
Also, yes it's certainly true

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:13.870
that the Granville Sharp
honorary degree is fascinatingly a

01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:20.570
complicated question and there
were ideas percolating in the 1780s

01:49:20.570 --> 01:49:26.060 position:56%
but a few years ago, as you probably
know, there was an assertion

01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:28.370
that Virginia had a
moment when it came close

01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:32.670
to abolishing slavery in the 1780s.

01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:37.520
I think that has been chipped away
at recently but I do also think

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.680
that what you have discovered,
uncovered, recovered with your work

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.900
on this subject really does cast
that into doubt in fascinating

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:53.590
and important ways not least
because of the dimensions of class,

01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:59.040 position:56%
and social hierarchy that correlated
with religious affiliation.

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:00.340
I really don't think that
we're going to be able

01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:03.370
to say they were anywhere near
abolishing slavery if the account

01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:07.990
that you've given today
becomes more widely known,

01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:10.430
so I wanted to thank
you for that and ask

01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:12.310 position:56%
for any comment that you might have.

01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:14.710
&gt;&gt; Thank you, I think in addition

01:50:14.710 --> 01:50:19.170
to the New England clergy I
would add New York, Pennsylvania,

01:50:19.170 --> 01:50:26.730
some parts of Maryland, New
Jersey, I think there are many,

01:50:26.730 --> 01:50:33.040 position:56%
many people outraged not only by his
infidelity meaning his lack of faith

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.240
but also his relationship
with Sally Hemmings

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:41.890
and that really is widely known by
the very, very early 19th century

01:50:41.890 --> 01:50:46.950
and you can read all kinds of, the
[inaudible phrase] and you know,

01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:54.380
I mean just really, really
remarkable how deep that was

01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:59.290
and how deeply it wounded
Jefferson, you're right.

01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:04.170
And then, in terms of
the abolition of slavery,

01:51:04.170 --> 01:51:11.790
I do think the work that's been
done recently by Polly Brewer,

01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:14.570
Alan Taylor, even Claire Priest

01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:20.230
in the law field have very
definitely shown that for example,

01:51:20.230 --> 01:51:25.130
the Manumission Statute produced
a more compliant slave population

01:51:25.130 --> 01:51:29.560 position:56%
because people were hoping to be
manumitted and of course rarely were

01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:35.330
but it is also true that one
of the reasons Coke could cause

01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:38.190
so much trouble is that
he'd appear in town

01:51:38.190 --> 01:51:43.970
and some people would start
manumitting so it was both

01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:49.120
because some people were
really moved by the thought

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.070
that they were preventing
the return of the Messiah

01:51:51.070 --> 01:51:56.270
and many more reacted
violently against that.

01:51:56.270 --> 01:52:00.630
So yes, I think I'm feeling my way
along as you rightly point out,

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:02.680 position:56%
with the rest of the historiography.

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.980
Thank you.

01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:06.630
&gt;&gt; I've been thinking about the
New England clergy this week

01:52:06.630 --> 01:52:09.600
because I'm trying to
imagine their shock.

01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:13.620 position:56%
Of course, we can't project their
thinking into the future but to know

01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:16.840
that a major speech was given
this week on the subject

01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:20.070
of religious pluralism and
separation of church and state

01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:23.080
by the head of the
Roman Catholic Church,

01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:27.500
who gave a very important speech
in Cairo a few days ago and how

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:31.020
that would have been inconceivable
to the New England world view

01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.170
in the 17th or 18th century.

01:52:33.170 --> 01:52:36.080
Samira, do you want to
ask our last question?

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:43.900
&gt;&gt; First, I wanted to say
regarding Peter and John's comments

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:46.960
about the religious nones, as
someone who has spent a lot

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:50.600
of time studying multiple
religious belonging

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:57.080 position:56%
and that growing population, yes
rah rah, I think definitely the some

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.040
of this and some of that is a
really excellent way to think

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:04.940 position:56%
about if not all nones many of them,
and I'm really curious to see how

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:10.620
that works out in the legal
framework but if you will excuse me

01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:14.340
for asking a question
of a cultural historian

01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:18.530
of American religion moving into
thinking about religion and law

01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:25.140 position:56%
for my second project, I'm wondering
John if you could say a couple

01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:32.110
of things about disestablishment
both in terms of what it looks like

01:53:32.110 --> 01:53:35.150
and how debates about
it have functioned,

01:53:35.150 --> 01:53:38.370
I'm thinking about when I started
graduate school a little bit more

01:53:38.370 --> 01:53:42.370
than 10 years ago, Georgia
was having a terrible drought

01:53:42.370 --> 01:53:47.040
and our governor had prayer
meetings on the front steps

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.590
of the capitol to pray for rain.

01:53:49.590 --> 01:53:53.970
I'm sure that this came up in
your classes as it did in mine

01:53:53.970 --> 01:53:57.250
and so you know, what is that?

01:53:57.250 --> 01:54:00.840
How does that relate to legal
understandings of disestablishment?

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:05.330
And the second question is,
this question of government

01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:09.140
versus corporation right,
we see the religious freedom

01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:14.890
of the individual changing as
corporate personhood is allowed

01:54:14.890 --> 01:54:19.890
to exert power and I understand
the difference between government

01:54:19.890 --> 01:54:23.390
and large corporate
entity but I'm wondering

01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:26.930
about the practical ramifications
in terms of the American citizen

01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:30.140
and how those rights and
what the legal precedent

01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:36.660
around those rights are likely to
be given the cases still pending

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.130
and of the last couple of years.

01:54:38.130 --> 01:54:41.510
&gt;&gt; I've spoken an awful
lot so I'll let Peter jump

01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:45.170
in on the none question and I'm
going to also ask Sally to jump

01:54:45.170 --> 01:54:46.480
in on the disestablishment stuff.

01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:47.800
She's really the expert on it,

01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:49.650
writing a fabulous
19th century book.

01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:52.100
If there's any time left, I'll
address your questions directly

01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:54.100
but I've talked too much so Peter?

01:54:54.100 --> 01:55:02.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Oh, so I construct my own work
on the so called nones that it seems

01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:07.120
to me that well, in the writing
I've done with it I've tried

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:10.680
to make a parallel
with earlier moments

01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:18.700
of personal disestablishment,
of the desire of individuals not

01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:23.630
to be associated with any
particular religious institution.

01:55:23.630 --> 01:55:27.250
And there's a wonderful
sermon by George Whitfield

01:55:27.250 --> 01:55:31.190
where he's preaching I
think in Philadelphia

01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:35.730
and he's channeling the voice
of Father Abraham in heaven

01:55:35.730 --> 01:55:40.030
and he's asking who they have
there, are there Lutherans there,

01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:43.510
are there Methodists there,
are there Anglicans there

01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:46.240
and Father Abraham
says through Whitfield,

01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.060
"We don't know those names here"
and so that's an earlier moment

01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:54.300
of talking about none-ness,
none of those things.

01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:58.700
And so, I wonder if at a
certain point when we look back

01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:02.930
at this moment of disaffiliation,
that's the world I was looking

01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:05.470
for not personal disestablishment
but personal disaffiliation,

01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:08.800
will it look like something
similar and will we realize

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:12.110
that this is another moment that
might be called an awakening

01:56:12.110 --> 01:56:16.550
by some future generation because
it's giving rise to a new set

01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:21.760
of categories that we
can't guess at yet.

01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.850
&gt;&gt; I really enjoy your
question and I'd love to talk

01:56:23.850 --> 01:56:27.880
about corporate personhood
but also, on the nones,

01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:33.990
I'm just starting work now on
this very, very important movement

01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:38.310
in the late 1830's which I
have to think of another name

01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:41.430
because they call themselves
the come-outers [laughter]

01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:47.050
which means something so
different now but by the tens

01:56:47.050 --> 01:56:51.160
of thousands they left organized
religion over their silence

01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:55.440 position:56%
on slavery and you very rapidly saw-

01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.890
&gt;&gt; In the south as
well as the north?

01:56:56.890 --> 01:57:02.430
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, oh yeah, and you
very rapidly saw for example,

01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:07.200
schisms appearing within Baptists
and Methodists from whom many

01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:11.830
of these people had come out as
it were, because they became more

01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:17.190 position:56%
and more concerned that if they did
not embrace a more negative attitude

01:57:17.190 --> 01:57:19.890
towards slavery they would
lose the rest of their people.

01:57:19.890 --> 01:57:25.490
I mean, tens of thousands of
just Methodists in just New York

01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:29.810
so I think it's worth thinking
about the ways that Peter's point

01:57:29.810 --> 01:57:36.680
about a massive shift in attitude
may be expressed in disaffiliation

01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:41.170
and yet itself be deeply
religiously motivated.

01:57:41.170 --> 01:57:45.530
And then, the only other thing
I wanted to say before learning

01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:49.970
from John is that I've also
been so interested by the fact

01:57:49.970 --> 01:57:55.410
that the first really common
non-government corporations

01:57:55.410 --> 01:57:58.670
in American history were
religious corporations.

01:57:58.670 --> 01:58:04.340
Those are the first, the first
general incorporation statute was

01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:09.520
written in 1784, for religious
organizations and so one

01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:12.490
of the things to think
about is the longstanding

01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:16.150
and very deep relationship
between corporate status

01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:20.790 position:56%
and all kinds of religious entities.

01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:23.670
You can't hold property securely

01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:26.500
as a religious organization
unless you incorporate

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:29.890
and that's been true
for more than 200 years.

01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:32.140
It's really interesting
how deep that goes.

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:35.580
&gt;&gt; Let me just speak
to your question

01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:39.190
about the role of religious
ceremony.

01:58:39.190 --> 01:58:41.600
I'll start with an anecdote.

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:45.140
Right in the middle of the heyday
of strict separation of church

01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:46.980
and state, there was
a poster that appeared

01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:51.460
in a California public
school and the poster read,

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:56.080
"In the event of a nuclear attack,
the prohibition against prayer

01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.080
in public schools will be
temporarily suspended."

01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:03.260
[Laughter] And it speaks to
a question about the role

01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:08.340 position:56%
of religious ceremony and authentic
religious ceremony in some instances

01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:11.920
in times of crisis and
need and the recognition

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:16.220
that when 9/11 occurs we go
to the National Cathedral

01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:18.920
and hear religious
officials pray and discourse

01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:20.870
about some of the fundamentals.

01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:25.300
In times of real Force Majeure,
there is new cooperation

01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:30.320
between religious and
political officials in seeking

01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:32.740
to alleviate those
that have suffered.

01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:35.440
In times of great crisis like
the Civil Rights Movement

01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:38.820
when we're seeking to bring
our African-American friends

01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:42.370
into full communion in
America, politicians

01:59:42.370 --> 01:59:47.780 position:56%
and clerics link arms walking
towards the achievement of some good

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:49.470
and I think there's
some power in that,

01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:52.560
that Robert Bellah calls
the power of civil religion

01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:54.180
or what Emil Durkheim way back

01:59:54.180 --> 02:00:00.040 position:56%
when called the necessary
religious elements of communal life.

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:03.380
And I think the Supreme
Court in fits and starts

02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:05.660
over the last 40 years
has come to realize

02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:10.450
that the establishment clause
really can't rise to or descend

02:00:10.450 --> 02:00:16.040
to intrusion on or reinvestigation
of those kinds of forms

02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:19.590
of what the court calls ceremonial
deism, that there is a place

02:00:19.590 --> 02:00:20.890
for some of this [inaudible]

02:00:20.890 --> 02:00:24.930
and that the establishment clause
isn't designed to second guess

02:00:24.930 --> 02:00:29.850
or third guess that nor to
give an individual dissenter

02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:34.490
from that religious expression
a kind of heckler's veto

02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:40.060
that would stymy the expression of
those forms of religious ceremony,

02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:45.010
sometimes authentic and rich and
textured in their expression.

02:00:45.010 --> 02:00:48.370
I happen to find that a
congenial read and I happen

02:00:48.370 --> 02:00:52.730
to think Bellah got this right
and I think it speaks to ideas

02:00:52.730 --> 02:00:56.800
that Benjamin Franklin had way
back when in his first discussions

02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:00.440
of public religion with a
CK on public by the way,

02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:04.420
when he's thinking through about
the necessity of having some kind

02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:07.650
of common belief, some
kind of common values

02:01:07.650 --> 02:01:12.130
which sit atop the particular
sectarian expressions of values

02:01:12.130 --> 02:01:14.820
and the corporations that
gather around it in worship

02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:16.660
and property holding and more.

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:24.170
And, as Chief Justice Burger said
in the case of Lynch v Donnelly,

02:01:24.170 --> 02:01:28.430
it's far too late in the day to
impose such a crabbed reading

02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:31.020
of the establishment clause that
would allow the Supreme Court

02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:33.340
to unearth those practices.

02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:37.290
I think on that one,
the chief got it right.

02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:41.510
&gt;&gt; John, Peter, Sally, thank
you for an extraordinary panel.

02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:46.080
