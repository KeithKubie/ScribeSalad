00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
 

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.210
We're given two matrices over
here, matrix E and matrix D.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.960
And they ask us,
what is ED, which

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.310
is another way of saying
what is the product of matrix

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.050
E and matrix D?

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.590
Just so I remember
what I'm doing,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.970
let me copy and paste this.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.620
And then I'm going to get
out my little scratch pad.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.070
So let me paste that over here.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.540
So we have all the
information we needed.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.180
And so let's try
to work this out.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:33.840
So matrix E times matrix D,
which is equal to-- matrix E

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.510
is all of this business.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:44.970
So it is 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 2 times
matrix D, which is all of this.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.250
So we're going to multiply
it times 3, 3, 4, 4,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.062
negative 2, negative 2.

00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:55.770
Now the first thing
that we have to check

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.270
is whether this is
even a valid operation.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.740
Now the matrix multiplication
is a human-defined operation

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.870
that just happens-- in
fact all operations are--

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.950
that happen to have
neat properties.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.400
Now the way that us humans have
defined matrix multiplication,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.330
it only works when we're
multiplying our two matrices.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.000
So this right over here has
two rows and three columns.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.020
So it's a 2 by 3 matrix.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.224
And this has three rows and
two columns, it's 3 by 2.

00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:23.890
This only works-- we
could only multiply

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.730
this matrix times this matrix,
if the number of columns

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.600
on this matrix is equal to the
number of rows on this matrix.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.250
And in this situation it is, so
I can actually multiply them.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.240
If these two numbers weren't
equal, if the number of columns

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.950
here were not equal to the
number of rows here, then

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.030
this would not be a valid
operation, at least the way

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.029
that we have defined
matrix multiplication.

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:49.820
The other thing you
always have to remember

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.750
is that E times D is not always
the same thing as D times E.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.220
Order matters when you're
multiplying matrices.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.620
It doesn't matter if you're
multiplying regular numbers,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.470
but it matters for matrices.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.340
But let's actually
work this out.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.740
So what we're going to get
is actually going to be a 2

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.505
by 2 matrix.

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:09.130
But I'm going to
create some space here

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.255
because we're going to have
to do some computation.

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:15.160
So this is going to
be equal to-- I'm

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.300
going to make a huge
2 by 2 matrix here.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.590
So the way we get
the top left entry,

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.990
the top left entry
is essentially

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:29.770
going to be this row
times this product.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.270
If you view them
each as vectors,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.920
and you have some familiarity
with the dot product,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.590
we're essentially
going to take the dot

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.800
product of that and that.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.660
And if you have no idea what
that is, I'm about to show you.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.210
This entry is going to be
0 times 3, plus 3 times

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.500
3, plus 5 times 4.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.310
 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.260
So that is the top left entry.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.801
And I already see that I'm going
to run out of space here, so

00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:58.160
let me move this
over to the right

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.250
some space so I have
some breathing room.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.490
Now we can do the
top right entry.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.840
This was the top left, now
we're going to do the top right.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.100
So the top right
entry is going to be

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.970
this row times this column.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.170
Notice the entry
is getting the row

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.270
from the first matrix and the
column from the second one.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.310
That's kind of
determining its position.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.430
So, once again, is
going to be 0 times 4,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.880
plus 3 times negative 2,
plus 5 times negative 2.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.620
And we keep going.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.780
The bottom left entry is going
to be this row, the second row

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.400
here times the
first column here.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:58.800
So it's 5 times 3, plus 5
times 3, plus 2 times 4.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.210
And we're almost done.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.710
We just need to multiply or
take the dot product of this row

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.770
with this column
right over here.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:14.070
So it's going to be 5 times
4, plus 5 times negative 2,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.279
plus 2 times negative 2.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.949
And so this is going
to be equal to,

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.550
and we could just
evaluate this now.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.370
Let's see, 0 times 3 is 0.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.370
This is 9 plus 20.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.270
This is 29.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.420
This all simplified to 29.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.940
All of this is 0.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.670
This is negative 6.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.070
And then this is minus 10.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.940
So this all simplifies
to negative 16.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.140
 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.110
This right over here, it's 15
plus 15, which is 30 plus 8.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.470
So this is 38.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:59.180
And then finally, this
is 20 minus 10 minus 4.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.440
So this is going to be 6.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.170
So this is all going
to simplify to 6.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.178
So this all became 29,
negative 16, 38, and 6.

00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:25.130
 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.800
Let's check our answer.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.457
And we got it right.

00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:28.957
