00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.640
The volume of a cube
is equal to its length

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.830
times its width
times its height.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.230
A cube with side x has length
x, width x, and height x.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.360
So its volume is equal
to x times x times

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.670
x, or x to the third.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.660
Shane takes a big cube of
butter with side length 5

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.880
from the fridge.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.213
So I'm assuming-- well, they're
not giving us the units.

00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:25.580
Maybe it's 5 centimeters.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.646
With side length
5 from the fridge.

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:30.020
Maybe I'll go with
5 centimeters.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.120
That seems reasonable.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.370
Then he cuts out a little
cube of side length 2

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.170
from one of the
corners of the cube.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.780
Write an expression
that describes

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.800
the volume of butter left.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.800
So let's think about it.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.870
The original volume of
butter that was-- they're

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.270
saying side length 5.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.400
I'm visualizing it
as 5 centimeters.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.480
Its volume is going
to be 5 times 5 times

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.740
5, which we could just write
as 5 to the third power.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.320
And then he takes out a
little chunk from that.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.810
And the volume that
he takes out is

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.099
the volume of that little cube.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.530
And that little cube
has side length 2.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.510
So its volume is going
to be 2 times 2 times 2.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.510
Or another way of writing
that is 2 to the third power.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.700
So it's going to be 5 to the
third minus 2 to the third.
