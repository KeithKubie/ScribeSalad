00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.860
Forget being a vampire, could techonology
keep us young forever?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.320
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.139
In the new movie SELF/LESS, a dying man uses
technology to transfer his consciousness to

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.240
a younger man's body.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.259
But what if we could just stay young forever?

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.029
Would you want to live forever? if you could
how would you do it?

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.269
Some research suggests young blood has rejuvenating
properties, which sounds creepy as all get

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.269
out.

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.269
I talked about it in a previous episode.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.640
So if you want to learn more about it, you
vampire you, check it out… link in the description

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.120
Other research suggests we should tackle the
ways our cells divide.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.880
As our cells divide throughout our lifetime,
the ends of our DNA start to get shorter and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.589
the DNA could fray, causing age related illnesses
like cancer.

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.160
But we’ve got telomeres, little caps that
are like the tips of your shoe laces.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.230
By keeping the caps on our DNA long and healthy,
we could extend our lifespan.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.030
Again more on that in a past episode.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.829
But that’s mostly biological.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.760
How could technology help us live longer?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.609
There are lots of companies and investors
jumping on this bandwagon.

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:06.030
Investor Peter Thiel donated a total of $500,000
towards SENS, or Strategies for Engineered

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.740
Negligible Senescence.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.380
This type of research is focused on finding
a cure for aging.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.020
Maybe the future would be tailored to us.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.460
Just like a made it your way burger at a fast
food restaurant, maybe you could have your

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.170
medicine made just for you.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.700
At that’s what the world Thiel hopes to
see.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.680
He invested in other companies, too.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.500
Like Counsyl, where you could start off with
a genetic analysis to see if you or your kids

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.790
might be at risk for any diseases.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.531
If it it turns out you’ve got a rare disease,
there are companies out there that want to

00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:34.549
hack into your immune system.

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.210
Immunosoft says they can program your cells
to cure disease.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.039
They would take some of your cells, wrap them
with a bit of DNA that would code for a protein

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.280
that you’re missing, then insert into your
system.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.399
Then your own body would start to produce
that protein.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.970
Or maybe if nothing’s too wrong with you
but want to keep an eye out just in case,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.070
a watch could help you.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.110
There’s a lot of wearable tech out there
right now to keep track of things like how

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.720
far you walk and your heart rate, stuff like
that.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.430
But imagine a device that could alert you
to a health issue, before it happens.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.890
Well that’s on its way to becoming a reality.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.140
Google is investing in a combination of a
smartwatch and nanoparticles.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.050
You’d swallow the nanoparticles in a pill,
and because they’re magnetic they’d be

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.780
able to explore your body for any diseases.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.360
Maybe they’d attach on to a cancer cell
or monitor chemicals in your blood.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.220
If anything is out of the ordinary they’d
alert you on your watch!

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.920
But not surprisingly Google’s not stopping
there, In September of 2013, Google announced

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.300
Calico, a company that focuses on fighting
aging.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.340
While nothing major has come from this company
yet, they are partnering up with major Universities

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.060
like Harvard and UC schools.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.970
Their partnership with UCLA focused on technology
that could modulate the body’s stress responses

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.700
which is known to trigger inflammation, disease
and aging.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.840
But a lot of this technology is still a long
way off, so it remains to be seen whether

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.520
any of it will become reality.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.950
If you want to live long enough to see these
advances, stick to the old school approach.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.950
Don't smoke.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.950
Get plenty of exercise.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.950
Eat right.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.550
And if you’re a budding scientist who wants
to come up with your own anti-aging solutions,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.020
maybe go see Self/Less for inspiration.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.790
The movie comes out July 10th and stars Ben
Kingsley as a wealthy man, dying from cancer,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.550
who undergoes a radical medical procedure
that transfers his consciousness into the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.600
body of a healthy young man, played by Ryan
Reynolds.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600
Sounds like an interesting future.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.500
If you see it, tell us what you think.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.060
So do you wanna stay young forever?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:19.140
