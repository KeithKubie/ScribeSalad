00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.430
NARRATOR: In the high cliffs
of Alaska's Kodiak Island--

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.900
That's pretty exciting.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.100
NARRATOR: --the world's
largest brown bears--

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.730
Probably doing
the first day out.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.200
NARRATOR: --are
back on the prowl.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.770
That's the only one I see.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.770
He's just working
his way up the hill.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.300
He's not really
necessarily eating,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.630
he's just kind of traveling.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.330
Might be going from one
green spot to another.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.930
Honey, you see him?

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.400
[dog whimpers]

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.630
The bear's not necessarily
a very big bear,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.970
but it's encouraging
just that I found a bear.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.730
You could go for
10 days, 15 days.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.600
There's no set pace for it.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.330
It can happen at any time.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.630
Hopefully, we're gonna
see a lot of bears.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.230
Even though we're gonna
have to pick through them

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.130
to determine which is
trophy quality or not,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.970
there's a lot of bears
that you're gonna see,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.970
young bears that
are gonna be rubbed.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.200
There won't even be
enough hair on them

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.530
to make a toilet seat cover.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.970
But as many years as
I've been doing this,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.430
I can recognize them for
what they are, and take

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.270
them one bear at a time.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.600
Come on.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.730
NARRATOR: The hunt
begins in six weeks.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.830
Until then, all Mike
can do is keep watch.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.200
MIKE: I came here because,
traditionally, it's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.370
been a good spot in years past.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.870
NARRATOR: Map out a strategy.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.830
MIKE: And now that
I've seen a bear,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.130
I'm gonna utilize this place.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.430
NARRATOR: And prepare to
survive among the deadliest

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.300
predators in the wild.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.900
[music playing]

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.370
I'm gonna stash a tent.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.230
If I end up coming
out of here real late,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.000
or if there's a real bad
storm and I get stuck here,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.730
I'll have a tent, and we'll have
shelter and a place to stay.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.370
I'm gonna stash
it up in the tree.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.730
Otherwise, I'm
afraid if I set it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.600
up that another bear
could come along

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.970
and use it for a chew toy.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.600
Every season we have to do this.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.030
Everything I can get
done without having

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.730
to do it when the
hunters with me

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.070
are just one step
ahead of the game.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.400
[music playing]

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.000
I feel real good about
seeing a bear today already.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.170
We've got good weather coming.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.130
A lot of snow is already gone.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.100
Things are turning green.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.030
I think it's gonna be great.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.130
That's the first
one of the season,

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.730
but I'm sure we'll
be seeing more.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.670
