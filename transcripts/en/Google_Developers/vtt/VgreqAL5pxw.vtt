DAVID GLAZER: Welcome,
everyone.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.140
Thanks for coming to
the fireside chat.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.100
Hope you're all having
a good I/O so far.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.610
I know I am.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.800
Google's a big enough company
that we all learn things about

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.510
what other parts of Google are
doing at this event and have

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.370
some of the same reactions you
all do to the cool stuff

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.920
that's happening above
us or on screen.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.850
So by way of introduction, I'm
actually going to have a seed

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.950
question for each person
on the panel.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.509
We're going to go through.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.820
I'll do a short intro to who
they are an ask them a

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.560
question so you can hear
everyone's voice, know what

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.400
they're experts on.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.380
And then we have a mix of
questions that some of you

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.810
have submitted online already.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.350
We had that link open for
a couple of days.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.920
And we have questions everywhere
from Cape Cod to

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.260
Bangalore to Belgium queued
up from online.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.320
And we'll also do live
questions here.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.080
But let me just go down this
list in order here.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.740
So Joseph, Joseph Smarr.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.060
If you could introduce yourself
and your role.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.300
And then I have a question for
you about the Google History

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.480
API that we announced yesterday,
and what is it?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.650
What's going on there?

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.210
JOSEPH SMARR: Cool.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.800
Hi, everybody.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.260
I'm Joseph.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.790
I'm an engineer on Google+.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.970
I've been working on Google+
since it began.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.060
I was very involved in the
creation of circles and the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.690
sharing model initially,
hence the t-shirt.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.380
And then a bunch of stuff
across the site.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.380
And recently I've been focused
on this History API that we

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.400
just launched yesterday.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.580
And the basic thinking there, if
you haven't seen it, is we

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.990
want you to be able to pull in
all the activity you're doing

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.570
on and off Google but share
it on your own terms.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.550
Just like with circles, I can
really choose exactly who I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.590
want to share with each time,
you want to be able to do the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.520
same thing with activity while
still taking advantage of the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.070
fact that we are living our
lives increasingly digitally.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.850
So all the things you might want
to talk about in the real

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.410
world like where you've been
or what you've seen or what

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.655
you've read or what you've
bought or what

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:50.900
you've eaten or whatever.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.660
Now I'm increasingly reading my
books online and watching

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.800
my videos online and all
that kind of thing.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.400
So we should be able to help
you share with that.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.110
And so the way it works, it's
kind of like if you've used

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.310
instant upload for Google+,
where every time I take a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.360
photo my camera, it's privately
and automatically

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.510
uploaded to the cloud.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.820
And then I can go through and
just review the photos and

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.280
then share out the
ones that I want.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.140
And so it's giving me that
the efficiency of having

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.280
everything queued up
for me, but where

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.330
I'm still in control.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
And so we've opened up an API
where you guys can now write

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.120
anything you want from whatever
app you're doing.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.860
So for example, we already
showed Last.fm did an

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.860
integration where every song
I listen to comes into my

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.440
personal history, and then I
can choose to share out the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.140
ones that I want.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.760
And that's really useful for
something like music where I

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.250
really don't want to spam my
friends with every single song

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.160
I'm listening to.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.610
But if I discover a new artist
and it's got the cover art

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.750
right there and there's a link
to go check out the band, it's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.310
really nice to be able
to say, oh yeah.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.430
I was listening to that song a
lot, and I should share it.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.730
So that's basically the idea.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.360
And it's just a developer
preview right now.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.665
We still want to get enough
content into the system that

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:48.030
we can do more and more
interesting things with it.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.190
But you go opt in today and
start programming against it.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.390
It's really easy to do.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.730
And you'll see your stuff show
up right in Google+.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.300
DAVID GLAZER: Thanks, Joseph.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.390
And for anyone who wants to know
more about History, you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.040
can ask questions.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.910
But also, there's a History
session immediately after

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.080
this, in this same
room at 5:15.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.380
So Chee, down here from Seattle
Kirkland, Chee Chew.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.950
Could you tell us a little
bit about Hangouts?

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.330
I know you did a fireside chat
yesterday on Hangouts.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.000
But for people who weren't
there, what's the Reader's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.170
Digest version?

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.550
CHEE CHEW: So I'm Chee Chew.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.070
I'm Engineer Director for
real-time communications,

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.220
which includes Chat and Hangouts
and Google Voice.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.990
And we had a session
yesterday.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.780
And the message that I have for
folks through this about

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.290
the platform, the API aspect
is that we try to make it

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.580
really, really simple and very
flexible to enhance your

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.150
applications with Hangouts.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.040
You can iframe your app in
really quick, very little

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.210
code, and then just add on
additional functionality and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.140
build upon it.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.890
So almost any app that you have
on the web, if it has

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.860
collaboration where multiple
people want to use it

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.840
together, it's super, super easy
to add Hangouts to it.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.690
And then you can make it richer
and richer from there.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.440
DAVID GLAZER: Thank you, Chee.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.150
Seth, one of the newest
Googlers on the panel.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.660
If you could introduce
yourself.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.970
But also talk a little bit
about, we did a launch the day

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.440
before I/O started of

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.529
recommendations on the +1 button.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.355
And tell us a little bit about
why a publisher might care.

00:04:21.355 --> 00:04:21.670
SETH STERNBERG: Yeah.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.430
So hey, I'm Seth Sternberg.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.770
And I'm a product manager
now focusing

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.920
on all things platform.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.360
And I came in through the recent
acquisition of Meebo.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.820
DAVID GLAZER: Set was
one of the founders

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.780
and the CEO of Meebo.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.130
He's being modest.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.730
SETH STERNBERG: So I've been
here for all of two weeks.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.020
Now one thing that was really
nice when I got here--

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.000
so as Meebo, we were hearing
requests from publishers all

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.030
the time via e-commerce sites
or travel sites or folks

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.370
putting out content that they
really wanted content

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.570
recommendations in their site.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.150
They wanted some way to kind of
say to a user, hey, here's

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.390
some other stuff that you may
really want to see on my site

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.850
based on who you are and what
your interests are.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.325
And so when I got--

00:05:02.325 --> 00:05:04.810
when the collective we got into
Google a couple weeks

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.640
ago, we discovered that, in
fact, the Google+ team was

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.290
already working on that,
which is awesome.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.550
And the reason why publishers
were asking us for that so

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.330
much-- and Google had heard
the exact same thing--

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.660
is, as you all know, a lot of
the traffic you get to your

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.410
websites today comes from
the side door, right?

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.370
It either come from people
doing a Google search.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.350
And they land on a specific page
of yours, a particular

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.610
part of your site.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.720
Or they come in from
a social stream.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.000
But they're not going through
your front page.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.020
And so you lose the opportunity
to program to

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.060
those users.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.980
So with content recommendations,
you can have

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.230
a user land on the hotel's
booking page for the hotel

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.920
that they're looking
for in Cabo.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.225
But you then might have the
opportunity to also point them

00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:52.330
to some content about Cabo as
well and move them around your

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.070
site, rather than having only
a very transactional

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.930
relationship with that user.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.590
Hence, content recommendations.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.040
DAVID GLAZER: Great,
thank you.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.420
Ken.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.810
Ken Norton is--

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.290
we've seen a lot of talk about
mobile at Google I/O. And for

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.750
one of this data points that we
announced is that Google+

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.630
is now seeing more users on
mobile than on desktop.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.690
So with that, what's the news?

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.160
What have we done to help
mobile developers in

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.830
particular?

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.935
KEN NORTON: Yeah, that number
is pretty astonishing.

00:06:22.935 --> 00:06:25.790
I've been at Google coming
up on six years.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.900
And just watching mobile users
going from being kind of an

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.180
interesting side project, to a
slight distraction, to OK,

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.180
something you need to start
taking seriously, to wow, oh

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.330
my god, to wow, we
should really be

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.040
building for mobile first.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.760
So I think it's really amazing
to think that more than half

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.670
of Google+ users
are on mobile.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.190
And I know you as developers
have been watching the same

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.740
thing happen.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.070
And so what we've announced in
developer preview is a Google+

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.990
SDK for iOS, Android, and mobile
web to make it easier

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.370
for you to bring Google+
into your app.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.640
And that includes a sign
in with Google+.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.230
It includes +1 buttons.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.290
It includes making it easier
to share to Google+ from

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.900
within your app.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.780
And then also the
new History API.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.950
So we're really excited
about it.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.750
It's currently in developer
preview.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.950
iOS is ready now.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.140
Android is coming within
the next few weeks.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.640
It's part of the Google Play
services that will be going to

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.490
all phones with Google
Play store, I

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.540
think Froyo and above.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.000
So it's a pretty wide base.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.400
We're pretty excited about it.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.080
DAVID GLAZER: Thank you, Ken.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.090
And Bradley.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.790
Bradley Horowitz is
our VP of product

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.460
management for all of Google+.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.900
Curious.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.910
You've been walking the halls,
watching the events, involved

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.650
in a lot of the material
coming up here.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.260
When you look at what the news
of the week was from the eyes

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.420
of a developer, what do you
think developers should pay

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.300
the most attention to
over this week.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.050
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Well I think
the high-level message is that

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.510
we deeply, deeply care and
depend on making you

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.320
successful.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.850
And all the investment that we
make at Google I/O is really

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.830
in the interest of making
you successful.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.730
We understand that what you want
are distribution channels

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.500
and the opportunity to impact
the world and ultimately

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.840
change the world.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.750
That's what we are trying
to provide for you.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.810
And I think some of the momentum
story, big shared

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.940
numbers around Google+ adoption,
the number of

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.110
Google+ upgrades, the engagement
in the stream.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.980
All of this bodes toward
the inevitable success,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.250
we feel on the team.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.450
And we want to sweep you up into
that and invite you to be

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.290
a part of it.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.800
And I think another message I
hope is resonating with folks

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.470
is that we are pretty good
listeners, and pretty attuned

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.690
to the dialogue that's
happening between us.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:43.080
And so as we invite you onto the
platform, it's intended to

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.300
give you a voice and give us the
feedback that will help us

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.510
shape the product, shape
the platform.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.120
And we understand how much
you have to offer in that

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.900
relationship.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.510
And so these fireside chats
really are one means of

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.660
dialoguing with you.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.710
But those that have been working
with Google for a

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.710
while know that we have many,
many channels of communication

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.490
and depend on them to ensure
that we're building a product

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.270
that does indeed work for you
and ensures your success as

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.720
well as ours.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.990
DAVID GLAZER: Thanks
you, Bradley.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.700
And I realized I forgot
to introduce myself.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.570
I'm David Glazer.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.810
I run platform engineering
for the Google+ platform.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.180
So all of the different aspects
that hopefully we'll

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.250
be talking about.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.500
So if any of you all have
questions, please

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.510
come up to the mics.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.570
I'll be trying to mix online
and live questions.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.980
But there's mics in both
aisles, so feel free.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.150
I'm going to start with--

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.830
and by the way, if any of you
submitted questions and we

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.560
don't get to them.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.600
There were a bunch of really
good questions about the

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.980
Google+ product and the end user
experience and features

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.850
and roadmap that we're
not covering today.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.320
So they're just out of scope
for this session.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.830
So if you don't hear us get
your question, that's why.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.590
But the top question that
came in from Cape Cod,

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.790
Massachusetts was, when will
the full API for Google+ be

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.250
available to everyone?

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.160
The current API, which only
allows access to public data

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.890
and can't be used to post
is pretty much useless.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.700
And that's not filtered.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.350
That could have been a more
harshly worded question.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.900
That was actually a fairly
honestly worded questions.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.050
And I'll take that one myself.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.750
I think that this is something
we thought a lot about in the

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.240
early days of the platform,
before Google+

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.980
launched over a year ago.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:34.560
And we deeply wanted, as Bradley
just said, to make

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.900
sure we were building a platform
that worked for

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.920
developers, and that let you all
build on and enhance and

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.750
extend, build something that was
great for our joint users.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.090
And at the same time, we knew
there were a couple of failure

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.600
modes around doing that.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.150
The obvious failure mode is
don't give you tools.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.270
Well, that's an easy
one to avoid.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.420
And this question is saying,
I want more tools.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.500
Understood.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.930
But there's some other
failure modes that

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.010
we've seen out there.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.410
And one of them is to provide
tools before we know if it's a

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.080
good idea, and then to change
our mind, and then to change

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.410
our mind again, and then to
change our mind again.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.880
And we've heard from when I went
out and talked to a bunch

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.880
of people who have been
building social media

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.260
applications on top of the
platforms, what it felt like

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.590
to be whipsawed by policies
and changing rules of

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.210
engagement on other platforms.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.030
And we wanted to avoid that.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.210
And the other failure mode that
we've seen is that it's

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:31.870
possible with a platform that
has insufficient guidelines or

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:36.290
tone or just doesn't nudge the
experience in the right

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.790
direction, to build something
that creates a

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.970
tragedy of the commons.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.130
Where the more that people build
on the platform, the

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.030
more it hurts the overall
community and takes away from

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.780
that momentum Bradley talks
about, which is what we are

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.740
all getting the value from,
is making users happy.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.010
So when we put those all
together, our answer was to

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.250
take a pretty deliberate
approach to rolling out APIs.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.590
So we have a bunch of APIs that
are out there and are

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.390
completely widely available,
including a read-only API to

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.790
access public information
from Google+.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.280
Pretty small subset of what you
might want to do, but that

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.910
one is 100% available.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.010
We have another large set of
APIs that let you, in a

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.990
user-mediated way, help your
users interact with Google+.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.570
And these are both desktop and
mobile and some of the brand

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.640
new mobile SDK widgets.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.840
In mediated ways, where you can
say to a user, I want to

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.060
let my users share to
the Google+ stream.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.610
Great.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.730
Here's a way to do it.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.690
That involves putting
up pixels that

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.050
the user clicks through.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.400
And that means that we know the
users are being thoughtful

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.470
about their posting.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.730
We have other APIs that are
available to limited sets of

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.720
partners where we're
experimenting with things.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.390
We're saying, we think this
is a good set of APIs,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.330
but we're not sure.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.740
And we want to be able to work
with a small enough set of

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.210
partners that we can actually
get feedback from them and

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.900
have a relationship with the
people who are using it.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.270
So that if we change our mind,
we're changing our mind in the

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.220
context of a relationship.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.170
And once we know what sticks,
we're comfortable opening up

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.160
more widely.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.990
And then finally we have, as
Joseph talked about earlier,

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.480
we this week added the Google+
API in developer preview.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.990
Which is open to everybody.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.830
And does add, we think, a lot of
the capabilities that we've

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.990
been hearing people asked
for from the API.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:25.250
But adds them in a way that
has a circle-centric,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.530
user-centric twist.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.843
Which is what we like to do is
stay pivoted around the users.

00:13:29.843 --> 00:13:30.246
JOSEPH SMARR: Yeah.

00:13:30.246 --> 00:13:31.820
I was just going to add a quick
comment about that that

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.540
I think ties together the
themes David said.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.730
Which is one of the things we
could really use help from you

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.070
guys is figuring out what is
the right surface area, for

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.370
example, to take the
example of getting

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.230
posts into the stream.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.380
That works well enough for
developers and the use case

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.000
that makes sense for them.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.380
But also works well enough
for Google+ and users.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.860
And I think it's complicated.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.150
Because when you go to share in
Google+, it's a rich post.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.130
You might have an attachment.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.860
You might want to choose which
circles you're sharing to.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.650
You might want to choose
or to notify them.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.560
We built a lot of richness
because we think sharing is a

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.460
pretty nuanced thing.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.790
And so it's pretty hard to
capture that if you're doing

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.060
an automated post, and the
user's not in the loop.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.480
So if you pull up a share box,
well, we control the UI there.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.940
So you can have all that
functionality, and you can

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.600
pre-fill the content.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.910
And if you write to the History
API, one of the

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.000
reasons it makes sense to do
besides giving the user that

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.350
buffer space is that when the
user goes to share it, they

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.070
then can go and choose that
sort of stuff when they're

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.480
sharing it.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.490
And I think obviously there
are cases where using a

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.650
different API and having that
generate a post makes sense.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.750
And so figuring out how much
of that is just a really

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.890
complicated API where you can
basically recreate all of the

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.990
same UI on your end, versus
setting some policy in advance

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.540
like always post
to this Circle.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.190
There's lots of possible
solutions we

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.220
could come up with.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.260
And I think we're really
open to talking

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.330
through specific examples.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.660
But if it's just, hey, I'm
already cross-posting to these

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.160
four other sites.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.210
I want to add Google+.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.270
That's generally not going to
work because we each have a

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.320
different surface area.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.710
It's not the same as a tweet or
a different kind of post.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.460
For anyone who wants to really
think through the nitty gritty

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.240
about how that would work and
present this use case that

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.300
says, here's an app I'm doing
where it really does make

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:09.510
sense for the user to set it
and forget it or use my UI,

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.710
but ultimately, having it
take action on Google+.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.850
Come show us because I think the
devil is in the details.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.940
And we could actually use
some more clarity there.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.380
DAVID GLAZER: That, by the way,
is almost exactly the

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.110
same answer we give internally
when some internal team says,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.170
how about launching
such and such API.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.870
And we have that same
conversation.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.230
JOSEPH SMARR: Right.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.260
As you guys know, we're trying
to unify Google right now.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.410
There's lots of fairly separate
products that are

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:29.240
trying to get unified.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.680
So we have a mini version of
this platform problem just

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.050
getting ourselves unified.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.380
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I want to
add a little bit too.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.010
One of the things we hope you
guys have noticed is that we

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.980
have a very high
velocity team.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.590
Things are changing.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.630
Authors who wrote the Getting
Started with Google+ guide, by

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.360
the time the effort was done,
Google+ had changed entirely.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.430
And they sort of had
to start over.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.170
This is not what you want
when you're a developer.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.370
You don't want to be chasing
after moving target.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.150
So I think part of what Dave's
talking about in terms of the

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.470
maturity of the platform and
ensuring that we're not

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.390
whipsawing the developers around
is getting to a point

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.900
of stability where we're
confident that your efforts to

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.490
build against that platform
are going to

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.820
be time well spent.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.090
And that we're not moving so
fast that in an effort, you're

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.160
sort of chasing after us.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.070
So that's an important aspect
of that as well.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:19.410
DAVID GLAZER: I agree.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.480
Thank you.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.340
Question from the floor.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.580
AUDIENCE: OK, I'm going
to have to call

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.200
bullshit on you guys.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.190
You answered the wrong
W question.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.130
DAVID GLAZER: The wrong W.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.550
You answered the, why don't we
have it instead of when.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.070
When is a time frame.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.365
There was no time frame
specified in

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:41.570
any one of your answers.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.190
When can also be specified
conditionally too.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.230
Like, when we figure out X,
we're going to do this.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.510
But there's no there's no way
to hold you guys accountable

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.920
to when is it going
to be offered.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.770
Now to the general question
of a use case.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.960
I think it's important that we
separate two different users

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.780
and consumers of
your products.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.760
Because there's no reason why
you have to solve everything

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.130
for both sets of users.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.089
So specifically, there's a set
of users that are consumers

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:16.060
that may install apps and
not have a contractual

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.660
relationship, necessarily,
with their apps.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.470
But then there's business
owners.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.839
Who, we have the product APIs
and such like that.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:27.810
But there's no write APIs to
use pages, to update pages,

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.180
which are primarily focused
on businesses.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.300
And for my case, my business
benefits--

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.080
basically we act as a user's
agent to manage

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.520
their social web.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.690
And so we are heavy contractual
relationship

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.910
involving exchange of money and
everything else like that.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.660
Which is a whole lot different
than, did my wife install some

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.080
app that's messing up
her Google profile.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.810
And I think you don't have to
solve the consumer problem in

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.130
its entirety to recognize that
if you have this thing where

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.670
you say, are you charging
money for the

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.880
person to use your app?

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.900
Means that we're held legally
liable at a much higher level

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.380
with our customers than
necessarily a consumer app

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.370
where they've free
installed it.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.520
So back to the thing
is like when?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.820
And can we break it up
into consumer stuff

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.940
versus business stuff?

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.290
And let the business stuff get
ahead of the consumer stuff

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.100
because of the contractual
relationships.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.576
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah.

00:18:24.576 --> 00:18:26.242
Probably several of us have
something to say about that.

00:18:26.242 --> 00:18:27.650
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I'm sure a lot
of have something to say.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.100
So thank you for calling
us out on that.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.010
I think implicit in our and
answer were a bunch of those

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.750
preconditions.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.290
We will do this when we are
certain that it will not

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.630
destroy the user experience.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.920
When the velocity of our team
has stabilized to a point

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.160
where we're not whipsawing the
developers around chasing a

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.290
moving target, et cetera.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.130
I'm certain that no one on
this panel has a specific

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.490
date, if that's what
you're looking for.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.460
I think what you're seeing us
do is, gradually, with the

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.570
launch of History, with the
momentum you're seeing, you're

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.070
seeing the experiments that we
are running in market right

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.390
now play out.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.900
And those learnings accrue
to getting us

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.020
closer to this date.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.810
In terms of the use case you
provided, we are working with

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:12.460
a handful--

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.920
literally five I think is the
current number-- of partners

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.220
that are in a business
similar to yours.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.750
Where they help entities,
business entities generally,

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.160
but also sometimes celebrities,
have a presence

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.750
on social media sites.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.860
And what we wanted to do was
really understand what is the

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.510
effect of having those
relationships mediated.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.020
In a worst case scenario--

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.610
and I'm not saying you or others
intentionally do this--

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.530
but what happens is
you get brochure.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.780
Where you get sort of least
common denominator things

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.470
where a handle is pulled and out
sprays a tweet over here

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.710
and a post over here and
a post over there.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.650
And there's absolutely
no engagement.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.730
It's a really inauthentic means
of an entity engaging

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:56.780
with an audience.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.030
And we want to create something
that actually

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.450
elevates the conversation.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:05.220
Where entities participate as
principles in our system and

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.000
actually respond to comments.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.250
And don't just refer
to themselves

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.200
in the third person.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.250
Where so and so will
be appearing here.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.580
But they actually say, I am.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.230
And they actually refer to
themselves as a person would.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.950
Or we, in the sense
of a business.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.000
And so that is our hope.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.590
And part of what these
experiments are-- and I don't

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.290
know that we've ever talked
about this publicly.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.170
But for those experiments we're
running right now, we're

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.400
actually looking at, how is the
engagement of posts that

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.750
are made through this mediated
system faring relative to

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.510
posts where we know that the
author is actually clicking on

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.500
a button and watching
and observing.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.140
Is the thesis that these are
lower quality conversations

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.480
something that we can measure?

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.100
Are there ways that we
can help them help

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.410
themselves and improve?

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.370
So these are the kinds of
experiments we're running.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.850
But it's all in service of
ensuring that what is special

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.480
about what we're building is not
compromised inadvertently.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.470
And I think we all feel like
we're sort of walking down the

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.840
aisle with this golden egg.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.050
And we're trembling, and we
don't want to screw it up.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.320
Because we feel the magic
in our system.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.540
Any of you who are deeply
engaged on Google+ and have

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.950
been part of this community
understand that there's

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.330
something special
going on there.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.880
And we think it's worth
treating right.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.430
And part of our tentative nature
around this is ensuring

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:24.390
that we get it right.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.840
And making sure this experience
isn't compromised.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.080
Not that anyone has a malicious
agenda, but just

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.530
unintentional consequences that
could corrupt what is

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.030
very special.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.270
JOSEPH SMARR: And so again,
the takeaway is we're not

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.970
saying we don't want to do it.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.410
We're saying we want to figure
out how to do it right.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.840
So help us figure out
how to do it right.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.150
And that's going to that next
level of detail on what

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.860
integration would look like or
the scenarios that it enables.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.410
DAVID GLAZER: And one thing
to add in particular.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.620
Because I actually expected
this question.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.730
I didn't talk to you, but I've
talked to other people in the

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:57.240
halls who had very similar,
well-grounded, hey, I know how

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.580
to do something good for my
customers, how come you won't

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.480
let me, basis.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.400
So the update I got this morning
from the team working

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.300
in that particular area is
that they are comfortable

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.940
saying, we've looked
at that experiment.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.690
We like the results of
that experiment.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.880
Exactly what Bradley said.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.860
We have decided to open that up
more widely for what sounds

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.530
like exactly your use case.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.200
I'm still not going to
your W question.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.890
But we've said, yeah we're
going to do it.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.560
And now we're working on the
details of the tactics of

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.090
doing it as opposed to the
strategic question we started

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.260
with of, is it a good idea.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.755
And the last point I want to
make is I think you're spot

00:22:35.755 --> 00:22:39.090
on, on the line you're drawing
between different categories

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.210
and the idea of segmenting.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.520
I'm not sure it's a difference
that matters.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.780
But I draw I think the
same line you drew

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.770
for different reasons.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:52.050
It's not between paying
customers and casual users.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.380
It's between supporting the
presence of brands and

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.660
entities on Google+ versus
supporting the presence of

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.580
people on Google+.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.400
And there's a lot that
could happen.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.240
If I get a personal thank you
note from somebody that I sent

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.530
a gift to, there's a lot
of humanity in that.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.380
And therefore, there's a lot
of ways that it could get

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.910
messed up if it got run through
a fax machine and an

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.360
OCR and whatever.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.240
But when I get communication in
the exact same mailbox from

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.070
a hotel, it's not all that
personal to start with.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:30.360
And I'm not as worried about
breaking the human touch.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.980
So there's a lot more value that
can be added by software

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.500
like yours with a lot less
risk to the tone of the

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.610
conversation.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.850
JOSEPH SMARR: That said, I hope
one of the things that

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.770
Google+ lets us do is blur
that line increasingly.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.980
Because when you see celebrities
or people

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.440
representing brands acting
authentically online, it's a

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:48.980
wonderful thing.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.780
I think a lot of Google+
engineers and other folks on

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.520
the team are personally--

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.820
like Ken posted the post about
Google+ history and then is

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.370
responding to feedback directly
and all that.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.030
And so we designed the Circles
model so that there's no hard

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.010
line between public
and private or

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.110
business and personal.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.470
We tried to make the Plus page
profiles look like personal

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:08.070
page profiles.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.810
So you don't really have to
think about, is this Lady Gaga

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.490
the person or Lady
Gaga the company.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.740
And obviously for people who
are less famous, it's even

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.320
more of a blur.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.570
Like Bradley, for example.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.980
I don't want him to have to
decide, do I need Bradley

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.400
Horowitz TM, the business,
or Bradley the person.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.990
Because I'm going to have this
radically different experience

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.810
with my consumers.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:28.700
Because we're just
in the middle.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.670
And I'm glad we don't
have that.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.220
But then that complicates the
line you're talking about.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.365
DAVID GLAZER: Another question
And then I'm going to do an

00:24:34.365 --> 00:24:36.430
online one.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.780
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:41.880
So I'm just wondering how does
the team really keep its--

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.670
what is the mission statement
for Google+?

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.110
In a lot of ways you think of
like, when I think of Facebook

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.480
or Google+ and like,
what is it for.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.700
And who's using it.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.300
And there's so many possible
scenarios.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.000
And we're just talking a lot
about a lot of them here.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.640
How do you, as a team, think
about how you're going to

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.290
focus in on what your
mission is.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.430
And then how do you communicate

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.230
that to us as well.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.750
About what is the mission for
Google+ and what is it

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:06.730
actually solving?

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.730
Because it's not as laser
focused as some other products

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.070
that are much more
clearly defined.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.480
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I'm hogging
the panel here.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.940
And I will surrender
the mic soon.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.970
But that one is just too juicy
for me to pass up.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.120
I love that question.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.610
Vic alluded to this in
the stats he gave.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.580
There are really, I see
it, two missions.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.620
Google is an incredible set
of services that have been

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.160
developed over a decade.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.670
Sergey's stunt, if it shows
nothing, is that we have a

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.370
healthy disregard for
the impossible.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.920
And we take on these ambitious
crazy tasks.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.620
I remember one of my very first
meetings, where I was

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.300
lurking in a meeting
with Larry.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.500
And somebody was explained to
him very thoughtfully why what

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.520
he was asking for was impossible
and couldn't be

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.180
done in a browser.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.640
And he sort of leaned back and
said, maybe we should build a

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.850
browser where this
is possible.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.880
And we did.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.780
He can do that.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:05.740
We can do that.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.540
We actually have tremendous
resource.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.600
And it's amazing the company
that Google is, and the value

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.190
that it provides in users
lives around the world.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.160
It's not perfect.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.800
And if I look at the growth of
the company over the last 10

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.040
years, one of the things that
I think we could have done

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.860
better at, was thinking
more holistically

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.050
about an end game.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:29.340
What a user's experience would
be like when maps and finance

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.150
and self expression and
communication were not siloed

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.070
events in a user's life, but
a more holistic approach.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.570
And I think even down to our
management structure, it

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.750
didn't really support any
initiatives that tried to knit

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.860
together these products so that
they were more than the

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.260
sum of the parts.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.080
And to our credit, I think we
have fantastic services that

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.860
have changed the world.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.400
But there's still
work to be done.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.620
And I think Google+ plays a big
role in providing that.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.390
And some of this stuff is just
so blatantly obvious.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.910
Like I meet someone at a party,
and I want to connect

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.060
to that person.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.290
I have to go figure out, what
is your YouTube handle?

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.500
sushiguy21 at YouTube.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.410
What is your Blogger?

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.470
Or does he have a blog?

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.360
Does she have a blog?

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.320
How do I find that blog to
connect to the content that

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.110
they're producing?

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.570
What is their email address?

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.120
I want to get in touch
with the person.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.000
What is their phone number?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.800
There's so many different
touch points to

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.340
connect to a person.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.690
There's no good way to
do that at Google.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.380
You have to do a tremendous
amount of effort across all of

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.150
our products.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.010
Or in this culture, a
woman gets married,

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.750
changes her last name.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.450
Right now there's umpteen places
where you would have to

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.760
go on Google and change
your profile to

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.440
reflect that change.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.460
This is not a feature.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.460
This is a tragic bug.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.300
And one of the things that
Google+ can do is provide that

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.990
social spine that
Vic referred to.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.340
That gives you a simple,
coherent place to express who

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.140
you are, who you know, and what
you care about across all

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.350
of Google, and ultimately across
the internet if that's

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.320
what you wish.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.170
And in doing so, we think we can
provide a better quality

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.160
of service for everything
we do.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.030
We can build a better phone, a
better browser, better search,

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.030
better ads.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.670
Everything gets elevated when
Google knows a little bit more

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.560
about you than just your IP
address and some cookies we've

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.620
put on your browser.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.870
And that is very much one of the
missions of Google+ is to

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.990
turbo charge the next
decade of our

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.450
relationship with our users.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.680
And it's a noble mission.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.600
And we're doing it.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.090
You look at what we did
in Local a month ago.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.840
Where we took Local, which was
this disconnected product, and

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.420
brought it into the Google+
fold so that now I can see

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.760
restaurant reviews from people
I know and trust.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.250
That's a no-brainer.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.410
And I'm delighted that we've
actually taken that step.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.000
And it's one of many, many more
that we will take over

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.620
the coming quarters.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.460
That's a big part
of our mission.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.550
And I think of that in some
ways as remedial.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:53.110
We're sort of fixing what's
broken about Google and

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.680
providing something really
special as a result.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.490
The other part that Vick
mentioned is Google+--

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.250
AUDIENCE: Before you go on,
isn't my identity on Google+

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.320
just like a long number?

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.140
Is there a way to have
a short, like a

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.930
Twitter name on Google+?

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:10.910
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Noted.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.070
AUDIENCE: I mean, you talk about
a scenario that makes it

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.670
difficult for users.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.900
The ability for me to create
a short tag name from my

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.205
identity is totally
missing now.

00:29:19.205 --> 00:29:20.440
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I think we
agree with you that that would

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.630
be incredibly useful.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.450
So that when you do meet
somebody at a party, you're

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.850
not giving them a 16 digit
hexadecimal number.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.430
Yeah, that would be good.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.780
But also, search should
work so well that if

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.830
your name is Joe Smith.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.450
We ought to be able to get
that person to you just

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.460
knowing Joe Smith and the
guy I met at the party.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.670
And perhaps through social graph
or other means be able

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.920
to locate you.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.850
I don't want to diverge
on that.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.860
I want to talk a little bit more
about what I see as the

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.460
next part of that mission,
which is I think equally

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.780
exciting and important.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.570
It's not fun being late to
market, but it does afford you

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:58.850
certain advantages.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.110
And we had the advantage of
actually talking to people and

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.980
asking them what did they like
about existing social networks

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.570
and where could they
be improved.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:09.100
And what we heard resoundingly
was that privacy matters.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.500
And one of the things--

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.780
Joseph was instrumental in
coming up with the model that

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.140
we call Circles--

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.200
context matters.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.690
When you have 2000 friends who
are your kindergarten teacher,

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:23.840
and your co-workers, and your
friends from your church or

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.850
synagogue or whatever, there's
almost nothing you can say to

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.080
an audience that diffuse
which is meaningful.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.440
It's, checked into the
Olive Garden, traffic

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.900
on 101, I hate Mondays.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.950
The quality of conversation is
least common denominator to

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.870
appeal to a diffuse audience
when you don't know who you're

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:41.700
talking to.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.570
In the real world, there are
these things called walls.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.730
And there's the laws of physics
that determine how

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.570
sound travels through them.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.390
We wanted to introduce
that context.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.380
So that when we're up here on
stage, we have one posture, we

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.620
have one tone, we have
one vocabulary.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.960
When we're at home on the
couch with our families

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.400
tonight, it's very different.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.940
And that's not a
character flaw.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.680
That's the way human
beings are built.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.690
And we believe Google+ has an
opportunity to reintroduce

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.170
authenticity and context
into social networking.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.470
And we see that the level and
quality of discourse, the

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.400
dialogue that's happening
in our product.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.870
People are talking about
meaningful things.

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:21.490
We get countless stories about
how Google+ has changed

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.490
people's lives.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.280
Has introduced them to people
that they wouldn't otherwise

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.010
be connected to or know
in the real world.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.780
There's just a huge opportunity
to make social

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.780
networking something more
than ego casting.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.320
Something more than watering
people's farms.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.960
Not that there's anything wrong
with that, either one.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.170
Those are fine too.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.400
But we aspire to
something more.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.480
And we think we have
the framework--

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.120
that's the special thing we're
carrying down the aisle-- that

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.210
can afford that.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.240
I think Hangouts speaks
to that too.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.810
Going beyond 140 characters
is great.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:54.470
But what about having the
authenticity, the ability to

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.370
look someone in the eye, to
read their body language,

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:58.760
their inflections.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.850
These are really meaningful
cues in human

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:02.970
discourse and dialogue.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.660
And we think we have an
opportunity to introduce them

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.500
into our product.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.800
So we think our mission
is noble.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.820
It's not just about the
thrilling prospect of unifying

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.810
Google's products.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.270
But creating something which
is markedly different than

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.710
anything else in market that
can change the world.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.420
How people communicate, how they
connect, and the quality

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.370
of communication that
they're having.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.720
AUDIENCE: So does
your team focus

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.350
around a single sentence?

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.430
Can you boil all of that last
five minutes into like one

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:32.340
since for--

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.415
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Vic can do that.

00:32:34.415 --> 00:32:37.000
JOSEPH SMARR: It's like, making
social work and making

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.810
Google work.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:41.260
And bringing your social
world to Google.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.890
AUDIENCE: I mean, I like the
concept of contextualizing our

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.610
communications much better.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:50.060
Because that's been the big
problem with emails and all

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.870
the other things that we have.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.340
And I think it'd be great if
Google could do more to help

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.110
make it easier to do temporal
and physical location-based

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.820
contextualization.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.680
Like, it's kind of difficult for
me to set up a Circle with

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:10.280
the 12 friends I have who are
here at the I/O. And I'd love

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.090
to see where are they all right
now, and do more of that

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:15.740
automatically.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:17.653
Because you guys know that.

00:33:17.653 --> 00:33:18.800
You know where they are.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.580
You could pull those together
for me and give me a much

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.110
better view than what I'm seeing
right now in Google+.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.290
JOSEPH SMARR: And that dovetails
with a quick

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.470
observation I would make in
support of what Bradley was

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.870
saying too.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.070
Which is that one of the things
I think inspires us on

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.030
the team is this idea
that while it

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.260
seems like, oh my God.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.640
There's social information
overload.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.850
Everybody's tweeting everything
and whatever.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.740
Actually, I think so much of
what matters in our lives is

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.530
just not getting captured
at all.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.190
Of all the sessions you've been
to, which ones really

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.970
blew your mind.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.510
And is that going to help
somebody else who's deciding

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:45.670
which videos to watch later.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:46.880
It probably didn't get
captured at all.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.420
And so the more technology can
help you seamlessly capture

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.140
and share at the right volume
with the right people in the

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.300
right context.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.920
There's just so much more to go
after that we're definitely

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.455
not at the stage where we feel
like we're fighting over a

00:33:57.455 --> 00:33:59.756
fixed slice of pie.

00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:01.240
DAVID GLAZER: All right.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.260
Let me get through a couple
maybe quick ones from online.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.400
Here's one from South
Lake, Texas.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.139
We half covered this already.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:11.210
Are there plans to add Share,
+1, and comment

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.010
features to the API?

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:18.130
Ken, you want to talk about what
we aren't doing there?

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.350
KEN NORTON: So I think the first
comment I would make is

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.699
back to the mobile SDK.

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:25.520
Which is now much, much more
accessible for mobile

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.010
developers to integrate
+1, to integrate

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.040
Share with their app.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.400
I think, to go back and touch
on something David said

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.290
earlier, around giving
affordances that help make

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:39.469
sure that the user is taking
a thoughtful action.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.010
So widgets and buttons
are part of this.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.460
And being able to do Share box
integration on your site or on

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.670
your mobile app.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:49.770
So I think what you'll see us do
is more in line with that.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:52.889
Around giving you the capability
to offer to your

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:56.610
user the ability to do
lightweight actions like +1s

00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:00.810
or to Share, versus kind of
automated APIs is to do it on

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.890
behalf of the user.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:07.500
DAVID GLAZER: And another
question from Barcelona.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.605
Now that we've launched Google+
Events, will we have

00:35:09.605 --> 00:35:14.300
an Events API to add information
on live events?

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.100
The easy, standard answer there
is, that's a great idea,

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.400
and we have nothing
to announce.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.650
KEN NORTON: Request noted.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.400
DAVID GLAZER: Ken, I'm going to
give you this next one also

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.440
because you wear a couple of
hats that put you in the right

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.400
place to answer this.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.010
Will Google+ History tie into
Maps, Check Ins, and Events?

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.360
KEN NORTON: Great question.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.190
So I think as we think about
History as we've

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.060
been building it out.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.790
We start to realize there are
different types of what we

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.690
call moments that
are relevant.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:44.610
So some of them could just be
things like a song you listen

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.530
to or an article you read.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.070
But we realize that there's
other types of moments that

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:54.560
are less living by themselves
and more annotating the other

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.330
moments in your life.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:36:00.070
So where you were when you
checked into a restaurant.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.090
Or where you were when you
were with someone else.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.480
We start to realize that these
are kind of interesting

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.900
dimensions that help make
your history come alive.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.360
And it's more vibrant.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.270
So we're definitely thinking
very, very much about that.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.100
We did announce that
Latitude is coming

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.490
to the Google+ History.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.840
It's going to be one
of the Google

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.140
sources that's connected.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:19.890
It's very close.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.580
It will be coming in
the next few weeks.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.970
So you'll start to see, if you
visited a city, that showing

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.820
up in your Google+ history
as a moment.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.710
And it's caused us to think
about what is the right level

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.450
of granularity for these things
to show up in your

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:33.230
Google+ History.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:36.370
I don't think I want a moment
written every single minute

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.490
when Latitude writes
my lat-long.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.730
I want some more meaning
on top of that.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:42.110
So that's one of the first
sources we have going.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.080
So absolutely location's
critically important.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.300
It came up just a minute ago.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.250
And we think it's a very
important part of the spine

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.680
for Google+ History.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.150
AUDIENCE: So I have
two questions.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:58.790
One is, although I do a lot of
my discussions in Google+, I

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.460
lose a lot of my conversations
because they

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.050
flow by in the stream.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:07.190
So there are a few hacks to hold
on to that information,

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:11.330
but none of them are
particularly bookmark-ish.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:15.225
One that I had offered to me was
to reshare it to myself to

00:37:15.225 --> 00:37:18.190
a Circle that had no people
in it, that only I

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.390
would be able to see.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:21.600
But then of course the person
who shared that on a limited

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.250
basis sees that I'm resharing
it and goes, hey.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.560
What are you doing resharing?

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.860
And then I've got to explain
to them that it's my way of

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.190
bookmarking things.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:34.620
Is there going to be any way
of bookmarking or storing

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.550
posts or threads so that you can
go back and look through

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.080
them a week later,
two weeks later?

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.650
DAVID GLAZER: If anyone
else wants to take it.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:47.380
I'll say that that's a need
that I've felt personally.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.590
That I have conversations
like that.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.520
And I use exactly the same kinds
of work arounds you're

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.110
talking about.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.150
So that's a pain point
that several of us on

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.790
the team have felt.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.630
And we don't have an
answer to announce.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:01.540
But i we agree with the need.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.430
CHEE CHEW: I also
have a point.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:07.370
The way that we think about
this for conversations and

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:08.290
real-time communications.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:11.620
I think there I would have two
categories of those to happen.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.820
One are like broad post
announcements, and then the

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.340
thread that goes
back and forth.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.620
And that's really interesting.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:21.440
And also recognize that a lot of
people use the stream as a

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.560
quick way of sending an
individual or a couple of

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.770
people a message.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.630
So in becomes a small,
private conversation.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.940
And those you want to have
an easy way of finding.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.260
Sometimes the only way finding
that is go to the profile of

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.190
the person who sent it.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.580
And you have to remember
who sent that.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.590
That problem is also something
that we're definitely thinking

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:45.370
about in our overall work on
improving real-time chats.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:49.130
So I guess the message for you
is, this is something we

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:50.820
acutely are aware of.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.280
And we hit that every
day ourselves.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.860
And we're working on figuring
out a better solution.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.940
JOSEPH SMARR: I would say, it's
also just something that

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.830
the web needs in general.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:01.950
I use Instapaper.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.110
I try to bookmark stuff.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.180
I try to leave tabs open
and then use Chrome

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.580
to pull stuff across.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.600
None of it really
works very well.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.875
I have labels in Gmail
for [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:08.875 --> 00:39:09.770
all sorts of stuff.

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.940
And it seems to me like the
two things that go wrong.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.540
One is, that supposedly idle
time when I'm going to want to

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.500
bring the queue down doesn't
seem to happen as much as I

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.170
would think.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.200
So things just get queued up
and queued up an queued up.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.480
And after a while I'm like, OK,
well jeez, I haven't read

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.240
this article for a year.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.470
I'm probably not going to read
it and I just have to DQ it.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.220
And the other thing is that
that consumption pattern

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.720
doesn't necessarily fit.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.100
It doesn't remind you,
oh, here's a

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:32.880
little bit of idle time.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.580
Here's the stuff you
could be reading.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.840
And so I think most of those
problems aren't even really

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.690
Google+ specific.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:40.325
Like we often talked about, oh
should we be able to star a

00:39:40.325 --> 00:39:42.300
post and go back and see a
stream of starred posts or

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:42.900
something like that.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.570
And you could do that.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:45.870
Modulate the complexity
and is that

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:46.760
really the right solution.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.780
But it actually isn't really,
I think, Google+ specific so

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.740
much as just there's way too
much stuff for me to always

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.360
respond everything.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.560
And there's no kind of good
GTD solution for the web.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.300
Of queue it up in the tasks and
someday maybe get through

00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.030
and pull it down.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.650
And so I hope people can
help build that.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:02.580
And if you've got a good
solution for that and are just

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.400
waiting on some integration with
Google+ to make it really

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.800
work well for that, we'll
be very motivated.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.130
Because we all have this
pain point to try to

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:08.550
help you make it work.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:10.680
AUDIENCE: I guess my reason
for asking the question is

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.270
because I'm part of a team
developing an app in Hangout,

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:18.100
called Tabletop Forge, which
lets people play games--

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.070
Dungeons and Dragons kind
of games in Hangouts.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.950
And so a lot of prep and talking
goes on before the

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:27.050
game started up that you want
to then reference later on.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.650
The guy says, well, you can make
this kind of a character,

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:30.910
and you make that kind
of a character.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:32.570
And by the time you actually
get around to doing it two

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:36.360
weeks later, the night before
the game, you can't find the

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.760
instructions that
he's given you.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.570
So we'd like to be able to not
only the star those, but even

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:44.790
potentially tag them and connect
them to an event or a

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.435
Hangout, or a Hangout
in an event.

00:40:46.435 --> 00:40:47.580
Something like that.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:48.500
CHEE CHEW: I agree.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.330
Actually we do that in
our team as well.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.780
A couple of things that I would

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.890
suggest is using hashtags.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:59.130
So we use a series of hashtags
to help find those and

00:40:59.130 --> 00:40:59.840
filter those out.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.270
And then with the addition of
Events where you can have a

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:04.130
Hangout scheduled event.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.570
You can bind and
put information

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.370
related to that as well.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.120
AUDIENCE: So my second question,
not to monopolize

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.740
the microphone, is that in the
Hangout itself, we'd like to

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:18.210
be able to do a screen capture
of the Hangout.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:23.300
And using the History API like
you would do in the party the

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.980
other night with people going
around taking pictures.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:28.130
And those pictures immediately
can be put up and shared as

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.920
part of the event.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.760
We'd like to be able to capture
the entire screen and

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.090
do the same thing.

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.930
So right now, we could build
an extension that we would

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:39.030
have to load at the same time
we load the app and

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.240
render it in HTML5.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.260
But we still can't get
the film strip.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.890
It would be ideal if the app
could just have a way of

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.290
grabbing the screen at
a particular time.

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:49.930
So in our game for example
you roll the dice.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:52.420
If you roll really poorly,
everybody freaks out and you

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.270
can see them.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.340
And it's quite funny usually.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.670
And if you roll really well,
everybody goes, yeah!

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.610
So it would really nice to be
able to capture those moments.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.030
Because those are the moments
that define the experience.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.190
Just be able to capture
those automatically.

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.710
CHEE CHEW: Right.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.355
That's a great suggestion.

00:42:06.355 --> 00:42:07.640
And I agree with you.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.470
It's something that we started
to investigate.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.040
There are some privacy
concerns about that.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.350
So the technology
is one thing.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:20.720
And then there's the policy,
privacy sort of thing that's

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.670
probably will take longer
to resolve.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.820
But yeah, I agree with you.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.080
That's a good use case.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.380
JOSEPH SMARR: I will say that
if you looked at the private

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.560
Google+ streams of a lot of
people on the team, you would

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.080
see many a screen shot of
Hangouts that includes

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.150
something funny happening or
people doing something weird.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.250
Especially because a lot of them
take place later in the

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.290
evening, and then everybody's
a little bit laid back.

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.070
And so there's a lot
of fun stuff.

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.200
So once again, yes we absolutely
feel that plan.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.170
DAVID GLAZER: You wouldn't
happen to be Ed in

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.080
Cincinnati, would you?

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.820
Because the next question on my
list from Ed in Cincinnati

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.340
is, how about write
APIs for pages?

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:58.060
Unlike users, queueing up and
automating posts would rock.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.510
AUDIENCE: No, I'm not Ed.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.820
DAVID GLAZER: But I think
we mostly answered that

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.875
previously.

00:43:03.875 --> 00:43:05.710
AUDIENCE: But as someone who
was born and raised in

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:09.460
Michigan, I resent being
considered from Ohio.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.460
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm from Ohio.

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.980
AUDIENCE: Oh how I
hate Ohio State.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:22.380
So it's a little bit of a
follow on to my needs as

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:26.170
someone who is a business
for business.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:28.910
Is that one of the concerns.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.320
I kind of debated even asking
the question because it's kind

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.750
of on of our selling points.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:39.530
Is that Google, as with many
other large social networking

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:43.300
sites, has this propensity to
take down first and ask

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.120
questions later.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.100
And when you're a person, and
it's one thing that hey, my

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.300
post about what I did
this evening get

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.550
taken down, it's annoying.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:55.360
When it's marketing

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:58.720
collateral, it's beyond annoying.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.470
And this extends to things
like YouTube videos where

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:06.370
there's various automated DMCA
takedown notices to just

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:07.920
random mother things.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:13.000
Malicious DMCA filings
and such like that.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.370
First of all, there's no real
API mechanism, unless someone

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.980
corrects me.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.170
There's no API mechanism where
a program could monitor for

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:25.050
such a request being filed.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:35.580
And it doesn't really seem
like there's any sort of

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.980
coherent process where it's like
a certain number of days

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.520
that you can hire lawyers
and stuff like that.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.500
This is stuff that's really
important for businesses, less

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.010
so for people.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.560
And people get irritated
by it, but

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.990
businesses get ballistic.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.110
And since we're trying to do
this, we're building this tool

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:54.750
to help businesses manage their
social web presence.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:58.130
Being able to have a
notification mechanism that

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:02.850
there is some sort of DMCA
filing against our customer's

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:07.440
video is something that
is useful to us.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.540
KEN NORTON: That's a really
great request, thanks.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.790
You've seen, I think, Google
generally becoming more and

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:16.010
more transparent, as transparent
as we can be about

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:17.170
these types of government
requests.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.680
And obviously there's regulatory
issues that we

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.260
comply with.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.050
But we're trying to be as
transparent as possible.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.150
And that's a really great
suggestion which is direct

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.640
notification.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.470
Which is something
we'll take back.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:31.260
CHEE CHEW: For something like
Hangouts and real-time events,

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:35.540
it is important for us to take
action pretty much real time.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:39.830
If you think about like very
popular live sports events.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:43.450
If we allow them to go and take
them down a couple of

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.980
days later, that's
a big problem.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.360
We can't do that.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.790
So for real-time, live,
streaming events, we need to

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.330
take pretty quick action when
we have confirmation that

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.430
there's a violation.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:02.520
If you have ideas specific to
your use case where we can

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.420
satisfy the requirements that
we have, but also help you,

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.170
we're extremely open to
brainstorming and talking

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.840
through ideas.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.360
We would love to engage with you
to figure out how we can

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.870
satisfy what you're
trying to do.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.763
SETH STERNBERG: One thing I'll
just say, having just joined

00:46:18.763 --> 00:46:19.570
the team really recently.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:21.390
So none of these guys are
probably going to say it.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.930
But I'll just say it
as an observation.

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:26.220
Is you've never seen a group
of people that are more

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.340
focused on just, what is the
right answer for the user.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:34.120
So I remember very well being
on the outside of this team,

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.240
wondering why do they make
decisions that they make.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.810
And why is there no API yet.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:41.310
Like Meebo would have
loved an API.

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.870
And then coming onto the inside,
it's very much what is

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.150
the right decision
for the user.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:48.210
And how can we really protect
the user and give the user the

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:49.950
best experience possible.

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.320
And sometimes that ends up
meaning that it takes a little

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.540
bit longer to get that right
capability in the hands of

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.550
developers.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.800
But ultimately, hopefully,
that's better for developers

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.400
and the ecosystem
and the users.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:02.820
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.704
Let's take one from this
side of the room.

00:47:04.704 --> 00:47:05.620
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.130
I don't want to harp on the
subject, but to ask again

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:09.380
specifically about commenting.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.990
Especially for tools like
ours that ingest data.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.330
Users might not be using the
Google+ API or the Google+ app

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:20.250
or the website.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:23.000
They might be using some other
reader tool to read data.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.920
But they still want to do
something with it like +1.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.530
You can +1 now, but what
about commenting?

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.160
It seems like something that
while you're figuring out how

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.580
to let people share stuff within
Circles and control

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.910
that aspect of it, they
could still be able

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:37.250
to just add a comment.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:40.020
A good example is the Instagram
API where you can't

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.600
post photos because they want
to control that experience.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.490
But you can favorite them and
you can comment on them.

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.450
And that still gives tools that
ingest data a good way to

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:48.440
let you users [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.490
it without taking over
how you post things.

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.280
DAVID GLAZER: What company
are you with?

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.130
AUDIENCE: I'm with Scope.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.730
It's a social media
aggregation tool.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:57.450
JOSEPH SMARR: There's
good sense there.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:00.710
Although I'll point out that
even our commenting surface is

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:01.830
more complicated than
you might think.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.940
Because I can plus mention
people and it auto completes.

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.055
And then it expands the access
control of the entire post to

00:48:07.055 --> 00:48:07.700
include those people.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.130
And so you could have a
stripped down comments

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:12.090
experience without some
of the complexity.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.560
But everything we touch like
there's actually enough

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.790
complexity there that it's
not a no brainer.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:19.690
That said, I think we're very
eager to do anything that

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.220
improves engagement on posts.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.870
Like you said, recently we did
this thing where in Gmail, you

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:26.510
can just comment directly from
the message you get notifying

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:27.140
you about a post.

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.140
You don't have to go back over
to the app to do that.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.320
And as you might expect, when
you cut that kind of friction

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:34.030
out, you see a corresponding
increase in engagement.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:36.380
So I think we're certainly--
that's an area where I think

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.920
everyone is pretty well aligned
around making it as

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.630
easy as possible to comment as
soon as you see something and

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:42.400
have that urge.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.980
DAVID GLAZER: And let me
ask a specific question

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.650
about your use case.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:47.290
Both about your use case, but
also as a sort of the thought

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:50.000
process we go through in
these kinds of things.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.180
If we gave you a widget
of some sort

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.290
that you could invoke.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.210
So you display a post in
your tool, your UI.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.280
You have a comment button.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:02.540
When someone clicks it, you
invoke our box that pops up,

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:07.110
which lets them type in
a comment on the post.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:10.820
Would that fully, partially, or
not at all meet your needs.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:15.490
AUDIENCE: For commenting, and
if we were able to theme it

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:17.960
somehow, then yeah.

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.730
That would be OK.

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:21.530
For posting, like using the
services SDK, I went to that

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:22.080
talk today.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.490
That wouldn't really be ideal.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:26.300
You kind of take people out of
the experience of your app.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:30.000
But if it's just commenting on
something and you can make it

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.150
look something like your
app, that's fine.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:34.000
Yeah.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.180
But just because half
of our feature

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.370
requests are at Google+.

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:41.330
And to allow us to tell the
user, oh, well Google+ is

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:42.720
working on how to do that.

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.910
And they're like, well,
why don't you do that?

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.350
They just think it's
our problem.

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.610
DAVID GLAZER: That
makes sense.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:49.080
So thank you.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.550
Because that is the path we go
down to try to find that

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.186
balance that's good for
the user, good for

00:49:53.186 --> 00:49:54.030
the community, and--

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:55.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah, if there was
a way to comment, we would

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:57.560
integrate it now.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.060
JOSEPH SMARR: Perhaps not
surprisingly, we face this

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.410
exact challenge even
internally.

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.485
So when we've done our
integrations in Gmail and

00:50:02.485 --> 00:50:03.060
Search and everywhere else.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.170
We always have this like, hey
could we give you a little

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:06.880
iframeable widget where
we still do all

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.790
the rendering ourselves.

00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:10.820
Or are there performance UI
reasons why that's not good?

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.760
And we've had to kind of do a
mix of solutions depending on

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.730
the situation.

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:15.850
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:17.320
Thank you.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:21.130
I've always been a big fan of
Kevin Rose's app, Oink.

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:24.490
And when he moved over to
Google, it was understood that

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:26.200
he was working on Google+.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.230
And then I know he recently
went to Google Ventures.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:31.400
So I was just wondering what
his influence or his team's

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.240
influence has been on Google+
and if they're

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:34.210
still working on it.

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:38.250
And get you to shed some light
on that situation.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.010
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
I can take that.

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:42.850
So in general, when we acquire
or hire people, this is sort

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:47.120
of an unusual quirk of Google,
we rarely know what they'll be

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.370
working on and neither
do they.

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:49.850
We hire the world's
best people.

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:52.560
They're generalists
most often.

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.820
And we give them kid in a candy
store access to what

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.660
we're doing.

00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.880
And they look around and
figure out where

00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.120
the best fit is.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.240
DAVID GLAZER: Seth did social
media for publishers, so we're

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.810
having him redo our
data centers.

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:07.080
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Kevin is one
of these amazing entrepreneurs

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.960
who has passions around
investing.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.720
He's a prolific Angel
Investor.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.140
He's also a great product
visionary and product mind.

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:16.800
He has passions in
both directions.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.740
We didn't know for sure
where he would land.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.880
We invited him to contribute,
and he continues to

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.480
contribute.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.440
He's an avid fan and
user of Google+.

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.710
His primary passions lean toward
what he's doing helping

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:31.380
build start ups and companies.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.420
And we have a unique opportunity
for him with

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.240
Google Ventures.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.500
Many other team members--
it's a small team.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.370
It's not too many.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.650
But folks like Daniel Burka
continue to contribute on

00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:46.830
Google+ and particularly around
the mobile redesigns

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:47.500
that you've seen.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.810
They were contributors there.

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:50.790
Although there was
a ton of momentum

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:52.710
that they walked into.

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:55.015
If you've been watching our
trajectory, you'll have seen

00:51:55.015 --> 00:51:59.710
that our sincere redesigns of
mobile pre-date Kevin and his

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.050
team joining us.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.430
But they're an incredibly
talented team.

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:05.840
And we always try to optimize.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.790
And the optimization function
includes both where are their

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.870
skills, but also where
are their interests.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.580
And where are they going
to get most passionate.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.490
And so we're delighted that
Kevin's at Google, and we

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:18.210
think he's going to do
a ton of good for us

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.740
doing what he's doing.

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.080
JOSEPH SMARR: And then Milk
guys are definitely making

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.010
Google+ better.

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:24.730
And I'd say we've had a bunch
of relatively small

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.710
acquisitions of really talented
people that had a

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.170
huge impact inside Google+.

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:29.470
I can think of the
[? Say Now ?]

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:32.810
guys or the Planner guys,
and the list goes on.

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:33.990
So Milk's definitely
in that list too.

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.560
It's going to be cool.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.230
And it's partly I think why
Google has a pretty start-uppy

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:38.200
feel inside the company.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.780
It's not just that we kind of
built something from nothing

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.450
in the last year and
getting it out.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.810
But also that we've got a lot of
that entrepreneurial spirit

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:45.830
in the people on the team.

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.460
SETH STERNBERG: Which is
therefore very intimidating

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.750
for me and the rest
of the Meebo team.

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.330
We've got to do a
good job here.

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:53.180
JOSEPH SMARR: But hopefully it
means that it's your people.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.430
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.120
My name's JP.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.420
By the way, Hangouts--

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.970
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Do you
love pear shooter?

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.930
AUDIENCE: No, definitely not.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:07.630
I love adrenaline though,
but not that much.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:08.660
Love Hangouts, by the way.

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.960
We use it internally
in our company.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.000
We have a small business
to business app.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.830
I think one of the things I hear
from the business guys--

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:18.740
and I think more B2B not B2C.

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:23.340
And I see a lot of potential for
Google+ the platform and

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.560
rolling it out for businesses
in our context.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.850
And I think a theme I keep
hearing is just allowing us

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:33.420
the ability to plan our
dev around your dev.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.230
You lead the way.

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:36.900
And if you do want us to
integrate with your APIs then

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.680
we're all in.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.060
We're in the Apps Marketplace.

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.900
We have a gadget and all
that good stuff.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:45.150
But as you guys think beyond
features, features, features

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:49.190
and functionality, I'd just like
to open the conversation.

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.780
Have you guys be a little
bit more committal.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.350
That's just a theme I keep
hearing is share back.

00:53:55.350 --> 00:54:00.800
Because not committing to
a date or committing to

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.140
shipping, I get it.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:05.350
I'm on the other side of the
fence more often than not.

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:09.040
But to enter the dance with you
and go all in on Google

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.260
and really build our app around
you guys or with you

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:16.235
guys, that reciprocity would
be really, really helpful.

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:21.560
DAVID GLAZER: Understood
Thank you.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.040
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.490
Hi.

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:28.310
I have two quick questions,
I hope.

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:31.500
One is, you mentioned that it's
important to keep one

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.780
identify of the user.

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:37.000
And just as a comment, I
have a Google+ account.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.960
I have a Google App domain,
so I have a

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.570
Google+ account there.

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:43.380
I have another domain, so I have
a Google+ account there.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.050
So I have three Google+
accounts.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:49.180
People add me, they bring my
accounts into their Circles.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.030
It's quite a bit of a mess.

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:53.453
So am I the only one?

00:54:53.453 --> 00:54:53.836
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: No.

00:54:53.836 --> 00:54:55.620
All of us are in
that situation.

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:56.040
JOSEPH SMARR: Yeah.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.000
We all have our Google accounts
and many of us have

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.520
entity domains and
yeah, it's lame.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:00.520
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Yeah, it hurts.

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.330
We're aware of this.

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.510
It turns out to be a more
nuanced and complicated

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:07.260
problem than you would imagine
at first glance.

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.230
We have felt that way as we have
struggled to provide the

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:13.050
right tools and remedies
to this situation.

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:15.450
But it's not you, it's us.

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:16.350
We're working on it.

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:17.140
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.640
And the second question is about
creating more social

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:26.140
engagement or communications,
is there a guide to share or

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:27.450
to do the post?

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:31.230
But really like what about
listening or to actually keep

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:33.090
the conversation alive?

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:38.295
So let's say we generate the
post shared to the circle and

00:55:38.295 --> 00:55:40.640
it starts generating
some activity.

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.010
A week later, there's really not
much way to actually get

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:47.540
back to that or keep track of
if there's some activity on

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:50.950
the two-week-old post.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:53.120
JOSEPH SMARR: You're talking
about at the product level?

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:53.780
SETH STERNBERG: That's
actually a really

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:54.520
good feature request.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.730
So you want you want an API that
would send you a signal

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.100
that says, hey, this post has
a lot of activity, right?

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:01.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.420
Like someone--

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.300
that was a wonderful example
about the hike.

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:11.280
I'm planning to hike, to
mountaineer, in three months.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.970
If I post it now, in
two weeks, it will

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:14.970
fall off the radar.

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:16.030
No one will remember that.

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:18.680
No one will be able
to find that.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.930
So for discussions which
are not really

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:22.350
within a day or two--

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:26.080
and it's not just Google+.

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.330
It's actually I think
quite a common issue

00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:29.890
within social media.

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:34.760
But that's just one of the
comments I have that I think

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.020
it would be a good
thing to improve.

00:56:38.542 --> 00:56:39.810
JOSEPH SMARR: Yeah, totally.

00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:42.630
One thing that excites me
about working on Google+

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:46.330
inside of Google is that so many
of the surfaces I go to

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.900
when I'm looking stuff up,
whether it's a Search or I'm

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:50.970
looking up stuff on a map or
I'm going to my calendar or

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:52.220
I'm going to my phone.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.670
These are all, in theory,
surfaces where we can pull

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:57.790
from that stream, including the
deeper contents that have

00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:59.980
fallen off when it's only
reverse chronological.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.630
So I think of the content as
going-- that's one of the

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:03.790
reasons why I'm passionate
about History.

00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:06.420
Everything that comes in is
collected in this sort of

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.220
database of Shares or the
sort of wisdom of

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.160
your crowd or whatever.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.840
And I think right now as an
industry, we don't do a very

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.560
good job of providing
lots of different

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.730
pivots into that database.

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:16.520
But I think there's no reason
why we couldn't and shouldn't.

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.140
And you see a bit of that now
with the Search, plus Your

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:22.080
World integration where Google
Search is really reaching into

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.256
all the privacy-aware photos
and shares and so forth and

00:57:25.256 --> 00:57:26.260
pulling that information out.

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.140
But it's just scratching the
surface when you really think

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.370
about all the scenarios where
that could be pulled out.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:34.140
And I think people would share
a lot more if they knew, I am

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:35.580
going to be able to get that
back when I need it.

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:37.230
Or when my friend goes and looks
for that thing three

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:39.010
months from now, they're going
to be able to find that

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:39.700
information.

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.050
So I think it creates
a virtuous cycle

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:42.116
if it's done right.

00:57:42.116 --> 00:57:42.562
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:57:42.562 --> 00:57:44.855
Because yeah, with History, it's
my personal History where

00:57:44.855 --> 00:57:47.430
with Share, it's more often
discussion, right?

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.890
JOSEPH SMARR: Right.

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:49.070
Although even with your History,
not only you can

00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:50.210
share explicitly.

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:53.990
You can also go in and make the
data available to say your

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:56.070
friends Circle or people without
having to make a post

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:58.255
about everything.

00:57:58.255 --> 00:58:00.800
And right now, the main way
that surfaces is you go to

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.580
somebody's profile, you could
see more of their stuff.

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:06.270
But it's along that whole idea
of just get the data in, make

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.720
it available.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.210
And then hopefully we can do
more and more interesting

00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:09.120
things over time.

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.700
AUDIENCE: But wouldn't making
the History available to

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:15.470
others be the same as a post?

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:16.170
DAVID GLAZER: No.

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:17.960
Great question.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.860
Stick around for the next
session and either grab us in

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:22.170
between or ask afterwards.

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:25.140
There's an important but subtle
difference there.

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:28.240
We have just over
a minute left.

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:33.440
And most of the remaining
platform questions in the

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.940
online forum in the moderator
are about History.

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:39.010
So if you ask one of those,
please stick around.

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:40.150
Come back for the
next session.

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:41.400
We can take them there.

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.860
And I think--

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:45.630
let me see.

00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:49.090
I'm going to put everyone on the
spot and ask you for a 10

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:50.240
second sound bite.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.000
See what happens.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:51.710
I have no idea.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:55.140
So I'm vamping just for 20
seconds just so people have

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.020
time to come up with
something.

00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:01.980
Sort of a closing thought around
the Google+ platform

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:05.350
and either what you learned from
developers today or your

00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:07.430
thoughts on what we
should do next.

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:10.870
So Bradley looks like he's
got a mic ready to go.

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:12.230
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Sergei,
we need you.

00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:17.900
KEN NORTON: Help us make
Google awesome.

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.840
SETH STERNBERG: Yeah.

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.720
sjs@google.com.

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.560
I really want to know what you
guys want to see out of

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.780
Google+ as a platform.

00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:30.860
CHEE CHEW: For Hangout API, we
tune and design our APIs and

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.780
prioritize based upon what
you're trying to do.

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:39.220
And the team holds Hangouts
every Thursday where we engage

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.890
and we talk and we get
feedback from you.

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:42.930
Please engage with us.

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:44.220
Come and give us the feedback.

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:47.480
And we will tune our APIs, what
we do and how we do it,

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.780
based on your needs.

00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:50.500
JOSEPH SMARR: And we
didn't get to talk

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.110
about it much today.

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:54.070
But we don't want to just make
Google+ platform social.

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:55.340
We want to make the
whole web social.

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:58.100
And so anything you can do to
help us think through, as we

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.660
open up our platform, how we
can do in ways that aren't

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.150
just about plugging into our
particular social stack, but

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:06.020
about making social gestures and
profile and identity and

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.780
sharing more web native.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.300
We still really care about that
and want to hear your

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.010
thoughts about it.

01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:12.510
DAVID GLAZER: All right.

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:13.200
Thank you, everyone.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.340
Thank you very much.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.590
Appreciate it.
