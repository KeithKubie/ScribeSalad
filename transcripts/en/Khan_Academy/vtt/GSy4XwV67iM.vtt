00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.240
- [Instructor] The photograph shows author

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.620
Helen Keller teaching
actor Charlie Chaplin

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.550
the manual alphabet.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.050
So when I read it, I paused a long time

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.820
when I saw the semicolon
here because it's there

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.970
but it felt strange.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.030
The photograph, and
then it put a semicolon?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.250
The semicolon would separate
two independent clauses.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.580
The photograph for sure is
not an independent clause.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.430
It can't stand on its own as a sentence.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.410
And shows author Helen
Keller teaching actor

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.130
Charlie Chaplin the manual alphabet,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.120
that also is not an independent clause.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.300
So I definitely wanna change this thing.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.620
And one thing to think
about, and this is just

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.710
a good principle in
general in life, is, well,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.360
do you need this thing or do
you need any punctuation there?

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.810
And if you just read
it without punctuation

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.200
how does it read?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.670
The photograph shows author
Helen Keller teaching

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.620
actor Charlie Chaplin the manual alphabet.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.940
Sounds great, no reason
to put any kind of pause

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.920
or anything over there.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.860
The photograph shows.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.320
So I like just no, I like
no punctuation there at all.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.420
Now what are these other choices?

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.280
The photograph, colon.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.867
Well, I would use a colon
if I'm about to list

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:06.220
a bunch of things.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.340
You know, there's three
reasons why I liked

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.151
this movie, colon, it was entertaining,

00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:15.750
there was a lot of action, and
there was a lot of romance.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.970
Or if you were providing
some type of a definition.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.670
But that's not what's going on over here.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.640
And you would typically
have an independent

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.290
clause before your
colon, and the photograph

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.480
is not an independent clause.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.920
It's not a full, it can't stand on its own

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.890
as a sentence.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.100
So rule that out.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.710
And then a dash right over here.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.180
That would be good for a parenthetical.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.280
So the photograph, and
then if you were somehow,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.390
you know, making a little bit like hey,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.890
the photograph, which I lost yesterday,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.490
shows author Keller, author Helen Keller

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.260
teaching actor Charlie Chaplin

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.130
the manual alphabet,
then you might wanna put

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.160
a dash before and after
that parenthetical clause,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.980
that little aside that
you make to the reader.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.890
So I'm gonna rule that one out as well.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.910
And, you know, always go for whatever

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.303
is most simple as long as
it actually makes sense.
