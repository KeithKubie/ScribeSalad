Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab. We're going to keep going with our show on colors now with a story about, well, hey blue, the color of the sky, most beautiful color. No red. Yeah. Yeah. You got it. It's a story that we find really surprising frankly. And it comes from our producer Tim Howard. Yes. Hello. Um, who, uh, heard it from [inaudible] set up who this guy is. Uh, so Guy Deutscher is a linguist and a writer and uh, I came across his book or through the language glass and he tells this one particular story in it that, uh, starts in I think 1858 with this Guy William Gladstone, who was incredibly famous politician in England. He was four times prime minister in the second half of the 19th centuries. Every school kid knows who he is even now. But there's one thing that not many people know about Gladstone, but he was a, a home of fanatic.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Those, the soldiers marched. The gleam went dazzling from the magnificent bronze all about through the upper air to the heavens. He was a deeply religious man. And for him, the Iliad and Odyssey were almost like a second Bible sipping the black blood, the tall shade, perceive pain and cried out shot. He read them over and over again throughout his life. So he was in the homer. Yes. And so early on in his career, Gladstone decided to write the definitive history of homer, his huge book, actually three books, thousands of pages way. He discussed a whole range of issues relating to home and his wallet. And here's the thing, as he was reading, doing his research and everything, he made this very strange discovery.

Speaker 2:          01:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:46          that's the way home I talks about [inaudible] in the Iliad. And the Odyssey is extremely odd. It's odd. Very, very odd. How so? To start with uses extremely strange times, four colors of, of simple objects. The most famous one perhaps is the wine, dark sea, the wine, wine, dark wine, dark seats eight. It looks like wine. Looks like wine. It is, it possibly like a, a poetic kind of thing. And that's what you would naturally think. But the other thing he calls, um, wine color, uh, oxen, but, but it's more than just a wine take the color violet, which to me and probably to universal purple like purple. And homer uses it. He talks about the sheep and the side clubs. Rams were in the cyclops caves is having a dark violent wool. But that's just fantasy. I mean, but the other thing that he also says is violet is iron iron. So chew on that or how about this one? What is both the color of honey and the color of, uh, faces Pale with fear. I had no idea. If you ask homer, those are green, green honey. He didn't call his green, he didn't call his leaves green. Um, it all seems to be wrong. And, um, this was totally puzzling to Gladstone. Hobo was Gladstone's absolute hero. So he found it difficult to understand and accept why someone who was so perceptive would use such defective terms as Gladston colleague.

Speaker 1:          03:20          So he starts going through the Iliad and the Odyssey again and page by page, and he counts how many times each color appears. I mean like how many times he uses the word black or blue or whatever. Yeah. And um, it only takes a couple pages for him to notice. Predominance of black and white that the term black carrion flat black Bros, black, black, black, black, black, black occurred about 170 times in both books. White, white arms, white club, the white curd about 100 times. But red blood, red serpent only clocks in at about 13 times the red wine to the exotic Trump, yellow in her yellow robe row under 10 times Greens, teeth chattering, green fear also under 10 mm. And then Gladstone realizes something crazy, the color blue,

Speaker 3:          04:17          um,

Speaker 1:          04:23          zero times what there's just no word that describes the color blue in any of Homer's poems. He does not use the word blue at all. No blue, no blue. Not even once. Nope. So Gladstone Thought, Huh? Bazaar. And he started looking in other classic Greek texts too. And there he kept finding all of these strange uses of color, violet hat and things like that. And after thinking about this for a long time, Gladstone concluded that homo was kind of blind, but also that all the Greeks were kind of blind. We, he thought all of them were colorblind. Yes. That they saw the world in black and white, maybe with a touch of red. His thought was that they were straining to see these other colors that were kind of just outside of their reach. And then their kid would inherit that effort or their kid would just be a little bit better.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Oh. So that's how we got color. So homer junior would be able to see a little bit of yellow, cause homer tried really hard to see yellow and you then homer, the third would be better than home or the second and then this would happen again. And again, every generation down 3000 years to the present day, it just seemed the only, you know, the, the only possible explanation. That's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. We know today of course, seven that, that the color vision goes back probably about 30 million years, you know, to like when we were still in the jungle climbing trees. Exactly. So I'm generally people Ma

Speaker 4:          06:01          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:01          No one took him seriously. So then how do people explain the no blue and homer thing? Well, here, the plot thickens. 10 years after Gladstone's homered debacle. This other guy and gentleman, Jewish penologist called Lazarus guy again, Lazarus Geiger, a German Jewish, what did he say? Philologists which I thought was a linguist. It basically means he studies ancient texts. He finds pretty much the same kind of weird stuff Gladstone did, but he finds it not just an ancient Greek texts, but all over the place. Sorry, this one, he looked at the old Icelandic Sagas [inaudible] ancient Chinese Joan Susa. Young, ancient vedic hymns. [inaudible] Stephie, the Bible [inaudible] and surprise, surprise. What did he find there? No blue. Even the Bible had no blood in the original Hebrew [inaudible] Vinnie of Hahaha. It has no blue. Huh? So where, what's this? What's this room? Right now we're in the public catalog room.

Speaker 1:          07:06          I actually went to the New York public library and talked to this librarian and to Vic [inaudible] can speak German, so and fic long can shake the dementia. And we got out Geiger's book development, history of mankind. Wait a second. I know this voice. Really? Yeah, that's, that's my girlfriend. Oh, my name is Brooke Watkins and I'm a librarian at the New York public library. She is a librarian. Very cool passenger. Does speak to daggers books. See at first let's do it in German. Guy Again has this amazing quotation. Okay. It's fast. You hear about the Indian vedic poems, these Alita [inaudible], Jane towels and vans and [inaudible]. What does that say? She's hymns of more than 10,000 lines are brimming with descriptions of the heavens. Scarcely. Is there any subject evoked more frequently? The Sun and reddening. Don's play of color, day and night. Cloud. Enlightening. The air in the ether and efs are unfolded before us and over and over in splendor. And did it fullness. Well, there's only one thing that no one would ever learn from those ancient songs who do not already know it. And that is that the sky is blue.

Speaker 5:          08:14          Who? Who?

Speaker 1:          08:16          It gets weirder. Hmm. You're ready? Yeah. Ready for this and totally ready. Alright. Cause Geiger then wondered, all right, if there's no blue in any of these old texts, then when did blue come into these languages? Yeah, so he did this massive analysis to trace when each color term was first introduced to each language. And what he found was that the order at which languages seem to acquire these kind of Thames is not entirely random.

Speaker 4:          08:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:47          first black and white. Every language has black and white. Then when they get their first color term, red always comes fast. Always red after red. It's always yellow. Really? Yeah. And then green and blue only to very end. So black, white, red, green, yellow and then blue. Yeah. And that's universal. Well, as people discovered more and more languages, they found some exceptions, but a couple of things held even from Geiger out of these colors. Red Is always first and blue is always last. Why? Well, why would there be an order at all and why would blue always be last? Well, here's where you get to the guessing part. Okay. Thinks it might have to do with a couple of things. First in Homer's world, you wouldn't have actually been exposed to a lot of blue things. Actually, if you think about it, blue is extremely rare in nature.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Blue Foods, no blue animals know. How about plants? There's a few blue plants, like what flowers it I really blue eyes. Extremely rare. A lot of flowers that we think of as blue. They're actually artificial flowers. We made them blue genetically man. Yeah. What about Blue Eyes? Blue Eyes at the time. Way In short supply. I'm among the Greeks, but here's where we get to guy's main point. He says you don't really need a word for color until you can make that color reliably and the reason they're red might have been first is that red is apparently one of the easiest to produce. You can just take a dried piece of red clay and you can use that as a [inaudible], which is why paints made out of oak or go back something like 60,000 years and blue. Blue is the hardest of all. For thousands of years. No one had it. One exception, the Egyptians, the Egyptians, and they, and only they had their own word for blue. So that's it. That's your answer. Yeah. Like no blue dyes. No blue words. That's not interesting. I want more than that. What do you mean more? I don't know. Something more to say than just it's about all right,

Speaker 6:          10:51          here you go.

Speaker 1:          10:52          As I was calling around, I ran into something that made me think a little differently about Gladstone's whole theory of colorblindness called this guy named Jules Davidoff, professor of newest psychology, London University, and a few years back he got interested in this particular tribe in Namibia called the Himba Himba many languages in the world. They don't have a different word for blue. You might think of them as like a very poor stand in for homer. All right, and to make a long story short, Joseph went to Namibia. He sat down with a bunch of members of the Himba tribe, whipped out a laptop and showed them 12 colored squares, or I didn't except for one. And there's actually some really cool video footage of his research assistant doing this and they asked them very simply, which one is different now that you look at this and you see the 11 of these squares are green [inaudible] we would call green, very green.

Speaker 1:          11:43          The other one is blue. This blue one, it's, it's shouting. It's like, Hey, I'm bayou over here. I'm blue. It's easy enough for us to do. It would be, yeah, it's a no brainer, but the Himba who don't have a separate word for blue in their language, they find this distinction and that are difficult. When they stare at this screen, they just stare and stare. They don't see the difference. They don't know was there something wrong with their eyes. Now, definitely not completely rule that out. They don't see color and individual colors differently, but then it's so easy to say that they're seeing different colors to us and then not, well then how does he explain it? Okay. When we, when we decide to put colors together in a group and then give those colors a word like blue, something happens. He says, what happens is that now that there's a category for that thing, the thing in the category jumps out, it gets louder and louder to your eyes.

Speaker 1:          12:48          The category actually feeds back on your perception. So you notice it more. You're saying that having the word for blue unlocks your ability to see blue. I mean it, that's how it feels to me. And jewel says no, it's not caught that he says without the word, you're still seeing the blue no matter what. You're just not. Um, noticing it. Your eyes are just kind of glossing right over it so you don't see it. It's hard. It's, it's, it's harder to spot. It says jewels, whatever. I don't quite understand that difference. But blue would not jump out and say high five the way it does with us. But if it doesn't jump out to that extent, then this is starting to sound very Gladstone to me. I mean maybe he was a little right. Like, cause if homer had no word for blue in the word, somehow enables the blueness of the blue, then maybe his world was less blue than it would be for us.

Speaker 1:          13:42          I mean maybe the blue went through his eyes in the same way, but perhaps didn't get into his mind in the same way. Yeah. Blue didn't matter. Wait a second. Do you know where this breaks down? Where deaf sky. I mean you look up and there's the bluest blue in the world and it's right there above our head. It's been there since the dawn of time. So why wouldn't blue matter more? I mean, why wouldn't it be the first color instead of the last? Well, that's what I thought too. And I asked guy about that. Yeah. Why is the sky blue? Is, is the, the, the first question is that you allegedly, the first question that all children ask. Yeah, but I wanted to see how obvious or striking this blueness of the skies. So I decided to make an experiment.

Speaker 7:          14:29          Uh,

Speaker 1:          14:31          guy has a very young daughter, 18 months. She was learning to speak. What's her name? Um, I talked a lot about colors with Emma and taught her all the colors, including blue. And we would play all these games there that dads play with the children, you know, pointing at objects. I would point it to a blue object and ask him, what's the color of this? She would say boom boo for blue. A. Okay. Soon enough, Alma is a total pro. She could identify any color, show me the red object, show me the destiny. Right. The only thing I didn't do, and I asked my wife not to do, was ever mentioned that the sky was blue. That was the setup. So one day guy and Elmo were taking a stroll and they're practicing the colors. What's the street? What's this, what's this? And then I pointed at the sky and said, what kind of is that?

Speaker 1:          15:19          And she wouldn't give me any answer. Huh? Oh, does she just a second before would was happily telling me that something was blue on red or green. She just looked up and looked at me in comprehending Dingley sort of, what are you talking about? Cheetah? You're kidding. I think she didn't understand what I was on about. Huh? In retrospect, there was no object that there was nothing with color for her. You're just pointing into the void, basically pointing into nothingness. So she wouldn't say anything, but guy kept asking every single time they went out. And once I would do it only when the sky was blue and she would never answer. And this went on for two months. And then finally she did consent to give me a color name, but it wasn't blue. It was white for for a few times you said white.

Speaker 1:          16:03          And then finally after a month and a half or two moments, she said blue for the first time. Wow. Even then it wasn't consistently blue. So she then she said once blue, no white, no blue. Did she eventually decide though? You know what that is? Blue wasn't, no, she never said it this way, but eventually when I asked it became consistently do it. So she just would say blue. Okay. This was for me really the point where I, I could, you know, convince myself, I convinced at least my heart that this sort of allegedly perfect example of blue, um, is not so perfect. So you know, for Houma who, you know, never ever probably saw a blue object except the sky and the sea, never had a dad who sort of went on and bought blue objects and asking them what they kind of, this guy was the fact that he didn't lose sleep over. It doesn't seem so strange anymore.

Speaker 8:          17:03          You know, it's kind of, it's a, now that I've heard this, I'm a little, I'm a little, uh, ruining the, the moment when Alma decided the sky was blue, let her have whatever color she wants it to be. Doesn't have to be blue weirdly then color is a loss of innocence. Yeah. It's Kinda like having something fixed that for awhile it's just between you and your friends, he'd hearts, you know, this guy has many colors. Truthfully, on the other hand though, I'm disagreeing with myself now. If we all agree the sky is blue, then that's something we can share that she can share. And then she's in conversation and then eventually she'll understand, you know, this kind of blue,

Speaker 9:          17:41          um, uh,

Speaker 1:          17:45          [inaudible]
