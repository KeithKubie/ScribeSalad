00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.210
Okay, one answer, and the actual way this happens, is

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.770
that the cell could make a copy just of the sequence

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.630
that it needs for the current recipe it's making, and

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.850
bring it to the cytoplasm to be turned into protein. Just

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.050
imagine for a second that we actually make a tiny

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.370
copy, just of this little piece of the chromosome here. Because

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.960
that's the information we're interested in. And then we bring

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.930
it out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. And now we

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.720
have access to these ribosomes that can use the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.110
information to build from. Now there might be other ways

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.890
you've thought of to do this. Like someone came up

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.440
with a way where, like a piece of the nucleus

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.060
might break off into the cytoplasm carrying DNA directly

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.820
to the ribosomes. Another possible explanation you could have come

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.210
up with is that there's another special compartment that could

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.230
house both DNA and ribosomes so they have to be

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.940
trafficked there or taken there together. Or

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.910
maybe you thought of something even more unique.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.230
But the way a cell solves the problem is that it makes copies of the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.790
information that it needs to build the protein that it wants at that time, and

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.680
it takes these copies into the cytoplasm.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.130
To actually be turned into protein by ribosomes.
