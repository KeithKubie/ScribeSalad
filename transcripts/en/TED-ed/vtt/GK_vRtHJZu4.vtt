00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.734
Our planet's diverse thriving ecosystems
may seem like permanent fixtures,

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:15.037
but they're actually 
vulnerable to collapse.

00:00:15.037 --> 00:00:17.034
Jungles can become deserts,

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:19.666
and reefs can become lifeless rocks,

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:23.972
even without cataclysmic events, 
like volcanoes and asteroids.

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:28.466
What makes one ecosystem strong
and another weak in the face of change?

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:32.217
The answer, to a large extent,
is biodiversity.

00:00:32.217 --> 00:00:35.692
Biodiversity is built out 
of three intertwined features:

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.720
ecosystem diversity,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.585
species diversity,

00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:41.696
and genetic diversity.

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:44.589
The more intertwining 
there is between these features,

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.321
the denser and more resilient 
the weave becomes.

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:50.305
Take the Amazon rainforest,

00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:53.292
one of the most biodiverse 
regions on Earth

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:55.289
due to its complex ecosystems,

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.086
huge mix of species,

00:00:57.086 --> 00:00:59.849
and the genetic variety 
within those species.

00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:01.678
Here are tangled liana vines,

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:04.918
which crawl up from the forest floor 
to the canopy,

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:07.047
intertwining with treetops

00:01:07.047 --> 00:01:11.657
and growing thick wooden stems
that support these towering trees.

00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:13.299
Helped along by the vines,

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.963
trees provide the seeds, fruits
and leaves to herbivores,

00:01:16.963 --> 00:01:19.821
such as the tapir and the agouti,

00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:23.778
which disperse their seeds
throughout the forest so they can grow.

00:01:23.778 --> 00:01:26.207
Leftovers are consumed 
by the millions of insects

00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:30.223
that decompose and recycle nutrients
to create rich soil.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:34.910
The rainforest is a huge system filled
with many smaller systems, like this,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.188
each packed with interconnected species.

00:01:38.188 --> 00:01:40.471
Every link provides stability to the next,

00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:43.329
strengthening biodiversity's weave.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.092
That weave is further reinforced

00:01:45.092 --> 00:01:48.976
by the genetic diversity 
within individual species,

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:51.484
which allows them to cope with changes.

00:01:51.484 --> 00:01:54.441
Species that lack genetic diversity
due to isolation

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:56.182
or low population numbers,

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.491
are much more vulnerable 
to fluctuations

00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:03.042
caused by climate change, disease
or habitat fragmentation.

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:06.713
Whenever a species disappears
because of its weakened gene pool,

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:10.945
a knot is untied 
and parts of the net disintegrate.

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:14.511
So, what if we were to remove one species
from the rainforest?

00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:16.945
Would the system fall apart?

00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:18.388
Probably not.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:19.610
The volume of species,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.062
their genetic diversity,

00:02:21.062 --> 00:02:23.249
and the complexity of the ecosystems

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.135
form such rich biodiversity in this forest

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:30.802
that one species gap in the weave
won't cause it to unravel.

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:34.457
The forest can stay resilient
and recover from change.

00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:36.509
But that's not true in every case.

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:40.271
In some environments, taking away
just one important component

00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:42.747
can undermine the entire system.

00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.963
Take coral reefs, for instance.

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:48.215
Many organisms in a reef
are dependent on the coral.

00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:51.801
It provides key microhabitats,
shelter and breeding grounds

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:56.397
for thousand of species of fish,
crustaceans and mollusks.

00:02:56.397 --> 00:03:01.186
Corals also form interdependent 
relationships with fungi and bacteria.

00:03:01.186 --> 00:03:02.987
The coral itself is a loom

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:07.261
that allows the tangled net 
of biodiversity to be woven.

00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:09.624
That makes coral a keystone organism,

00:03:09.624 --> 00:03:12.974
one that many others depend on
for their suvival.

00:03:12.974 --> 00:03:15.670
So what happens when destructive
fishing practices,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.237
pollution and ocean acidification

00:03:18.237 --> 00:03:21.775
weaken coral 
or even kill it altogether?

00:03:21.775 --> 00:03:23.695
Exactly what you might think.

00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:28.478
The loss of this keystone species
leaves its dependents at a loss, too,

00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:31.241
threatening the entire fabric of the reef.

00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:34.232
Ecosystem, species
and genetic diversity

00:03:34.232 --> 00:03:37.991
together form the complex tangled weave
of biodiversity

00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.593
that is vital for the survival 
of organisms on Earth.

00:03:41.593 --> 00:03:44.711
We humans are woven 
into this biodiversity, too.

00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.983
When just a few strands are lost,

00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:49.394
our own well-being is threatened.

00:03:49.394 --> 00:03:52.796
Cut too many links,
and we risk unraveling it all.

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:55.365
What the future brings is unpredictable,

00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:58.301
but biodiversity can give 
us an insurance policy,

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:02.597
Earth's own safety net 
to safeguard our survival.
