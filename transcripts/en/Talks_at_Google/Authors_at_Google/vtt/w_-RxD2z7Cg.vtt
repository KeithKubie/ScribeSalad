[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.494 --> 00:00:07.160
ERIC ALEXANDER: It's
an honor to be here

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.130
and to be able to share this
story with all of you today.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.990
And just like you said, my goal
is to encourage-- hopefully

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.850
to inspire you to overcome
the Everest in your own life.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.710
And I've chosen
to actually title

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.930
this talk today, "Ascend!"

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.110
because we so often
maybe limit ourselves

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.790
in what's possible
for our lives.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.920
And that's one reason I
love climbing with people

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.500
with disabilities-- because
when I see them challenge

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.620
themselves, I'm the one
who's encouraged and inspired

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.160
to go and live a
limitless life, myself.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.390
And so it's to ascend.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.660
It's to rise to the challenge of
what's possible for our lives,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.480
and to live beyond limits.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.930
How many of you have ever
maybe hit rock bottom?

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.810
You've set off for something.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.159
You thought, this is the
direction I'm going to take.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:57.950
This is the course.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.900
Maybe it's literally
you've fallen.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.230
Your climbers here,
your cyclists--

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.170
these types of things.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.900
And maybe you've had
injuries or setbacks.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.850
And so often, we let those maybe
define us or we get dejected,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.540
and it's hard for us to kind of
regroup and set off and chart

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.100
a new course.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.430
I had an experience like
this in the French Alps.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.840
I had just finished
a year long exchange.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.130
I had been ski patrolling.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.860
I'd been learning the
language and working side

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.980
by side with these guys.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.563
And I thought, what
a cool opportunity

00:01:27.563 --> 00:01:29.060
I have here at the
end of the year

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.800
to go and do the Haute Route.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.974
A bunch of patrollers were
coming from Beaver Creek,

00:01:33.974 --> 00:01:36.140
up in the Vail area, and
they were going to join me.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.970
We were going to do this week
long ski tour over the Alps,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.620
and it was going to be awesome.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.870
We get to the top of the tram.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.190
We set off on day one.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.290
We can see the
route ahead of us.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.160
And we descend, and as we
descend, these clouds come in,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.940
and they just totally
obscure our view-- the route.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.310
We can barely see our ski
tips, it's that thick.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.105
And it just came in like that.

00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:59.000
And so we go across
this glacier,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.821
and we lose sight of the route.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.320
And we're trying
to find our way up,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.186
and we keep kind
of scooting along.

00:02:05.186 --> 00:02:06.560
And the next thing
we know, we're

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.350
getting spit out way
down the glacier.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.940
How did we get so
far off course?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.820
And we're just sitting
there all together,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.570
talking about what's
going to happen next.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.090
And we're completely bummed out.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.170
The clouds lift.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.280
The sun comes out.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.430
It's now afternoon, and it's
too late to take the course

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.110
that we had charted.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.250
And then up from below
comes this French guide--

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.890
a guy that I had gotten
to know that year.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.870
And I can see his
face right away,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.305
and he's kind of smiling
and singing songs.

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:36.680
And he sees us
there and he goes,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.970
ah, Eric, in his French accent.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.260
What are you doing?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.280
And then we tell
him what happened.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.180
And I'll never forget his
words, and I think of them

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.110
all the time because it was
simple, and in French, he said,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.560
[SPEAKING FRENCH].

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.670
And it means, we don't
go down, we go up.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.060
And he said, come with me.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.310
We're going to go to this hut.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.990
We'll get you back on course.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.840
And that's all it took, was
just kind of that bright,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.230
smiling face and the sunshine
to get us back on course.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.480
Someone who maybe
believed or saw

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.840
the way that we couldn't see.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.260
And so I've never forgotten
those simple words--

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.660
we don't go down, we go up.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.380
And so climbing with people with
disabilities, I see that a lot.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.000
I am this way.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.510
I can't recover from this.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.130
It's too late.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.470
My life is over as I knew it.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.270
The adventure is gone.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.570
All possibilities-- all
the goals and dreams I had.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.220
But then there's those rare few
who do see the possibilities.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.600
One more example of this was
something growing up in my home

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.090
that my dad had brought home
that he won in a contest.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.130
It was these pencil sketches.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.410
The first one said, prepare,
and it showed these guys

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.240
getting their equipment ready.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.680
The second picture-- and these
are giant, framed drawings--

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.690
was this, and it said, ascend!

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.320
And you can see this
is probably 1963.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.150
I'm guessing it's the first
American expedition on Everest,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.520
and he's got the oxygen mask
on and going up the lines,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.730
heading up the mountain,
taking on the challenge.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.080
And then the third
picture was triumph.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.990
And there they are.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.680
They've got the flag planted
on top of the mountain.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.769
They've made it to the top
and there's celebration.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.320
But the one I always choose
to focus on is this one--

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.750
ascend.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.550
That's where the adventure is.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.750
That's kind of the unknown.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.270
It's where you have
to apply your strength

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.040
and your skill-- the
preparation's done,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.530
and this is where the challenges
are-- the questions lie.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.280
Will you make it?

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.290
Will you not make it?

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.460
Will you need to turn around?

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.300
And that's where so much
of our life is lived.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.910
If we choose to take that step.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.190
If we choose to believe.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.300
If we choose to ascend
beyond our circumstances

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.191
or ascend towards our
dreams and our goals.

00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:56.690
I've climbed around the world
with people with disabilities,

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.630
and I've seen this many times.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.150
In one particular case, I
got to trek the Inca Trail

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.120
to Machu Picchu--

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.100
35 miles.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.710
We did a special version.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.590
We called it the Super Inca.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.200
And we did 35 miles--
over 15,000 foot passes--

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.850
and we had nine blind high
school students on this trek.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.980
It was amazing.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.960
The scariest part
about it was that they

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.800
had nine sighted high school
students as their guides.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.300
So you can imagine
how that goes.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.770
They tune out to the
ear buds, which they

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.860
shouldn't have had anyways.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.790
But the hat is pulled down.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.456
It's like, oh, man,
this place is great.

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:32.970
And then there's a drop here,
and the leader takes a left

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.560
and forgets the guy behind him.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.370
Can't see the turn--

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.200
ah, there's a drop.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.780
But fortunately, we
travel in threes,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.240
so there's always someone
behind to grab a backpack,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.560
turn him, slap him on the rear,
and say, no, no, this way.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.950
It's amazing to see how they
would take on that challenge,

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.200
and how their trust
and their camaraderie

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.740
would grow on the
days along the trail.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.340
And the vision for what
was possible in their lives

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.030
would also grow as
they would ascend.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.770
We got to Machu Picchu--

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.984
all of us, in one piece.

00:06:06.984 --> 00:06:09.150
And when they got there,
they had special permission

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.290
to duck the ropes and go in
and touch these stones often

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.420
considered sacred
with their hands,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.011
and run their hands on them.

00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:18.760
And I thought this is
going to be amazing.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.360
It's going to blow their minds.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.270
They're going to
want to spend days

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.660
here, but after
about 10 minutes,

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.280
they were ready to go--

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.500
get a meal, shower
up, I don't know.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.250
But what I realized
was it wasn't so much

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.350
the destination,
because one rock began

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.910
to feel just like another.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.520
And to them, they couldn't
see it in its grandeur,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.930
but it was just putting
their hands on the stone.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.080
What it was for
them was the ascent.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.610
It was the journey.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.710
It was the camaraderie
that they had experienced,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.830
the trust which they had
really never had to that level

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.020
or that degree in
their life back home.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.750
And on this trip,
they got to experience

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.630
that in a really special,
unique, and different way.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.712
Well, after the trip was over,
we're heading out on the train,

00:07:04.712 --> 00:07:06.420
and four of these
students came up to me,

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.972
tapping their white canes
up the center aisle,

00:07:08.972 --> 00:07:09.930
and they surrounded me.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.388
And I thought oh, they're going
to beat me with their canes

00:07:12.388 --> 00:07:15.060
because I've tortured
them over this last week.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.400
Instead, they said hey,
this has been incredible.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.390
Would you take us
to Kilimanjaro?

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.710
Wow-- that next year, I
saw four blind students

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.450
stand on the roof of Africa with
a completely new vision of what

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.504
was possible for their lives.

00:07:32.504 --> 00:07:34.170
When we were done
with that, one of them

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.086
said, I'm going to get
an internship with NASA

00:07:36.086 --> 00:07:38.500
and be the first
blind person in space.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.950
Another one said, I'm going
to start a blind driving

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.200
school, a racing school.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.200
Wait a second-- this
was before Google Cars,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.880
you know, and all of that.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.440
I don't know if
that's going to work.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.648
He said, no, no, hear me out.

00:07:50.648 --> 00:07:52.560
We go to the
Bonneville Salt Flats,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.740
and as long as you go straight
you can go as fast as you want.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.540
I don't know if it ever
got off the ground,

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.700
but I haven't heard of
any deaths out there.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.840
But I admired his
passion, and it's just

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.380
amazing to see their eyes
opened up figuratively.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.620
I have been able to
climb other places--

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.669
Aconcagua, Denali, Russia--

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:15.210
I got to go there
with my good friend

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.820
Erik Weihenmayer, who
lives here in Golden.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.200
He's completely blind.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.120
We climbed Mount Elbrus,
the highest point

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.040
on the European continent.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.160
We would climb it blind and
make the first blind ascent,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.500
but then we'd
click into our skis

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.510
and make the first blind ski
descent from 18,500 feet.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.502
A lot of you ski, maybe
Winter Park here in Colorado,

00:08:36.502 --> 00:08:37.710
and you've seen blind skiers.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.480
Anybody seen that?

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.179
You're familiar with
maybe with how that works?

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.440
Maybe you doubt?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.390
That's usually what
I've experienced,

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.620
is that people riding
on a chairlift will say,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.190
well, they can see
a little bit, right?

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.830
No, not always--
completely blind.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.670
So the way it works is
I yell at him a lot.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:00.130
Or when he's not looking, which
is pretty much all of the time,

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.410
I give him a push and say
good luck and drop in behind.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.960
It's a little bit that way,
but I stand beside him.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.370
I describe the terrain.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.030
It's gentle.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.910
It's wide open.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.240
There's no obstacles,
no trees, no rocks.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.040
So you can pretty
much go for it--

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.726
make your first
turn to the left,

00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:17.100
and I'll be right
there with you.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:23.730
And so we'll take off, and I'll
say turn a left, turn a right,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.910
and we'll make big, swooping
fast turns until the terrain

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.844
gets narrow and steep.

00:09:28.844 --> 00:09:30.760
Then we slow down, and
it's more like a dance.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.570
It's turn left, turn
right, turn left.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.390
If there's something
he needs to know about,

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.300
I'll make sure he knows.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.322
Hey, there's a rock
outcrop up there.

00:09:41.322 --> 00:09:42.780
You might want to
slow down and put

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.127
on the brakes and
[WIPE OUT SOUNDS]..

00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:45.960
No, no, no, he says.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.293
I don't need to know what it is.

00:09:47.293 --> 00:09:48.870
I just need to know what to do.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.870
So it's better to
say stop, cliff.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.770
There's really two things
you need in blind skiing,

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.810
and the first is trust.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.980
The second, forgiveness.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.430
Because you always do make
mistakes, or I do as a leader.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.940
And so it's actually a
very important quality

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:15.390
that you have in a friend,
in a spouse, at work even,

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.310
and especially in blind skiing.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.290
What I've learned
from my friend is

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.660
that he doesn't hold
that grudge against me,

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.020
because he knows it'll keep
us from achieving our goal.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.360
It's more important
to focus on the goal--

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.410
fix the problem but keep
our vision up ahead.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.754
And that's the way we do it.

00:10:32.754 --> 00:10:34.170
So maybe you'd
like an opportunity

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.931
to guide a skier
down a mountain.

00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:36.930
I'll give you that here.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.730
So I've got a video.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.650
Put yourself in my position.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.120
You're going to lead this
person down the mountain.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.589
So just kind of
hang on and think

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:45.880
about the lefts and the rights.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.940
You don't have to shout
it out here in the room,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.790
but just to maybe get
a feel for what that's

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.270
like, change your perspective.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:52.936

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:02.803
Slow down.

00:11:02.803 --> 00:11:05.442
Stop, stop, stop.

00:11:05.442 --> 00:11:06.650

[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.245
How'd you do?

00:11:09.245 --> 00:11:12.860
Yeah, OK, that guy is not blind.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.530
But that's exactly what it feels
like, kind of out of control,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.580
a little bit scary.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.770
It's amazing.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.380
That's why I'm so inspired
to see people do that

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.130
and to be a part of it
and to ascend and try

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.090
these things that are difficult
and challenge ourselves.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.180
Another time I got to
do this was on Denali.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.640
Climbing the highest
peak in North America,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.150
I was able to take two
blind army veterans.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.110
One was blinded in Iraq when
a suicide car bomb went off

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.555
right next to him.

00:11:43.555 --> 00:11:47.690
He nearly lost his whole
head, and since then, he's

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.930
not seen the face of his
wife or has he ever seen

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.940
the faces of his children.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.400
But he's thankful
everyday that he has life

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.530
and that he has those children.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.200
And he still continues
to climb and to seek out

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.990
adventures in life, to ascend.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.830
He's not going to be
defined by his disability.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.350
He's going to be defined
by his ability to continue

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.360
to live a full life.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.960
The other was Marty Bailey,
blinded in Afghanistan

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.300
when a grenade went
off in the foxhole

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.480
that he was in right next to
him, severed his optic nerve.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.280
And it's the same for him.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.890
He's seeking out
challenges professionally,

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.740
seeking out challenges
here in the mountains

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.680
to continue to
live a life that's

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.130
full of adventure, to ascend.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.950
We came up just
short of the summit.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.950
But again, it wasn't
about the triumph.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.990
It was full of preparation.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.540
But it was mostly about
the ascent, the challenge,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.250
the obstacles, the struggle,
and doing this together.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.540
I still climb.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.420
Most recently, I was in
the Swiss Alps climbing

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.250
with my blind friend Erik.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.230
And we chose to do one
of the six great north

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.370
faces of the Alps.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.530
This one's called
the Piz Badile.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.410
It's a 3,000 foot
wall of granite.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.570
And we spent a lot
of time preparing,

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.540
getting trained
physically to do this.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.310
We got to the Alps,
and you can see here,

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.320
this is a technique
called stemming.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.810
But really, for
Erik, it's more about

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.430
brailling his way up the rock,
feeling where those holds are.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.860
And so he'll be feeling for
a hold, and I'll say oh yeah,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.870
it's right there, Erik.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.265
It's just up eight
inches and over ten.

00:13:29.265 --> 00:13:30.390
And then he'll feel for it.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.730
And then he'll remember
right where that is,

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.230
and when he gets
up a little higher,

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.192
he knows his foot can
go right on that hold.

00:13:35.192 --> 00:13:36.650
And so I'm there
climbing with him,

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:41.060
looking down between my feet,
guiding him as to where to go.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.220
Well, at one point
on this climb,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.960
it gets a little congested.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.584
The weather had been
bad, and at this time,

00:13:47.584 --> 00:13:50.000
everybody was charging the
mountain because it was finally

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.040
dry and the weather was good.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.050
And so we thought, this is it.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.150
This is our do or die moment.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.830
If we continue on,
there's a good chance

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.110
we're going to spend the
night out on this face,

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.985
hanging from our harnesses.

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:04.610
If we go down, we're
probably not going

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.740
to get another shot at this.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.390
What do we do?

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.864
We chose to continue to climb.

00:14:10.864 --> 00:14:11.780
We followed our heart.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.360
We followed our gut
and we pushed on,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.520
about 13 hours of climbing, just
pure movement the whole day--

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.560
4:00 in the morning
till about 4:00 or 5:00

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.740
at night making the summit.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.880
There's Erik celebrating.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.250
I told him to give this
kind of corny pose,

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.150
you know, like the
double thumbs up.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.990
But we were psyched
to have made it.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.960
The next day-- we
didn't realize this

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.560
as we headed down into Italy,
but the mountain right next

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.070
to us, a twin peak
called Cengalo caved off

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.480
four million cubic meters
of granite, which went down

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.940
the valley and wiped out the
trail which we had hiked up,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.430
wiped out the road
which we had driven up.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.800
Our car was now stuck
in this parking lot,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.300
high up on the mountainside
as this stone and mud and tree

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.910
and debris just
cleared the valley.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.430
It went down and it wiped
out the Swiss village

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.720
where we started.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.940
It had been
evacuated thankfully,

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.100
but eight people died.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.700
And I was thinking, I am so
glad we didn't turn back,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.940
that we followed our gut.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.320
Eight tourists who were
trekking or climbing in the area

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.880
lost their lives to
that, and I think

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.960
we would have been among
them had we turned back.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.390
I was thankful for the ascent.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.009
I didn't realize it, but it
even made news here at home.

important to make a decision

00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:50.750
to turn back.

to continue on.

know the outcome,

00:15:55.631 --> 00:15:56.630
but we give it our best.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.200
And in this case, I was glad
that we made the ascent,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.740
that we chose to ascend.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.020
Well, it's lessons I've
learned from climbing

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.070
that I apply to my life,
whether it's professionally

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.860
or to my family,
and again to climbs

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.112
that I continue to take on.

00:16:14.112 --> 00:16:15.820
And that's what I want
to pass on to you.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.520
What is it to ascend,
to make the ascent?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.140
What does that require?

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.660
Well, it requires
the preparation.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.900
But in the midst of it,
it requires courage,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.360
for us to be courageous.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.120
And I'd like to add
this little bit to that,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.250
and that's the
courage to serve--

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.210
to look beyond ourselves
and our own needs,

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.250
to expand that to look out
to the needs of others.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.910
One thing I love about climbing
with people with disabilities

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.150
is it requires that of me,
to forget about myself,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.280
to put my attention on them.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.220
And in doing that, the next
thing I know is my own fear

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.810
is gone because I've
taken it off of myself.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.220
I've put it onto them and
we move along together.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.720
My fears take a backseat.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.270
My attention has
focused on them.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:08.390
It takes faith and trust in each
other, a special team spirit.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.280
We often hear the word teamwork.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.410
And to me, teamwork is great.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:13.890
It's getting the job done.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.730
It's very task oriented.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.859
But it's a little bit like an
engine which is just idling.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.750
It's not going anywhere.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.510
I like this word team spirit
because it is engaging.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.950
It's what puts that car in
gear and uses that engine

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.920
to move the car down the road.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.100
Leadership and integrity-- often
we hear the word leadership

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.700
and we think of it as if
it has virtue on its own.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.710
But it's not until
the leader himself

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.650
has integrity and character
and is in that position

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.720
that this is true.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.450
So leadership is great, but
it's having the integrity

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.160
which makes it matter.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.290
And then lastly, perseverance--

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.110
the ability to go right back
up to the top of this list

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:58.620
and courageously serve again
and take another step forward.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.626
I would learn this
really in the Himalayas,

00:18:01.626 --> 00:18:03.500
because the greater the
challenge, the higher

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.680
the obstacle, the greater
the lesson, the more

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.392
we have to learn, the
more it can make of us.

00:18:09.392 --> 00:18:10.850
I'd go to this
mountain here called

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.830
Ama Dablam on a training
climb with my friend

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.660
Erik, training for
Everest the next year.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:21.070
We would climb up to
19,000, 20,000 feet together

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:25.180
through white outs, through
wind and cold and storm

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.640
while the team climbed ahead.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.020
And at this point, I'm
super thankful for teamwork

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.630
because they've gone
ahead and set up camp.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.140
Hey, that's awesome, teamwork.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.390
I like this I can get into it.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.210
Thanks, guys, for
carrying the heavy loads.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.400
Which tent is ours?

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.590
To which they reply, uh,
yeah, you guys, you're

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.510
right over here.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.300
Oh, thank you very little.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.285
No problem.

00:18:47.285 --> 00:18:48.910
I'm sure you're
thinking exactly what I

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.770
was-- my tent mate's blind.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.500
He can sleep on the left.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.900
He's also a lot quicker
and smarter than I am,

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.260
so he got in there and put
his stinky socks and underwear

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.480
all over the right hand side.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.010
So I got the room with the view.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.430
As we climbed into this tent,
the team went down to base camp

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.400
to get more supplies,
5,000 feet below.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.950
And as they went
down, a storm came in

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:16.030
and it pinned us in this
tent together for six days.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.160
Six days at 20,000
feet in the middle

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.495
of a storm in the Himalayas
with a blind climbing partner--

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:22.870
there is really
not a lot you can

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.090
do, except get to
know each other better

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.510
than you really ever wanted to.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.510
So people always ask,
because the middle schooler

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.240
in us really truly never dies--

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.680
you're stuck there.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.050
You're with someone who's blind.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.220
You're eating.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.080
You're drinking.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.630
You sleep.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.150
You have your coffee,
and then you know,

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.460
certain things need to happen.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.230
And that'd be kind of rude.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.410
I don't want to talk
about it, so I'll just

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:54.841
show you a picture of Erik
doing a bombing raid over Nepal.

00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:57.410
That kind of puts an
end to that question.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.870
So, you know, sometimes
you have to get creative,

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.830
innovative to find solutions.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.920
The team came back up,
and it was a week later.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.640
Our supplies were limited.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.230
And we basically had one
shot at making the summit.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.780
We gave it everything
we had, but the mountain

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.890
was coated in this thin layer
of ice and powdery snow,

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.820
and it just wasn't safe.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.340
We're going to
have to turn back.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.370
Incredibly difficult decision,
because we'd gotten sponsors.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.600
We'd spent their money.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.640
We'd traveled halfway
around the world.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.985
People didn't believe in this.

00:20:30.985 --> 00:20:32.360
There were naysayers,
and we were

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.640
going to have to
face those people

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.490
and say we didn't make it.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.000
But I learned a lot about
success in this moment,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.990
in this process.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.560
So often we want
to define success

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.284
as standing on the summit
or planting that flag.

00:20:48.284 --> 00:20:50.700
You know, maybe it's the house
you own, the car you drive,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.400
the job you have,
the title you hold.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.590
Those are fine, but they
don't define success.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.640
In this moment, our
success was defined

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.860
by making the right decision.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.260
This time, it was turning
back, which we needed to do.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.440
It was not letting our pride,
I think most importantly,

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.640
get in the way of making the
right and the best decision.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.650
And so we swallowed our
pride and we turned back.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.660
One person made the
summit that year

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.590
from another team,
a Russian guy.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.190
That Russian guy lost
all 10 of his fingers.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:29.490
But our success was
defined by that decision,

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.720
not letting our pride
cloud that decision.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.010
We communicated, we worked
through it, and we descended.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.430
That was our success.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.120
It was in the descent.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.090
And so we worked our
way down the mountain.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:51.510
And as we did, I got down to
our lower camp at 19,000 feet,

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:55.010
banging down these rocks,
rappelling down these ropes.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.230
Then I had to unclip
from the fixed lines.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.750
A few more steps, I
would be at my tent

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.750
on the edge of a 600 foot cliff.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.900
I took this one last step, and
then the rock under my feet

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.652
flipped over.

00:22:08.652 --> 00:22:10.110
The extra weight
in my pack I think

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.730
is what caused it to turn
like that, and I fell onto it.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.010
And I landed on my chest,
and I grabbed the rock.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.040
And as I did, it started
to slide over the edge.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.865
My feet were dangling in space.

00:22:21.865 --> 00:22:23.240
And I thought, if
I don't let go,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.948
this rock is going to
crush me as I fall.

00:22:24.948 --> 00:22:29.010
So I let go, but my gloved
hands couldn't grab the ledge.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:32.310
And I started to
fall that 600 feet.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.390
I'm often asked, well,
what were you thinking?

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.240
As if you can pause
in mid air you

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.120
know and formulate a
thought, like the coyote

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.104
and the roadrunner cartoons--
it's not like that.

00:22:42.104 --> 00:22:44.520
I was thinking what anyone
would be thinking, and that is,

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.430
do these pants make me look fat?

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.630
No, it's four letter
words, you know the ones--

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:57.506
help, stop, grab, pray.

00:22:57.506 --> 00:23:00.660
Well, maybe one or two
others slipped out.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.651
And then it was a free
fall for a little while.

00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:06.150
Then I hit a rock outcrop, and
I slid, and then another rock

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.120
outcrop, and 150
feet down I landed

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.420
on a ledge the size
of two of these chairs

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.870
on my feet with my eyes closed.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.510
I thought I would open
them and see angels,

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.450
but instead I saw my
teammates looking down waving.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.866
And I waved back, I'm not dead.

00:23:25.866 --> 00:23:27.520
I kind of felt--

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.882
thinking I would feel my femur
sticking out, and I didn't.

00:23:30.882 --> 00:23:33.090
I felt as though I'd landed
right in the hand of God,

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.106
and he said you know what,
it's not your day today.

00:23:36.106 --> 00:23:38.210
I was so thankful.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.610
I was even more thankful
for the rope that came down,

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.010
and my sherpa friend
that came down

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.130
with it to help me back up.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.710
I got into the tent and
I was greeted by my tent

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.510
mate, who was an ER doctor.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.700
A throwback to the '60s--

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.770
he said when I saw you
fall, all I could say

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.670
was whoa, man, stop.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.860
My other teammate, this kind
of rough dude from Alaska,

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.780
he said dude, I thought
you were a goner.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.386
Then he headed off to his tent.

00:24:06.386 --> 00:24:09.600
Well, what about a hug?

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.850
My third teammate said, I
just started praying for you.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.390
I felt as though his
prayers were answered.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.970
But that night, my lungs
filled up with fluid.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.560
My body was in shock
and I was getting

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.230
high-altitude pulmonary edema.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.910
Thankfully, the ER
doc the next day

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.710
helped me down to base camp.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.202
Together we'd make it
there, 5,000 feet below,

00:24:28.202 --> 00:24:29.910
and I was finally put
in this thing here.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.420
It could save my life.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.590
In fact, it was a professor
here at CU that invented it.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.900
It's called the
Gamow bag, and it

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.350
could save my life if my
teammates knew how to use it.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.560
You can see he's reading the
instruction manual behind me

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.000
on just how this
might save my life.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.660
I was so thankful
while I was in there

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.890
that I had people around me
that could help, that cared.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.590
And at the same time, I
felt like the biggest loser

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.190
on the planet.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.864
I shouldn't be the guy falling.

00:24:59.864 --> 00:25:01.780
You can understand if
it's someone who's blind

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.180
who couldn't see that
rock, or you know, maybe

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.607
I misled him and said step
left, I mean right, ah.

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:09.190
But it was me.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.100
I'm supposed to be reliable
and strong for my friend,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.080
and this is it.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.000
I'm not going to
Everest next year.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.640
It's all over-- kind
of hitting the bottom.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.630
The next day I was flown out.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.750
A little hole opened
up in the storm.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.330
A helicopter was able to land.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.880
It was a Nepalese pilot
that risked his life

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.510
for mine, a complete stranger.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.330
Talk about having the
courage to serve--

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.090
there was a guy
fulfilling the duties

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.530
that he wanted to when
he took his job, when

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.755
he took his position to
fly these helicopters.

00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:50.380
It didn't require that he would
fly up in the midst of a storm,

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.580
but he did.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.770
He risked his life for mine.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.790
I went home and I
thought about this.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.530
I contemplated it,
and I spent time

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.340
with this guy here, my best
friend, my climbing partner.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.062
We'd scale the rocks.

00:26:05.062 --> 00:26:06.520
Sometimes we'd even
get to a climb,

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.190
and we'd just be so engrossed in
a conversation we'd never even

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.910
get to climbing.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.940
Before we knew it, it's
time, oh, we got to go--

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.060
just that kind of guy.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.970
Joseph is a friend who
believed in me more

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.980
than I believed in myself.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.650
He's the kind of friend that
I would wish everybody here

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.750
at some point in
their life would have.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:29.920
Even better yet, a spouse like
that who believes in you more

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.660
than you believe in yourself--

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.670
an encourager.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.750
When I told him I had my
doubts about climbing,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.458
he said this is the
chance of a lifetime.

00:26:37.458 --> 00:26:38.690
You've got to go back.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:39.190
I'll go.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.620
I'll carry your bags
if I can go, but don't

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.420
let this one pass you by.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.370
I took that to heart,
because I was really

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.920
wrestling with fear and doubt.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.930
That's what was keeping me
from wanting to ascend again.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.240
I had hit rock bottom.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.450
My pulmonary edema had turned
into a viral pneumonia.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.040
It got infected
and I wasn't really

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.910
able to train for Everest,
and there's no way.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.360
Well, then my friend went
missing in the East Vail

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.230
Chutes--

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.530
steep terrain outside
the area boundary.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.720
He decided on this day
that he could do it alone.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.470
He got overconfident.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.590
One thing about the back
country is you never go alone.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.710
You always have someone
there to watch your back.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:28.030
He descended this steep chute,
came around a blind corner,

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.250
didn't see the cliff
that was there,

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.864
went over it, and 40 feet
below landed upside down.

00:27:34.864 --> 00:27:36.280
It was the next
morning that I was

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.220
out with my friends on the
ski patrol looking for him,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.250
hoping to find him in a snow
cave or something with just

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.990
a broken leg.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.070
I'll never forget peering down
over the edge of that cliff

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.940
and seeing his snowboard
staring back up at me.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.256
We went down and
we dug him out and.

00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:56.590
And it was just way too late.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.180
He had suffocated.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.570
He was frozen and he was dead.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.310
Now it was two months before
the climb of a lifetime,

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.030
and I full of grief
and missing my friend.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:11.320
And I went to his memorial
and his funeral back

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.320
in Pennsylvania,
where he grew up.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.910
And I stood beside his casket.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:19.330
And next to it I saw his
yearbook, and in that yearbook

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.470
was a picture of him.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.820
And the question was, what are
you going to do with your life

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.920
after you graduate?

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.170
And the other students
on that same page

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.869
had answers that we all
would recognize, you know,

00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:33.160
I'm going to go to this school.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.280
I'm going to get this job.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.980
I'm going to spend
my summer doing this.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.230
And then there's Joseph.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.114
This was his response--

00:28:40.114 --> 00:28:41.530
"My plans are to
make a difference

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.910
in the world around me."

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:49.900
Not many high school kids
have that perspective.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.340
I thought about that.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.620
That's exactly who he was.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.170
That's how he was
living his life,

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.210
and that's what I want to do.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:01.420
I might honor my friend and at
least explore this opportunity,

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.000
so I'm going to do that.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.400
And as a Christian,
I'm a person of prayer,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.460
so I prayed through it.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.510
And I was kind of letting
fear control that.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.380
And so I prayed
that way, like yeah,

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.460
let's just slam
these doors shut.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.279
Let's do that.

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:16.320
That's the way I want it.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.100
I'm afraid.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.570
I don't want to go
back on that mountain.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.200
So I'm going to see a
pulmonologist in Boulder.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.469
This guy is a specialist.

00:29:23.469 --> 00:29:25.260
He's going to give me
that pink slip, which

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.100
I can show the team.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.260
And so I went and
saw him and he said,

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.850
you know what, if
you're careful,

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.500
I don't see why
you can't go back.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.340
[SIGHS] That's
not what I wanted.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.070
OK, well I'll go ask the
team, because they're not

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.200
going to say yes.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.700
Not one of my teammates said no.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.300
Nuts, we don't have
the money for this.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.610
Just as those words
left my mouth,

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:52.560
we got a $250,000 donation
from the National Federation

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.730
of the Blind.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.940
Of all organizations to
sponsor a climb like this,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.420
it was a blindness organization
that believed in us

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.240
and put their neck on the
line to support this climb.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.380
I got one last chance.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.827
So I asked my friend Erik,
and I said, hey, you're blind.

00:30:08.827 --> 00:30:10.410
You don't want another
gimp taking you

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.100
to the top of the world.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.130
What do you think?

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.250
I'll never forget his response.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.900
He said, being blind,
my whole life people

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.890
have made judgments about me,
what I can and what I can't do.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.350
I'm not about to do
that same thing to you.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.660
You've got to
decide for yourself.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.830
Oh, I realized, yeah,
you'd be a hypocrite

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:34.070
if you'd said anything
else, but I would sure

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.630
wish you would have said no.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:36.750
I'd be OK.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.554
I thought about it for a minute.

00:30:38.554 --> 00:30:40.970
I said, all right, Erik, I
don't know if I'm strong enough

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.540
to get to the top.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.030
But I know I'm strong enough
to help you get there.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.930
And so if you'll
have me back, I want

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.910
to see you stand on
top of the world.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.990
So again, leaning
on my faith, I would

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.340
take these words to
heart, where it says,

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.570
"Be strong and courageous.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.770
Do not be afraid.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.930
Do not be discouraged."

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:01.980
So I took that.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.240
"Be strong and courageous,"
sure, for my own sake,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.550
but for his sake too.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.080
Maybe it's just base camp.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.300
I'll get there, and
then I'll break it down.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.640
Camp one, we'll get there.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.730
Well, when word got out that
we were going to Everest,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.830
that a blind man
wanted to summit,

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.740
we had naysayers, people who
thought, this is impossible.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.720
A blind person doesn't belong.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.920
He's going to die.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.110
They tell me he's going
to take you with him.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.151
Our response is, well,
that's great, Mom and Dad,

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:29.580
but really, we
have what it takes.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.850
And it was people close to us
that were concerned, of course,

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.950
but it was the elite
Himalayan veterans,

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.890
names that if I was to
tell you, you'd recognize.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:42.600
And what we'd learned was
that these guys are experts,

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.632
but we're the
experts on ourselves.

00:31:44.632 --> 00:31:46.590
They have not climbed
with someone who's blind.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.270
They don't know
what an athlete you

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.700
are, what experience you
have, what you're capable of.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.394
We can make this ascent,
so let's take that step.

00:31:56.394 --> 00:31:58.060
And there we are,
back in the Himalayas,

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.947
making this 30-mile
trek to base camp,

00:32:00.947 --> 00:32:02.530
climbing right in
front of Ama Dablam,

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:05.740
the mountain I had fallen
off the year before.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:10.900
Along the way, we would have two
other blind trekkers with us.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.000
So we had Erik, who's
climbing, and then

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.601
what we called our alternates
in case he fell on a crevasse.

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.100
They didn't think
that was so funny,

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.710
but they called themselves the
three blind mice as we'd go up.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.730
And so the sherpas,
they're part of our team.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.970
Our success really depends
on them, and especially

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.610
their belief that
this can happen.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.390
And so as we're
trekking in, they said,

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:33.790
those guys are blind.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:34.730
They're off the trail.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:35.688
They're needing breaks.

00:32:35.688 --> 00:32:37.360
They're not so good
with the tools.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.860
But that guy, he's fast.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.860
It's almost like he can see.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.110
And so they thought we were
up to something, you know,

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.550
this is a hoax.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.080
And so they're
going to prove it.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.830
And so they'd come up to Erik
as we're going down the trail.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.512
And this was for days on
end, and just kind of whew,

00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:54.220
you know, he's going
to flinch this time.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.350
I'm going to get him.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.350
We're going to show him.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.290
They'd set up like
these little tricks.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:01.420
Erik, man, our
team is splitting.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.900
You've got to tell them your
story, something, because this

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.620
isn't going to fly.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.060
So we'd get up high, and one
of our dining tents-- you know,

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.220
it's below freezing.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.750
Breath is rising.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.070
Sunburned faces,
puffy coats are out.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.320
There's a candle on the table.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.736
The wind is blowing-- you know,
something kind of like out

00:33:19.736 --> 00:33:20.830
of an Indiana Jones movie.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.410
It's this surreal moment.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.900
And the lead sherpas come in.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.860
This is it.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.560
The tissues are there for
when the tears start flowing.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.880
Tell your story, Erik.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.330
And instead of saying a
word, he comes into the tent

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.610
and he just goes
[PLUCKING SOUNDS],,

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:42.460
pulls out his prosthetic eyes,
and looks around the room,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.440
and puts them back in.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.670
My team's response was
just like the sherpas, uh--

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.520
please do not do that again.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.490
We believe you.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.270
That next morning, they were
at his tent first, you know,

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.000
let me help you.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.666
Here's your tea.

00:33:56.666 --> 00:33:57.820
Some extra sugar?

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.800
Let me take your backpack.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.230
Sometimes, it takes a little
bit of innovation, and again,

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:07.640
a dramatic moment to get people
on board and on the same page.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.949
And that's what happened.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:09.659
So there we are.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:10.870
Now we're a cohesive team.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.000
We're ready to set
off on the climb.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.170
We've made it to base
camp, 18,000 feet.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.804
The climb truly
begins in earnest

00:34:18.804 --> 00:34:20.679
here as you go up through
the Khumbu Icefall,

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:24.130
this river of ice flowing
down from Nuptse, Lhotse,

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:26.590
and Everest.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.889
Hundreds of meters deep,
crumbling, moving--

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:33.489
many people have lost
their lives here.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.170
The avalanche most
recently, I think

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.420
it was 18 people
that were killed,

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.280
and then the year
before, 15 sherpas

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.260
were killed when ice
came down on them.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.760
It's not a place
you want to linger,

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.884
that you want to move slow.

00:34:43.884 --> 00:34:45.199
You've got to be quick.

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:49.120
Our first time through that
icefall took us 13 hours.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.560
I thought, the
climb is not going

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.726
to happen if we can't get
through here more quickly.

00:34:52.726 --> 00:34:54.489
We're too exposed.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.190
As time went on,
our time came down,

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.580
and we were able to
eventually cut that in half.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.960
Well, what I did see as we
began our ascent was not just

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.610
the courage to plan, to
prepare, but the courage

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:14.532
to ascend, to put our feet to
the ground and make it happen.

00:35:14.532 --> 00:35:16.240
You'll see that in
this little video clip

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.440
that I have of Erik stepping
on this first ladder crossing.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.500
It had never been done
before, first blind person

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.150
to summit Everest.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.830
So what do you do
about the ladders?

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.370
You can't see, and they're
not perfectly level.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.850
They're not OSHA approved.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.680
They lay on their side.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.597
They're missing rungs.

00:35:33.597 --> 00:35:34.138
They're bent.

00:35:34.138 --> 00:35:34.810
They're damaged.

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:37.400
They bounce.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.420
Courage, it's defined
as facing danger

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.014
with confidence and control.

00:35:43.014 --> 00:35:44.680
I think a better
definition is that it's

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.440
the mental and moral
strength which propels us

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:52.060
in the presence of fear, because
the fear doesn't go away.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.090
Hopefully it can just sit in the
back seat as you move forward.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.454
So put yourself in these shoes.

00:35:58.454 --> 00:35:59.448
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:59.448 --> 00:36:02.430
[PANTING]

00:36:35.729 --> 00:36:37.230
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.450
ERIC ALEXANDER: That's courage.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.770
And it's not just one time.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.300
It's continual.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.270
But thankfully, there's a team,
because not at every moment

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.255
are you that person
who's leading the charge,

00:36:47.255 --> 00:36:49.380
or who's full of courage
and ready to be the leader

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.710
and rise up.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.260
We need each other.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.540
We need a team.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.440
We need that trust.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.470
And what is that trust made of?

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.800
As I see it, I've broken it
down into these components.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.680
Trust is reliance.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.180
You have trust
because you've proven

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.400
yourself reliable over time.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:15.660
It's competence, that
you've shown and proven

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.780
that you belong because you
have the skills required.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.030
On this mountain, there
are so many people

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.959
who are really incompetent, who
don't have the experience, who

00:37:23.959 --> 00:37:24.750
don't belong there.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:29.310
They rely completely on the
experience of someone else,

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.670
most likely their guide.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.030
It's commitment, that you're
committed to each other.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.700
Again, you show that over time.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.770
You prove yourself.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.740
And then lastly, that
leads to confidence.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.200
Having those things give you
confidence in each other.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.810
With all of that,
you then have trust.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.970
This team had trust
like no other,

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.594
like no other on the mountain.

00:37:49.594 --> 00:37:51.010
In fact, at first
when we arrived,

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.820
people said avoid those guys.

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.340
They're going to be a problem.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.430
But by the end, people
were rallying around us

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.040
because we had proven ourselves
to be so trustworthy and so

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.250
competent on the mountain that
they wanted to be a part of it,

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:07.000
and that we could support
each other, collaborate.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.730
And that's what team spirit is.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:12.000
Team spirit transcends
teamwork, because it

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.340
maximizes the
individual's strengths

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.750
towards a common goal.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.340
It's collaborative and
it's focused on others.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.679
That's what made our team
so different from any other,

00:38:22.679 --> 00:38:24.720
because we had this blind
person who they thought

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.960
was a weak link, who was
actually the glue that held us

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.660
together in an unlikely way.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.980
I like this saying, where it
says, "Two are better than one,

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.140
because they have a good
return for their work.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.450
If one falls down, his
friend can pick him up,

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:43.910
but pity the man who falls and
has no one to help him up."

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:44.910
You think, that's great.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.570
You're always picking Erik
up because he's blind.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:47.653
He's tripping and falling.

00:38:47.653 --> 00:38:49.500
But it was actually
my blind friend

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.690
who picked me up,
who believed in me

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:56.510
and saw the possibilities for
me as much as I did for him.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.380
An unlikely pair,
but with that pair,

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.830
we made a good team because
we were there for each other.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.690
He was there for me when he
said yeah, come back and climb.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.981
He was also there for me when
it's 4:00 in the morning.

00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:10.850
It's dark, windy,
below zero outside,

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:12.680
and I hear his
crampons on the ice.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.000
He's ready to go.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
I'm still in my sleeping bag
trying to get every second I

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.780
can out of the warmth
that's in there,

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.860
and I realize he needs me.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.930
He can't climb without me.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:25.590
It's time to move on.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:26.615
He's picked me up.

00:39:26.615 --> 00:39:28.960
We're ready for the ascent.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.200
And so we continue to
climb from the icefall.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.860
Now it's on to the Lhotse Face--

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:41.750
this 3,000 foot wall of ice,
45 to 70 degrees in steepness,

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:44.630
ice falling, rocks
tumbling down, cascading.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.990
We'd set up camp here at
24,000 feet before we'd

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.510
turn the corner and go
over the yellow band.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:52.250
And then the Geneva Spur.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:55.700
Finally, ending at
26,000 feet, a place

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.730
called the Death Zone, where
you can't survive long,

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.420
even with supplemental oxygen.
It takes a whole team just

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.670
to set up the camp.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:08.250
As the wind is blowing
30 to 50 miles an hour,

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.790
the temperature is
consistently below zero.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.360
One guy holds the tent while
one sticks the poles up through,

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.970
throwing the gear in
and then tying it down.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.220
At this point, you
know that this is it.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:25.440
This is where the climb
really will happen.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.290
We still have what it takes.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.720
The team, we start to look
at each other with kind

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.807
of like this laser
beam like vision.

00:40:32.807 --> 00:40:34.640
You can almost see right
through each other.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.830
Can I still trust you now?

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:40.250
Because this is where
it really matters.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.530
Just steps away
from our tent, we

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:46.820
see the body of a sherpa
who died years before,

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.010
but he's still there frozen
to the ground, perfectly

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:52.944
preserved-- a guy who died
with all of his senses,

00:40:52.944 --> 00:40:54.860
and we're still trying
to bring a guy up who's

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.630
missing a critical one of his.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:02.050
Well, the team decides
to continue on.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.170
9:00 at night, without
really saying a word,

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:10.140
we form a single file line
and we continue the ascent.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.890
Just the night before,
an Austrian climber

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:14.590
had fallen to his death
when an old rope snapped.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:19.150
A Russian climber fell to
his death on the north side.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:23.760
Fear and doubt again
have us in its grip.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.250
But with that team spirit,
with the kind of trust we have,

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.961
feeling good enough, we
take those steps forward.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:37.526
A couple hours in, our
team leader turns back--

00:41:37.526 --> 00:41:39.150
a guy who had submitted
Everest before,

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.790
one of the strongest
climbers on our team.

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:42.570
He's coming down.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:43.470
He gets to me.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.420
He lifts his
goggles and he's got

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.470
a tear running down his cheek.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.890
And he says, I've
got nothing left.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.990
My feet are frozen.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.542
I've got to go back.

00:41:54.542 --> 00:41:56.250
I thought for sure
he's going to just say

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.360
and we're all going back.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.990
If I don't have it, chances
are you don't either.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.892
We're going back.

00:42:02.892 --> 00:42:05.100
But in that moment, I learned
a lot about leadership,

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.730
because this guy had the
original vision along with Erik

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:10.540
to make this climb happen.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.740
And I that's what leadership
is, is it's visionary.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.300
And it believes in that vision.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.559
It takes action upon it.

00:42:18.559 --> 00:42:20.100
And then most
importantly, it's built

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.080
on a platform of character.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.380
He didn't let his pride
get in the way once again.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.724
And his character said, you
guys have what it takes.

00:42:28.724 --> 00:42:31.140
I'm not going to push so hard
that I get myself in trouble

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.360
and bring you down with me.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.570
I'm going to pass the baton
and say you guys go for it.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.060
That's what good
leadership does.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.575
So we continued on
into the darkness

00:42:40.575 --> 00:42:42.180
where at one point
in a white out,

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.490
I couldn't see my hand
in front of my face.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:48.180
The guy behind me said, I
haven't seen mine in 20 years.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.260
Keep going.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.165
All right.

00:42:51.165 --> 00:42:53.400
And so we keep moving forward.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.890
The white out gives
way to the stars.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:58.194
The stars soon give
way to the sunrise.

00:42:58.194 --> 00:42:59.610
And though we can't
feel the heat,

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.760
we feel that warmth of hope,
that this might just happen.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:08.610
What people said was impossible
we're going to pull off.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:11.070
We get to the Hillary Step.

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.400
And Erik reaches out
and grabs one old rope.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.350
I see that this is where a
guy died the night before.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:19.470
And I yell at Erik,
don't grab one.

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:21.431
Grab all those old ropes.

00:43:21.431 --> 00:43:21.930
He does.

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:25.500
He gives it a yank and a kick,
and like that, again traveling

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.240
in threes, we get up
over the Hillary Step,

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.710
and a few more
steps to the summit.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:37.921
Perseverance, the last in my
list of requirements to ascend.

00:43:37.921 --> 00:43:39.420
That's having a
passion for what you

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.980
do, a faith in its purpose,
a willingness to take a risk,

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.540
and then the mental
stamina to persist in it.

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:51.990
With that, you can persevere
and stand on top of the world.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.280
We spent about 15
minutes up there.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.280
This team that was supposed
to go down in flames

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.080
set five world records.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.410
As the sherpas called him, the
blindest man in the world, Erik

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.670
stood on top.

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:04.770
Sherman Bull was
on our team, 64.

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.930
At that time, he
became the oldest man.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:08.299
It was his fifth attempt.

00:44:08.299 --> 00:44:10.840
He said, I didn't plan to be
the oldest man to climb Everest.

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.780
I just got old trying.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.980
His son, Brad Bull, who
lives here in Colorado,

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.450
was part of our team.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:19.080
So they joined and they became
the first American father

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.310
and son.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:22.980
At the time, we also
had the largest camera

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.910
to stand on the summit,
a 25-pound HD camera.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.970
But the one I'm most proud of is
that we were the largest team.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.911
19 of us stood on top.

00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:34.410
The reason that is
is because we all

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:39.180
had that common belief
and that glue of Erik

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.320
uniting us to get to the top.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.920
Erik made the cover of "Time"
magazine a couple weeks later.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.760
And I'm not at all
bitter or jealous

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.010
that I'm standing right there.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.850
You can see a rope
tied to his waist.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:59.640
Well, in this picture,
that rope goes to me.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.540
But that's not why I
signed on, you know,

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.280
it's just celebrating
that success with him.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.950
An invitation in New Zealand to
stop by the home of Sir Edmund

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:08.760
Hillary--

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.560
we got to spend
the day with him.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.359
We talked about five
minutes of climbing,

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:15.900
and the rest of the time it was
about philanthropy and giving

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.277
back, and what's next,
and what are you doing?

00:45:18.277 --> 00:45:19.110
How are the schools?

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:20.640
How are the hospitals?

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.940
Great to be with one
friend and two heroes.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.680
Also, an invitation
to the Oval Office

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.620
to meet former President Bush.

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.420
So to be here this
afternoon to talk to you,

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.750
it's to encourage
you, to challenge

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:39.430
you and myself to
ascend, to not give up

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:42.790
on those dreams and the
possibilities that you see,

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.400
or maybe those friends
that believe in you more

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.790
than you believe in yourself,
that they see for your life.

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:52.890
To apply these principles
and to challenge yourself

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.790
to take that next step towards
that summit, whether it's

00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:00.060
a mountain, a physical
summit, or whether it's

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.670
right here in this building.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.300
So thanks for your time today.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.830
I want to wish you all the best.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.007
Thanks for your time.

00:46:08.007 --> 00:46:14.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:14.475 --> 00:46:17.682
SPEAKER 1: So the first question
is from Dave [? Minago. ?]

00:46:17.682 --> 00:46:18.390
I don't know if--

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.490
Dave, are you here by chance?

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.010
OK, I'll go ahead and
ask it for him then.

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:25.020
I understand the cost
of this expedition

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:28.210
can cost tens of
thousands of dollars.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:33.210
How would you recommend folks
trying to climb something

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.230
like this in the future begin
to finance this expedition?

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:37.380
Sponsorship, or--

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.550
ERIC ALEXANDER: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:39.966
Sponsorship gets
harder and harder

00:46:39.966 --> 00:46:43.520
to find as the climb
has become so popular.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.030
A lot of people
do it, and so what

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:46.624
makes you different or unique?

00:46:46.624 --> 00:46:48.290
So if you're going
that route and you're

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:50.430
going to find sponsors,
I think to finance

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:54.180
this you kind of really
have to have something that

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.340
sets your climb apart
and unique, whether it's

00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.540
a new route or something
that's not been done before,

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.790
in a winter without oxygen--

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:05.550
you know, you've got to kind of
push the boundaries if you're

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.100
going to get a sponsor.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:15.800
Otherwise, work hard, raise
the money, sell your car.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.250
Yeah, go up the north side.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.210
It's a little less expensive.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.870
You can figure out ways.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.630
Get the skills required.

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:23.980
You don't need to pay guides.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.680
Try to get a private expedition.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.030
Just hire some sherpas.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.771
Keep your team to the minimum.

00:47:29.771 --> 00:47:30.270
Yeah.

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:32.910
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:34.830
What are your thoughts
on the long standing

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:38.535
question of commercialization
of the seven summits,

00:47:38.535 --> 00:47:40.559
and should people
have to qualify

00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:42.600
to climb those mountains,
almost like a marathon,

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.820
or should the mountains
always be open to everybody

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.186
who wants to try them?

00:47:46.186 --> 00:47:48.060
ERIC ALEXANDER: That's
a tough one to answer.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.240
To me, the mountains
really represent freedom.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:55.440
And I think people should be
free to go and to attempt it

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:59.460
and to try it, but there
are those prerequisites.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.530
And some people lack
the judgment to say,

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.410
I don't have those skills yet.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.740
I don't own it.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:10.920
And on Everest, for example, you
have to send in an application,

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.119
but it comes with a check.

00:48:12.119 --> 00:48:14.160
And I think all they really
do is take the check,

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.652
toss the application, and
yeah, you're good to go.

00:48:17.652 --> 00:48:19.860
You've driven Mount Evans,
that's good enough for us.

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:23.300
You're ready.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.810
So the commercialization,
it's great for the guides.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:29.700
They get to make a living
doing what they do.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.110
They get to use their expertise.

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.600
They get to kind
of shepherd people,

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.920
protect them, keep them safe.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.710
But I think there's
limits to that.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:43.600
And some people get greedy
and push those limits.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.370
So it's a mix.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:46.920
I'm mixed on it.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.020
I don't have the
answer or the solution.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.490
SPEAKER 1: Fair enough.

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:52.504
We'll take a live question.

00:48:52.504 --> 00:48:54.420
Somebody will-- and just
go ahead and speak it

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.974
as loudly as you can.

00:48:55.974 --> 00:48:57.390
AUDIENCE: And sorry
I missed this,

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:00.150
but I was curious how exactly
you involved in the beginning

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:04.020
with helping people either hike
or climb with disabilities?

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.090
ERIC ALEXANDER: I live
up in the Vail area,

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.040
and I grew up
skiing Winter Park.

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.140
And so I saw people
with disabilities skiing

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.910
all the time, you
know, with one leg

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:14.520
cranking through the
moguls, and blind skiers,

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.240
and I was always
inspired by that.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.950
And so after college when
I went up to live in Vail,

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:22.800
I got involved and started
volunteering in the blind ski

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.780
program.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.380
And I enjoyed it.

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.630
And I guess I've
always just gravitated

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.450
to those people with
physical challenges.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:34.590
And so they tend to
just cross my path.

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.850
In terms of Erik, I was
living with a friend who

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:41.280
was in a wheelchair,
and he invited Erik

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.947
over after skiing
together at a conference,

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.030
and that's how I met Erik.

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:48.180
He crashed on our couch,
started talking about climbing,

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.690
and then one thing
led to another,

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:52.800
and were on Mount Everest.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.610
SPEAKER 1: Just like that.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.445
Any other questions
from the audience?

00:49:57.445 --> 00:49:59.540
Otherwise I have a
few more in here,

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.130
and then we'll wrap it up.

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:05.010
As a non-disabled climber,
what was your biggest challenge

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:09.420
to overcome summiting Everest
and the other tallest peaks,

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.640
and then for a climber
with disabilities,

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.830
what did you witness being
their biggest challenge?

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:16.830
ERIC ALEXANDER: My biggest
challenge, especially

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:20.790
on this peak, was
fear and doubt,

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:25.830
and figuring out that path,
navigating fear and doubt,

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.870
and not letting it overwhelm me.

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:32.890
And I think that was a big one.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:36.180
And really what helped is
having a team, a supportive team

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.630
around me to overcome that.

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:39.090
And then like I
said earlier, too,

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:41.410
is having the courage
to serve someone else.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:43.360
And when you put your
focus on somebody else,

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.360
you see their problems
that you're helping with,

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.950
and you forget yours.

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:50.130
And so I saw that ladder
as an example of this.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:52.530
You know, my first step
was like shaky knees,

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:54.810
Elvis leg, you know, I
don't want to do this.

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:55.960
I don't trust it.

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.340
But then I see Erik just kind
of coming right up behind me.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.550
Next thing you know, I'm
walking across backwards

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:03.090
because I'm focused on him.

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:05.800
So that's the way that goes.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.740
So that was my challenge,
was fear and doubt.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:11.580
The physical part
wasn't so hard.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.877
For people with
disabilities, I think

00:51:13.877 --> 00:51:15.710
I can relate to them,
because a lot of times

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:16.570
it's the same thing.

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:17.970
It's the unknown.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:21.800
And so that tends to
bring out fear in us.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.470
Their fear I think
is best overcome

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:29.060
by developing that trust and
that relationship over time.

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:33.020
Otherwise, sometimes it is
just flat out the physical.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.520
Yep, that same buddy
that used to be

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.270
my roommate in a wheelchair, he
climbed Kilimanjaro on a hand

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:41.060
cycle with arms like this.

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.920
His arms are bigger
than my legs,

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.290
such a stud, just hand cycling.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:47.240
So what's the challenge there?

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.800
Well, it is the physical.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.770
How do we get your wheelchair
up this narrow trail

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:55.130
with lava rock and all
this, but there's a way.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.878
You've just got to be smarter.

00:51:57.878 --> 00:51:59.830
SPEAKER 1: Awesome,
unbelievable.

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:01.411
Did you have one quick one?

00:52:01.411 --> 00:52:01.910
Go for it.

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.540
AUDIENCE: Hopefully quick,
and future aspirations

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:05.806
by yourself or with Erik?

00:52:05.806 --> 00:52:07.430
ERIC ALEXANDER: Any
future aspirations?

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:08.442
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:08.442 --> 00:52:10.525
ERIC ALEXANDER: Uh, are
you going to tell my wife?

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.420
He just had a hip
replacement in July

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.550
and we went out and did
a 10-mile hike last week.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:22.740
So he's on the road to recovery.

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.880
We want to go back
to Ama Dablam.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.020
Yeah, so that might
happen in the fall.

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:30.932
Not this fall, we're a
year out so he can recover.

00:52:30.932 --> 00:52:32.390
And then he just
said, let's go ski

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:35.190
across the ice
sheet in Greenland,

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.670
which is a 30 day polar trek.

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:38.730
So there's that, and--

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:39.340
SPEAKER 1: Unbelievable.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.881
ERIC ALEXANDER:
--it's a never ending

00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:42.195
like, what else can we do?

00:52:42.195 --> 00:52:45.129
So yeah, there's
plenty of things.

00:52:45.129 --> 00:52:45.920
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.378
ERIC ALEXANDER: Actually, I
want to go to the Rubicon Trail

00:52:48.378 --> 00:52:51.170
with my blind friend
Scotty, the Iraq veteran,

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:52.385
and let him drive.

00:52:52.385 --> 00:52:55.480
It's a four wheel
drive Jeep thing,

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.204
but it's so slow I
think he could do it.

00:52:57.204 --> 00:52:59.370
SPEAKER 1: You should call
the high school student--

00:52:59.370 --> 00:52:59.930
ERIC ALEXANDER: I should.

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:00.400
SPEAKER 1: --that
was interested.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.358
ERIC ALEXANDER: I should,
I thought about that.

00:53:02.358 --> 00:53:03.177
Yeah, call the kid.

00:53:03.177 --> 00:53:04.760
SPEAKER 1: There you
go, there you go.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.080
Well, thank you for
sharing your story with us.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.940
Thank you guys for coming.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:09.690
Round of applause.

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:11.023
ERIC ALEXANDER: Yeah, thank you.

00:53:11.023 --> 00:53:13.940
[APPLAUSE]
