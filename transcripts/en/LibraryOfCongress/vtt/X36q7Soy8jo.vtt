00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.840
&gt;&gt; So, welcome to the
Audio Media Preservation

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.460
through Imaging Conference.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.270
This is the first meeting of
this particular group of people.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.480
This is a very new technology.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.700
We're really excited that all
of you have been able to come.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.300
And we hope that we continue this
dialogue even past this conference,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.830
so we have some opening
remarks from Mark Sweeney.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.610
And, are you ready to --

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.910
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.570
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Peter, and
good morning to you all.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.210
I'm Mark Sweeney, the associate
librarian for library services

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.550
and on behalf of the Librarian of
Congress, Dr. James Billington.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.120
It's my pleasure to welcome
you today to the library

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.860
and to this three day
conference on Audio --

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.670
Audio Media Preservation
through Imaging Technology.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.910
As Peter says, this is just -- just
an excellent opportunity for us

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.920
to share our knowledge
and experience and sort

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.380
of chart a path for the future.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.090
And you're having wonderful weather
today here in Washington and --

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.370
and for those that had an
opportunity to go out to Culpeper,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.280
I think something really
special yesterday.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.050
So, audio recording has
existed for over 150 years.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.740
The development from the
phonautograph to tin foil

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.710
to the myriad of today's, you know,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.040
modern high fidelity
digital recordings.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.620
You know, it's -- it's -- it's
all amazing and astounding.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.410
And over a comparatively short
period of time, about 15 years,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.090
many of those in attendance
here have developed, introduced,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.920
refined the imaging
technology to capture audio

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.700 position:56%
from physical audio carriers for the
purpose of preserving information

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.710
from these valuable artifacts.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.310
The collaboration that has
surrounded the development

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.380
of these specialized imaging tools
has been open and a collegial one.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.080
And there have been
substantial contributions

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.380
from the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory, the University

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.890
of Applied Sciences in
Fribourg, Switzerland.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.360
The University of Southampton
in England, the University

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.660
of California, Berkeley,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.720
the Northeast Document
Conservation Center, First Sounds,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.780
the National Museum
of American History,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.720
the Thomas Edison National
Historical Site,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.620
the Roja Muthiah Research
Library in Chennai, India,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.200
University of Chicago and of
course, as well as the Library

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.740
of Congress that you're here today.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.510
The research has received major
funding from a number of sources,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.800 position:56%
the Institute for Museum and Library
Services, The National Endowment

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.090
for the Humanities, the Library
of Congress, as well as support

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.340
from the University of California,
the Department of Energy,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.830
the Smithsonian Institution, the
Schenectady Museum of Innovation

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.730
and Science, the National Archives

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.960
and Records Administration,
Harvard University.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.530
The Council on Library
and Information Resources,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.050
the Mellon Foundation,
Guggenheim Foundation,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.370
the MacArthur Foundation.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.010
So we have many supporters that
have been helping us along the way.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.580
As is true with any
technological development,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.480
there are successes
in and challenges.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.160
Utilizing imaging technology

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.450
on audio media has already
given us access to recordings

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.880
that were broken into pieces,
in too fragile of a state

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.130
to be touched physically and in --

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.240
or early experimental
formats for which, you know,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.410
we have no playback equipment.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.370 position:56%
So only a relatively short time ago,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.970
these recordings were
considered lost to history,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.170
but now they're accessible again.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.400
But there are also issues
that have yet to be solved.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.160
I would put high on the list,
maturation of this technology

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.580 position:56%
to meet our specific needs at scale.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.590 position:56%
This gathering of collection holders

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.330
and instrument builders can
help define the priorities

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.680
for new tools to meet our needs.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.200
By balancing the most pressing
needs of our collections

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.770
with the capabilities
of the technology today,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.130
while also planning for the future,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.360
those gathered here can help shape
the development and the roadmap

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.490
for these imaging media
systems of tomorrow.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.570
There are so many sound
recordings in need of preservation.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.750 position:56%
Setting the proper priorities for
development is the first imperative.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.420
We believe this technology
has diverse uses

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.700
as a noninvasive format
migration tool for media

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.140
in a wide range of
physical conditions.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.730
It also serves as an
assessment and measurement tool

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.410 position:56%
to set standards for media playback.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.730
These are core requirements
for preservation.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.770
A future roadmap will
allow others in the field

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.720 position:56%
to consider how this technology fits

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.740
into their preservation
strategies and to plan accordingly.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.980 position:56%
As the technology gains capabilities

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.230
and preservation specialists
accumulate real world experience

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.260
with these tools, the
position of the acceptance

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.870
of the technology will
broaden -- should broaden.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.550 position:56%
By working cooperatively, this group

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.950
of mavericks has made
considerable progress

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.990
over the relatively short period
of time, ensuring the application

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.210
of new technology from a very
-- for a very specific purpose.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.750
As future challenges are met
and solutions are proposed,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.500
the collegial nature of
this group should see it

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.970
through the most difficult
future issues.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.360
Since preservation serves not
only living scholars and patrons,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.700
but also future generations, the
generosity of this group shows

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.570
that it's -- that it's
deep knowledge

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.610
to solve longstanding
problems inherent

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.870
with this valuable historical
record is recognized.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.260
So I thank you for your dedication.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.820
I'd like to conclude by
also thanking the members

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.690
of our conference organizing team.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.290
That would be Peter [inaudible],
Gene DeAnna, Carl Haber,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.570
Audria Henley, Steven
Legitt and Angela Newburn.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.400
Thank you for your hard work,
please enjoy the conference

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.270
and I look forward to
sitting in and learning more.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.070
So, thank you.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.500
[ Applause ]

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.960
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.260
I'm Gene DeAnna.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.400
I'm head of the recorded sound
section here at the library.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.510
And I want to welcome all of you
that I didn't welcome yesterday

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.180
at the tour of the Packard Campus.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.260
This is a great, exciting
meeting, it's wonderful

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.110
to see you all here today.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.510
We had a really, I
think interesting tour.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.320
We had great discussions
yesterday --

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.020
or beginning discussions
with lunch, in the hallways

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.380
between our stops at
the Packard Campus.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.660
And before we get too far along,
I want to make sure to invite all

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.520
of you who weren't able to make
the trip, to please let us know

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.700
and we'll try to make
arrangements to get you

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.190
out there to see the facility.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.310
I'm sure it'll be worth your while.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.330
I want to second Mark's thanks,
particularly Audria Henley

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.120
and my colleague, Steve Legitt who
I'm not sure has made it today.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.140
But Steve is the coordinator
of our National Film Board

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.140
and our National Recording
Preservation Board,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.820
there are several board
members here today.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.170
The support of the
library and Congress

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.060
of these boards has allowed
them to support national efforts

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.230
at preserving film
and sound, you know,

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.940
it helps to make events
like this possible.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:18.200
As an archivist who's been in
the field for over 25 years now,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.180
seeing this gathering
of scientific, technical

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.860
and archival expertise
focused on an exciting

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.950
and still emerging technology

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.620
for capturing sound is
extremely gratifying.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.240
In December of 2012, the library

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.130
and the National Recording
Preservation Board,

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.940
with the assistance of
the Council on Library

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.810
and Information Resources,
published a national plan

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.780
for the preservation
of our recorded legacy.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:51.760 position:56%
That plan distilled over -- over 100
preliminary recommendations gathered

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.740
from an extensive study, multiyear
study and the recommendations

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.530
of an eminent group of expert task
forces, distilled them down to

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.670
about 32 major recommendations.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.730
And since its publication,
that plan has been anything

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.190
but just another report, good ideas
that sits on a shelf somewhere.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:18.760
It's -- it's been a vital document;
it has influenced the direction

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.190
of the work and provided a
national framework for the --

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.730
the focus of audio preservationists
and the institutions

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.650
and organizations that support
their work all across this country

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.010
and actually internationally
as well.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:40.530
So today, we gather here under
the auspices of recommendation 1.7

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.710
of the National Recording
Preservation Plan,

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.640
which says to encourage scientific
and tactical research leading

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.200
to the development of new
technologies to recover, reformat

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.770
and preserve audio recording media.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.240
The development of
imaging technology

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.240
for audio is a terrific story
when you tell people about it,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.090
when they read about it they
respond to it like it's magic.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:10.200
It's -- there is an element
of magic to it, I think.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.010
And -- and from a more
technical standpoint, it's --

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.070
it's just really cool [laughter].

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:21.770
There remains a lot of work to
be done discussing, defining,

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:27.690 position:56%
guiding that work, defining the
framework of how to guide that work.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.750
It's going to be one of the
important goals of this conference.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.530
Now for me as an archive
manager of a two large archive

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:42.760 position:56%
of recorded sound, I see three clear
significant benefits and pathways

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.160 position:56%
to development to audio preservation
that imaging technology offers.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.110
And that does not include
the coolness factor.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.980
The first is obviously
the safe recovery of audio

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.200
from fragile damaged
or broken carriers,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.650
sound that otherwise
might not be recovered.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:07.060
So playback of the unplayable or
probably should not be played.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.930
And that also includes the
safe playback of unclean,

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:17.300
unprepped recordings to enable
us to identify them for purposes

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.290
of assessment and prioritization.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.590
You'd be amazed at the --

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.540
the resources that have to go
into the conservation prep work

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.990
to get recordings that just -- you
just want to hear what they are.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.080 position:56%
To get them ready to put a stylus on
them, that's a commitment of a lot

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.050
of resources and if you
can imagine, those --

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.150
those materials that
demand that kind

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:46.100
of work often get just shunted
aside for practical purposes.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:51.380
Secondly, it's a non-time base
method for making transfers

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.890
of groove media and it can
be carried out in parallel

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.510
and a non-monitored workflow.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.750
So I decided to do a little third
grade math because occasionally I

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.570
like to push beyond my
comfort zone and I calculated

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.930
that [inaudible] holds
about, say a million hours --

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.620
a million hours of unique audio,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.640
that is no dupes, one
of a kind audios.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.100
So clearly if you think about a
million hours of preservation to do

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:28.470
in standard time based capture,
we need to develop other ways

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.180
of doing this that overcome
playback time in the limitations

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.850
of standard reformatting.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:41.160 position:56%
And thirdly, the -- this is a little
harder for us, this is new for me

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.050
to -- to get my head
around this, but it's --

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:49.210
it's the transformational
ability that 3D imaging provides

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.560
for digitally preserving
the carriers themselves,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.230
that is the grooves.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:02.520
To image those grooves, capture
that image for future generations.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:08.070 position:56%
Audio archivists operate justifiably
so under the understanding that all

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.790
of this media is going to degrade
or eventually become unplayable

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.900
for one reason or another,
obsolescence, over time.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:23.240
But imaging is adding
that new paradigm.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.980
The goal of capturing and
preserving the groove structure

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.490
of historical recordings,
historically important recordings,

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.450
the earliest recordings
of humanity is --

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.140
is really now a realistic
consideration for archivists.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.090
And I guess we have to ask
ourselves, what's that worth?

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.720
And what's that going to be
worth down the line in a couple

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.310
of hundred years for people?

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:54.060
So there's -- there's still a lot
of work to do, but one thing I want

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.310 position:56%
to point out, yesterday at the tour,
the group saw what I think is one

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:02.370
of the great success
stories of AV preservation.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.170
Up on the third floor
in the video lab,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.720
there's an array of
five SAMA robots.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.800
They work in parallel.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.660
Their hoppers full of u-matic,
VHS and beta cartridge tapes,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.410
these are video formats
that carry the vast majority

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.880
of recorded television worldwide.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.210
So, 20 some decks digitizing
in parallel in a workflow

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.950
that generates now 25
terabytes of content a week.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.280
Ladies and gentleman, I can
tell you that 10 years ago,

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:40.070
television preservation was
nonexistent, virtually nonexistent.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.760
This content was more at
risk than our nitrate,

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.660
more at risk than our audio tape,

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.930
our lacquer discs and
our wax cylinders.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.650
Now my colleagues in
the moving image section

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.300
and one yesterday while we
-- he talked to the group,

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.520
mentioned the word finishing and
that's the word that doesn't come

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.940
up too often in the
recorded sound section.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:07.540
Finishing preserving television
and you think, well, what happened?

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.570 position:56%
Well, obviously the Packard
Humanities Institute and the Library

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.130
of Congress with congressional
support happened.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:20.720
But really what happened to make
that a reality was good science,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.170
engineering brilliance
and a clear understanding

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.550
of the archival principles
and practices of preservation.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.360
So scientists, engineers
and archivists,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.780
it's exactly the mix we
see in this room today.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.880
So I -- I looked forward to this
conference, I think it's very,

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.960
very important, essential
that we continue

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.940
down the development of imaging.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.310
And I want to welcome you and I
look forward to the discussions.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.940
So now I want to introduce my
colleague, Peter [inaudible],

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.330
who leads the IRENE Project
here at the Library of Congress.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.130
Peter?

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:04.080
[ Applause ]

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.380
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.460
I don't have a lot to say, but I
wanted to give a little perspective

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.980
that I think may not be the
common way we think about this.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.140
There are obviously a lot of issues
involved in this preservation ,

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.820
there's degradation in materials
and there's the time factor

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.080
of getting all these
things preserved.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.890
But this imaging technology
actually does an interesting thing.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.820
When I -- when I came to
the Library of Congress

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.000
as a preservation specialist,
preserving audio recordings,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.500
we went to analog tape,
we preserved things and --

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.800
and actually that's
incorrect to say.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.840
We did not actually
technically preserve things.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.370 position:56%
At that time, preserving something
was making sure the original carrier

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.800
was in good condition.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.350
It was very much from
the book world.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.980
But what I did was --
was reformat materials

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.180
and it wasn't considered
part of preservation.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.940 position:56%
Not so long ago, people realized as
these materials are degrading and --

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.080
and going away and equipment

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.170
to transfer them was becoming
less accessible, that the process

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.480
of reformatting was
actually part of preservation

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.750
because you might lose
the original item.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.750 position:56%
However, that did for the particular
items we're talking about today,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.620 position:56%
that actually does a transformation.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.810
These items are physical items.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.810 position:56%
And when you do a transfer, you
actually convert this physical thing

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.290
into an audio stream and then
you recapture that audio stream.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.800
So the thing that's so
fascinating about the idea

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.440 position:56%
of imaging is we're back to the idea

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.910
of actually preserving
the original item again.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.200
And it gave us a whole host of --

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.270
of possible uses in the future
for these kinds of things.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.810
I thought I'd mention
a couple technologies

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.390
that have been developed
over a period of time,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.070
which aren't actually
in the physical realm,

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.100
but kind of highlight this.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.770
There's a -- there's
a technology called

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.340
from plangents [phonetic]
processes, which uses bios tones,

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.800
which are high frequency
signals on audio tapes,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.380 position:56%
which aren't for listening back, but
for use for alignment of the tape.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.580
To actually re-speed the
tape, you can actually lock

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.990
on to these signals and then --

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:07.940
and then actually get a better
speed for the tape playback.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.390 position:56%
That's an idea where -- where you're
using something that's not normally

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.960
preserved on a tape
for a purpose of --

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.640
of actually preserving
the thing better.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.080
There's also work at the --

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.890
the University of Maryland

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.140
where they're actually
marrying [phonetic] records

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:32.320
of the power grid cycles to
signals on audio recordings

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.520
because there's date stamps on the
actual fluctuation and power grids.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.050
And you can actually then match
these up with audio recordings

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.980
and figure out exactly when
something was recorded.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.280
So, those may seem very
esoteric and people

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.020
who have collection
problems may think, you know,

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.360
I just have trouble
getting through this stuff.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.690
Why -- that's so out in
the, you know, weeds,

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.070
why would we ever think about that?

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.000
But I think if you look at --

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.240
at what's happening when you
start collecting large --

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.680
collecting large data sets, which
essentially what's happening

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.730
when we make digitized
files of these things.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.910
The kinds of research,
the kinds of relationships

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.950
between these data sets that can
happen in the future are things

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.830
that we don't really
envision right now.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:18.460 position:56%
I mean, once -- once audio
completely gets into that realm and,

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.540
as Gene said, finish is not a term
we necessarily talk about a lot,

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.380
but as we get larger and
larger data sets of -- of --

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.910
of audio, some of the
things people will use them

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.760
for will be nonaudio reasons.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.130
They will be data sets that
will be referenced and -- and --

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:39.430
and cross related to
other data sets.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.250
And it's hard for us to imagine
that, but that's what's --

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.340
that's to me what's
really interesting about --

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.820
about imaging, is that there's a
lot of things you lose once you,

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.090 position:56%
in terms of a record or a
cylinder, put a stylus in that thing

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.050
and only get the audio signal back.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.420
There's a lot of conditional
information, there's --

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.100
there's just the -- the -- the
surface of these images have --

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.760
have all sorts of information in
them that we may not be envisioning

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.300
as valuable right now, but
are part of that record.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.160
And that's -- and that's
interesting because, you know,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.840
originally when people
talk about preservation,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.240
they wanted the original to live.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.180
And -- and that's kind
of the same thing again.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.030
So it's funny that we're
kind of going full circle,

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.730
what this technology
is allowing us to do,

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.810
what we originally
would've wanted to do.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.690
Now that doesn't say that
this is the perfect solution,

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:29.190
it's going to cover all, you know,
it just wipes away everything else.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.610
That's not, you know,
the case at this point

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.650
and it may never be the case.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.270
But it -- it's something I
think we need to keep in mind

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.550
as we hear what people are doing,
these projects that people are --

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:47.450
are envisioning now, how saving the
image actually is a change, it's --

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.170
I really is a change
in preservation.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.160
It's a fundamental change.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.670
So I'm really looking
forward to this.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.200
I'm, you know, I've been
working on this for what,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.260
about 12 years now with Carl.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.840
So, I'm extremely happy
all you are here.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.420
And I would like to invite Carl up,
I guess we're a little bit ahead

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.020
of schedule, but that's
not bad, is it?

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.510
So -- so, Carl?

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.880
[ Applause ]

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.100
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Good morning.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.130 position:56%
Hi. So -- excuse me, I'm Carl Haber.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.900
I work at the Physics Division,

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.560
Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory,

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.090
which is part of the
University of California.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.460
So this is an introductory
kind of overview talk.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:34.690
I will try to address general
issues of modern noninvasive

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.320
and data centered methods

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.230
of recorded sound preservation
and access.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.100
I'm -- I share with Peter, the
thrill to attend this meeting

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.720
with so many people who have worked
on and thought so deeply and worked

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.070
on these and related subjects.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.740
Excuse me.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.360
I would like to acknowledge our
host, the Library of Congress

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.960
and the agencies which
have been so key

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.860
in supporting this
work internationally.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.620
So, I'm going to talk a
little bit about the technical

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.540
and historical context
of sound recordings

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.810
and imaging based methods.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.840
And then I'll try to
define a little bit

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.510
because I know there's a
whole variety of people here

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.810
with different experiences.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.610
What we mean by these methods.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.880
I'll try to address the question,
you know, why should -- why --

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.850
why do we bother doing this at all?

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.940 position:56%
And then what -- what does the field

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.310
from my perspective
need to move forward?

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.160
So here's a zoology of --
of early sound carriers.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.770
You see a lot of different
pictures of disparate objects.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:48.190
They're all forms of --
of sound carriers that --

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.540
that encode sound in a whole
variety of different ways.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.270
So, you -- you should
be struck with the --

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:59.280 position:56%
with the diversity and the lack of
similarity among these things and --

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.280
and that's what we face
when we look particularly

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.870
at the -- at this early period.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:08.030 position:56%
A lot of different materials, a lot
of different formats, shapes, sizes,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.150
structures, modes of
recording sounds.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:16.750
So, the challenges, how do
we deal with all of this?

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.020
So, there is of course as I said,
this -- this great diversity,

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.210
but in the service of
simplification, I want to focus

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:30.490
in on two general formats
that encompass much

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.930
of what is represented
in this diversity

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:38.130
and it will help motivate our
understanding of the approaches

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.670 position:56%
to -- to digitizing these materials.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:47.170
So, on the top, I'm
referring to this --

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:53.460 position:56%
the famous wax cylinder of Alexander
Graham Bell and Thomas Edison and --

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.540
and others in the -- in the
early period of sound recording.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:01.800 position:56%
So this is a cylindrical object with
a groove that essentially makes a --

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:07.400 position:56%
a helical pattern around the
surface and that grooving code sound

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.900
in a vertical modulation
of the surface, so the --

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.980
the bottom of that
groove goes up and down.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.310
And if you put a needle on it,

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.660
that needle is following
the up and down motion.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.860
So there's obviously a cylinder --

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:24.730
a couple of cylinders and this
picture is a blown up region

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.940
of a tiny, tiny portion
of one of those cylinders.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.040
And so, the -- the groove is --
is here between these two ridges

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.880
and time is in this direction,

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.810
so you can imagine a
stylus riding up and down.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.320
This is a picture --
looks like a photograph,

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.720
but you should actually think of
it as a -- as a map of heights,

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.180
so if it's dark, it's deep
and if it's light, it's high.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.670
And so, as you go along the time
direction, you're going deep

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.570
and high, and deep and
high, and so forth.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:54.740
And if you follow this,
it -- it's a -- it's a --

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.820
basically a -- a up
and down pattern.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:03.020
And the -- the extent of this
motion is just about 10 microns,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.080
so that's not going to be a
familiar unit to everybody.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.300
So, think of a human hair.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.860
According to Wikipedia, the average
human hair is 50 microns, okay.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.430
So, this is a fraction of a human
hair, but in that tiny amount

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.900
of space, the audio which has --

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.670
which has been recorded on
the thing is -- is encoded.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:27.380
If we look across -- now
you're going around and around,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:32.000
you see that it's a -- it's a kind
of a circular shaped structure

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.410
and the bottom of it is --

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.560
essentially the entire
structure is moving up and down.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.540
So we refer to this as a
vertical recording and typically,

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.840
cylinders are made that way,

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.600
but there are vertically
recorded disc formats as well.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.370
Over here is the more familiar
disc, the -- the phonograph record,

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.150
if you like, it was the common --

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.430
common term that maybe we used
when some of us were kids.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:02.160
There instead, you have a
groove of -- of fixed depth.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.680
For example, it might be
around 75 microns and it's sort

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.430
of like a 45 degree triangle.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:13.210
And the sound now is encoded in a
side-to-side movement of the group.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.270
And so, here's the -- the needle,
and you can see in this picture,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.060
the groove undulating
from side-to-side.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.610
And we refer to this as a
lateral or side-to-side recording.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.440
And there are many
variations on all of this,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.380
but most recordings
can be classified

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.460
as vertical or -- or lateral.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:36.450
Again, the -- the -- the size of
the movement from side-to-side is

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.750
as small as less than a
micron and as big as many,

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.180
many tens to hundred
something microns.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.960
Okay. So, what about
these -- what are these --

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.880
what are these noninvasive
and optical approaches

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.840
to playing recordings back?

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.210
So, you really start off when you
think about using light instead

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:02.340
of a needle to get information
off of a recorded sound carrier.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.170
Back around 1960, people
were already talking

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:10.520
about using the reflected pattern
of light bouncing off test records,

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.390
records which just contained
a set of fixed frequencies,

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.590 position:56%
as a way to do quality assurance
and -- and test the -- these things.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.500
In -- in the mid-1960's,

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.890
people started using the
scanning electron microscopes

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.730
to study the structure of
grooves on records again,

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.550
as part of -- of engineering.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:33.580
In the 1970's, interferometry,
the interferons of light

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.970 position:56%
as it is reflected from the surfaces
was used to study CD-4 discs.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:43.640
And then in 1977, people really
started to work with the idea

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.830
of using light to really
play records back,

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.130
not just to study them.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.980
And in 1977, Heine patents
a laser disc players, okay.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.960
In the 1980's, a company
called Finial tried

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.820
to take this system
commercial and failed.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:04.000
It was then taken over by a
company called ELPJ in Japan

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.180
and they turned it into a
marketable product in the 1990's.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.220
And you can buy these things
now, this is the laser turntable.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.900
In the late 1990's and early
2000's, a variety of --

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.090
of essentially research labs
and universities and places

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:23.560 position:56%
of that sort, tried to use a
variety of laser reflection methods,

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.380
particularly to try
and read cylinders.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.750
They're sort of small projects.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:32.770
Syracuse University and Lausanne
in the Soviet Union and in Japan,

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.720
so the -- the names of the --
of the principle players are --

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.680
are listed here and there
are probably some others

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.290
that I -- I neglected.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:43.060
But fundamentally, all the
methods that I just referred

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.310
to replaced the stylus with light.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.840
So you're essentially -- you're --
you're still playing these things

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.380
in this -- in the way -- in
this kind of continuous way.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.040
Light is bouncing off of surface
and being picked up like a --

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.430
instead of a stylus, okay.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.940
But the approaches that
are really the focus

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.450
of this meeting are what I would
call metrological approaches, okay.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.130
Instead of -- of -- of replacing
the stylus with a beam of light,

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:12.580
the idea is to treat the
entire surface as a very,

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:18.370
very high resolution, digital
data set, a big digital data set

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:23.660
that you can analyze offline to
extract the recorded sound in --

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.020
in terms of a mathematical
algorithm.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.450
So, we're not making a player
anymore, we're making a way

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:33.550
of migrating a physical
object into the digital domain

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.720
and then applying large-scale
data analysis tools to --

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.580
to extract the information from it.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:43.490
And I -- I think the originating
idea and sense of the --

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.220
of the literature as far
as I could find is --

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.660
is in a paper by Stanke and Paul,
which was called <i>3D Measurement</i>

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.620
<i>and Modeling in Cultural
Applications </i>,

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.170
which was published in 1995.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:58.080
And they point out that a whole
variety of materials, statues,

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.960
ceramics and all sorts of things
could be digitally rendered

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.330
with 3D scanning methods.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:08.960
And that would add value for
scholarship and museum work

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.480 position:56%
and archiving and so forth, to have
these objects in the digital domain.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.670
And I know they were interested
in sound recordings as well

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.940
as statuary materials and so forth.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.280
In 2001, Cavaglieri,
Babst and Johnsen

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:26.310
in Switzerland developed
a 2D photographic method

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:30.500
of transferring disc records
into the digital domain,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.180
which is called the visual
audio and you're going to hear

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.540
from Stefano here today
about visual audio.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.020
And in 2003, a two dimensional

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.550
and three dimensional direct
surface metrology approach

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:51.210 position:56%
to digitizing these materials
started to be worked on by our group

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:54.420
in Berkeley and colleagues at
the University of Southampton

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.430
in the U.K. In the U.S.
we refer to this as IRENE,

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.160
you probably heard the term
in the tours and so forth.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.950
So, that's -- that's kind of
where that -- that originates.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.670
So, what's the basic process?

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.160
I -- I want to transcend
the specific on limitation,

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.340
so I picked a picture that nobody
will confuse as a sound recording.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:20.130
But the point here is -- is you
see the David and this rig is --

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.890
is some kind of a digital scanner
that you can see this little patch

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.660
of light on -- on his nose.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.960
It's actually digitizing.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.280
There is a digital David
that exists through this work

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.310
and it's a tremendously
interesting project.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:37.070
So, think about a generic
scanner and a generic object

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:40.470
of cultural value and
then replace it

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.810
with a phonograph record,
disc, or a cylinder.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.370
And through some scanning
methodology and you will hear

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:50.670 position:56%
about different ones, we end up with
either a three dimensional rendering

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:54.650
of the surface or a two dimensional
rendering of the surface that --

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.760
that then is the form -- the
basis of this digital data set.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.120
[Inaudible] archive it and then you
also pass it through an algorithm

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.870
that calculates how would a
needle move through this surface

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.810
if it was actually playing.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.280
That creates an audio waveform,

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.770
which you can than put
into the form of a file.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.050
So in the process of this
of course, you can --

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.330
you can do digital
restoration, you can ask questions

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:21.390
about the condition of the material
and so forth through these --

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.140
through these analysis processes.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:28.070
Okay, so the two basic ways of
getting information once you're

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:29.370
in -- on the computer from --

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.630
from these data sets
are -- are as follows.

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:37.200
If you have a very high
contrast, two dimensional image

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.840
of the surface, that
can be suitable for --

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.380
for grooves that move
from side-to-side.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.510
You can obtain these through --
either through direct imaging

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.950
or through the photographic films
of the surface that you then scan.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.950
You have to have an
illumination system

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.450
that highlights the surface
features that are flat

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.540
so you can see distinct edges.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.880
You need sufficient resolution
to match the audio content,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.090
so that turns out to have about
one pixel in your imaging system,

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.430
needs to refer to about a
micron on the object surface.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:12.430
You naturally end up sampling
the audio in the time domain

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.470
up to 100 kilohertz or even more,

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.560
quite readily when you
-- when you do this.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.230
There are high speed cameras for
collecting pictures like this

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:23.290
that allow you to collect
the data in --

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:27.550
in just a small factor times
the actual real play time.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.170
And then finally, you
can extract the --

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:34.800
the groove information and
information about damage and debris

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.850
by applying a very well known
mathematical image processing

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.870
technique that is called
edge detection.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:45.060
And that's what happens when
you apply an edge detector

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.360
to this picture.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.590
It throws everything away except
the -- the interfaces between light

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.440
and dark where all the
information is stored.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.500 position:56%
Once you have this, it's basically a
swarm of data points that -- that --

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:03.580
that reflects very directly the
-- the stored audio information.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.960
It's almost trivial to go from --

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.230
from this kind of a data
set to actual sound.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.810
But the great thing about --
about this is that it's --

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:16.410
it so nicely captures the very
regular, but undulating structure

00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:20.330
of the groove, but when there's
a -- a damaged area, or dust,

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.790
or a big scratch, the edge detector
kind of goes crazy and you end

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:28.100
up with a swarm of uncorrelated
-- relatively uncorrelated points.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.730
And that's a great way
of identifying damage

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.690
and spurious features in the
audio right there in the image.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.760
So, it's -- it's a
pretty powerful method

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.050
and it's widely used among
the different approaches.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.920
Instead if you go to
three dimensions,

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.860
you want to capture the entire
three dimensional structure

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.160
of the surface.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.800
That's important in the cylinder
or any vertically cut material

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.020
because photography
is not a very good way

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.120
of capturing the third dimension.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.690
So the method of choice which
has emerged among people working

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.920
in this field, is a type
of confocal microscopes.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.950
It's a microscope which actually
measures the third dimension very

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:11.260
well and the other dimensions in
a scanning kind of an approach.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.030
And it -- it's actually very
clever the way -- the way it works.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:17.230
It takes white light
and it focuses it

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.220
through a lens that's a
mixture of a lens and a prism.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.960 position:56%
So all the different colors get
dispersed by this lens and they come

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.930
into focus at different places.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.060
Okay, so you get this swarm of --

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.260
of points of red, green,
blue, and so forth.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.120
And then when you pass the
surface through that region

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.170
of multiple focus points, you
get reflections back strongly

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.280
from the color that's
in focus and weakly

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.200
from the colors that
are out of focus.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.350
And so you can -- you can
really color the depth.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.450 position:56%
These are extremely powerful devices

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:53.030
and they have a very
significant industrial

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.930
and manufacturing application,
so they're --

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.890 position:56%
it's a very growing field and we're
really benefitted from these things.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.450
The point that they
measure is very small,

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.120
it's only about three
microns in diameter.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.420 position:56%
And they have vertical
resolutions of 50 to 100 nanometers.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.560
So 100 nanometer is
a tenth of a micron.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.870
A micron is a 50th of a human hair.

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:19.900
So it shows you, you know,
what we're talking about --

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.500
sizes which are small compared --
resolution which is small compared

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.790
to the natural scale
of how the surface

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:30.290
of these materials
change due to the audio.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.450
And they're very verbose.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.170
You get a lot of repetitive
data about the surface,

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:38.540
so you can apply averaging
and -- and so forth.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:43.850
Okay, now when you take a
physical carrier and you migrate it

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:47.130
from the -- from the -- the --

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:52.450
the physical object
to an electronic form,

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:56.760
you're in a modern day,
we're digitizing, okay.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.710 position:56%
So it's important to understand what
we mean when we say digitization

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.930
because it -- it really has
a kind of different meaning

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.960 position:56%
in these image-based approaches than
in the more traditional approach.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.270
So let -- let's consider
the traditional approach.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.540
So in the traditional
approach, you put a needle down,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:19.820
the needle follows the groove, the
motion of the needle transforms --

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.530
well, the -- the velocity
of the needle is transformed

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.990
by the mechanism in the cartridge
into an electrical signal.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.750
That's what this waveform is.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.190
That's passed through a
filter and then into an analog

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:35.300
to digital converter that's
running at a certain speed,

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:40.070
let's say 44.1 kilohertz for
standard CD's or 96 kilohertz

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.960 position:56%
for the higher speed archival specs.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.760
And that represents -- and that --

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.520
and that results in a
series of discreet points

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.430
that represent the
filtered version of what --

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.070 position:56%
what was on -- what was on the disc.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.740
So there's a clock
and there's an ADC.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:04.280 position:56%
Now when we digitize a sound
carrier using these optical methods,

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.750
we're essentially taking
a picture of the surface.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:11.200
And so we're turning the physical
object into a grid of points,

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.750
so pixels or voxels, right.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:17.420
Now, those pixels have different
meanings in different directions.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.420
So the pixels that are going
along the time direction,

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.860
the direction of increasing time,
the way those pixels are sliced

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.450
up tells you how fast
you're sampling the audio.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.790
So that's like the clock, right.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.260
The pixels in the other directions
in some way relate to the accuracy

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.140
with which you're measuring
the amplitude.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.800
But that's a much more
complicated relationship

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.220
that depends on many things.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:43.840
It depends on the properties of the
imager, it depends on the algorithm

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.620
that you're using to
-- to get the data out.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.680
So, while in the case of an
ADC, I can tell you, well,

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.860
according to the specification
book, this is a 16 bit ADC

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.740
or a 10 bit ADC -- is
not a simple way to say

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.880
that a particular optical
process results

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.450
in a certain particular bit depth.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.810
There are many particulars and I --

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:12.750
I'm not going to address
this point more until I get

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.780
to my own presentation later about
the IRENE system and I will talk

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.750
about it in that particular
context, but I --

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.540
I'll invite obviously the other
speakers to address that --

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.140
that issue as they see it.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.700
Okay, so why do this?

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.410
And by the way, Peter, can
you let me know when --

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.000
when is this talk supposed to end?

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.230
I'll keep going, okay.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.530
So, never.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:43.890
Okay. So why do this?

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.190
Why are we doing this?

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.460
In the -- in the first, Peter
and Gene, I think eloquently --

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.280
and Mark, eloquently addressed
this, but to reiterate --

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.480
we do this for preservation, to
protect delicate or damaged objects

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.290
from further degradation,
to restore the unplayable.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.970
We do this for access,
to use automated scanning

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:05.170
and analysis methods to massively
digitize large collections.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:09.570
We do this to assess
the, in detailed way,

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.920
the condition of these
sound carriers.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:17.270
We do this to avoid the need to
maintain legacy playback systems

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.740 position:56%
and diverse legacy playback systems.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.330
And we do this in the hope of
applying high resolution methods

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:27.210
to extend the frequency response
and noise reduction opportunities

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.890
of getting data from
-- from these carriers.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:34.040
And I could add, you know,
Peter's really nice point

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.530
about getting access to what --

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:40.300
what we maybe even considered to be
intangible at some time, these --

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.890
these hidden, latent
sets of information

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:45.100
that can be very meaningful
in the end.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.700
Okay. So where are the advantages?

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:50.220
So, remember that we're
transforming the object now

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.200
into a very large digital data set.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.640
This is a modern notion of
the digital humanities, okay.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.330
And then once you get into the
realm of the digital humanities,

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.720
you can ask questions and do things

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.330
that you never would have
though you could of done before.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:08.570
So, there are advantages -- and
I will have a couple of slides

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.990
that address these, but just
as a list, I'm going to argue

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:14.060
that this approach is very general.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:17.360
I try to make the point about
the diversity of sound carriers.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.370
The -- the methods are
redundant, they're verbose,

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:25.570
you get a lot of data that -- that
has repetitive information in it.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.570
They have extraordinarily good
frequency response and resolution

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.960
out to -- to very high frequencies.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.620
They allow you to deal
in a really rational way

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.030
with delicate and broken materials.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:40.970
And they lack the physical dynamics
of a mechanical playback system

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.570
that responds in real time and --

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.080
and that is an important
thing as well.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.380
So generality, these methods
have already been demonstrated

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.410
on a large variety of
materials and formats

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.540
that required actually
very little reconfiguration

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.840
of the scanning system.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.100
So, shellac discs, lacquer discs,
aluminum discs, memovox discs,

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.850
dictation belts, wax and plastic
cylinders, copper galvanos,

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.980
tin foil cylinders and discs,
experimental optical discs,

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:12.270
paper tracings, wax discs with
both vertical and lateral cut.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:14.930
These are all examples of
things that have been scanned

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.960
and then restored already
by optical methods.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.170
I reproduced the picture
from the first --

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:24.070
second slide because those are
actually examples of all things

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:27.910
that have been already
looked at to this day

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.810
with -- with optical methods.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:34.600
So sound redundancies -- a sound
is recorded not just in one point

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.020
on a surface, but in the
entire profile of the groove.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:40.010
The entire profile
contains multiple copies

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.340
of the same audio information.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:46.130
So the groove is moving -- and a
stylus when you plop it in there,

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.640
really only samples a small
portion of the groove.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.150
But a more complete data set,
the entire groove profile,

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.710
gives us analysis options
which can sometimes add value

00:42:54.710 --> 00:43:00.110 position:56%
and that's represented showing that
these lines are the computers choice

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:05.090
of using all the points along the
edge as an estimation of the sound.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.260
And here's a case where there's
some sort of a defect or a damage

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.410
in this -- in this particular
portion of the groove.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:15.800
That can be eliminated from the
data set because it's so redundant.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.350
So frequency response --
I'm going to dwell on this

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:22.040
for a moment before finishing
up because this is, I believe,

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:27.330
a really critical issue for
optical restoration and something

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.550
that people really
need to keep in mind.

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:33.190
On a lateral disc and when the
groove is moving side-to-side,

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:36.820
as the frequency goes up what
happens is the stylus sort

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.820
of gets pushed higher
up into the groove.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:43.240
On a vertically cut disc,
something really different happens.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:47.370
As the frequency goes
up, the stylus starts

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.940
to sample the groove incompletely.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.530
And I'll show you in
a picture why that is.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.320
This leads to distortion,
to attenuation,

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.330
and to non-linearity
in the playback.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.820
Optical probes are so much
smaller than physical styli,

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.080
that they don't suffer from this
at -- until you get to a very,

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.290
very high frequency, okay.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.260
So, these little undulations here
are supposed to just, you know,

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.720
be higher and higher frequencies
that might be vertically recorded.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.350
So when you -- when -- when
the stylus is placed in there,

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.620
you can just see very
clearly from the picture

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:25.600 position:56%
that at a certain frequency, the
stylus is going to be too big to fit

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.700
into the structure
anymore vertically, okay.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.010 position:56%
That's called a tracing error, okay.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.200
Once that happens, the
amplitude gets attenuated,

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.540
the sound gets distorted and
it happens in a non-linear way

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.320
because it samples one direction
of the swing, but not the other.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.870
The optical stylus is so tiny,
that this problem only shows

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:48.730
up at a much higher frequency.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.030
So where does that happen?

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:52.050
So here's just a simple
little calculation.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:53.380
Let's look at the numbers.

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:57.570
So, a cylinder's playback stylus
of 7.5 mils, which is a kind

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:03.010
of standard value, plops down
into the groove which let's say,

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.280
has a depth of 10 microns.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.790
And it reaches the bottom
at -- and at some point,

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.910
there's something I'll call the
critical chord, it's the place

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:15.080
where essentially you
-- you just fit, okay.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.500
So that occurs around 85
microns for this geometry, right.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:24.380
So the question is,
where does the wavelength

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:28.060
on the surface actually hit 85
microns and the -- and the --

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:32.510
and the cylinder playback
stylus no longer fit anymore?

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:34.720
Okay. Well, that depends on the --

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.520
on the speed with which
the record was recorded,

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.280
whether it's a 90 RPM or 160 RPM.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.690
So I, you know, did this whole
spreadsheet, but you can see

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:48.730
that this -- this stylus will
start to not fit anymore at three

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.180
to 4000 cycles per second.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.490
Okay? The optical limit occurs
around 100,000 cycles per second.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:59.330
And it's just because one
is bigger than the other.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:03.510
So really, if you play a
cylinder back with a stylus

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.580 position:56%
and you digitize it at 96 kilohertz,

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:10.820
your affective bandwidth is
equivalent to only sampling it

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.510
at eight kilohertz, which is twice

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.940
that critical frequency,
it's the Nyquist rule.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:20.010
So, people think, well, I'm
running this thing at 96 kilohertz

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.560
or 48 kilohertz -- you're
not getting that information

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.500
because the stylus
just can't pick it up.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.710
It's too big, all right.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:29.970
Who cares, right.

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.610
Who cares about high frequencies
on an acoustic recording?

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:38.460
Acoustic recordings only capture
sound up to a few kilohertz anyway,

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.430
but the problem is that damage and
wear don't respect these limits.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:49.420 position:56%
Cracks, scratches, the effects of
mold have high frequency information

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.640
in them which is -- which is --

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.160
doesn't care about the
frequency limitations

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.250
of the recording process, okay.

00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:01.290
That's the reason in any case, that
you want to transfer a recording

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:02.810
with very high sampling rate,

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:05.290
because you want to
get at the noise.

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:09.230
Only an optical scan gives
you the resolution to measure

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:11.620
and process these high
frequency features, okay.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.220
And here's an example.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.740
So this is a cylinder
which was played back

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.950
on a modern stylus player and
was played back optically.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:23.230
This is a plot of the
energy or the --

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:26.150
the power essentially at
different frequencies.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:28.780
So here's the -- the music,
it's the Rakoczy March,

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.360
so it's if you're a
Hungarian nationalist,

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.300
you're going to like this.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.280
And once you get above
a few kilohertz,

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.090
the frequency content
drops really fast.

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.790
That's because the
stylus is too big, right.

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:42.090
So, let's listen to
what it sounds like.

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:58.040
[ Music ]

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.780
Okay. And now, the same cylinder,

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.510
the same portion played
back optically.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:13.080
[ Music ]

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:16.710 position:56%
Now, you might not like that because
it sounds brighter and tinnier

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:20.070
and is more noise, but
that's exactly what you want.

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:22.880
You want all the information,
you want all the noise

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.460
because then you have what to
work on when you try to process it

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.010
and -- and handle it, okay.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:33.390
So this is a -- a more true
rendering of the information

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:36.500
than that which limits
you when you have a stylus

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.670 position:56%
that has a natural frequency cutoff.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:43.820
Okay. Here's where it comes in
when you try to do noise reduction.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:48.730 position:56%
This is a depth map, so dark is deep
of a little portion of the surface

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.540
of a wax cylinder from the
collection of the University

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.810
of California's Hearst Museum.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:58.200 position:56%
It's a recording of Ishi, he was the
last speaker and surviving member

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.590
of the Yahi band of
Northern California.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:04.390
He was recorded in 1911 by
Professor Waterman and Krober,

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:10.840 position:56%
a very famous collection, it's on --
been on the national sound registry

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.530
and it has damage due to mold
that eats into the surface.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:19.900
So that's all this
black stuff that is deep

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.700
into the surface, it's dark, okay.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.510 position:56%
So when you play it back with a
stylus, this is what it sounds like.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:33.260
[ Singing ]

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.760
When you do an optical version
and you capture all these --

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.800
these fast noise transients
and can process them,

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.750
you're going to hear this and
don't pay attention to the rumble,

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:45.050
I want you to pay attention

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.000
to the crunching sound
due to the mold damage.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:58.270
[ Singing ]

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:02.060
Okay. So, broken and
delicate materials,

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.410
these are obvious for
noninvasive methods.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.980
A number of broken and damaged
things have been shown already,

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.420
you're going to see more
later in the conference.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.060
There are issues related
to how you collect data

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.360
from these segmented objects

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.170
and there are different
approaches and visual audio.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.520
And IRENE, you're going
to hear about those,

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.970
but there are many common issues in
the way the data has to be analyzed

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:23.240
and how you link groove
segments across gaps.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.670
And then the problem of
what happens when the number

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:29.160 position:56%
of broken segments approaches
infinity, how do you deal with that?

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.320
That is a very interesting problem.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.350
I think finally, modeling, okay.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:37.340 position:56%
What you see is what you get, that's
a little bit of a pun I guess,

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.900
but what I'm saying is
because you have these very,

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.960
very high frequency response
and very high resolution,

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:50.680
you get optical transfers that are
truly flat in the frequency sense.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.770
The optical measuring processes
don't have an intrinsic frequency

00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:56.700
response, which it then
imposes on the measured audio.

00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:00.010
A stylus on the other hand is
a dynamic, mechanical system

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:03.150
and that creates a
particular sound when you --

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:04.670
when you hit a defect, okay.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:08.440
Physical modeling can be used to
add these to optical measured data,

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.030
but that's really a choice.

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.610
So here's a -- this
is a stylus playback

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:14.550
and you can see it hits a scratch

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:17.530
and the stylus actually rings
for some period of time.

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:20.350
The mechanical stylus
respond dynamically

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:23.610
and to these imperfections
and that creates the sound

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:27.060
that you're familiar with
in a stylus playback.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.200
But that's -- that's an
effect, okay, it's an artifact.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.170
It's not actually part of
the sound recording, okay.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.030
Is this a universal solution?

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:37.510
No, not yet.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:41.680 position:56%
At present, the tools are expensive,
there's scientific instruments

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.500
with a limited expert base.

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.910
They take longer than traditional
playback methods by a fair margin

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:50.450
in some cases to --
to collect their data.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:53.370
For commercially pressed shellac
discs, which is most of what's

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:56.570
out there in some numerical
sense and if they're

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:59.380
in reasonable condition,
traditional methods are faster,

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.950
much faster and are often superior.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:05.630
But for vertically cut
records and delicate, damaged

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:08.500
or special needs materials
like lacquers, there are very,

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:09.890
very significant advantages

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:12.980
and I think that's what
brought everybody here today.

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.280
So what does this field need?

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.730
The field has made I
think very good progress

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:20.840
in about 15 years considering the
small number of people at work.

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:25.440
In the 1980's, over $20
million of venture capital,

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.480
in then year dollars, was
invested in domestic R

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.920
and D for the laser turntable
that actually never really worked.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.240
And then, the Japanese
started working on it.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.540
So, I can only imagine
what they invested

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.340
in it before it became
a commercial product.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.050
The amount of money which has
been invested internationally

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:45.380
in optical methods, of
the metrological sense,

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.060
is much, much less than this.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.740
We need a larger community
of developers and users

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.380
to bring this into greater use.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.240
We need to develop accepted
standards and specifications

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.770
that everyone agrees
upon and can adhere to.

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:02.890
We need more targeted engineering
and software development.

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:06.950
We need access to new
instrumentation as they appear.

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.300
We need to offer more
training opportunities,

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:12.760
educational opportunities and
internships to younger people

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.580
to -- to learn these methods.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:19.220
And we need more focused,
large transfer projects as ways

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:23.620
to gain experience and converge on
best practices across a community.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:29.430
Okay, so I'm going to conclude just
with a little anecdotal reference.

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:35.570
When you're -- when you're
confronted with an opportunity,

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:39.730
a new idea or some direction to go,
obviously people are often hesitant

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.110
and maybe don't want to take
the chance to try something new.

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:46.500
I think the library showed a lot of
leadership and the funding agencies

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.720
in Europe who supported this
showed a lot of leadership

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.500
to embrace these things
and say, you know,

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:52.980
why don't you try to
do these things?

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:57.600
But you should always keep in mind
that sometimes your assumptions,

00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.200
if you're scared of
them, they prevent you

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.500
from -- from going forward.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.230
So I want you to question
your assumptions.

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:05.200
So the invention of sound recording

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.440
in the 19th Century utilizes
technology and methods

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.050
which actually could have
been applied hundreds

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:12.350
of years before that.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:15.540 position:56%
So I always wondered, could Leonardo
DaVinci who's like the smartest guy

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:18.990
of the 14 to 1500's, you know,
have invented sound recording?

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.290
Why didn't he do that?

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.840
He had everything he could
-- he needed to do it.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:26.030
But it turns out that Da
Vinci believed that poetry

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:30.610 position:56%
and music were inferior to sculpture
and painting because hearing is

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:35.010 position:56%
and I quote, "Less noble than
sight, in that as it is born it dies

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:37.210
and its death is as
swift as its birth."

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:40.810
Okay. So he figured, you know,
God didn't care about sound

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.750
or he would have made
it more permanent.

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:46.580
He didn't realize that he was put
on earth to solve that problem

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:50.430
and find a way to record sound,
but he just didn't do it, okay.

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:53.200
So, you know, it's always
good to think about Leonardo

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.780
when you're trying to make your
next funding decision, okay.

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:58.950
Anyway, so -- so I think
that's all I have, yeah.

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.750
So thank you very much.

[ Applause ]

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:11.270
So, I think you're doing questions
at the end, right, Peter or now?

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:13.520
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.820
Oh.

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:28.490
&gt;&gt; Here, let me give
you a mic [inaudible] --

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:31.600
&gt;&gt; So, Carl, as you're -- as
you're talking about the maturation

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.360
of this, I guess traditionally if
I went to the Library of Congress

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.940
to get a recording,
I'd get a recording.

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.970
But now is there a method
to distribute the data sets?

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:46.880
Is that -- is that the
future you're seeing?

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.190
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Well, so
you're asking a question

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:57.830
about how the results of these
optical studies are disseminated,

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.130
okay.

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:03.620
So, for -- for small pilot
projects and I'll speak about some

00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:06.030
that we did at Berkeley and I'm
sure our colleagues will speak

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:08.080
about other ones that they've done.

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.780
We have it set up, you know,

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.100
websites about the Volta
Laboratory Collection

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.950
from the Smithsonian and so forth.

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.620
But in terms of the
library's process

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:20.820 position:56%
for disseminating the results of
this, I would like to defer to Peter

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:25.710
or some colleagues from the
library to answer that question.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:28.010
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I actually was --

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:29.310
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: The question is --

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:30.610
&gt;&gt; Can you hear me?

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:32.920
&gt;&gt; -- is if you do these
large-scale transfers, how do --

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.290
how are the results made
available to people?

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:39.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, can I get the data set or
do I just still get the recording?

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:40.570
Is that ......--

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:41.870
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: You mean,
you want the image data?

00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:43.420
&gt;&gt; -- the future that you see
that you will distribute the --

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:47.380
the 3D data set, the
image of the recording

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.680
as well as the [inaudible] --

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.390
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, the -- the
mission of the library is

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:53.220
to make the stuff available.

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:57.490
There's nothing, you know, if --
if this was previous to the ability

00:56:57.490 --> 00:57:01.260
to image these things and someone
wanted to physically look at a --

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:04.860
an object, you know, they'd
have to come here and see it.

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:08.090
That' similar to being able
to distribute data set,

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.520
I guess there are copyright
issues, right, Gene?

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.730
I mean, if -- if something is
copy written, I suppose the --

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:17.260
the image data set is as copy
written as an audio file,

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.690
so you certainly have
that, you know,

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:20.630
you can't just pass
these things around.

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:22.000
But do you have something --

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.130
&gt;&gt; -- but doing something
that's completely new.

00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:32.310
So, you know, taking copyright
aside, if you were asking for a --

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:35.370
&gt;&gt; If you're asking for,
you know, an image --

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:39.210
you know, IRENE transfer, say
of -- of a sound recording,

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:43.180
in my opinion you would get the
full data set and an audio file.

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.910
That would be just -- that would
just be what -- what you got.

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:49.680
But that's a new or a -- that's
a new idea, although you know,

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.400
now we give it -- we provide you
with maybe a scan of the label.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.530
People sometimes ask for the
scan of a label of a disc and --

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:59.880
and the audio file as well, but
nonetheless, that's a new idea.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.710 position:56%
But yeah, I would consider that part
of the transfer and I think any DCC

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:08.520
who was actually doing this
-- this work does the same.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.270
&gt;&gt; Is Bill there, or?

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.580
&gt;&gt; I'm certain that they are
distributing the data set along

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:15.880
with the --

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.360
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Yeah, so is -- I
don't know, is Bill or Mason here?

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.660
Yeah.

00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:24.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we -- in general
for institutional clients,

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.900
we include the image data and
some of them aren't interested,

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:29.260
but we've had some people
that were more interested

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.820
in the images than the sounds, so.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:36.370
Yeah, I think they're
really important and useful.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:43.120
&gt;&gt; I can -- the -- my name's
Jerry Favers [assumed spelling],

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.780
I'm the curator at the Thomas
Edison National Historical Park

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:51.750 position:56%
and I can speak to this as a user --
as a customer both with experience

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:54.390
that Library of Congress
at any -- and at any DCC.

00:58:54.390 --> 00:59:00.670
And I think with this process,
it's important to understand

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:06.760 position:56%
that the archival data that's
captured is the image data and we --

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:11.160
in my experience, I was given
the image data, but not the --

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.110
no capability of using it.

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:15.720
Not the software, in other words.

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.900
I think that's something
that needs to change.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.710
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: I think that's
a tremendously good point.

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:25.660
And so what you're saying is, to
translate to a more general way --

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:31.310
so, the optical systems scan,
they create image files.

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:37.240
Then the operators use software
to transform the image into audio.

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.370
And so, simpleminded things, okay,

00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:45.720 position:56%
and then when you give the user the
audio -- if you give the user the --

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:50.700
the image, there is software that
can be used to -- to transfer that.

00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:52.460
And you can make different
choices when you do

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:56.450
that about noise reduction or a
bunch of choices that you can make.

00:59:56.450 --> 01:00:00.210
And one of the goals really
should be and as part of this --

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.940
this notion of -- of larger
community of developers and users,

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.240
and more targeted engineering
and software.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:11.660
It would be great to make an
application that is easy to use,

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:17.300
that is very user-friendly, that
has the basic presets or choices

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.830
and it gives a person with
just a little bit of training,

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.810
the possibility to
process the image data.

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:24.110
And it's a great goal.

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:27.330
It's just something that
hasn't been accommodated yet,

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:31.060
but it's certainly something that
you could define quite readily

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.360
and -- and think about doing.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:37.000
And you're right, that -- that is
something that you should have.

of Chicago.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.440
Thanks, Carl.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.210
You used the [inaudible] of
zoology, but it occurred to me now

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:47.610
as you're talking, as this
discussion is going forward

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.670
about images and distribution
of images,

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:53.760
that you've added a new element to
the zoo in an important way and --

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.650
and extended zoology
really, carrying it forward.

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:02.520
But speaking to the importance
of distributing the --

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.340
the images themselves,
if I think of an analog,

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.590
the Dead Sea Scrolls come to mind.

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.190
And for a long time, many
of you probably will know

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.720
that it was only the research
on the Dead Sea Scrolls

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.930
that was distributed and the
images themselves were not

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:20.080
until fairly recently.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.680
But by virtue of distributing
the microfilm or other sources

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.830
that have the full context
of the Dead Sea Scrolls,

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:29.950
you've increased the
number of users.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:33.550
And here I'd like to point
back to your set of needs.

01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:35.850
You've talked about
a larger user base,

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:38.570
but presumably you want a
larger research base as well.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:39.870
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Absolutely.

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:41.170
&gt;&gt; By distributing the images,

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:45.080
effectively you increase the
possibility that a larger group

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.750
of scientists can address these
questions of interpretation

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:51.240
of the signals in new
and creative ways

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.420
that might not be possible
now or even imagined now.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.100
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: I mean, it
might be a good idea to sort

01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:03.490
of do a pilot project where we
put up a variety of image files

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:08.710
from a variety of sound carriers
and put it out there to the --

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:13.210
the world of universities
and interested people,

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:16.080
like a data challenge,
to see what they can do.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.660
I actually went to a data
challenge event in San Francisco.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:25.540
This is where these big data
companies offer a prize to come

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.520
up with a better way
to analyze things.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.520
So, for example, I'm a high
energy physicist and they put

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.780
out the data set that led to the
discovery of the Higgs particle

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.550
and they just ask the world
to try to analyze it and see

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:41.070
if they could get a better signal
to noise than the physicist got.

01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:44.730
They did. But -- but these kind
of data challenges, you know,

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:47.020
they gain -- they gain
some traction and --

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.550
and there's a lot of
smart people out there

01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:50.080
who think about large data sets.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.510
And so, it might be a way
to seed something like this.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:12.720
I would like to say many
people, same as with Carl,

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.030
many people have contributed
to this project.

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:18.210
Some of the names are here.

01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:23.420
I have forgotten many and also
[inaudible] maybe 50 names to add.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:28.180
I am not going -- I'm going
to jump over some of the --

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:33.710
my slides because Carl has
already given you the most

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:36.010
important information.

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:38.480
And what's the problem?

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.070
Well, [inaudible] that's
why I will go to.

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:46.750
Next slide, to -- and this
slide is mainly interesting

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:50.510
because that's a kind of
slide we have been working on,

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:58.290
and Stefano will get into more
detail about such records.

01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:08.740
And the fundamental again, Carl
has talked about and now I'm going

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:11.650
to the fundamental technique.

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:16.240
It's the idea from Stefano, I will
talk a little bit about it later,

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:24.950
is to the entire surface of
a disc could be photographed.

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:31.790
Here is the same observation if we
look with a microscope of a groove,

01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:35.510
probably you know what
kind of record this is.

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:43.190
This is your stereo record because
you see the widths and the --

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:47.920
the lateral movement
change with time.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:54.980
And here is a basic block diagram
of the visual audio concept

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.930
where we have one step -- one
extra step from the record.

01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:08.850 position:56%
First we make film, then we digitize
film, then last step, we go from --

01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:15.510
we extract the sound from
the image to get a sound.

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:21.300
Now why should we have an
intermediate photographic step?

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:25.470 position:56%
It's controversial something, it's a
good solution something [inaudible].

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:36.000
I believe one idea is that it's
urgent way to -- to extract --

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:44.500
not extract the sound, to save the
disc before it decays even more.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:49.700 position:56%
Film are small, cheap, quite stable.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.600
We know it [inaudible] microfilms.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.000
Microfilms are last a few
hundred year [inaudible].

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:06.920
And we are using film
relatively similar to microfilm.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:14.420
Here is what we get if
illuminate a record from above,

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:19.850
a record [inaudible]
both with 78 rpm record

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:27.690
where the groove is a little
bit round and with 33 rpm record

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:31.920
where the groove is much
more triangular groove.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.640
And this is what we get
at the bottom on the --

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:40.330
on the film, but I will get
in more detail on it later.

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.240
So what do we need for the film?

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:48.890
If we have the highest possible
resolution, the smallest grain,

01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:50.850
it should be black and white.

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:53.600
We don't care about color and also,

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.240
black and white film have
much higher resolution

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:02.870
than color photographic film.

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:05.040
And also, the speed should
be high of the films,

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:11.790
so that we can reduce the time

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:16.220
and also we can reduce
the amount of light.

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:25.880
We melted a few records I believe
at the beginning in our first trial

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:30.120
because we had 500 watts light,

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:36.770
but we did it on --
on record of no value.

01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:44.780
Here you see the picture
of the system [inaudible]

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.840
and the next we see the
system to take picture.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:53.800
Basically, the system while you
will make a one to one picture,

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:59.690
here we have a 40 centimeter
focal lengths lens.

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:06.590
If it were one to one,
we need 80 centimeter,

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:10.360
two times the focal length
on each time -- each play --

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:17.710
each side of the lens, so it give
a total length of one meter 60.

01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:20.650
And the total system is a
little bit more than two meter

01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:23.760
because we want -- we need
some hardware [inaudible] --

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.890
some mechanical hardware outside.

01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:34.420
So how does -- how do we
make the illumination?

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:39.440
We make the illumination so
that we can separate the --

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.750
the interesting part.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.080
We use directional light,

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.600
we use monochromatic
[inaudible] monochromatic light

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.320
so that we can -- first of all,

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.250
we select the shortest
possible wavelength

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:56.350
and that is blue or deep blue.

01:08:56.350 --> 01:09:03.070
And secondly, we have less
problem with [inaudible] dispersion

01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:06.480
when using a single color.

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:12.510
And now, in optics
or in photographics,

01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:14.720
in the photographical optic,

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:20.600
resolution is limited
by two main factor.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.020
We have the diffraction
that gives us an airy disc.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:30.690
It mean one point become a
spot of a certain [inaudible].

01:09:30.690 --> 01:09:35.110
And we have the de-focusing error

01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:39.240
because we are never
completely focused just

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:45.500
because our record
had a certain depth.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:53.180
And both of them give
a certain enlargement.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:10:01.160
And we can calculate all
of them and they depend

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.230
on the numerical aperture.

01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:16.180
And both of them depend -- and one
of the problem is that one improves

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:23.940
when you increase the numerical
aperture, the other one goes down.

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:27.830
So we must get -- so
there is a compromise.

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:29.730 position:56%
It's a good thing with a compromise,

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:35.330
is that when we have the
sum, the bottom is very flat.

01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:39.720
So we can use practical
consideration, for example,

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:46.290
the size of the system of other to
select something that is within one

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:53.360
or two percent of the optimum,
especially taking into account

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.610
that it is [inaudible] optimum.

01:10:56.610 --> 01:11:03.860
There, yes -- here are the --
are the value with -- with the --

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:09.980
with the end number that we can
actually have on the optic we had.

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:20.050
And here again, you see the
-- the resolution in micron.

01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:25.160
So now we have done one
process, we have taken a picture

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.030
and what's interesting with the
picture is that with this picture,

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:30.350
we have a big [inaudible].

01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:35.900
We have a [inaudible] of one
millimeter and that is good due

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:42.000 position:56%
to -- because many records are not
flat, are in bad shape, can be bent,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.910
but a depth of one millimeter
we can get bigger [inaudible].

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:51.480 position:56%
Simply then we have less resolution.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.580
Now, next step we have a film.

01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:00.260
We use negative film, but people
could use also positive film.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.960
And then we have to use a scanner.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:09.470
And our scanner is
quite similar to --

01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:15.520
has many similar characteristics
to Carl's 2D system.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:24.260
Simply while scanning a
film, not -- not a record.

01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:30.250
What it means also we get
light, a reflective light,

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:35.520
we have light going through
the film by transparency.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:42.730
And here, when you see a little
bit better, you recognize under --

01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:47.160
on the bottom of the
system, a light source.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:52.170
Unhappily, we had to use red light

01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:56.940
because blue light
source are not available.

01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.510
It is LED [inaudible] already.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:03.660
And we hope -- we at each --

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:11.190
we have a rotating scanner at
each rotation with 2048 samples.

01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:15.980
So we -- we are scanning in
each rotation a certain number

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:20.100
of [inaudible] if there are only
five, but usually [inaudible] 10

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:27.850
to 12 rotation we get when we scan.

01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:32.410
Our sampling frequency is valuable.

01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:36.100
We have used sampling
frequency of up

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:45.150
to 200 kilo samples per ring
corresponding for 33 rpm record

01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:53.130
of sampling frequency up to
110 and for 78 rpm records

01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:57.030
of sampling frequency
up to 260 kilohertz.

01:13:57.030 --> 01:14:01.680
That is probably used less,
but again as Carl said,

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.220
now it's [inaudible] useful
information to improve

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:09.180
in -- to reduce in-band noise.

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:15.290
So here is what we get with the
-- when we scan the picture.

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:21.470 position:56%
That is a more typical example while
you recognize the sound and you see

01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:26.660
that for each groove,
we have two white lines

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:31.180
and in the middle we
have black line.

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.940
Remember, it is a negative,
so all we talk

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.530
about the lines get inverted.

01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:45.670
And now, if we look at the optic,

01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:50.130
we go from the photographic
optic now to microscope optic.

01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:53.530
We have the same physical
constrained

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:57.770
from the optic, but
different number.

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:03.380
We have the diffraction
giving the airy disc

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:06.280
and we have the de-focusing.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:18.040
And there, we consider that we need
a depth of field of 30 to 50 micron

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:27.460
and it gives us blur, total
blur of about 13 micron.

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:37.920
And what is interesting is
as it is shown on this curve,

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:46.100
increasing magnification does
not increase the resolution.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:50.570
Because when increased
magnification at a certain point,

01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:56.650
you have a reduction in
the -- in the resolution.

01:15:56.650 --> 01:16:03.630 position:56%
And here are just we have different
figure whether we need a [inaudible]

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:06.260
of 30 or 50 micron.

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:10.300
Where does it -- the number
30 and 50 micron come from?

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:14.920
They come from our knowledge

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:20.920
about the negative film
[inaudible] accuracy

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:26.980
in negative film plus the
film is put on a glass plate

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.070
and the glass plate rotate.

01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:36.460 position:56%
We have measured how the glass
plate move up and down on a rotation

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:41.960
and -- and that is how we came
to -- to the fact that we are --

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:49.040
we need a depth of field of
between 30 and 50 micron.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.230
And here I go back
to what is happening

01:16:54.230 --> 01:17:00.680
with 78 rotation per minute record.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:08.150
We have -- we have form with
a groove and it gives --

01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:12.600
where we have a lot of
light, reflected light, we --

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.430
it's black because it's negative.

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:19.050
And where we have no
reflected light, it is white

01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:27.940
and that's why we have two
white lines for each groove.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.780
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:33.160
I put -- pushed the wrong button.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:40.010
And the -- for our 33 rpm
record usually we have nothing

01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:46.430
at the bottom, but sometimes
because the cut is not perfect,

01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:50.870
we have also very same line,
black line appearing in --

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:55.790
at the bottom, but not often.

01:17:55.790 --> 01:18:00.760
For processing the
image, we do basically

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.480
as Carl said, edge detection.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:10.770
And we have two or four edges.

01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:14.560
Secondly, important
thing, the resolution --

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:22.960
the edge detection can be
detected with better than a pixel,

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.200
that's what I call
subpixel accuracy.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:32.220
If the accuracy of the position
of a edge depends on signal

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:34.740
to noise concern [inaudible]
problem.

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:41.400
Not to the size of
pixel on the scanner.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.390 position:56%
And as I said, noise and distortion
are the problem, the main problem --

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:48.110
it is not [inaudible]
it is not a blur.

01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:50.880
It is mostly the noise
and distortion.

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.030
But the good -- but if we have
less blur, we have more information

01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:58.540
on a noise and we might
be able to --

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:02.340
to get rid of the noise
in a better way.

01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:07.660
And the noise distortion, many
-- there are many of them --

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:12.820
dust, defect, non constant
illumination.

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:15.530
Our main noise that is different

01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:19.920
from what Carlo does
is a film grain.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:26.570
We have random shaped
crystal system in photography.

01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:34.240
We have -- we have noise
naturally in the linear CCD camera.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:39.010
We have -- we might have,
but -- well, it's very low.

01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:45.720
Our sampling frequency of
sampling time is not perfect,

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.610
so might be vibration, mechanical
vibration on the scanner.

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:57.480
There might be bad centering
of the record, same issue.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:04.430
And - but -- bad centering create
only second or third order problem.

01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:09.870
So one thing we do to
light is not -- we don't --

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:14.720 position:56%
can't have constant illumination due
to the optics -- optics of the --

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:21.630
the microscope makes it our
lightest, not constantly constant.

01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:26.240
That can be corrected with
a curve, but any correction

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.740
that you [inaudible]
some slide noise.

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:35.740
And it's easy, we measure
a film without anything

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:40.360
and that gives us a
correction curve.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.330
And now, we look at the processing.

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:47.430
Here is a typical example,
we have two white lines

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:52.250
and we want to extract the edge.

01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:57.990
And we are looking, we cut
with looking at one pixel

01:20:57.990 --> 01:21:02.380
and you have the intensity .

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:08.270
We dictate up to constant
level on the top and the bottom

01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:13.330
and after the threshold,
it's put about in the middle.

01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:16.950
It is more complicated than that.

01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:24.010
And then, we are going
to do it with time --

01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:26.870
with time, yes, vertically
it's a time --

01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:30.530
or it is space here what
is correspond to time.

01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:33.830
And now, what are going to do?

01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:41.920
We are going to look at the
image -- image to find mistake.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:46.700
As you can see below, if we
take just the average about --

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:51.150
between the four edges
or between the two edges,

01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:53.670
we see clearly some distortion.

01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:59.460
And we have some information
to get rid of information.

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:03.540
We know that all the four
lines should be [inaudible].

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:09.050
So [inaudible] being stupid
and adding the four lines

01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:11.670
to get [inaudible]
the best position.

01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:16.350
We -- we add the four lines when
everything is perfect [inaudible],

01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:21.530
but when one line is clearly
different from the other,

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:25.930
we suppose that that
line is incorrect.

01:22:25.930 --> 01:22:30.860
And then you will make an
interpolation on this line based

01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:32.650
on the three other lines.

01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:35.920
When I say line, I mean
naturally the edge.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:43.620
And -- and typically, yes, it's
also -- we use [inaudible].

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:55.770
And when we have cut we
do interpolation linear

01:22:55.770 --> 01:23:01.000
of [inaudible] second
of the interpolation.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.070
And here is another
example where you see

01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.710
where we have the four edges.

01:23:09.710 --> 01:23:14.830
And where we detect
where there are problems.

01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:24.450
And in red, we have the edges,
the four edges after correction.

01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:32.310
Here is on top, we have what we --

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:39.380
the basic signal, it's
a edge signal.

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:43.780
And on this edge signal, I
like to show the top one.

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:47.530
We have two special
effects, we have a ramp.

01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:51.640
The ramp is due to the
spiral in the groove.

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:57.040
Then we have a [inaudible],
nearly a [inaudible] wave.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:03.030
The [inaudible] wave is due to
bad centering of the record.

01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:08.030
And then at the beginning,
you see some jump.

01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:13.410
That when we jumped to the
next groove we made a mistake.

01:24:13.410 --> 01:24:17.470
We jump on one groove to next
and then back again later.

01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:22.650
It didn't happen much, but I want
-- I, on purpose, I put one --

01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:26.450
one bad case where
we put it in evident.

01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:31.620
So after taking away
[inaudible] and a sine wave --

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:35.010
and the sine wave has a
frequency equal to rotation,

01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:40.010
to our 32 -- 33 rpm record.

01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:47.350
It correspond to 0.5 hertz
signal for 78 at 1.2 hertz about.

01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:54.360
So it is very easy to get rid of
it just by high pass filtering.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:25:00.950
And then afterwards, we get the
sound waves glitches at place

01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:06.470
where it jumped or where
there was some noise.

01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:16.180
Afterwards, I don't want to go
into all the specialty record,

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:20.150
but most record are equalized.

01:25:20.150 --> 01:25:26.900
It mean that what you see, the
lateral movement is not the sound.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:30.160
There are some derivative
and integration

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:36.020
to be made before getting
the equalized sound.

01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:42.520
It means that when reading we must
make inverse equalization operation

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.810
as [inaudible] when
writing on the record.

01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:53.530
That is done in most mechanical
playing device, the same is done.

01:25:53.530 --> 01:26:00.010
The problem, we don't always know
how the equalization was made.

01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:05.340
We know it for after
the a1930's we had stand

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:09.150
out equalization before each
record was nearly equalized

01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:10.570
in a different way.

01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:16.150
And additional post-processing
might be applied,

01:26:16.150 --> 01:26:22.270
but many sound specialists
say, don't process,

01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:26.640
don't do any additional
post-processing on the original.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.800
Only do it on copy.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.910
Keep the original even if bad shape

01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:34.720
because later we might
have better technique.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:39.820 position:56%
Now, how can we measure the quality.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.010
That a big issue.

01:26:42.010 --> 01:26:44.510
Perceptually is one possibility.

01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:47.230
Another possibility is
to measure the noise

01:26:47.230 --> 01:26:51.840
in silent section of a groove.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:58.530
A third solution is
to have a test record

01:26:58.530 --> 01:27:05.110
and to measure what we obtained.

01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:09.610
As an example, this is
just for showing On the --

01:27:09.610 --> 01:27:17.890
on the bottom slide, we have a sine
-- the spectrum of a sine wave.

01:27:17.890 --> 01:27:25.670
And what do we have if we have
a perfect sound on the record.

01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:29.380
We'll have a peak in -- at
the frequency of the sound

01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:31.930
and elsewhere, we will have noise.

01:27:31.930 --> 01:27:33.870
That what we see at the bottom.

01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:38.060
And it's much -- it's some high
frequency of some small peaks

01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:42.760
that can be due -- due
to many [inaudible].

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:49.730
For example, 30 or 60 hertz
interference during recording

01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:55.590
that comes out -- can come out
a different frequency later.

01:27:55.590 --> 01:28:03.830
And on top, we have example, that
is what happened when we have none

01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:08.260
of [inaudible] and we have
an [inaudible] harmonics

01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.560
and [inaudible].

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.300 position:56%
So such technique can be used to try

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:17.310
to measure the signal
to noise ratio.

01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:23.370
And what resolution do we
need to get, for example,

01:28:23.370 --> 01:28:26.390
a 40 dB signal to noise ratio?

01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:32.240
With constant amplitude record,
we need a resolution at 1.75

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.700
or accuracy at 1.75 micron.

01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:40.070
For constant velocity, 0.25 micron

01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:44.420
and for equalized record,
1.28 micron.

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:50.520
And this is amazing number showing
that in mechanical engineering --

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:58.650
in mechanics, 150 years ago, they
did as well as electronic managed

01:28:58.650 --> 01:29:02.750 position:56%
to do with [inaudible] 20 years ago.

01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:08.040
So, electronic is 100 -- more than
100 years behind -- mechanics.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.030
I like to tell it especially
to my electronics colleagues.

01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:15.390
I am electronics also,
not a mechanic.

01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:23.570
I show how perfect one wasable to
record things in a mechanical way.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:31.320
So does it make sense
to try to get this?

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:36.000
One -- one thing now, a blur
of 25 micron and a resolution

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.420
of one micron, I mean,
we're far away.

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:44.000
But the blur is low pass filtering,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.010
so resolution is related
to the noise.

01:29:47.010 --> 01:29:54.030
That's why it's -- it
does -- it is possible.

01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:59.420
But actually, if we can reduce a
blur, it will be a good solution.

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:01.720
It helps always.

01:30:03.130 --> 01:30:07.900
Now I go through something
Stefano will go more through it,

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:09.650
is the time of processing.

01:30:09.650 --> 01:30:13.630
And I believe each
case is different,

01:30:13.630 --> 01:30:16.620
and Stefano has much
better [inaudible].

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:24.640
Yes. So the advantage
I believe I have talked

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:33.120
about already, compared
to mechanical.

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:43.510
I want to go now into the detail
of the record cut in many pieces.

01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:50.950
When you look the image file,
when you scan the record,

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:55.710
the [inaudible] record become a
file like this, and the sound is

01:30:55.710 --> 01:31:01.280
in a groove vertically,
and we have big crack.

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:06.790
And [inaudible] that we have pieces
of the puzzle, except [inaudible]

01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:09.980
but with a slight cut between them.

01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.280
So what can we do?

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:20.320
First thing we must label each part
of our puzzle as it is shown here.

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:27.920
And now we must try to fit
perfectly the different pieces

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.220
of the puzzle using information.

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:37.600
And first [inaudible] first we
have to detect the common border

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:45.020
of a chunk, then we must
look at the best match

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:52.240
and then we must add together
or put together different parts

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.320
of sound on each [inaudible].

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:59.060
So here is an example,
we have a chunk,

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:03.880
and you see the vertical line
corresponds to the groove.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:11.950 position:56%
And afterward we have now the common
[inaudible] between the groove

01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:18.620
and we must [inaudible] best
match of the two blue path

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:23.190
or the two red path or
the two [inaudible] path.

01:32:23.190 --> 01:32:26.160
And this is done [inaudible] here.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:32.870
First we put the -- we look at the
path of the groove near the boulder

01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:38.750
on each side, and we look at
what shift gave the best math.

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:42.600
We have found that there
can be shifts up to five --

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:47.070
equivalent to five groove,
maybe even six or seven.

01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:53.300
So we have to test what
displacement give the best match,

01:32:53.300 --> 01:33:01.920
it means give the best similarity
in the statistical property

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:07.760
on the groove above
and below the cut.

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:12.300
And there are many
different [inaudible].

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:15.120
And there are some
special situations.

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:23.980 position:56%
For example you see here,
sometimes one groove might disappear

01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:32.310
[inaudible] because it was
exactly where there was a cut.

01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:38.330 position:56%
Okay? And here you see how -- we
can see how usually relatively well.

01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:42.420
Now, what happened in some case
the computer is much more stupid

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:44.230
than human.

01:33:44.230 --> 01:33:46.710
So what do we have to build?

01:33:46.710 --> 01:33:52.670
We have to build something so that
when the computer is not sure,

01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:57.740
it let an operator
decide what to do.

01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:04.050
And I will show it only very
happily here on this picture,

01:34:04.050 --> 01:34:07.030
on the left, the operator.

01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:11.450
For each place the computer
can't make a decision,

01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:17.210
the operator can change what
groove fit which -- each other.

01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:23.980
For example, it can say that the
groove should be fitted this way.

01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:29.530
There are still some problems.

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:32.430
Sometimes there are [inaudible].

01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:38.780
Secondly, sometimes on record
there are several [inaudible].

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:47.650 position:56%
A record stops and the -- because it
was, for example, for a court case,

01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:51.750
at the end they will lift
the groove [inaudible] --

01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:55.450
not the groove, stylus,
and a new one will start.

01:34:55.450 --> 01:34:58.810
And there might be
some other problems.

01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:03.140
Sometimes that what happened
with our first record,

01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:05.580
the reading was the wrong way.

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:06.880
The reading was the wrong way.

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:11.450
With the first, six months after we
started the project we got the very

01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:14.380
same sound until we
found the right idea.

01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:16.960
Let's try to turn around the sound.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:21.990
So that is -- one should
never forget it.

01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:28.550
Then afterwards simply we
concatenate all the sound together

01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:32.550
to get the sound.

01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:37.520
We have processed the
number of such records.

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:43.570
Typically that will go on to say we
couldn't recover all the records,

01:35:43.570 --> 01:35:44.980
at least at that time.

01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:49.760
Typically 35 faces out
of 46 could be extracted.

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.640
Some were in too bad a shape.

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:58.000
Now just a few more words.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:07.280
As a professor I'm very happy
that the project doesn't finish

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:10.690
by collecting dust because
that's what happened with 99%

01:36:10.690 --> 01:36:15.220
of the project of Professor
[inaudible].

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:21.130
But the one who initiated
it, Stefano Cavaglieri

01:36:21.130 --> 01:36:24.270
from the Swiss National
Archives in Lugano,

01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:27.440
is also the one taking it
over, and I'm very happy,

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.370
especially that I am now one
year before retirement age.

01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:37.770
So it's good to know
that the same continuing.

01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:40.920
It was very interesting
because it's very valuable.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.280
That's why I didn't
believe in this project

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.590
of [inaudible] the beginning,

01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:48.420 position:56%
but I knew it was a very
interesting project for the students

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:52.280
because updates, electronic,
mechanic, everything.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.920
What I found later so very
interesting is working with people

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:00.540
who are not engineering
near of non-physicists --

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:05.120
engineering near the same --
but people from the humanities

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.670
and people from, yes,
from the cultural world.

01:37:08.670 --> 01:37:11.950
It was a collaboration
between many institutions

01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:17.590
and with funding from
different entities.

01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:19.510
Thank you very much, and so --

01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:31.410
[ Applause ]

01:37:31.410 --> 01:37:34.550
&gt;&gt; So, let me [inaudible]
Stefano [inaudible].

01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:35.850
&gt;&gt; Maybe I'm --

01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.530
&gt;&gt; Hi, Stefano, how you doing?

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:50.830
&gt;&gt; This is Bill Storm.

01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:53.840
I have a question regarding
the way you've --

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.140
&gt;&gt; How are you?

01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:56.440
&gt;&gt; Pretty good.

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.740
&gt;&gt; Oh, hi.

01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:59.040
&gt;&gt; There we go.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.090
In the 1980s, there was a major
project done in this country

01:38:01.090 --> 01:38:04.180
that resulted -- it was called
the Rigler-Deutsch Index.

01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:10.650
That's a microfilm copy of many
thousands of sound recordings

01:38:10.650 --> 01:38:13.970
that allow the Library of
Congress, New York Public, Yale,

01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:15.920
Syracuse University, and I'm going

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.580
to forget somebody,
to -- we did a --

01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:20.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.530
&gt;&gt; -- photography of all
of these sound recordings

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:25.580
with very, very even lighting.

01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:28.840
It was using high-contrast
microfilm.

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:32.280
Is it possible that your
system might literally be able

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.850
to play those images from
the Rigler-Deutsch Index?

01:38:36.850 --> 01:38:38.640
They're very high-resolution.

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:39.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:43.130
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yes, what
are the size of the films?

01:38:43.130 --> 01:38:46.380
&gt;&gt; Thirty-five millimeter.

01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:47.900
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Thirty-five
millimeter.

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:54.200
Oh, no. That's for the first test
we tried 35 millimeter and just

01:38:54.200 --> 01:39:01.310
by simple calculation we found
it was completely impossible

01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:07.090
and we arrived to the fact
that one to one was about --

01:39:07.090 --> 01:39:11.960
was what would make it possible.

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.260
&gt;&gt; Okay. That's too bad.

01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.560
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yeah, it is.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.000
&gt;&gt; Another question for Ottar?

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:27.860
&gt;&gt; I was surprised to hear
that your depth of field

01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:32.140
for the photo was only one
millimeter, because it seems to me

01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:35.160
that warped records tend
to be, or can be worked

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.990
by much more than one millimeter.

01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:38.390
So, if you could explain that.

01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:43.540
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yes, our depth
of field is one millimeter,

01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:48.980
but simply if it can go to
much higher value simply

01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:52.520
than the resolution is lower.

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:56.610
&gt;&gt; So what [inaudible].

01:39:58.130 --> 01:40:03.240
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yes, but I
would say I made calculation

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.150
with one is more like we have --

01:40:05.150 --> 01:40:07.800
I would say the order
of three millimeter.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:11.250
&gt;&gt; But warped records
which are acetates --

01:40:11.250 --> 01:40:12.550
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yeah.

01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:15.910
&gt;&gt; -- probably you don't because
of their glass or aluminum backing,

01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:19.240
you don't get that huge warpage
where you might get with a vinyl

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.060
or a -- because they don't
have that same heat problem,

01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:27.780
and so to the extent that you've
been focusing on lacquer discs,

01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:31.080
I think this large warpage
probably doesn't come in.

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.380
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: No.

01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:37.150
I don't believe so, but Stefano
maybe can answer also about it.

01:40:37.150 --> 01:40:39.310
&gt;&gt; The delamination.

01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:42.460
&gt;&gt; Is a delamination but --
so that curvature's -- yeah.

01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:45.470
But that's not a couple
of millimeters, typically.

01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:47.120
&gt;&gt; It is or it can be.

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.830
It could be seven millimeters.

01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:51.820
But you have to work with
the disc [inaudible].

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:55.440
What I think he's saying is --

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:57.000
&gt;&gt; Carl, give him the mic.

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:04.060
&gt;&gt; I think the warp can actually
get up to seven millimeters

01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:08.160
if you include the warp of the
disc base and flaking lacquer.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.460
But if I understand correctly,

01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:12.140
if you decrease the
magnification you can continue

01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.840
to increase the depth of
fields, so if you were willing

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:18.130
to have a lower resolution
image file

01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:22.190
and lower resolution audio you
could get a high depth of field

01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:24.990
that would allow you to image
a delaminated lacquer disc.

01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:26.290
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yeah.

01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:30.210
Or we can reduce the --

01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:31.510
&gt;&gt; Aperture.

01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:32.810
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: -- the
aperture [inaudible], yes.

01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:34.110
Much better.

01:41:34.110 --> 01:41:35.870
You don't change the magnification.

01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:38.230
You change the aperture,
and that's a good way

01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:42.340
to get the bigger depth of field.

01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:46.280
&gt;&gt; But then you get
fracture [inaudible].

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.580
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yes.

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:48.880
That's what you pay.

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:52.260
That's the price you pay to
get the bigger depth of field.

01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:53.640
&gt;&gt; Okay. So are there --

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.940
&gt;&gt; Okay, we can move on.

01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.240
&gt;&gt; We're going to move on.

01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:57.540
Okay.

01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:58.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we have another talk

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.140
about [inaudible] from
Stefano Cavaglieri.

01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:04.570
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Okay.

01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:12.310
Good morning, everyone and --
well, that of Dr. Johnsen of the,

01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:17.140
let's say, scientific
approach to this project

01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:19.780
or to this system called
VisualAudio.

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:24.050
Mine will be a very
practical approach

01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:33.930 position:56%
with real day-to-day experience as
we used the system at our facilities

01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:36.560
at the Swiss National
Sound Archives.

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:43.950
It has been a long journey
because we started effectively

01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:46.590
with this project more
than 15 years ago.

01:42:46.590 --> 01:42:56.500 position:56%
It was in 1999 and I'm happy that we
at least got some tangible results.

01:42:56.500 --> 01:43:02.340
But, of course, there are
challenges, still challenges.

01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:06.190
There are ups and downs
and there is, of course,

01:43:06.190 --> 01:43:10.300
room for further improvements.

01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:16.210
The basic idea, as Dr.
Johnsen said, was --

01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:18.990
came from the microscopic
observation

01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:22.000
of the surface of the disc.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.820
If you look at the
shape of the groove,

01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:33.300
it visually represents the acoustic
vibrations which are very close

01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:37.000
to the electrical signal
of the recorded sound.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:44.000
There is plenty of information
available everywhere,

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.830
but it requires a very, very high
resolution photography or scanning.

01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:58.980
This is just a schematic overview
of the VisualAudio concept.

01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:02.820
You're getting familiar
with that, but I'm --

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:08.590
I try to insist on a
couple of important points.

01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:17.700 position:56%
What we do is we actually photograph
the disc and then we scan the film

01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:20.460
and then we process the image.

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:25.070
But we've been talking
about photographs

01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:26.760
and how does it look like?

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.750
It looks like this.

01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:36.220
This is an actual photography
shot with the VisualAudio system.

01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:39.660
It's a one-to-one ratio.

01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:44.620
It means if your record is 25
centimeters in diameter it's going

01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:49.820
to be 25 centimeters
on the negative film.

01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:58.250
So why, why do we have this
analog photographic step?

01:44:58.250 --> 01:45:04.250
Dr. Johnsen already told you about
a couple of important aspects.

01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:11.590
To me, having put this system
into a productive environment,

01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:15.990
I see those points as
very, very important.

01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:19.920
The first one is, well, it's
a quick and reliable way

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:23.010
to freeze the relation of
the surface of the disc.

01:45:23.010 --> 01:45:25.650
You just shot a picture.

01:45:25.650 --> 01:45:31.560
Even if within the next few
years your disc is degradating --

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:40.000
I mean, it is getting destroyed,
you'll have that frozen image.

01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:49.140
We also have a certain depth
of field which is granted

01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:51.290
by photographing principles.

01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:55.200
We've been mentioning
that earlier on.

01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:04.080
We can also think of the picture
as some kind of an analog copy

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:10.450
of the record as it has a very,
very, very high resolution.

01:46:10.450 --> 01:46:16.740
If you look at the picture through
a magnifying glass, for example,

01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:19.910
you'll see that the
-- it is just perfect.

01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:26.010
It's like looking at the
grooves under a microscope.

01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:28.000
So it's small, cheap, and stable --

01:46:32.170 --> 01:46:36.070
-- while it's still in
the market [laughter].

01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:39.430
I'm trying to anticipate
some questions [laughter].

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:47.700
Good. There are some additional
benefits of the analog photography.

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:51.180
Of course the picture is
shot without interfering

01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.070
with the surface of the disc.

01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:56.220
There is no need to
manipulate the disc except

01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:59.410
for placing it inside
the photo camera.

01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:07.010
We can take pictures of discs
in virtually all conditions --

01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:12.690
delaminated, broken, deformed,
and they can later on be read

01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:17.820
and hopefully the sound
can be restored.

01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:22.590
Each and every disc format -- it
doesn't matter the size, the speed,

01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:25.740
the cutting [inaudible] is
read using the same equipment.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:30.350
On some cases -- well,
under some circumstances,

01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:36.490
we even try to get a picture
out of a vertical cut disc,

01:47:36.490 --> 01:47:38.930
[inaudible] disc, the
typical [inaudible] disc.

01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:46.070
I can tell you that we were
able to look at the groove even

01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:51.030
if it's just a 2D system,
a two-dimensional system.

01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:56.070
This is because the way
of the groove changes

01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:57.770
in function of the depth.

01:47:57.770 --> 01:48:01.760
So we were able to extract this
information from a 2D image.

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.420
Image processing is
well-established.

01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:10.470 position:56%
It's easy to make corrections to the
physical [inaudible] of the disc.

01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:14.790
Again, film is stable, small, cheap
for storing sound information even

01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:18.320
if it sounds strange, storing
sound on film [inaudible].

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:23.630
But this means that it
might be implemented or --

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:30.190
this is at least what we do -- as
well as a long-term storage format.

01:48:30.190 --> 01:48:39.070
So what we are doing right now, for
example, is we are taking picture

01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:42.630
of some thousands of acetate
records because it doesn't take

01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:48.970
that much time and it gives us the
possibility while storing these

01:48:48.970 --> 01:48:54.190
things in our archives
to process them later on.

01:48:54.190 --> 01:49:00.790
So we'll still have time later
on to process this image.

01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:04.690
You already saw that picture of
the first generation photo camera.

01:49:04.690 --> 01:49:05.990
It was big.

01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:09.090
It was huge, not just
big, and heavy.

01:49:09.090 --> 01:49:10.390
This is where it is right now.

01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:15.620
I guess you can't figure
out where it is.

01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:22.330
It is a sound recording
studio in South Africa.

01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:24.580
This is the way we got it there.

01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:31.060
The funny thing is that our
colleagues at the School

01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:45.480
in Engineering in Freeburg had
to cut, literally cut the frame

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:59.750
of the door of the room
where the camera was built

01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:16.040
because it couldn't get out.

01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:17.340
You can see it here.

01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:23.720
Well, you can see we had some
trouble taking the camera

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:27.620
into the studio in South Africa.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.490
Well, it survived and it's there.

01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:30.790
It's working.

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.090
Nothing's broken.

01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:39.090
It's just -- it's a simple
thing, a simple set-up.

01:50:39.090 --> 01:50:43.030
Here we'll look at the
-- as for the main parts,

01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:45.540
the third generation photo camera.

01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:49.620
I'm not showing the second
generation of the photo camera

01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:54.490
which is that one that we are using
currently at the sound archives.

01:50:54.490 --> 01:50:56.550
This is the third generation
photo camera

01:50:56.550 --> 01:51:00.390
which is being built right now.

01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:03.930
The first camera will be
delivered in a couple of weeks

01:51:03.930 --> 01:51:07.740
in a photographic lab
we've been setting

01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:12.640
up in another part of Switzerland.

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:16.690
Being the third one
has the advantages

01:51:16.690 --> 01:51:23.050
of having fixed old problems of
the first and the second one.

01:51:23.050 --> 01:51:28.320
This one can be transported,
can be just disassembled

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:33.570
and reassembled quite
easily, and it's very,

01:51:33.570 --> 01:51:37.640
very, very easy to operate.

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:45.290
Then we have a turntable scanner
which is our kind of turntable

01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:50.400
where we put the film
for reading it.

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.350
It's still the first generation.

01:51:52.350 --> 01:51:55.660
It's the only one existing.

01:51:55.660 --> 01:52:03.330
That's probably the weakest part
of the whole chain right now.

01:52:03.330 --> 01:52:08.260
So, as I said, practical
VisualAudio.

01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:10.740
The workflow.

01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:20.170
The workflow is a three-process
or three-step process.

01:52:20.170 --> 01:52:25.850
Well, there's the first step
which is the photography.

01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:33.970
Photography takes more or less 10
minutes for one side of a disc.

01:52:33.970 --> 01:52:35.890
Why does it take 10 minutes?

01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:39.990 position:56%
Because you have to position the
disc, you have to shoot the picture,

01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:42.260
and you have to develop the film.

01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:43.560
It's an analog film.

01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:45.460
You have to develop it.

01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:48.340
An automatic developing
machine takes more

01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:52.350
or less five minutes
to develop such a film.

01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:56.040 position:56%
Of course, if you have two operators

01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:01.310
in the same room you can cut the
time by two because one shoots

01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:05.000 position:56%
and the other develops, and the
other shoots and the other develops.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.930 position:56%
You can really make it much quicker.

01:53:09.930 --> 01:53:12.490
Then we have the film
scanning process.

01:53:12.490 --> 01:53:16.410
Film scanning process,
it takes, let's say,

01:53:16.410 --> 01:53:21.620
30 minutes per face, or per side.

01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:23.410
We have the film positioning.

01:53:23.410 --> 01:53:29.990
We have a ring-by-ring scanning
procedure and a merge procedure

01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:35.900
in order to acquire the whole
image of the whole surface.

01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:39.240
Finally, we have the
image processing and image

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:48.140
to central [inaudible] which can
take up to two-and-a-half hours

01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:51.640
where the groove is aligned

01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:53.770
and reconstructure [assumed
spelling] the image.

01:53:53.770 --> 01:53:58.090
It's transduced to sound
and the emphasis is applied

01:53:58.090 --> 01:54:01.710
if necessary and stuff like that.

01:54:01.710 --> 01:54:08.160
So the good thing is that the
three processes are independent.

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:12.260
I mean, of course, you can scan
a film if you have the film,

01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:15.280
but once you have the photograph

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:22.750
in your hand you can decide
whenever you want to go further on.

01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:26.810
They can be carried
out by different people

01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:29.790
in different locations
on a different schedule.

01:54:29.790 --> 01:54:34.410
The timing as for steps two
and three is just a guide and,

01:54:34.410 --> 01:54:37.810
of course, it relies very much
on the shape of the discs.

01:54:37.810 --> 01:54:41.940 position:56%
When I say half-an-hour for scanning
the film and two-and-a-half-hours

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:47.150
for extracting the sound, I mean
if you're processing records

01:54:47.150 --> 01:54:51.390
like this one, completely
delaminated,

01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:54.000
things that you cannot read
on a conventional turntable --

01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:07.040
-- because the -- from my
perspective the main, let's say,

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:11.320
target for such a system
is not to read records

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:17.470
in perfect conditions simply
because the quality is not enough.

01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:22.260
It's not good enough,
the sound quality.

01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:26.640
Now, let's get more practical.

01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.790
I have some images and
some sounds for you.

01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:35.300
First of all, we've been
talking about rings, okay.

01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:38.890
How does a ring look like?

01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:41.000
This is --

01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:49.140
-- this is in row format.

01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:54.230
It's the reason why
I have to -- okay.

01:55:54.230 --> 01:55:56.880
So this is the ring.

01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:59.000
It's a number of grooves --

01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.850
-- okay, for one rotation.

01:56:09.850 --> 01:56:14.310
So we scan a ring.

01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:15.890
Then we can the next ring.

01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:22.130
We merge the two rings together,
and so on, up to the end.

01:56:22.130 --> 01:56:31.910
This is how it looks
like just after scanning.

01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:33.210
While --

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:38.000
-- this is how it looks like --

01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:43.530
-- now I'm working with row files.

01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:46.430
That's not that easy.

01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:55.540
I don't know if you can see the
green and blue lines on the edges.

01:56:55.540 --> 01:57:02.800
So there is a green line here, a
blue line here, a green line here,

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:04.910
and another blue line here.

01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:09.210
These are the four
edges of the two whirls.

01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:13.150 position:56%
I mean the upper edge, the lower
edge, the lower edge, the upper edge

01:57:13.150 --> 01:57:20.230
of the two whirls of the groove,
and these lines are the result

01:57:20.230 --> 01:57:24.200
of the first processing
as Dr. Johnsen said.

01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:29.440
So this is the, let's say, how
we estimate where the groove is

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:36.990
and how we estimate how
the groove moves laterally.

01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:44.300
Then linking the grooves
is not that magic.

01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:46.400
You saw these pictures before.

01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:54.860 position:56%
You saw that we can apply an offset
to the image just to tell the system

01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:58.500
when you come down here you have
to continue on that one instead

01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:02.920
of just continuing straight
on because the two parts,

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:06.470
broken parts of the
record, do not match.

01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:13.000
Here you can see it a little
bit better with a wider gap.

01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:26.240
But getting some sound
is better, I hope.

01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:30.520
So I prepared a couple
of different things.

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:37.510
We didn't try the level
so I just play it now.

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:50.590
[ Static and Music ]

01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:55.240
Okay. That was read
with a turntable, hmm.

01:58:55.240 --> 01:59:00.770
by applying the emphasis
curve that is necessary

01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:05.330
for properly reading this record.

01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:14.060
If we do a one-to-one comparison
with what came out of the system

01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:18.510
when we got it from
the school, it's this.

01:59:18.510 --> 01:59:31.170
[ Static and Music ]

01:59:31.170 --> 01:59:34.930
From here I don't know.

01:59:34.930 --> 01:59:38.650
I cannot make any judgments because
I don't know if you have enough

01:59:38.650 --> 01:59:42.180
of a lower frequencies
and things like that.

01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:51.850
But the two files, or the two
sounds, are in a way similar.

01:59:51.850 --> 01:59:53.660
I'm not saying they are equal.

01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:55.490
Are in a way similar.

01:59:55.490 --> 01:59:58.860
If we take another look

01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:03.510
at a different version,
which is this one --

02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:08.860
[ Static and Music ]

02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:12.510
-- we could tell linear
extraction with a turntable.

02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:18.640
[ Static and Music ]

02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:23.510
Now the linear extraction
with the VisualAudio System.

02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:33.860
[ Music ]

02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:36.480
We have some audio
engineers here in the room

02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:43.300
and I'm quite sure they noticed
that linear doesn't mean linear

02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:48.950
when we switch from a turntable
to an optical system, so.

02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:56.220
This has different
reasons, but it has also --

02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:59.360
it sets some new challenges.

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:07.250 position:56%
If we want to go into the challenges
and start thinking scientifically,

02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:13.970
we may come up with things like why
don't we take a constant amplitude

02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:15.770
output, which is this.

02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:23.050
[ Music ]

02:01:23.050 --> 02:01:24.850
Or a constant velocity output.

02:01:24.850 --> 02:01:37.220
[ Music ]

02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:45.510
Or what happens if we just apply
an RIAA curve, the emphasis curve?

02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:54.640
[ Static and Music ]

02:01:54.640 --> 02:02:00.600
I've not -- the answer's, well,
I would have some answers for you

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:03.900
but I'm not mentioning my answers.

02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:09.620
My main concern here -- and
I saw something similar,

02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:13.980
a similar situation yesterday while
visiting the [inaudible] facility

02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:17.100
when we had a demonstration
of the --

02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:25.960
a very little demonstration of the
IRENE system -- is that when --

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:30.160
looking at those things from
a scientific point of view,

02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:32.860
we get a lot of different options.

02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:38.540
A lot of different options
which do not mean too much

02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:41.620 position:56%
to an audio engineer, or not always.

02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:48.540 position:56%
An audio engineer is used to -- take
a record, put it on a turntable,

02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:52.120
select a speed, select
the correct stylus,

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:56.810 position:56%
select the correct equalization,
and just do the copy, and that's it.

02:02:56.810 --> 02:03:04.600
The end result is absolutely
correct, is --

02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:08.800
I mean from an audio engineering
perspective, it's correct.

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:10.100
It's what you want.

02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:14.690
With this kind of approach
you have a lot

02:03:14.690 --> 02:03:18.480
of different options, as I see it.

02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:25.320 position:56%
You have the theoretical possibility
to reproduce equalization and stuff

02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:31.980 position:56%
like that as it happens in the
traditional electromechanical world.

02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:35.380
But the result you got
is not exactly the same.

02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:44.310
So, why? Let me take
you to another example.

02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:48.500
This one, different

That was done using

at the Engineering
School in Freeburg.

02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.640
This was just applying -- they
just applied a low-pass filter

02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:29.170
at 21 kilohertz here.

kilohertz low-pass filter is this.

I should say what makes me sick,

02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:10.420

that the next version is -- I'm --

[ Static, Music, and Singing ]

02:05:30.630 --> 02:05:33.390
Do you know what N.R. means?

02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:35.580
Noise Reduction.

02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:41.870
So this was supposed to be
the noise-reducted version

02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:49.780
of the previous extraction
which is not a true -- not true.

02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:58.480
Why did that happen is
because -- if I go here --

02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:00.830
you can see I have two folders.

02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:07.460
One folder is audio as I got it
originally from the scientists

02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:13.090
which not always have a
very deep knowledge in audio

02:06:13.090 --> 02:06:20.610
or maybe the knowledge, yes, but
not the feeling, the right feeling.

02:06:20.610 --> 02:06:26.460
The other version which is -- or
the other folder which is that one

02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:30.810
where the files, the
sample files reside now,

02:06:30.810 --> 02:06:39.280
is a folder with old
files, loudness normalized,

02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:44.180
or I mean not level normalized
but loudness normalized.

02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:48.960
I mean just by applying the
EBU-R128, which is the equivalent

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:54.060
of the ITU-1770 here in the States,

02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:59.300
which is what makes
the perception more

02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:04.780 position:56%
or less the same of a certain sound.

02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:12.120
So if you take the original WAV
files as I got from the school,

02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:14.080
they were just -- the noise --

02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:18.080
that one with the noise
reduction was just,

02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:22.400
had just such a lower level that
you couldn't notice the noise.

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:29.770
But you couldn't notice
the music at the same time.

02:07:29.770 --> 02:07:38.820
So we went a little bit further
trying to measure things.

02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:41.030
Oops. It was not that one.

02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:43.440
It was that one.

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:46.470
So we took a test record.

02:07:54.030 --> 02:07:56.960
We put it on a turntable.

02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:00.440
We extracted the 96 kilohertz,

thing with VisualAudio,

not saying that the system is bad.

I'm just saying that there
is still some work to do,

02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:57.000
especially if I look at --

02:09:01.110 --> 02:09:03.000
-- at the noise floor, for example.

02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:08.870
Noise floor.

02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:13.780
So this is the typical noise floor
you can measure out of a turntable.

02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:19.910
You can just forget this
little green line here.

02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:34.080
This is the same thing
when I measured the output

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:35.870

02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:40.340
This is the typical noise
floor I get out of the system

02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:44.870
without applying any corrections,
any equalization, nothing.

02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:46.300
Just linear.

02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:57.430
Mm-hmm. Of course this has
also an impact on harmonics.

02:09:57.430 --> 02:10:00.040
But somebody said harmonics
are good.

02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:02.000
Somebody said harmonics are bad.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.970
But we are used to harmonics

02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:12.840
so when you play an instrument you
never get a pure sinus out of it.

02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:18.550
You get the main sound
or the main tone,

02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:22.590
and you get a lot of
harmonics out of it.

02:10:22.590 --> 02:10:24.720
So if we consider harmonics --

02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:32.990
I'll go back to that one and
switch back to the one kilohertz.

-- we get all that noise.

I'm talking as an audio engineer.

02:11:43.710 --> 02:11:46.990
My very first background
is as an audio engineer.

02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:52.040
I've been working in that field for
more than 30 years doing recordings

02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:55.880
and all the stuff of things.

02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:00.160
What I see is that,
and maybe I'm wrong,

02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:06.090
but I would like that somebody in
the scientific world would be able

02:12:06.090 --> 02:12:08.230
to investigate these problems.

02:12:08.230 --> 02:12:13.660
Things that bother
me a little bit is

02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:18.410
that the current image sampling
frequency, we say it's 64

02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:26.410
or 128 kilosamples per ring
while if we think audio we talk

02:12:26.410 --> 02:12:29.680
about 44.1, 48- or 9 is six.

02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:33.680
How do these things
correlate together?

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:36.880
Do we have an impact
in the audio quality

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:40.160 position:56%
because the two things do not match?

02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:41.780
I don't know.

02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:47.350
But I would like to hear
a very solid answer,

02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:55.150
not the theoretical
answer, a very solid answer.

02:12:55.150 --> 02:12:59.690
On the image, the radial position
of the groove can be estimated

02:12:59.690 --> 02:13:02.550
by detecting the edges
of the groove.

02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:05.090
Two edges, four edges, that's fine.

02:13:05.090 --> 02:13:09.100
On a turntable it is determined
mechanically by the pivot

02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:13.800
and the inertia of the arm as well
as the stylus tracking the groove.

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:15.100
It's a different approach.

02:13:15.100 --> 02:13:17.370
It gets different results.

02:13:17.370 --> 02:13:19.630
Can we measure that?

02:13:19.630 --> 02:13:20.950
Can we compensate that?

02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:23.290
Can we replicate that?

02:13:23.290 --> 02:13:25.510
These are all the questions I have

02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:31.660
for my friends in the
scientific world.

02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:37.860
Maybe the last one is -- image
processing extracts the position

02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:39.160
and affect the amplitude

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:42.600
of the groove while a
stylus gets the velocity.

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:47.590
That was very well
described by Carl Haber.

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:53.870
Is the derivative, which is the
signal, the same for both methods?

02:13:53.870 --> 02:14:00.010
If so, can we apply the same
de-emphasis such as the RIAA

02:14:00.010 --> 02:14:02.310
or other less-known curves?

02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:03.610
I would like an answer.

02:14:03.610 --> 02:14:09.210
But not a mathematical
answer, a practical answer.

02:14:09.210 --> 02:14:12.010
Something that I can
measure or, even better,

02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:13.310
something that I can hear.

02:14:17.170 --> 02:14:20.140 position:56%
Oh, there's another little question.

02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:25.680
Is maybe IRENE suitable for
processing our analog pictures?

02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:31.350
I was dreaming the other day of
putting my film on an IRENE system

02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:38.010
and being capable to read
it using their algorhythms.

02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:41.970
What I mean by that is --

02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:48.060
-- image or sound processing

02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:54.150
by imaging is a very niche
mark, a very tiny market.

02:14:54.150 --> 02:15:01.190
To my opinion it really makes sense
if we could just merge the efforts

02:15:01.190 --> 02:15:05.980
and to merge the knowledge
and in order to get something,

02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:12.090
maybe just one system or two
systems that really take advantage

02:15:12.090 --> 02:15:19.180
of all the beauties of the
[inaudible] developed so far.

02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:22.670
Therefore, I'm still dreaming.

02:15:22.670 --> 02:15:24.420
I'm dreaming a lot.

02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:28.550
But sometimes I also
get to the point.

02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:35.080
I'm dreaming of setting up some
sort of a center of excellence.

02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:39.450
For example, in Switzerland,
having the two systems,

02:15:39.450 --> 02:15:41.750
IRENE and VisualAudio,
sitting together

02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:49.030
and somebody every day using the
two systems and other people coming

02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:54.200
in to do some more research
and development in order to try

02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:56.570
to achieve better results.

02:15:56.570 --> 02:16:05.200
So I hope that will come true
sometimes, but, well -- Good.

02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:06.500

Stefano, to address the
last point that you made,

02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:17.250
there will be a proposal made --

02:17:17.250 --> 02:17:21.290
there's a group of scientists that
are having a conference in Padua,

02:17:21.290 --> 02:17:25.770

proposal will address the issue

02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:28.940
of trying to bring together
the scientific communities

02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:32.740
and taking advantage of the fact
that we don't always have to be

02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:37.640
in Washington or Berlin or San
Francisco, but to take advantage

02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:41.090
of the technology that
exists in a virtual sense.

02:17:41.090 --> 02:17:45.230
Why can't there be global exchange
of information using something

as simple as Skype, and how you
integrate the different communities

02:17:49.470 --> 02:17:50.770
in that manner.

02:17:50.770 --> 02:17:54.910
For example, in a university
environment you may have an archive

02:17:54.910 --> 02:17:58.080
and the archive is a
certain amount of expertise,

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:01.880

as your example proves,

02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:05.310
how do you leverage your
needs with the expertise

in an archive and find out, gee,

02:18:11.670 --> 02:18:14.170
I'd like to work with
the Swiss archive

02:18:14.170 --> 02:18:17.100
and use social media
in that technology.

02:18:17.100 --> 02:18:22.200 position:56%
I think you could facilitate exactly
what you're asking for tremendously.

02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:23.950
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
Yeah, thank you very much for that.

02:18:23.950 --> 02:18:29.240
I think this is a good
approach, yeah, yeah.

02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:32.010
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Jenny Doctor from
the Balfour Audio Archive

02:18:32.010 --> 02:18:33.900
at Syracuse University.

02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:36.530
I just want to say I think you're
asking really good question,

02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:39.440
and I really like the fact
that you're saying that we need

02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:44.100
to use the audio engineer
expertise in conjunction

02:18:44.100 --> 02:18:50.780
with the scientific genius that
has been bringing together --

02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:54.700
sorry, I was using the
genius a word kind of a --

02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:59.170
but the point is that there's
been a huge amount of approach

02:18:59.170 --> 02:19:03.500
that has come from the
scientific side and I think

02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:08.100
that there are decades' worth
of expertise that does come

02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:10.980
from the audio engineer
side that has to do

02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:15.650
with how the stylus does
fit in the groove, how --

02:19:15.650 --> 02:19:20.130
whether you do go right down to
the bottom of the groove or not,

02:19:20.130 --> 02:19:23.930
whether some of the noise may
be coming from that issue,

02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:28.100
and whether maybe the edges
-- I don't know enough.

02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:29.400
I'm not a technician.

02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:31.820
But I wonder if some
of the noise problem is

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:36.630 position:56%
because it is targeting the bottom
of the groove and that is a problem.

02:19:36.630 --> 02:19:39.750
So I hand that over to
some of the audio engineers

02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:41.280
who can answer that more.

02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:45.820
But I know that that when we
were talking to the engineer

02:19:45.820 --> 02:19:52.310
at Syracuse University who
was doing the laser project

02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:57.950 position:56%
that Carl mentioned earlier, and he,
for the first time, 10 years later,

02:19:57.950 --> 02:20:02.440
talked to our audio engineer
about why that project failed.

02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:06.150
He hadn't never realized that he
should not be directing the laser

02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:07.550
at the bottom of the groove.

02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:13.330
He should have actually been
directing it to the wall higher up.

02:20:13.330 --> 02:20:15.370
So that was a huge
revelation to him.

02:20:15.370 --> 02:20:19.150 position:56%
But he hadn't bothered to talk to
the audio engineer to find that out.

02:20:19.150 --> 02:20:24.340
So I just -- I don't know about
why some of the noise is coming in,

02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:29.400
but I do wonder if maybe -- if the
edges going right to the bottom

02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:32.220
of the groove, if it
was slightly higher up,

02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:34.450
I don't know if you
would get better results.

02:20:34.450 --> 02:20:35.750
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Well,

02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:37.050
in our case it's a
little bit different

02:20:37.050 --> 02:20:39.620
because we are not just
measuring what happens

02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:42.580
at the bottom of the groove.

02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:49.910
As I mentioned, we are trying to
figure out, or to set an average

02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:52.220
between different reference points.

02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:56.680
But the different reference points
are either the top or the bottom,

02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:02.100
never in the middle, while,
when you use a stylus,

02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:05.000
you read up on the groove.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.890
It's never going to be on
the top or on the bottom.

02:21:08.890 --> 02:21:11.740
That's probably one of
the major issues, yeah.

02:21:11.740 --> 02:21:13.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that [inaudible].

02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:14.340
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Yeah.

02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:19.220
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So,
Stefano, you put up a bunch

02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:23.050
of questions just before
your last slide,

02:21:23.050 --> 02:21:26.380
and I was thinking maybe we
could try to address some

02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:28.290
of those questions since
they were questions.

02:21:28.290 --> 02:21:29.590
Is that okay?

02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:30.890
&gt;&gt; Sure.

02:21:30.890 --> 02:21:32.190
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So some way
we could put them back up?

02:21:32.190 --> 02:21:34.000
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:21:43.130 --> 02:21:44.430
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

02:21:44.430 --> 02:21:48.230
So let me turn this mic
and see if [inaudible].

02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:49.530
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Okay.

02:21:49.530 --> 02:21:51.460
So we can see it [inaudible].

02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:52.760
&gt;&gt; It's all [inaudible].

02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:54.060
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:56.030
So one of your questions was

02:21:56.030 --> 02:22:04.400
that the current image sampling
frequency is some tens of thousands

02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:07.810
through hundreds of
thousands of samples per ring,

02:22:07.810 --> 02:22:13.010
while standard audio sampling
frequencies are 96, 48, whatever.

02:22:13.010 --> 02:22:16.160
How do the different
figures correlate

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:19.420
and what is the impact
on the audio quality?

02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:23.180
So, I would like to
say, I think the answer

02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:26.170
to that question is
very straightforward.

02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:27.780
You have a disc.

02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:30.870
Let's say it's 78 rpm.

02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:37.940
That means it takes some .7 seconds
approximately to go around once.

02:22:37.940 --> 02:22:42.720
If you take a certain number of
optical samples around the disc

02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:46.720 position:56%
by a simple ratio involving that .7,

02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:51.240
it translates into the
equivalent audio sampling.

02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:55.570
So I happen to remember in
my head that for a 78 rpm

02:22:55.570 --> 02:23:01.990
if you take 80,000 optical
samples that is 104 kilohertz.

02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:05.860
So every single number
exactly correlates

02:23:05.860 --> 02:23:09.390
to an equivalent audio sampling.

02:23:09.390 --> 02:23:14.110
So 96 kilohertz would
correspond to something less than,

02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:17.230
a little bit less than
80,000 for a 78.

02:23:17.230 --> 02:23:19.400
If it's a 45, it's going
to be a different thing.

02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:24.130
But there's a completely
well-defined clear correlation.

02:23:24.130 --> 02:23:27.530
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
Yeah, but my question is maybe more

02:23:27.530 --> 02:23:37.840
to him, is why while reading
the image these two numbers do

02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:39.140
not match?

02:23:39.140 --> 02:23:45.330 position:56%
I mean, the reading or the
producing of the, let's say, images,

02:23:45.330 --> 02:23:51.130
image samples or just straight
lines, is not the same number

02:23:51.130 --> 02:23:54.520
as the final number
of audio samples.

02:23:54.520 --> 02:24:00.920
I mean, for one second, for
example, for one second of audio

02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:06.410
with the VisualAudio System, you
will not take 96,000 pictures.

02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:08.300
You will take 120,000 --

02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:09.600
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Right.

02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:10.900
But that's because --

02:24:10.900 --> 02:24:12.200
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
-- or 80,000.

02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:13.500
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: But that's because
the record is, for example, at 78.

02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:16.940
Suppose the record
was at 60 rpm, okay?

02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:19.560
Then it would be one
second per revolution.

02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:20.860
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
Mm-hmm.

02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:22.720
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Then to get
96 kilohertz audio sampling,

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.830
you would take 96,000 pictures.

02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:26.130
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Yeah.

02:24:26.130 --> 02:24:29.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: But because you're
at 78, it's just a different number.

02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:30.880
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: No.

02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:34.310
But if you change the rotation
speed, it doesn't matter.

02:24:34.310 --> 02:24:35.610
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yeah.

02:24:35.610 --> 02:24:36.910
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
Because the rotation speed

02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:40.340
of the scanner's changing
in our case.

02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:43.670
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: It just matters
when you trigger the camera.

02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:44.970
Ottar, you --

02:24:44.970 --> 02:24:46.270
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yes.

02:24:46.270 --> 02:24:50.090 position:56%
I believe it is related to the
problem of sampling rate conversion.

02:24:50.090 --> 02:24:55.540
When you have digital sound,
when you change a sampling ratio,

02:24:55.540 --> 02:25:00.090
you have to do a mathematically
operation,

02:25:00.090 --> 02:25:02.500
and were it were done first was

02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:09.170
when converting 44.1 kilohertz
sound record sampling frequency

02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:13.030
to 48 kilohertz sampling frequency.

02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:14.330
An example.

02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:17.530
I'm going from 44.1 to 48,

02:25:17.530 --> 02:25:24.090
is that if you do it professionally
you can't hear any difference

02:25:24.090 --> 02:25:31.690
of the record at 44.1 compared to
48 kilohertz sampling frequency.

02:25:31.690 --> 02:25:35.820
As long as it is the right
way that you have no problem

02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:38.050
with sampling [inaudible].

02:25:38.050 --> 02:25:43.320
In my opinion, that is
also the case when you look

02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.540
at the VisualAudio System or IRENE.

02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:49.770
We have a sample rate conversion

02:25:49.770 --> 02:25:55.500
and sampling rate conversion
is nearly perfect.

02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:57.950
You can get as perfect as you want.

02:25:57.950 --> 02:26:03.930
Simply you have to increase the
length of your digital filter

02:26:03.930 --> 02:26:07.190
that does the sampling
rate conversion.

02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:11.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: But you can run any
of these systems if you want exactly

02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:14.400
at the sampling rate so you
don't have to do any conversion.

02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:20.280
You could choose to digitize
96,000 native, or you could choose,

02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:25.220
for various historical purposes,
IRENE runs at 104 kilohertz,

02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:31.670 position:56%
and then we, if we want, we can
down-sample to 96 or to 48 or to 41.

02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:37.460 position:56%
But you could set it up to digitize
exactly at the audio if you want to.

02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:38.890
I'm sure you can do this.

02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:40.960
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: I
wish we could with VisualAudio.

02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:42.260
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:43.610
But there's no fundamental
reason why you can't.

02:26:43.610 --> 02:26:45.710
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Beside we
have phase lock [inaudible] --

02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:47.010
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

02:26:47.010 --> 02:26:48.310
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: -- and
[inaudible] making it difficult.

02:26:48.310 --> 02:26:49.610
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: But you could do it.

02:26:49.610 --> 02:26:51.810
Okay. So, let's go to
the second question.

02:26:51.810 --> 02:26:55.510
Okay. So on an image,
the radial position

02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:59.780
of the groove can be estimated by
detecting the edges of the groove

02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:01.220
on some number of points.

02:27:01.220 --> 02:27:04.390
On the turntable it is determined
mechanically by the pivot

02:27:04.390 --> 02:27:08.810
and the inertia of the arm as
well as the stylus tracking.

02:27:08.810 --> 02:27:10.110
So where's the question?

02:27:10.110 --> 02:27:11.410
You --

02:27:11.410 --> 02:27:14.480
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
It's not really a question.

02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:18.050
It's just a [inaudible] two
different ways to determine

02:27:18.050 --> 02:27:24.760
where your groove is and how it
moves from one way to the other.

02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:34.120
The point is, using the optical
systems, you have no, let's say,

02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:38.960
no mechanical impact that
is, on a standard turntable,

02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:47.560
is designed to produce
a certain result.

02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:53.990
You remove that while reading
that -- while reading the image.

02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:55.290
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Right.

02:27:55.290 --> 02:27:56.590
So I think what you're saying is

02:27:56.590 --> 02:28:00.510
that the mechanical
dynamical response --

02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:04.610
I use the word dynamics in a
physics/engineering context,

02:28:04.610 --> 02:28:08.810
not in the way audio maybe
uses a dynamic range.

02:28:08.810 --> 02:28:16.480
In a physics dynamical sense,
you don't have the compliance

02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:22.420
of the mechanical components --
the tone arm, the stylus, the mass.

02:28:22.420 --> 02:28:23.720
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
Exactly.

02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:25.020
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: -- the
natural [inaudible].

02:28:25.020 --> 02:28:30.000 position:56%
So these are all parts of a physical
system which, together, conspire,

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.190 position:56%
hopefully, to give you good results.

02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:37.980
There are many examples in the
literature of problems associated,

02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:42.410
resonances and distortions that
people have worked for years

02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:48.190
and years in perfecting mechanical
playback systems to minimize.

02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:53.440
Right. Those effects are not
present in an optical scanning

02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:55.640
and VisualAudio or IRENE.

02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:59.470
All you're doing is you're
measuring the shape of the groove.

02:28:59.470 --> 02:29:04.700
Mathematically, the sound
should just be the derivative

02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:06.410
of that shape.

02:29:06.410 --> 02:29:09.230
When you take the derivative
of that data,

02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:14.070
it is a absolutely
mathematically flat infrequency.

02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:16.820
I think when you were using the
term linear transfer you mean a

02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:18.120
flat transfer.

02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:19.420
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Yeah.

02:29:19.420 --> 02:29:20.720
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: It's
a completely flat.

02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:28.030
In the ideal world the cartridge
would simply take that derivative

02:29:28.030 --> 02:29:32.290
by the fact that it's a
velocity between the magnet

02:29:32.290 --> 02:29:34.950
and the coil inside
creates the voltage

02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:38.770
that gets measured, and
that's what you get.

02:29:38.770 --> 02:29:44.240
If you want to add the flavor
or the aesthetic, if you like,

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:48.660
of a mechanical system, that's
called physical modeling,

02:29:48.660 --> 02:29:52.450
and you can develop that.

02:29:52.450 --> 02:29:55.840
But it's not there.

02:29:55.840 --> 02:29:57.810
It's not there.

02:29:57.810 --> 02:30:01.130
Then it becomes a question
of aesthetics, right?

02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:05.520
Do you want that ambiance, because
you're not going to have that.

02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:08.420
It's just going to measure
the information that's

02:30:08.420 --> 02:30:11.190
on the disc or the cylinder.

02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:12.490
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Yeah.

02:30:12.490 --> 02:30:13.820
I understand that perfectly.

02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:15.120
I understand that.

02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:16.690
This is actually my problem.

02:30:16.690 --> 02:30:22.810 position:56%
I mean, because also the -- when the
groove has been cut into the disc,

02:30:22.810 --> 02:30:26.170
it has been done with
mechanical means.

02:30:26.170 --> 02:30:27.470
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Yes.

02:30:27.470 --> 02:30:30.440
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: It
hasn't been done in an ideal world.

02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:34.450
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: But a different
mechanical system cut it --

02:30:34.450 --> 02:30:35.750
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Yeah.

02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:37.050
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: -- then
you're using to play it back.

02:30:37.050 --> 02:30:39.600
The mechanical system in
Indiana, and the mechanical system

02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:41.160
in California, and the
one in Switzerland,

02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:42.460
they could all be different.

02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:43.760
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
Mm-hmm.

02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:48.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So in some sense some
people might argue that it's good

02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:52.990
that you've removed one set of
variables from the playback process

02:30:52.990 --> 02:30:55.660
which is the mechanical response.

02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:58.540
Now you raised the
question about noise,

02:30:58.540 --> 02:31:03.440
and you very dramatically
showed these high noise levels

02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:04.740
that you're seeing.

02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:08.160
So I was thinking I would
like to address that also

02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:10.010
because I think it's
part of your question.

02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:15.620 position:56%
So when people use the term noise it
refers to a whole variety of things.

02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:18.830
So if you have sharp defects
-- click, click, click,

02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:20.890
okay -- people call that noise.

02:31:20.890 --> 02:31:24.780
If you have a very broadband
like the hiss that you

02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:28.070
so strongly showed the
[hissing sound], okay,

02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:29.910
they also refer to that as noise.

02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:33.540
But those are very different
things, and they all get stuck

02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:36.210
in the same category
and called noise.

02:31:36.210 --> 02:31:40.610
What you were dominantly
experiencing or sharing with us

02:31:40.610 --> 02:31:44.080
in the thing was this
very, very broadband noise.

02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:48.600
It was very clear when you
showed the noise spectrum

02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:52.200
that at some point around a
kilohertz or something it started

02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:56.070
to rise and it rose sort
of in a straight line,

02:31:56.070 --> 02:32:01.090
and it was much less prominent
when you, for example,

02:32:01.090 --> 02:32:04.260
in the test record, when you
played it back with a stylus

02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:08.970
than when you did with the
VisualAudio System, okay?

02:32:08.970 --> 02:32:12.810
That noise is due to a --

02:32:12.810 --> 02:32:16.360
just a structure that exists

02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:20.800
in a random way throughout
the data, okay?

02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:25.740
It can be due to perhaps
the film grain;

02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:30.030
it can be due to the
roughness of the surface;

02:32:30.030 --> 02:32:33.120
it can be due to the
region of the groove

02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:36.520
that IRENE or VisualAudio resolves.

02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:42.230
But it's a general structure
of the surface as rendered

02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:46.510
through the imaging which
gets worse and worse as you go

02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:49.420
to higher and higher frequencies.

02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:53.700
Because you're taking
a derivative you are --

02:32:53.700 --> 02:32:57.460
a derivative is a high-pass
filter so you're pushing

02:32:57.460 --> 02:33:02.840
up those high frequencies which
you should be doing, okay?

02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:08.160
But you should apply the RIAA curve

02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:12.270 position:56%
or whatever the corresponding curve
is for the older materials which is,

02:33:12.270 --> 02:33:15.930
in fact, designed as part
of the standard process

02:33:15.930 --> 02:33:19.050
to partially roll off
those high frequencies.

02:33:19.050 --> 02:33:20.350
It does it for the stylus.

02:33:20.350 --> 02:33:25.130
It does it -- and it should be
applied in these visual as well.

02:33:25.130 --> 02:33:26.430
I don't know if you
were applying it.

02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:28.010
It didn't look like
you were applying it

02:33:28.010 --> 02:33:30.000
because I would have
seen it turn over.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.700
But it definitely should be
applied because it's part

02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:34.000
of the way the record was recorded.

02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:40.670
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
Well, yes, of course.

02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:43.440
I thank you for this explanation,

02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:51.540
but it doesn't really answer my
questions because we are well aware

02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:56.930
of the fact that we have to
apply compensation curves.

02:33:56.930 --> 02:34:02.450
The problem is not there
because the compensation curve

02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:07.020
in this case removes, in our
case, removes everything.

02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:09.990
Removes the signal as well.

02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:11.640
The signal to noise ratio,

02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:15.490
especially in the higher
frequencies is that low

02:34:15.490 --> 02:34:17.570
that you can't remove the noise

02:34:17.570 --> 02:34:22.460
without removing what's
embedded into the noise.

02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:23.760
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Sure.

02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:25.490
Once it's below the noise,
if you put a curve on it,

02:34:25.490 --> 02:34:29.400
you're not getting it back.

02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:30.700
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Yeah.

02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:38.650
But the two noise floor I showed
were obtained using the same

02:34:38.650 --> 02:34:40.400
equalization curve.

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:42.690
One from the turntable and the
other one from the [inaudible].

02:34:42.690 --> 02:34:43.990
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay, okay.

02:34:43.990 --> 02:34:46.220
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
So it was already in.

02:34:46.220 --> 02:34:48.160
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:49.860
&gt;&gt; Okay. We should let
people get to lunch

02:34:49.860 --> 02:34:51.530
because we need to
be back here at 1:30.

02:34:51.530 --> 02:34:52.830
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri: Okay.

02:34:52.830 --> 02:34:54.950
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So.

02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:57.050
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

02:34:57.050 --> 02:34:58.350
&gt;&gt; Stefano Sergio Cavaglieri:
Thank you [applause].

02:34:58.350 --> 02:35:01.370
&gt;&gt; Okay. Good afternoon everybody.

02:35:01.370 --> 02:35:04.410
The first session after lunch
is always the worst one to have.

02:35:04.410 --> 02:35:07.900
That's when -- especially
if you've had a large lunch

02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:09.200 position:56%
and you're beginning to fall asleep.

02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:13.070
So I'm going to try and liven
this up a bit with some,

02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:17.920
hopefully some interesting
material for you.

02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:20.520
What I should say here
as an introduction.

02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:21.870
I'm an engineer.

02:35:21.870 --> 02:35:26.290
I've only dabbled in this
area for around five years.

02:35:26.290 --> 02:35:27.760 position:56%
The project I'm going to talk to you

02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:30.590
about here actually
concluded around 2010.

02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:34.850
I'm going to give you a bit
of an update as we go through,

02:35:34.850 --> 02:35:38.990
but it was just a piece of
work I did from my main job.

02:35:38.990 --> 02:35:41.740
So I'm a research scientist.

02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:45.700
I work primarily on structured
surfaces, on surfaces, and,

02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:49.320
of course, recordings
are structured surfaces.

02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:53.450
Structured surfaces are really a
big area of research at the moment

02:35:53.450 --> 02:35:58.920
for all kinds of things -- flights,
ships in water, everything, yeah?

02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:01.390
So this is just kind
of a side road for me.

02:36:01.390 --> 02:36:03.660
But I hope you find some of
the work we did interesting.

02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:06.510
There's a bit of a
history behind this.

02:36:06.510 --> 02:36:09.040
Let me just get my notes here.

02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:12.440
Can I have the first slide?

02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:13.850
Do I do that?

02:36:13.850 --> 02:36:16.310
Yeah, okay, all right, okay.

02:36:16.310 --> 02:36:20.230
So I'm just going to give you
an introduction and overview,

02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:23.070
and probably just focus
on the case studies.

02:36:23.070 --> 02:36:27.510
Actually, Carl here has done me
a great favor and Ottar as well.

02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:29.790
You covered most of
the technical aspects.

02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:31.640
So I'm kind of going to leave that.

02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:33.260
I've got a lot of slides here

02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:35.850
which I didn't really know
what I was going to say today,

02:36:35.850 --> 02:36:38.900
so I'm probably going to jump quite
a few of these slides and just go

02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:41.060
into the interesting stuff.

02:36:41.060 --> 02:36:44.640
I'll probably focus on some of
the recordings we looked at,

02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:47.660
particularly the Queen Victoria
and the tinfoil recording,

02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:52.050 position:56%
and maybe the Berliner disc as well,
but we'll come to those shortly.

02:36:52.050 --> 02:36:56.400
Before that I think the next one is
a video which I hope is new to you.

02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:00.960
One of my PhD students
found this on YouTube.

02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:02.260
I hope you like it.

02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:05.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So this is a one-of-a-kind piece.

02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:08.770
There's no other one like this
particular one in the world,

02:37:08.770 --> 02:37:13.620
and you can see the
tracks go this way.

02:37:13.620 --> 02:37:17.490
It's really cool because it
records much more accurately

02:37:17.490 --> 02:37:19.050
[breaking sounds].

02:37:19.050 --> 02:37:21.450
Oh, shit [laughter].

02:37:21.450 --> 02:37:23.180
Oh, my god.

02:37:23.180 --> 02:37:25.120
&gt;&gt; So that does happen
every once in a while.

02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:28.250
That can't be good.

02:37:28.250 --> 02:37:29.550
Now are you done with that?

02:37:29.550 --> 02:37:30.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm done with that.

02:37:30.850 --> 02:37:32.150
&gt;&gt; All right.

02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:34.940
Apparently we're [laughter]
really done with that one.

02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:39.770
&gt;&gt; So some of you have seen that I
guess, but if you haven't seen it,

02:37:39.770 --> 02:37:42.430
I think it's on YouTube,
and it's worth it.

02:37:42.430 --> 02:37:45.540
That's the way to damage a cylinder
recording I guess [laughter].

02:37:45.540 --> 02:37:48.990
Here's another one actually
which I'm not going to play,

02:37:48.990 --> 02:37:50.870
but Carl would probably
would be interested in this.

02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:54.630
This is the <i>Radio 4 Today </i>program.

02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:56.850
It's the most serious radio program

02:37:56.850 --> 02:37:59.300
in the U.K. It's early
in the morning.

02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:01.020 position:56%
You get presidents, prime ministers.

02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:02.630
It's really serious.

02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:08.040 position:56%
This lady here is one of the serious
people who present the program.

02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:10.850
I think about five years ago
she was giving a talk on --

02:38:10.850 --> 02:38:14.280
it was a very small slot on one
of the early sound recordings,

02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:18.200
and I think it was one
of the [inaudible] ones,

02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:22.150
and she gave the one-minute
slot on this piece of news

02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:24.740
that somebody had managed
to decode this recording

02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:27.950
from 1850 or something.

02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:29.920
The guy in the headphones said,

02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:32.830
"It sounds like a bee
in a bottle," yeah?

02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:34.740
She burst into laughter.

02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:36.460
She then could not stop laughing.

02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:40.160
She had a giggle fit which
actually went on to the next part

02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:42.600
of the program which
was an obituary.

02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:46.900
So she's reading an obituary of
some famous person who passed away,

02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:49.150
laughing as a result of this.

02:38:49.150 --> 02:38:50.470
So if you want to find it.

02:38:50.470 --> 02:38:51.990
Carl, you'll probably be
-- would be interested

02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:53.290
in hearing that [inaudible].

02:38:53.290 --> 02:38:54.590
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: I've heard it.

02:38:54.590 --> 02:38:55.890
&gt;&gt; Oh, you heard it.

02:38:55.890 --> 02:38:57.190
It's good.

02:38:57.190 --> 02:39:00.500
Okay. I'll come back to
more technical subjects.

02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:03.100
So probably I can miss this.

02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:07.400 position:56%
This is really just saying that what
we're trying to do with this piece

02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:09.920
of research is not
real-time playback.

02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:15.220
This slide was for general audience
so I'm going to skip most of this.

02:39:15.220 --> 02:39:19.920
It really describes what Carl
said in the first presentation.

02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:22.000
Let's just move on.

02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:30.970
Okay. I'll jump this one.

02:39:30.970 --> 02:39:36.550
There is a website which we still
have active, actually, which,

02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:39.380
if you get the slides later on, we
should be able to log onto this.

02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:42.460
All of the material that I'm
going to show you is actually

02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:45.090
on this website so you can look
at this in your own measure.

02:39:45.090 --> 02:39:48.150
I think the key thing is
archivesound, one word.

02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:52.390
If you Google that you
should come to this website.

02:39:52.390 --> 02:39:55.850
Okay. Let's move on.

02:39:55.850 --> 02:40:00.050
So, as part of the project, we
published quite a few publications.

02:40:00.050 --> 02:40:03.880
These are primarily in the
scientific literature domain.

02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:06.720
So those of you who are maybe
engineers or scientists,

02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:09.130
a lot of this work
is easily available.

02:40:09.130 --> 02:40:10.580
It's downloadable.

02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:13.300
So a lot of the technical
content is published.

02:40:13.300 --> 02:40:16.420 position:56%
I won't bore you with the details of
these but I'll maybe make reference

02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:18.000
to a couple of these
papers as we go along.

02:40:22.350 --> 02:40:23.650
All right.

02:40:23.650 --> 02:40:24.950
You've seen this.

02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:26.250
This is the measurement method.

02:40:26.250 --> 02:40:28.220
Carl explained this
earlier this morning.

02:40:28.220 --> 02:40:32.510
I'll probably say a few words
about some of our systems.

02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:35.510
This particular system
is very similar, I guess,

02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:39.140
to what you call IRENE, which is a
white light sensor with a cylinder.

02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:40.540
This has got a cylinder on here.

02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:41.920
I can't see it very
well on the screen here.

02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:44.310
I hope you can see
it on your screens.

02:40:44.310 --> 02:40:46.290
There's a cylinder
here being scanned.

02:40:46.290 --> 02:40:50.650
These are really important
so X is a long cylinder.

02:40:50.650 --> 02:40:53.610
Obviously theta is the
rotation of the cylinder.

02:40:53.610 --> 02:40:57.230
And zed is the height position,
so we're actually measuring

02:40:57.230 --> 02:40:59.590
as we scan along the
length of the cylinder here,

02:40:59.590 --> 02:41:03.490
we're measuring the zed
height, Z, sorry, Z heights,

02:41:03.490 --> 02:41:09.350
as a function of X. Then you rotate
and then you do the next scan.

02:41:09.350 --> 02:41:11.860
From that you essentially are
creating a three-dimensional

02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:14.470
representation of the object.

02:41:14.470 --> 02:41:18.350
Let's just move on.

02:41:18.350 --> 02:41:21.500
Another system -- I'll have
a movie of this system later.

02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:24.060
This is a flatbed scanner.

02:41:24.060 --> 02:41:27.540
It's an air bearing which is
a high-end piece of equipment

02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:31.440
for actually manufacturing
silicon wafers.

02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:33.990
But what we do with this
is you can see on here.

02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:37.570
Probably this is a 78
I guess with a laser.

02:41:37.570 --> 02:41:39.490
Again you've got the
theta, the rotation.

02:41:39.490 --> 02:41:44.890
X and Y now you've got Cartesian
coordinates with a Z height.

02:41:44.890 --> 02:41:46.190
Okay?

02:41:48.250 --> 02:41:51.470
I'm just going to pick up on a
few of the aspects which we kind

02:41:51.470 --> 02:41:59.290
of discussed a few times from
the presentations this morning.

02:41:59.290 --> 02:42:01.680
Something about resolution.

02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:03.640
Maybe resolution is the
main one we should focus

02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:07.140
on because this is taken
from one of our papers.

02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:08.590
The reference is there.

02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:10.960 position:56%
I hope you find this is interesting.

02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:15.070
This graph is essentially
the physical displacement

02:42:15.070 --> 02:42:20.170
of a cylinder surface
measured in nanometers, okay,

02:42:20.170 --> 02:42:23.320
against the frequency
response of a spoken word.

02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:30.350
Now if you talk to people who
are experts on spoken word,

02:42:30.350 --> 02:42:33.280
the harmonics -- here you
got the main sound here

02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:35.980
which is around 600 hertz.

02:42:35.980 --> 02:42:37.360
These are harmonics, the peaks

02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:39.480
that are come afterwards,
so the harmonics.

02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:43.910
Here you see a harmonic
around, what, 3000 kilohertz?

02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:49.140 position:56%
If you look at the amplitude of this
harmonic it's around 50 nanometers.

02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:52.630
Now this is a recording
from the early 1900s.

02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:54.590
It was a cylinder recording.

02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:57.510
What we've determined from this
is that actually, if you're going

02:42:57.510 --> 02:43:03.620
to measure these surfaces and get a
good audio record from the surface,

02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:07.670
you really need to be measuring
to this type of resolution.

02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:09.700
So we published this.

02:43:09.700 --> 02:43:14.790
I think, 500 nanometers
was the value

02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:17.240
that we suggested from this work.

02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:19.520
It's to do with the
spoken word and the way

02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:22.970
in which the ear interprets
the spoken word

02:43:22.970 --> 02:43:26.400
that these high frequencies, these
harmonics, are really important.

02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:30.620
Let's move on.

02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:35.510
One of the other issues we haven't
seen mentioned this morning is the

02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:38.500
optical sensors that
we use are not perfect.

02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:42.310
In fact, they have
some major limitations,

02:43:42.310 --> 02:43:46.560
and one of the limitations is
demonstrated very easily here

02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:52.890 position:56%
from a 78 disc where as we saw again
this morning the side wall here is

02:43:52.890 --> 02:43:54.740
like 45 degrees.

02:43:54.740 --> 02:43:57.540
Actually, it's very
difficult to get light back

02:43:57.540 --> 02:43:59.800
from a surface that steep.

02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:01.890
What you see is you get a lot

02:44:01.890 --> 02:44:03.900
of [inaudible] basically
on the side walls.

02:44:03.900 --> 02:44:09.440
Now, from what Ottar
presented in his presentation,

02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:12.120
this probably isn't that
important because actually

02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:15.960
if you can detect the edge
you can get the sound actually

02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:19.560
from these edge points and
also from these points here.

02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:21.450
We have an example of that later.

02:44:21.450 --> 02:44:24.270
I'm going to jump this.

02:44:24.270 --> 02:44:26.730
This is a signal extraction.

02:44:26.730 --> 02:44:29.760
This is really a whole
area in itself.

02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:34.650
I could talk to you for an hour
just on this, how you do this.

02:44:34.650 --> 02:44:38.060
In the simple sense it's
actually what we said all along,

02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:42.330 position:56%
all the way through this conference.

02:44:42.330 --> 02:44:44.520
Basically, you're getting a
three-dimensional representation

02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:45.820
of the surface.

02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:48.070
Then the secret is
to find the groove,

02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:52.070
and there are many,
many ways of doing that.

02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:57.130
You're really entering the realm
of signal processing and anybody

02:44:57.130 --> 02:45:00.290
who knows anything about signal
processing, it's endless,

02:45:00.290 --> 02:45:02.600
the possibilities are you can use.

02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:07.400
The one that we tended to
focus on is one particular.

02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:11.870
So the dark line on here is a cross
section of a groove structure.

02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:14.270
I think you can see
it's damaged, yeah?

02:45:14.270 --> 02:45:18.720
The bottom of the groove here
has quite a strange base.

02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:20.020
It's not curved.

02:45:20.020 --> 02:45:23.640
You can see if you just try
to find the minimum points

02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:26.540
as a representation
of the sound on this,

02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:29.640
the minimum point is
actually going to be noise.

02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:32.130
It's actually a damage
to the surface.

02:45:32.130 --> 02:45:34.850
So, actually, what we were
doing here was putting a filter,

02:45:34.850 --> 02:45:36.960
a particular filter, to the surface

02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:38.900
and getting the minimum
points of the filter.

02:45:38.900 --> 02:45:43.200
Again, there are endless filters
that you could use for doing this,

02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:45.970
but having got -- the key thing
is you have the raw data here,

02:45:45.970 --> 02:45:50.000
the solid line, is accurately
as you can get the data.

02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:57.390 position:56%
Okay. So that's really all I'm going
to say about the technical aspects.

02:45:57.390 --> 02:46:00.620
I could talk -- as I said, if
you have any questions I can go

02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:02.500
into all the details if you want.

02:46:02.500 --> 02:46:04.760
What I'd like to do is
just focus on some of these

02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:06.750
which I hope you find interesting.

02:46:06.750 --> 02:46:12.100 position:56%
I'm going to jump the first one and
not bother with that, and just focus

02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:14.040
on -- There's lots of cylinders

02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:16.700
that we've scanned as
part of this project.

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.630
They're all available on
the website so if you want

02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:19.930
to listen to them you can.

02:46:19.930 --> 02:46:25.520 position:56%
"Just Before the Battle, Mother" is,
I think, the first one we did, Carl.

02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:27.790
That was a collaboration
with Carl Haber

02:46:27.790 --> 02:46:30.060
and with Bill, the
cylinder supplied.

02:46:30.060 --> 02:46:34.240
So that was -- we did that probably
2005 I guess, something like that.

02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:36.000
So there are lots of
other examples on here.

02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:41.030
Now this is quite interesting.

02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:42.820
We saw this partly this morning.

02:46:42.820 --> 02:46:47.530
We actually found an
unusual character

02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:50.420 position:56%
in the U.K. who made test cylinders.

02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:53.990
This is one of the
cylinders that he made for us.

02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:59.330
So these have fixed frequency
sounds embedded in the grooves

02:46:59.330 --> 02:47:03.460
so that we could do a way
of testing the quality

02:47:03.460 --> 02:47:06.680
of our sound reproduction
from these scanning methods.

02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:09.380
I think you can just
about see that if you look

02:47:09.380 --> 02:47:10.770
across the cylinder here.

02:47:10.770 --> 02:47:12.070
You can probably just visually see.

02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:16.150
I haven't got it very clearly
on this monitor but -- yeah.

02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:19.170
But on here I think you can just
about see the different regions.

02:47:19.170 --> 02:47:23.480
Then we've scanned the cylinder
and what I'm going to show you.

02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:27.750
This just jumps over -- here's a
groove structure from the cylinder.

02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:29.050
Let's just jump on.

02:47:29.050 --> 02:47:30.350
This is just some of the same.

02:47:30.350 --> 02:47:31.660
So I'll just take one example here.

02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:36.860
If we look at the one -- we'll
just do one kilohertz, yeah?

02:47:36.860 --> 02:47:38.160
I'll play the stylus first.

02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:42.190
So this is a stylus playback
of the cylinder we had made.

02:47:42.190 --> 02:47:44.510
Oop. Let's try that again.

02:47:44.510 --> 02:47:48.950
[ High-Pitched Sound ]

02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:50.400
What do you hear?

02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:51.700
Can you hear a single frequency?

02:47:51.700 --> 02:47:53.000
&gt;&gt; It's modulating.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:54.300
&gt;&gt; It's modulating.

02:47:54.300 --> 02:47:55.600
Yeah. There's some variation.

02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:57.210
Let's listen to the optical.

02:47:57.210 --> 02:47:59.660
The same frequency.

02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:03.510
I'm sorry there.

02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:06.040
[ High-Pitched Sound ]

02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:10.340
We've written a paper on this.

02:48:10.340 --> 02:48:13.000
So one of the publications
-- I think it's <i>JASA,</i>

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:18.020
<i>the Journal of the American
Acoustical Society </i>.

02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:20.190
It's one of the top acoustic
journals in the work.

02:48:20.190 --> 02:48:21.990
There's a paper published
on this work.

02:48:21.990 --> 02:48:26.760
So we created the artifact so
that we could test the quality

02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:28.540
of the methods that we were using,

02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:33.230
and actually from this work we
actually determined some quality

02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:38.160
parameters that you could
use in actually in going back

02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:39.830
to the measurement and the way

02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:43.250
in which we process the
surfaces afterwards.

02:48:43.250 --> 02:48:51.500
Now I could go through all
of these but let's just jump

02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:52.800
on [high-pitched sounds].

02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:54.100
Oh, sorry [laughter].

02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:58.300
Okay. So these are frequency
analysis diagrams of the same data.

02:48:58.300 --> 02:49:01.480
If you aren't used to seeing this
type of stuff, this is the one

02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:02.780
that we've just been looking at.

02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:05.430
I think the one kilohertz
around here.

02:49:05.430 --> 02:49:07.120
So you've got the stylus scan.

02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:11.670 position:56%
So this frequency here, where the
arrow is pointing, is one kilohertz.

02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:14.950
Then you got the harmonics which
is probably the same variation

02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:16.320
that you were hearing.

02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:19.290 position:56%
If you compare that to the
optical, there's more noise on here.

02:49:19.290 --> 02:49:22.510
You can see slightly more noise,

02:49:22.510 --> 02:49:27.220
but the primary sinusoidal
signal is well-represented here.

02:49:27.220 --> 02:49:29.070
As I said, you could
read the technical papers

02:49:29.070 --> 02:49:31.870
on these if you want.

02:49:31.870 --> 02:49:34.520
This is one that is
really interesting.

02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:37.510
I have quite a few
slides on this one.

02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:41.920
So this was scanned -- I hope you
can imagine Queen Victoria's quite

02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:43.570
an important character.

02:49:43.570 --> 02:49:46.260 position:56%
It is for the British [laughter] so.

02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:54.520
There was a book, I think, written
around the recording of her voice.

02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:57.010
But at the time it
wasn't sure if it was a --

02:49:57.010 --> 02:49:58.870
it hadn't been authenticated.

02:49:58.870 --> 02:50:01.110
I'm going to show you
some evidence later

02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:04.390
about the authenticity of this.

02:50:04.390 --> 02:50:10.770
So this scanned at the Science
Museum in London back in 2005.

02:50:10.770 --> 02:50:13.380
I just really want to focus on
-- oh, there's the cylinder.

02:50:13.380 --> 02:50:15.330
This is a Graphophone cylinder.

02:50:15.330 --> 02:50:18.110
I think you can see three bands.

02:50:18.110 --> 02:50:25.300
One here on the left, one in the
middle, one on the far right.

02:50:25.300 --> 02:50:27.640
I hope you can see from here -- I
don't have it very clearly on here,

02:50:27.640 --> 02:50:29.480
but I know the slide pretty well.

02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:31.390
You can see the groove structure.

02:50:31.390 --> 02:50:37.730
Yeah. What you can also see is
this artifact on the top here.

02:50:37.730 --> 02:50:39.650
You can guess what that is.

02:50:39.650 --> 02:50:41.650
That's a stylus, yeah?

02:50:41.650 --> 02:50:43.770
So, essentially, what
has happened --

02:50:43.770 --> 02:50:47.170
this artifact has obviously been
deemed to have been important.

02:50:47.170 --> 02:50:51.340
It was in the vault of the
Science Museum in a huge safe.

02:50:51.340 --> 02:50:56.810
I think probably at some stage
in its history had been played,

02:50:56.810 --> 02:50:59.890
probably played with the wrong
stylus, with the wrong force.

02:50:59.890 --> 02:51:03.330
What it has done is
essentially damaged the bottom

02:51:03.330 --> 02:51:08.800
of the groove here -- though that
was our interpretation of that.

02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:10.150
Okay. Let's just move on.

02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:12.240
Let's see the consequence of that.

02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:13.540
Well, this is the consequence,
really.

02:51:13.540 --> 02:51:15.950
So this is a cross-section
from the data.

02:51:15.950 --> 02:51:17.940
This would be the top
surface here of the cylinder.

02:51:17.940 --> 02:51:20.200
These are the grooves.

02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:25.310
You can see -- I think
what you can see here.

02:51:25.310 --> 02:51:27.780
This may have been done in
the distant past, in fact,

02:51:27.780 --> 02:51:29.210
because it looks like a piece

02:51:29.210 --> 02:51:32.790
of wire has been used
to try to play this.

02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:36.890
I think, Bill, you were
saying that wire, piano wire,

02:51:36.890 --> 02:51:39.230
was one of the early
styluses that was --

02:51:39.230 --> 02:51:40.530
&gt;&gt; Steel wire.

02:51:40.530 --> 02:51:41.830
&gt;&gt; Steel wire.

02:51:41.830 --> 02:51:43.130
&gt;&gt; Steel chisels [inaudible].

02:51:43.130 --> 02:51:44.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah? You can see what this is.

02:51:44.430 --> 02:51:46.060
You see this repeated shape on the
bottom of the grooves essentially

02:51:46.060 --> 02:51:49.110
like a piece of wire
that's been cut.

02:51:49.110 --> 02:51:51.900
What that's done is it's
essentially removed, of course,

02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:55.440
some of the key content
of the material here.

02:51:55.440 --> 02:51:58.350
But that's one of the great things

02:51:58.350 --> 02:52:01.190
about doing three-dimensional
scanning.

02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:06.410
If you look at the -- yeah,
it's a virtual stylus.

02:52:06.410 --> 02:52:07.890
That's what's been removed.

02:52:07.890 --> 02:52:12.830 position:56%
But if you look to the left and
right of that -- let's just go back.

02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:14.780
Okay. This should be
-- okay, here you go.

02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:16.080
So you got the left-hand side,

02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:18.490
the right-hand side,
stylus in the middle.

02:52:18.490 --> 02:52:23.680 position:56%
But you got this whole region to the
left and right of the virtual stylus

02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:27.910
which is essentially where the
sound would have been carried.

02:52:27.910 --> 02:52:31.290
Because this is all in the digital
domain, we've scanned the surface.

02:52:31.290 --> 02:52:36.740
We can then actually just use --
decide where we run the tracking

02:52:36.740 --> 02:52:39.050
for this to get the
sound from the groove.

02:52:39.050 --> 02:52:43.040
It was quite damaged so we don't --
we're not going to hear anything.

02:52:43.040 --> 02:52:46.140
But you'll hear -- I'll play
you something and you can judge.

02:52:46.140 --> 02:52:50.350
So this is pretty much what
we saw this morning as well.

02:52:50.350 --> 02:52:55.680
We were using -- if you want a
binary indication of the surface.

02:52:55.680 --> 02:52:59.000
So the red is the left side;
the right is the blue side.

02:53:03.040 --> 02:53:07.370
There's the green is
the track of the stylus.

02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:10.360
Then all we're going to do is we're
going to move that to the left

02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:13.910
and just track to the left.

02:53:13.910 --> 02:53:15.210
Okay. So let's listen to something.

02:53:15.210 --> 02:53:16.660
I'll actually go straight
to the end.

02:53:16.660 --> 02:53:18.390
I won't go into the
complexities of this, but.

02:53:18.390 --> 02:53:23.520
I've kind of kept this secret.

02:53:23.520 --> 02:53:27.810
I played it a few times in the
U.K. at some archive conferences.

02:53:27.810 --> 02:53:30.260 position:56%
But we've never released this, so --

02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:36.930 position:56%
and it's certainly never been
played outside of the U.K. Let me --

02:53:36.930 --> 02:53:39.510
listen to it first and
then we'll go to the words.

02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:56.810
[ Static and Inaudible Speakers ]

02:53:56.810 --> 02:53:59.810
Okay. So what we're trying

02:53:59.810 --> 02:54:03.860
to do here is just interpret
what we think is being said.

02:54:03.860 --> 02:54:06.250
So, "greetings" is
quite clearly stated.

02:54:06.250 --> 02:54:11.200
We can hear spoken word but we
can't hear what's being said.

02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:13.910
The answer is very
clear, and it's said

02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:16.540
with a very high-class
British accent.

02:54:16.540 --> 02:54:18.720
"Can be" is also clear.

02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:20.020
This we're unsure of.

02:54:20.020 --> 02:54:21.510
Lord Granville, I think,
was the Prime Minister.

02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:24.340
I have to go look in
my history books.

02:54:24.340 --> 02:54:27.650
"Absolutely" is very
clear, and "has never" --

02:54:27.650 --> 02:54:29.350 position:56%
"has never forgotten" is also clear.

02:54:29.350 --> 02:54:31.510
Let's play it again.

02:54:31.510 --> 02:54:48.460
[ Static and Inaudible Speakers ]

02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:56.030
Okay? Could you --
[applause] thank you.

02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:59.400
There was some uncertainty
about who's speaking, yeah?

02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:01.520
Actually, the book
that was published

02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:04.190
on this left the question open.

02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:06.740
But then, since the
book was published,

02:55:06.740 --> 02:55:09.930
and I think that should be
my next slide -- yeah, here.

02:55:09.930 --> 02:55:12.100
This is a letter -- I wrote
to the Royal Archives.

02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:14.760
This is April, 2007.

02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:18.560
I've just highlighted part of this
text here which is the next bit.

02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:24.920
So the first bit in yellow is
referring to [inaudible] book.

02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:30.090
It's talking about a letter from
the Queen's Private Secretary,

02:55:30.090 --> 02:55:34.960
Henry Ponsonby's wife, Mary,
which came into the archive

02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:36.800
after the book had been published.

02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:40.680
Essentially this is the
key bit on the bottom here.

02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:44.320
"HM," Her Majesty, "spoke into it."

02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:48.430
So this was on the letter from
Henry Ponsonby to his wife,

02:55:48.430 --> 02:55:51.050
so we know that she
spoke into this device.

02:55:51.050 --> 02:55:53.670
I think if I, I may get
the dates wrong sometime --

02:55:53.670 --> 02:55:57.820
here we are, 29th of August, 1888.

02:55:57.820 --> 02:56:00.890 position:56%
So we know that she spoke into this.

02:56:00.890 --> 02:56:03.350
Actually she said she
didn't want to --

02:56:03.350 --> 02:56:07.920
I think what she said is she
didn't want to -- yeah, here we go.

02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:12.160
"But we told Mr. Morse he must not
go round the country producing the

02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:14.760
Queen's words" [laughter].

02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:18.610
So, very early piece of
history on sound recordings.

02:56:18.610 --> 02:56:21.580
I think, actually, the
machine was a Graphophone.

02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:24.980
It was one of the artifacts we saw

02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:27.210
in the museum yesterday,
at the Smithsonian.

02:56:27.210 --> 02:56:32.310
It was taken to the U.K. from the
U.S. and then taken to the Queen's

02:56:32.310 --> 02:56:36.480
which I think her and her
husband were keen advocates

02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:39.050
of the new technology.

02:56:39.050 --> 02:56:41.000
Okay. So a bit of history.

02:56:44.170 --> 02:56:47.330
This is another particular
piece of history if you're Welsh

02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:49.340
or if you got Welsh ancestry.

02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:50.640
I don't know who this person was.

02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:52.700 position:56%
I have to go back and remind myself.

02:56:52.700 --> 02:56:56.320
But this came from the
Welsh National Archives,

02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:02.820
and essentially this was Edmond
Roberts who was a preacher, 1905.

02:57:02.820 --> 02:57:06.100
But the artifact had been broken
so it wasn't the one that was

02:57:06.100 --> 02:57:07.550
in the movie that we
saw at the beginning.

02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:14.570 position:56%
But this is the casing that held the
artifacts of the broken cylinder.

02:57:14.570 --> 02:57:17.860
This was held in the museum
in Cardiff I guess, in Wales.

02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:24.940
It was sent to a dentistry
expert in Los Angeles

02:57:24.940 --> 02:57:27.290 position:56%
who did restorative dentistry, yeah?

02:57:27.290 --> 02:57:29.150
This is what came back.

02:57:29.150 --> 02:57:30.900
This is before we got involved.

02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:33.110
So this is actually what
we were presented with.

02:57:33.110 --> 02:57:34.660
Again, I can't see this
very clear on here,

02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:36.600
but I know the image pretty well.

02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:42.320 position:56%
I think what you can see is areas
of filling, essentially, from the --

02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:44.680
and you can see -- I think
you can see the damage

02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:46.500
and I think you can
see regions of growth,

02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:49.120
mold growth, around the cylinder.

02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:51.200
But, again, with this type
of artifact we're able

02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:53.520
to basically -- ah, here.

02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:55.210
That's a better picture.

02:57:55.210 --> 02:57:57.540
We're basically able to --

02:57:57.540 --> 02:58:01.150
like we saw with the previous
presentations this morning,

02:58:01.150 --> 02:58:02.650
we've got part of the
groove structure

02:58:02.650 --> 02:58:04.930
and then we can do interpretation.

02:58:04.930 --> 02:58:07.570
But there's no groove
here but we can then --

02:58:07.570 --> 02:58:10.110
we can add the time
period in as a blank,

02:58:10.110 --> 02:58:14.550
and that should get the sound.

02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:16.220
Ah, here's a good example.

02:58:16.220 --> 02:58:19.240
So here you can see --
it's getting trajectories.

02:58:19.240 --> 02:58:23.170
So the blue line would
be the conventional line,

02:58:23.170 --> 02:58:27.960
and then you can see -- this
is the broken surface here.

02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:30.570
Then we've just changed the
trajectory of the stylus.

02:58:30.570 --> 02:58:32.620
You can see where these things --
I can't see it very well on here,

02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:34.050
but I think you can,
hopefully you can see

02:58:34.050 --> 02:58:37.420
to the left you can see the
structures basically follow.

02:58:37.420 --> 02:58:39.910
The green line becomes
the retro slice.

02:58:39.910 --> 02:58:41.840
So this is a great advantage
with this technology,

02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:45.770
that you can use software
techniques,

02:58:45.770 --> 02:58:48.000
basically, to interpret the data.

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:51.410
Let's just play one of these.

02:58:51.410 --> 02:58:54.510
I'll do -- this is "Opticum."

02:58:54.510 --> 02:59:15.070
[ Static and Singing ]

02:59:15.070 --> 02:59:18.230
So that's a -- I think
I recognize that.

02:59:18.230 --> 02:59:22.430
I think that's a -- it's a
song I think which used to be

02:59:22.430 --> 02:59:26.900
like a church song, for
those in peril on the sea.

02:59:26.900 --> 02:59:28.970
So that's recognizable.

02:59:28.970 --> 02:59:32.510
This is the stylus.

02:59:32.510 --> 02:59:41.750
[ Static and Inaudible Speaker ]

02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:43.550
&gt;&gt; Maybe I should have
played this one --

02:59:43.550 --> 03:00:03.610
[ Static and Singing ]

03:00:03.610 --> 03:00:06.650
So at the time we were doing this
project it was quite frustrating

03:00:06.650 --> 03:00:08.710 position:56%
because we developed the technology.

03:00:08.710 --> 03:00:10.630
But everybody who came
to us came to us

03:00:10.630 --> 03:00:12.340
with an impossible sample
to measure [laughter].

03:00:12.340 --> 03:00:15.430
So this was an example of
something that was really difficult

03:00:15.430 --> 03:00:18.120
like the Queen Victoria
recording on this one.

03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:19.420
Then we represented -- oop.

03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:20.950
Let me jump to this.

03:00:20.950 --> 03:00:23.640
Tinfoil recordings came our way.

03:00:23.640 --> 03:00:30.180
This is the U.K.s oldest recording,
so it's an Edison tinfoil,

03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:35.140
and we were presented with this
to see if we could scan this.

03:00:35.140 --> 03:00:36.980
Because we did that, actually
the sound from this --

03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:39.420
I don't know how -- I
think I have it here.

03:00:39.420 --> 03:00:42.330
But because we'd done this piece
of work we were then contacted

03:00:42.330 --> 03:00:44.400
by the Norwegian Archive.

03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:45.700
I don't read Norwegian.

03:00:45.700 --> 03:00:47.000
&gt;&gt; I can.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:48.300
&gt;&gt; Can you read it?

03:00:48.300 --> 03:00:50.130
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I can.

03:00:50.130 --> 03:00:51.430
Oh.

03:00:51.430 --> 03:00:52.730
&gt;&gt; It's 1879.

03:00:52.730 --> 03:00:55.790
I can read that [laughter].

03:00:55.790 --> 03:01:03.670
&gt;&gt; So [inaudible] any old
[inaudible] is sort of flat

03:01:03.670 --> 03:01:07.000
on our -- the first
phonograph has been --

03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:15.100
-- has been [inaudible]
-- has been recorded

03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:19.340 position:56%
over an Edison phonograph in Norway.

03:01:21.750 --> 03:01:23.050
&gt;&gt; It's handwriting
which is the [inaudible].

03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:29.400
Okay. We have the date.

03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:30.700
&gt;&gt; Okay.

03:01:30.700 --> 03:01:32.000
&gt;&gt; So 1879.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:33.410
This was quite interesting.

03:01:33.410 --> 03:01:35.720
Let's play -- I think I
have this one [static].

03:01:35.720 --> 03:01:38.020
Oh, this is the [inaudible], sorry.

03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:45.880
This is the U.K. one which
is the Edison [inaudible]

03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:47.180
from the British Library.

03:01:47.180 --> 03:01:49.960
This is -- I think this is on an
exhibition in the British Library

03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:51.260
in London, and actually the same

03:01:51.260 --> 03:01:53.560
from this is also at
the British Library.

03:02:14.300 --> 03:02:17.750 position:56%
Okay. So you can see how that works.

03:02:20.590 --> 03:02:23.190
This piece of equipment
is an air bearing.

03:02:23.190 --> 03:02:25.970
I don't -- five minutes, okay.

03:02:25.970 --> 03:02:27.460
That's fine.

03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:29.730
A very expensive piece of
equipment, but it's basically used

03:02:29.730 --> 03:02:31.030
for silicon manufacturing.

03:02:31.030 --> 03:02:35.120
It gives you a very flat surface,
very high speed, and it's that type

03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:38.820
of technology we were using
for doing these [inaudible].

03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:40.120
I think -- oh, this is one --

03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:45.480
actually I was presented with
in the U.S. This was from --

03:02:45.480 --> 03:02:49.110
it don't show -- I can see
it very clearly on here.

03:02:49.110 --> 03:02:53.930
We didn't do this one because
it was so badly damaged.

03:02:53.930 --> 03:02:57.720
This is held in a museum,
I think, in New York.

03:02:57.720 --> 03:02:59.020
&gt;&gt; Schenectady.

03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:00.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:02.570
New York State.

03:03:02.570 --> 03:03:03.870
It's very damaged.

03:03:03.870 --> 03:03:06.720
I don't know if you had seen this,
but they were asking [inaudible].

03:03:06.720 --> 03:03:08.020
&gt;&gt; We did it.

03:03:08.020 --> 03:03:09.320
&gt;&gt; You did it.

03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:10.620
Okay. All right.

03:03:10.620 --> 03:03:11.920
Did you manage to get the sound?

03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:13.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

03:03:13.220 --> 03:03:14.520
&gt;&gt; Ah, okay.

03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:15.820
That's great.

03:03:15.820 --> 03:03:17.140 position:56%
Because we looked at it and thought,
gosh, this looks too bad [laughter].

03:03:17.140 --> 03:03:20.850
So this is the Edison
recording, 1877.

03:03:20.850 --> 03:03:23.210
Badly folded and ripped.

03:03:23.210 --> 03:03:25.860
Again, the sound is on the website.

03:03:25.860 --> 03:03:28.510
This is the Norwegian one.

03:03:28.510 --> 03:03:36.500
[ Static and Music ]

03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:38.550
So I think it's somebody
playing a Norwegian horn.

03:03:38.550 --> 03:03:39.850
&gt;&gt; That's great.

03:03:39.850 --> 03:03:41.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah? Is that right?

03:03:41.150 --> 03:03:46.510
So this was presented at an
Archive Conference in Oslo

03:03:46.510 --> 03:03:47.810
at the end of this project.

03:03:47.810 --> 03:03:51.610
I think it's in the Science Museum
in Oslo, yeah, with the sound.

03:03:51.610 --> 03:03:53.510
I'll play it once again.

03:03:53.510 --> 03:04:00.660
[ Static and Music ]

03:04:00.660 --> 03:04:02.890
But this particular artifact was

03:04:02.890 --> 03:04:05.000
in very good condition
compared to the British one.

03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:10.390
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'm just going to
come towards the end here.

03:04:10.390 --> 03:04:16.190
I'm going to jump the 78 disc
and just go on to the Berliner.

03:04:16.190 --> 03:04:22.370
So the EMI Archive is right next
to Heathrow Airport in London.

03:04:22.370 --> 03:04:25.090
They have a museum which
is not open to the public.

03:04:25.090 --> 03:04:28.510
It has some of the most incredible
artifacts I think I've ever seen

03:04:28.510 --> 03:04:29.940
just lying around this room.

03:04:29.940 --> 03:04:31.650
Some of you may have seen it.

03:04:31.650 --> 03:04:33.890
It's just incredible.

03:04:33.890 --> 03:04:36.260
Everywhere you looked there was
some incredible piece of history

03:04:36.260 --> 03:04:39.190
from sound recording, and it
was just in this vault, yeah?

03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:42.260
They gave me this to play
with which is a Berliner.

03:04:42.260 --> 03:04:45.050
I think this is one of the
earliest examples they had.

03:04:45.050 --> 03:04:48.210
I'm not quite sure
the history of this.

03:04:48.210 --> 03:04:51.220
I was looking online just to
remind myself where this came from.

03:04:51.220 --> 03:04:58.190
But this was a metallic master used
for printing probably on rubber.

03:04:58.190 --> 03:05:00.400
We actually scanned it.

03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:04.220
We never actually got around to
finishing this piece of work off

03:05:04.220 --> 03:05:07.610
so we have the surface and
we just haven't really got

03:05:07.610 --> 03:05:08.910
around to finishing it.

03:05:08.910 --> 03:05:10.620
But I just wanted to show
that to you as an example.

03:05:10.620 --> 03:05:14.240 position:56%
I'm just going to finish with -- I
should say thank you actually to all

03:05:14.240 --> 03:05:16.260
of the people who have
helped me with this.

03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:19.910
There were too many people to
mention but one of my PhD students,

03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:23.070
Anthony, who did his PhD in this,

03:05:23.070 --> 03:05:25.470
went on to work in
the film industry.

03:05:25.470 --> 03:05:29.610
So he did a PhD with me on early
sound recordings in engineering.

03:05:29.610 --> 03:05:34.090
He now works for a software
company in London doing CGI, yeah?

03:05:34.090 --> 03:05:37.510
He sent this to me, this
movie, which I like.

03:05:37.510 --> 03:05:58.410
[ Music and Singing ]

03:05:58.410 --> 03:06:04.070
Okay. So what he's done
is he's taken raw data

03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:07.930
from a scanned surface,
put it into CGI software,

03:06:07.930 --> 03:06:10.020
and recreated the surface.

03:06:10.020 --> 03:06:12.010
So you could fly through
this surface.

03:06:12.010 --> 03:06:14.260
You could do whatever you
want on a movie with this.

03:06:14.260 --> 03:06:17.110
You could actually follow
the grooves or whatever.

03:06:17.110 --> 03:06:20.400
So he just sent this
to me as an example.

03:06:20.400 --> 03:06:22.290
Just actually by coincidence,
I said, "Ah, I got to go

03:06:22.290 --> 03:06:24.260
and present something,"
and he sent me this.

03:06:24.260 --> 03:06:25.560
I thought you'd like to see it.

03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:26.860
I really like it.

03:06:26.860 --> 03:06:30.640
What it says is something about
the future of what we could do

03:06:30.640 --> 03:06:31.970
with some of this scan technology.

03:06:31.970 --> 03:06:35.130
This is maybe trivial, but it could
be something that would be good

03:06:35.130 --> 03:06:38.010
in a museum as a demonstration
of what these things are.

03:06:38.010 --> 03:06:39.380
This data's raw data.

03:06:39.380 --> 03:06:41.930
He just created it as a
movie as part of a CGI.

03:06:41.930 --> 03:06:43.470
I can't remember the
name of the company,

03:06:43.470 --> 03:06:45.920
but it's quite a well-known
CGI company in London.

03:06:45.920 --> 03:06:47.610
He's probably working
on the next Batman movie

03:06:47.610 --> 03:06:51.570
or James Bond or something.

03:06:51.570 --> 03:06:53.680
I think that's it.

03:06:53.680 --> 03:06:54.980
I hope you've enjoyed it.

03:06:54.980 --> 03:06:56.280
Thank you very much.

03:07:02.060 --> 03:07:03.360
Did I get close?

03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:05.240
&gt;&gt; That's looking very --

03:07:05.240 --> 03:07:06.540

&gt;&gt; It's nice to be
here at the conference.

03:07:12.130 --> 03:07:16.890
I want to thank the
organizer for this conference

at the Library of Congress.

03:07:18.630 --> 03:07:21.550
It has been very interesting
days for me,

03:07:21.550 --> 03:07:24.650
and to participate
in the conference.

03:07:24.650 --> 03:07:31.440
I also made some other visits
here in Washington, D.C. I've been

03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:40.270
up in Boston and Andover seeing
the IRENE technical operate.

03:07:40.270 --> 03:07:44.120
It was very interesting.

and seeing how they
have been working there,

03:07:49.950 --> 03:07:53.020
and yesterday in the Culpeper.

03:07:53.020 --> 03:07:57.690
It was very interesting to be there
also, and heard the discussions

03:07:57.690 --> 03:08:00.870
about all the preservations
problem they have,

03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:04.390
as we also have in our archive.

03:08:04.390 --> 03:08:11.590
There are many things to
go on with together I think

03:08:11.590 --> 03:08:14.380
to manage all these problems.

03:08:14.380 --> 03:08:21.940 position:56%
This is the new possibility to make
imaging of analog mechanical records

end of August this year.

I will have a short
presentation on how we have worked

03:08:37.530 --> 03:08:41.000
and what the results
so far have been done.

03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:52.340
Yes. I'm going to do a brief
presentations of the innovations

03:08:52.340 --> 03:08:56.540
and development projects
started at the National Library

About myself and my background.

03:09:16.620 --> 03:09:23.280
I've been working at many different
types of media and carriers, film,

03:09:23.280 --> 03:09:29.970
sound, video, and I started
early '70, in the early '70s.

03:09:29.970 --> 03:09:34.350
I have some experience
about these fields,

03:09:34.350 --> 03:09:37.290
and preservations of these things.

03:09:37.290 --> 03:09:43.360
I have also a big interest
in technical developments

03:09:43.360 --> 03:09:48.590
in all different fields, and
this project is one of these.

03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:50.170
Let's see.

03:09:50.170 --> 03:09:52.320
Yeah. Here we are.

03:09:52.320 --> 03:10:02.350
We have in the archive in KB, and
I will show you how it all started.

03:10:02.350 --> 03:10:14.260
We have a total amount of
about 146,000 Swedish records,

and of these there are 80,000 78s
and 60,000 vinyl records EP, Single,

03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:26.310
LPs, and so, and about
6000 lacquer discs.

03:10:26.310 --> 03:10:29.580
We are doing some cooperation
with the Swedish Radio

03:10:29.580 --> 03:10:41.000
and they have 285,000 records and
they also have [inaudible] records.

03:10:46.330 --> 03:10:50.140
Depending on our extensive
archive or records we want

03:10:50.140 --> 03:10:53.230
to investigate whether
it's possible to find ways

03:10:53.230 --> 03:10:56.310
to transfer these [inaudible]
in real-time

03:10:56.310 --> 03:11:00.190
and examine the sound
quality that can be achieved.

03:11:00.190 --> 03:11:05.360
It all started when we was
contacted with a company

03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:10.410
that showed a demonstrations of
optical playback of a 78 record.

03:11:10.410 --> 03:11:13.650
It was surprisingly good quality.

03:11:13.650 --> 03:11:17.020
The technical development
for image scanning used

03:11:17.020 --> 03:11:20.330
by this company was taken
directly from the shelf

03:11:20.330 --> 03:11:25.030
and had not been optimized
for applications we requested.

03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:28.920
We had discussions with the company
and described our needs to be able

03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:31.900
to transfer the disc
[inaudible] in real-time

03:11:31.900 --> 03:11:34.540
and at the best possible
sound quality.

03:11:34.540 --> 03:11:39.070
They also indicated that
image scanning operations

03:11:39.070 --> 03:11:43.080
and transfers could be fostered in
normal playback and possibilities

03:11:43.080 --> 03:11:47.440
to edit and optically
clean the discs.

03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:51.060
We were looking -- after that
we were looking for sponsors

03:11:51.060 --> 03:11:55.620
to investigate if it is
possible, all the technology,

03:11:55.620 --> 03:11:59.070
to have what we asked for.

03:12:00.360 --> 03:12:04.950
With this material and proposals
for the development project,

03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:06.910
we ended up finally

03:12:06.910 --> 03:12:10.680
to the innovation agency
in Sweden, Vinnova.

03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:14.330
We made applications with a
project description of Vinnova

03:12:14.330 --> 03:12:18.530
and got it granted as
innovation procurement PCP.

03:12:18.530 --> 03:12:22.960
We had no previous experience
innovation procurement

03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:25.910
and it has been very
interesting to run the project

03:12:25.910 --> 03:12:29.550
with the development process
that applies to this type

03:12:29.550 --> 03:12:32.640
of pre-commercial procurement.

03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:36.660
During the whole project there
have been a form of cooperations

03:12:36.660 --> 03:12:40.620
and dialog, but also
involved clear boundary issues

03:12:40.620 --> 03:12:42.720
of secrecy for the companies.

03:12:42.720 --> 03:12:48.810
These connections have created a
good and challenging development

03:12:48.810 --> 03:12:51.240
and exchange of information.

03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:58.320
When we started and we
brought these informations,

03:12:58.320 --> 03:12:59.620
you can see the picture.

03:12:59.620 --> 03:13:03.030 position:56%
It was this type of just a turntable

03:13:03.030 --> 03:13:06.810
and I have the lights
and the camera.

03:13:06.810 --> 03:13:09.460
Perhaps they have it better
on the other pictures.

03:13:09.460 --> 03:13:12.030
It's very dark here.

03:13:12.030 --> 03:13:15.510
It listened like this.

03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:38.870
[ Music ]

03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:46.000 position:56%
Yeah. With this we went on and we --

03:13:52.340 --> 03:13:54.930
I hope I will -- yes, here I am --

03:13:54.930 --> 03:14:00.120
make a short description how the
PCP project had been working on --

03:14:00.120 --> 03:14:02.540
and the result we want to achieve.

03:14:02.540 --> 03:14:04.450
That we were running at KB.

03:14:04.450 --> 03:14:08.070
It's an innovation project with
the funding from VINNOVA and also

03:14:08.070 --> 03:14:14.900
from KB that started the first
January 2014, and we be ended

03:14:14.900 --> 03:14:18.530
in the last August this year.

03:14:18.530 --> 03:14:21.640
VINNOVA is a governmental
institution in Sweden

03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:25.880
that provides financial resources
and opportunities for companies

03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:29.960
and governmental institutions to
apply for funds with development

03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:33.150
and various innovations
and investigations project.

03:14:33.150 --> 03:14:38.460
I can say today in [inaudible]
focused on innovation developments

03:14:38.460 --> 03:14:42.190 position:56%
and has dedicated enormous financial
resources that can be applied

03:14:42.190 --> 03:14:46.550
for development and
innovation proposals today,

03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:51.810
and for [inaudible] it's a special
program they have announced.

03:14:51.810 --> 03:14:55.240
We're on the development
project ourselves at KB,

03:14:55.240 --> 03:14:58.550
but have in our reference
and expert group participants

03:14:58.550 --> 03:15:02.770
from the Development
Department at the Swedish Radio

03:15:02.770 --> 03:15:07.240 position:56%
and also external experts in optical
scanning and image recognition.

03:15:07.240 --> 03:15:09.790
It is an innovation project,

03:15:09.790 --> 03:15:12.160
which means that the
result will be presented.

03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:15.920
It's a description of all the
technology have come today.

03:15:15.920 --> 03:15:18.300 position:56%
I can achieve with pictures scanning

03:15:18.300 --> 03:15:21.720
and with development
in image processing.

03:15:21.720 --> 03:15:26.080
The project will demonstrate the
results and the possibilities

03:15:26.080 --> 03:15:29.580
that exist to get audio
files from analog records.

03:15:29.580 --> 03:15:32.390
Our goal is to get
results which show --

03:15:32.390 --> 03:15:39.720
foster the real-time with
best possible sound quality.

03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:45.820
So on we started this
procurement and we received a total

03:15:45.820 --> 03:15:49.230
of eight proposals from
different companies.

03:15:49.230 --> 03:15:51.860 position:56%
Oh, yeah, I have to go on here also.

03:15:51.860 --> 03:15:53.160
Oop.

03:15:55.460 --> 03:15:59.690
They had no earlier professional
experience in audio recordings

03:15:59.690 --> 03:16:04.010
and were more oriented in the
industry and picture recognitions.

03:16:04.010 --> 03:16:06.620
In Sweden typically
example of sorting

03:16:06.620 --> 03:16:10.660
and selecting [inaudible] free
woods, planks, metal industry,

03:16:10.660 --> 03:16:16.220
productions, detections, robotnicks
[sic], selections, failure,

03:16:16.220 --> 03:16:19.000
in productions and so on.

03:16:23.530 --> 03:16:30.450
We selected of these eight, five
companies with innovation solutions

03:16:30.450 --> 03:16:34.490
that processed to Phase One.

03:16:34.490 --> 03:16:38.770
In the continuing work in Phase
One includes producing a report

03:16:38.770 --> 03:16:42.000
on a preliminary study
and detailed description

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:44.260
of its prototype solutions.

03:16:44.260 --> 03:16:49.670 position:56%
After examination of these Phase
One reports and the associated round

03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:53.890
of interviews by these companies,
we made a second new selection,

03:16:53.890 --> 03:16:59.390 position:56%
and we selected three companies
which now participating in Phase Two

03:16:59.390 --> 03:17:04.040
of development and
production of prototypes.

03:17:04.040 --> 03:17:09.180
They have to make and produce
all your file is [inaudible]

03:17:09.180 --> 03:17:13.220
in real-time from 78s
and vinyl records.

03:17:13.220 --> 03:17:17.640
In Phase Two includes a number
of goals that should be reported

03:17:17.640 --> 03:17:19.000
and be checked before
the final report.

03:17:28.650 --> 03:17:35.880
We have to know something
about the result and we have --

03:17:35.880 --> 03:17:44.080
give them these two records, test
records and reference records.

03:17:44.080 --> 03:17:48.410
It's important that we have
good reference and test records

03:17:48.410 --> 03:17:52.520
to compare with normal
turntable we're playing

03:17:52.520 --> 03:17:54.880
or with ELP lasered turntable.

03:17:54.880 --> 03:17:58.620
They had got these
records to work with

03:17:58.620 --> 03:18:02.090
and compare the bandwidth
and other parameters.

03:18:02.090 --> 03:18:08.770
It's the way for us to just
compare the result we get

03:18:08.770 --> 03:18:11.400
from these companies.

03:18:11.400 --> 03:18:14.320
The three companies
now participating

03:18:14.320 --> 03:18:19.090
in Phase Two have different
proposed solutions and prototypes

03:18:19.090 --> 03:18:24.650
that make it very interesting to
see how the results may differ.

03:18:24.650 --> 03:18:29.870
They're working with 2D and
3D scanning methods, laser,

03:18:29.870 --> 03:18:41.410
or LED lights, and other tools
that they have in their prospect.

03:18:41.410 --> 03:18:50.470
So far I'm not an expert in picture
recognition or an image scanning

03:18:50.470 --> 03:18:55.290
and so on, and they have to
prove and show the result for us,

03:18:55.290 --> 03:18:59.590
and we can only see the
potential for the results

03:18:59.590 --> 03:19:05.550
when they have delivered
the final report.

03:19:05.550 --> 03:19:12.010
I have understand so far it's
much about the lightning,

03:19:12.010 --> 03:19:14.260
highlight intensity,
and the brightness,

03:19:14.260 --> 03:19:21.250
and they probably will unfocus
and blur and also the pixel size

03:19:21.250 --> 03:19:24.240
in the cameras and so
on have limitations

03:19:24.240 --> 03:19:29.360
for this work with imaging.

03:19:29.360 --> 03:19:34.550
One company have used
laser and they --

03:19:34.550 --> 03:19:37.700
there was a problem with
sprecklers [assumed spelling]

03:19:37.700 --> 03:19:43.000
that I have understanding it's a
problem also about the quality.

03:19:48.220 --> 03:19:52.690
We go on and we -- there
are three companies

03:19:52.690 --> 03:19:59.950
and the first one here is
MBV Systems AB in Sweden,

03:19:59.950 --> 03:20:03.810 position:56%
and they use 3D laser triangulation,

03:20:03.810 --> 03:20:10.130
and they use also what they
call Scheimpflug techniques made

03:20:10.130 --> 03:20:13.080
for 78 records.

03:20:13.080 --> 03:20:21.180 position:56%
If you have questions about what
the technique is, I can't answer it.

03:20:21.180 --> 03:20:24.800
You'll have to call Texas company.

03:20:24.800 --> 03:20:30.870
Perhaps in the end of this
project I can more about the,

03:20:30.870 --> 03:20:34.690
how the result will be
described and so on.

03:20:34.690 --> 03:20:39.290
But this is the hardware
you can see here.

03:20:39.290 --> 03:20:47.700 position:56%
They have a laser and they have done
these things and I must also say

03:20:47.700 --> 03:20:52.260
that the sound recordings and so
on I got is from some months ago.

03:20:52.260 --> 03:20:58.270
I can say that it's a rather
short period for them to manage

03:20:58.270 --> 03:21:06.030 position:56%
and give us -- it's almost half a
year and I think they were very glad

03:21:06.030 --> 03:21:11.160
when they have built up this
hardware and get the sound from it

03:21:11.160 --> 03:21:16.190
and you may listen to what
it looks like and hear.

03:21:16.190 --> 03:21:20.360
This is from the MBV system.

03:21:20.360 --> 03:21:23.750
Here. Oh, yeah.

03:21:23.750 --> 03:21:25.550
Oop.

03:21:25.550 --> 03:21:31.050
[ Static and Music ]

03:21:31.050 --> 03:21:33.570
Very short but you hear something.

03:21:33.570 --> 03:21:39.940
The next one, the second,
is InVite Vision AB.

03:21:39.940 --> 03:21:45.120
They use 2D and they
have mostly worked

03:21:45.120 --> 03:21:46.420
with the LPs, vinyl discs, so far.

03:21:46.420 --> 03:21:48.540
This is the hardware you can see.

03:21:48.540 --> 03:21:51.760
They also have -- I go on here.

03:21:51.760 --> 03:22:00.800
InVite Vision is another company
working with UDS and have focused

03:22:00.800 --> 03:22:06.190
on primary vinyl records.

03:22:06.190 --> 03:22:13.570
Pictures of the whole
equipment with a label camera.

03:22:13.570 --> 03:22:18.840
This does meter with
display LED light, camera,

03:22:18.840 --> 03:22:21.310
and several multi adjusting
the distance.

03:22:21.310 --> 03:22:27.190
The disc is moving with an air
bearing, compressed air and rotate

03:22:27.190 --> 03:22:33.310
about 20 grooves in
the detection picture.

03:22:33.310 --> 03:22:47.710
I forgot to say something about
this I have right down here.

03:22:47.710 --> 03:22:54.710
They are working with the
78 records and their plan is

03:22:54.710 --> 03:23:01.780
to make it 10 times faster
than real time and catch 20

03:23:01.780 --> 03:23:05.360
to 100 rows in a picture.

03:23:05.360 --> 03:23:11.570
That was they have
told me and so forth.

03:23:11.570 --> 03:23:18.000
The third one then is the --

03:23:22.130 --> 03:23:27.070
We can listen to the
InVite Vision also.

03:23:27.070 --> 03:23:29.510
I forgot this also.

03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:56.820
This was a vinyl disc.

03:23:56.820 --> 03:24:00.510
I think they have the
same recordings.

03:24:00.510 --> 03:24:27.410
[ Static and Music ]

03:24:27.410 --> 03:24:33.080
This was, what we listening to was
in a vinyl recording, vinyl disc.

03:24:33.080 --> 03:24:40.220
The third one then is Joroma AB
and they call the system Optofon.

03:24:40.220 --> 03:24:47.260
Joroma AB is another of the
companies working with 2D,

03:24:47.260 --> 03:24:50.310
reported so far about
hardware competence

03:24:50.310 --> 03:24:54.990
and improved algorhyth
[assumed spelling] for pictures

03:24:54.990 --> 03:24:56.300
of the grooves, et cetera.

03:24:56.300 --> 03:25:00.040 position:56%
They are building the prototypes
and are doing tests and are planning

03:25:00.040 --> 03:25:03.930
to do tests with broken
and cracked discs.

03:25:03.930 --> 03:25:08.620
The plan is to make it 20
times faster than real time

03:25:08.620 --> 03:25:12.600
and to catch more than
40 grooves in a picture.

03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:18.580
Joroma AB is the Swedish
company with experience

03:25:18.580 --> 03:25:23.890
in developing automatic inspection
system for industrial applications.

03:25:23.890 --> 03:25:28.950
Theoretically able to capture
all grooves in two revolutions.

03:25:28.950 --> 03:25:32.360
New processing tools
can be reapplied

03:25:32.360 --> 03:25:35.910
to already scanned records.

03:25:35.910 --> 03:25:39.870
Individual grooves are
extracted and tracked

03:25:39.870 --> 03:25:42.760
as you can see in the picture.

03:25:42.760 --> 03:25:49.050
The image processing sound is
extracted using machine learning.

03:25:49.050 --> 03:25:52.220
I'm not sure about it.

03:25:52.220 --> 03:25:57.390
Probabilistic methods to
avoiding defects in grooves.

03:25:57.390 --> 03:26:01.320
It's only something
I'm not common with.

03:26:02.410 --> 03:26:09.090
The sound processing, sound can be
processed using single processing.

03:26:09.090 --> 03:26:12.480
Row date is always
preserved untouched.

03:26:12.480 --> 03:26:15.690
Can be useful to apply
noise filtering.

03:26:15.690 --> 03:26:19.660
They can be contacted.

03:26:19.660 --> 03:26:23.790
The man who has been
working this is Josef Grahn

03:26:23.790 --> 03:26:28.230
in Sweden in this company.

I have no audio to
reply from them so far.

03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:50.500
The next one is then to talk about
is the, as we call, same question,

03:26:50.500 --> 03:26:53.410
different solutions,
technical limitations.

03:26:53.410 --> 03:27:00.750
The companies shall submit the
final report on the 24th of August

03:27:00.750 --> 03:27:04.050
with presentations
or results achieved

03:27:04.050 --> 03:27:09.210
and suggest future technical
solutions that they have developed.

03:27:09.210 --> 03:27:11.540
After the project have
been finished,

03:27:11.540 --> 03:27:15.540
we are going to evaluate
the final results to see if

03:27:15.540 --> 03:27:18.390
and how we will proceed
in our continuing work

03:27:18.390 --> 03:27:21.760
with optical playback
and digitalizations.

03:27:21.760 --> 03:27:25.550
Depending on the results achieved
of some quality and how quickly

03:27:25.550 --> 03:27:29.080
and efficiently they may
transfer the records,

03:27:29.080 --> 03:27:32.850
we evaluate how realistically
applications

03:27:32.850 --> 03:27:37.140
and automatically those
digitalizations could be designed.

03:27:37.140 --> 03:27:40.540
It will be clear from the
companies' final reports

03:27:40.540 --> 03:27:41.980
that their optical playbacks

03:27:41.980 --> 03:27:44.810
and technical solutions
have the potential

03:27:44.810 --> 03:27:47.750
to achieve the quality we demand.

03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:52.180
Then it can be results that we get
from the optical playback of 78s

03:27:52.180 --> 03:27:55.830
that will be achieved the
quality we demand but not

03:27:55.830 --> 03:28:00.270
for transferring the
programs disc and so on.

03:28:00.270 --> 03:28:04.670
If the results are not going to be
what we want and be good enough,

03:28:04.670 --> 03:28:08.160
should the reasons be
described what depends on.

03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:13.610
It may be that new
technical possibilities

03:28:13.610 --> 03:28:17.820
of optical scanning technology
will be further developed

03:28:17.820 --> 03:28:21.400
in the near future and
provide new solutions.

03:28:21.400 --> 03:28:24.710
It can then, perhaps,
great opportunities

03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:27.520
for optical transmissions
and image processing

03:28:27.520 --> 03:28:30.410
and provide the results
we are demanding

03:28:30.410 --> 03:28:37.990
for full quality during playbacks
of even faster than real time.

03:28:39.710 --> 03:28:44.820
This is what we hope and
perhaps we, in the future,

03:28:44.820 --> 03:28:50.470
have some robot to
make this to work.

03:28:50.470 --> 03:29:03.950
We are planning to work for a -- if
depending on the results obtained

03:29:03.950 --> 03:29:05.970
and the potential that may exist,

03:29:05.970 --> 03:29:10.180
we plan to organize a workshop
during the autumn, late autumn,

03:29:10.180 --> 03:29:14.240
this year and where presentations
of the results that emerge

03:29:14.240 --> 03:29:18.950
from the participant companies.

03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:24.450
All this information we have heard
here from IRENE Project and so on,

03:29:24.450 --> 03:29:32.440
we will take with us and add to all
the results we get from our project

03:29:32.440 --> 03:29:38.320
and see what we can do with all
these results for the future.

03:29:38.320 --> 03:29:40.870
We never know.

03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:46.600
We hope it will be what we want.

03:29:46.600 --> 03:29:51.570
I'm eager to -- I don't know
the result from the companies.

03:29:51.570 --> 03:29:57.290
I'm eager to see what they
can present in the end

03:29:57.290 --> 03:30:01.040
of August this year, and
see what we can go on.

03:30:01.040 --> 03:30:08.510
That's what we are working with
and so thank you very much.

03:30:08.510 --> 03:30:18.670
[ Applause ]

03:30:18.670 --> 03:30:21.740
&gt;&gt; Now we have Carl Haber again.

03:30:21.740 --> 03:30:23.040
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

03:30:23.040 --> 03:30:24.340
I said good morning.

03:30:24.340 --> 03:30:27.000
Now I say good afternoon.

03:30:31.660 --> 03:30:41.090 position:56%
So this presentation will focus more
specifically on the IRENE technology

03:30:41.090 --> 03:30:45.980
which is a high resolution
direct imaging,

03:30:45.980 --> 03:30:50.250 position:56%
meaning we image directly the media.

03:30:50.250 --> 03:30:57.270
So IRENE is a set of
tools, it's not one thing,

03:30:57.270 --> 03:31:01.400
for non-invasive preservation,
restoration,

03:31:01.400 --> 03:31:04.730
and transfer of mechanical
sound carriers.

03:31:04.730 --> 03:31:08.280
It employs direct imaging
of the surface

03:31:08.280 --> 03:31:10.840
in both two dimensions
and three dimensions.

03:31:10.840 --> 03:31:15.320
It consists of hardware, which
you can call the scanner,

03:31:15.320 --> 03:31:17.370
and a variety of software.

03:31:17.370 --> 03:31:20.470
There's software that
controls the collection of data

03:31:20.470 --> 03:31:24.100
and the control of
the scanner itself.

03:31:24.100 --> 03:31:27.840
Then there's software that
is used to analyze the data.

03:31:27.840 --> 03:31:32.460 position:56%
There are five installations of this
equipment in one form or another

03:31:32.460 --> 03:31:35.370
in Berkeley, there are two
at the Library of Congress,

03:31:35.370 --> 03:31:38.670
there's a system at the Northeast
Document Conservation Center,

03:31:38.670 --> 03:31:43.650
and at the Richard Muthiah
Research Library in Chennai, India.

03:31:43.650 --> 03:31:50.480 position:56%
The IRENE project is a collaboration
between Lawrence Berkeley Lab,

03:31:50.480 --> 03:31:52.960
the Library of Congress,
the University

03:31:52.960 --> 03:31:57.730
of Applied Sciences in Fribourg.

03:31:57.730 --> 03:32:00.910
Professor Johnson and
the Smithsonian,

03:32:00.910 --> 03:32:03.910
and something like 40
students have participated

03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:05.690
in aspects of this work.

03:32:05.690 --> 03:32:11.230
Then all the different agencies and
mostly public and some foundations

03:32:11.230 --> 03:32:15.940
that have supported the project
are indicated here as well.

03:32:15.940 --> 03:32:20.550
So this is a picture
of the IRENE system

03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:23.340
which is actually at NEDCC now.

03:32:23.340 --> 03:32:25.680
So it's kind of what
you would expect.

03:32:25.680 --> 03:32:30.020
You've seen similar pictures
in the other presentations.

03:32:30.020 --> 03:32:35.290 position:56%
There's a vibration
stabilization table which is on air.

03:32:35.290 --> 03:32:40.950
There's essentially an arch that
contains both the confocal probe

03:32:40.950 --> 03:32:46.100
for doing the 3D imaging
and a camera

03:32:46.100 --> 03:32:49.130
for doing microphotography
for the 2D imaging.

03:32:49.130 --> 03:32:52.100
There's a turntable
that holds disc media.

03:32:52.100 --> 03:32:55.380
There's a mandrel that
holds cylindrical media.

03:32:55.380 --> 03:32:57.030
Both of these probes can be moved

03:32:57.030 --> 03:32:59.240
around under the control
of a computer.

03:32:59.240 --> 03:33:03.270
There's some lasers that
are used to control focus

03:33:03.270 --> 03:33:06.680
and there's other stages
that are used

03:33:06.680 --> 03:33:09.000
to move the cameras
and probes up and down.

03:33:09.000 --> 03:33:13.480
This is a picture that's supposed
to evoke the three-dimensional data

03:33:13.480 --> 03:33:16.670
where you get the full topology of
the surface and this is a picture

03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:18.670
that should invoke the
two-dimensional imaging

03:33:18.670 --> 03:33:19.970
where you're just looking

03:33:19.970 --> 03:33:25.280
at the light that's directly
reflected back at 90 degrees.

03:33:25.280 --> 03:33:29.940
Okay. There's various control
computers and so forth illuminators

03:33:29.940 --> 03:33:32.380 position:56%
that are part of the infrastructure.

03:33:32.380 --> 03:33:39.320
So this system is quite general and
it images a whole variety of media.

03:33:39.320 --> 03:33:42.960
The characteristics of that
media affect the quality

03:33:42.960 --> 03:33:44.260
of the sound that you get.

03:33:44.260 --> 03:33:48.170
There's no one number,
there's no one result

03:33:48.170 --> 03:33:52.140
that describes how this
system works because there's

03:33:52.140 --> 03:33:54.900
so many different variations
that occur.

03:33:54.900 --> 03:34:00.900 position:56%
But I tried to just to group a
couple of prime things here to point

03:34:00.900 --> 03:34:04.440
out some of the differences
that you have heard this morning

03:34:04.440 --> 03:34:08.040
and you'll also hear when
I play a few samples later.

03:34:08.040 --> 03:34:13.100
So lacquer discs have a very,
very fine-grained material

03:34:13.100 --> 03:34:15.090
that makes up the surface.

03:34:15.090 --> 03:34:21.060
When you image them, so this is
a blow-up region of the groove,

03:34:21.060 --> 03:34:24.920 position:56%
the appearance is very smooth, okay?

03:34:24.920 --> 03:34:30.250
Shellac is made of crushed beetles
and a bunch of other things.

03:34:30.250 --> 03:34:34.550
It's a highly composite material
which has a lot of texture

03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:38.010
and particularly as it gets
worn down different elements

03:34:38.010 --> 03:34:40.560
of the matrix wear
at a different rate.

03:34:40.560 --> 03:34:44.700 position:56%
So you have, instead, when you image
shellac material you see already a

03:34:44.700 --> 03:34:47.530
much more irregular structure.

03:34:47.530 --> 03:34:53.490
When this gets turned into audio
there's going to be more hiss,

03:34:53.490 --> 03:34:57.490
the broadband noise that you
heard some examples of earlier,

03:34:57.490 --> 03:34:59.900
in shellac materials
than lacquer materials.

03:34:59.900 --> 03:35:03.870
It goes back to essentially the
quality of the material and how

03:35:03.870 --> 03:35:06.500
that represents itself in an image.

03:35:06.500 --> 03:35:09.550
When you're in the 3D domain -- now
this is not a photograph anymore,

03:35:09.550 --> 03:35:11.060
I remind you from what
we saw this morning.

03:35:11.060 --> 03:35:14.420 position:56%
It's a depth image, so dark is deep.

03:35:14.420 --> 03:35:19.390
This is a curve that shows
how the surface is modulating.

03:35:19.390 --> 03:35:23.750
Here you've got many, many points
that describe this surface.

03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:26.450
It's not a simply an
edge transition anymore.

03:35:26.450 --> 03:35:29.840
So you're able to do a lot
of averaging when you have

03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:33.860
that much data, and that, itself,
has an effect on the noise.

03:35:33.860 --> 03:35:37.780
You heard some examples of cylinder
data this morning when we looked

03:35:37.780 --> 03:35:39.960
at the Riscossi [assumed
spelling] march in the context

03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:42.320
of talking about frequencies.

03:35:42.320 --> 03:35:44.950
This is another type of
three-dimensional imaging.

03:35:44.950 --> 03:35:47.760
This is an aluminum
transcription disc.

03:35:47.760 --> 03:35:52.690
So it's a groove that's actually a
lateral groove, but it's embossed,

03:35:52.690 --> 03:35:54.490
so you have soft aluminum,

03:35:54.490 --> 03:35:57.090
and the cutting tool
doesn't remove material.

03:35:57.090 --> 03:35:59.060
It just moves it, okay?

03:35:59.060 --> 03:36:03.640
So what the groove looks like is
it's a depression like a groove

03:36:03.640 --> 03:36:06.610
but -- so it's got
these horns on it, okay.

03:36:06.610 --> 03:36:11.350
The horns are the material that's
been pushed up out of the aluminum

03:36:11.350 --> 03:36:13.000
and now sit up on the side.

03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:18.860
If you shovel snow, it's the stuff
that you pile up along the sides.

03:36:18.860 --> 03:36:23.070
But so the audio is stored down
in here where you have many points

03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:24.990
that you can use to
characterize the groove,

03:36:24.990 --> 03:36:29.290
and then that has an
effect on the sound.

03:36:29.290 --> 03:36:32.060
There's a lot of software
that's come about,

03:36:32.060 --> 03:36:35.050
both controlled data
acquisition and analysis.

03:36:35.050 --> 03:36:42.400
So just to give you an example of
what the operator might encounter.

03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:47.320
This is the analysis software
that's used to process 3D data.

03:36:47.320 --> 03:36:48.800
So it's one of the software tools.

03:36:48.800 --> 03:36:53.440
So what you've got here is a
panel with a bunch of controls.

03:36:53.440 --> 03:36:57.820
This is a summary of the data
that was taken from a cylinder.

03:36:57.820 --> 03:36:59.180
So imagine the cylinder.

03:36:59.180 --> 03:37:00.920
You slice it and you unroll it.

03:37:00.920 --> 03:37:04.670
It becomes a -- a cylinder becomes
a rectangle when you do that.

03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:10.050 position:56%
So these stripes indicate the groove
and the top of here would go down,

03:37:10.050 --> 03:37:11.640
and then it would join again.

03:37:11.640 --> 03:37:14.480
So it's a mapping of a
cylinder to a rectangle.

03:37:14.480 --> 03:37:17.990
If you zoom in, you can see this,

03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:20.810
and you can see a lot more
detail of the surface.

03:37:20.810 --> 03:37:22.460
You can see all this mold damage.

03:37:22.460 --> 03:37:24.530
I talked about that this
morning when we looked

03:37:24.530 --> 03:37:26.810
at the Eeschi [assumed
spelling] cylinder.

03:37:26.810 --> 03:37:29.520
So this gives the operator
a much kind

03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:32.700
of more detailed understanding
of what's going on.

03:37:32.700 --> 03:37:38.870
Here along this line you see the
actual up and down profile that,

03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:42.810
roughly speaking, tells you
where that stylus would be moving

03:37:42.810 --> 03:37:45.510
and how it would be moving.

03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:49.770
So there's many, many
options that this gives you,

03:37:49.770 --> 03:37:53.590
and I realize that -- somebody this
morning was saying there are too

03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:55.320
many options.

03:37:55.320 --> 03:37:57.090
In fact, that is an issue.

03:37:57.090 --> 03:38:01.930 position:56%
What you would imagine in some
context is that this thing converges

03:38:01.930 --> 03:38:05.540
on a much simpler set
of presets and controls

03:38:05.540 --> 03:38:10.930 position:56%
and even becomes an application that
can be distributed and used along

03:38:10.930 --> 03:38:13.080
with -- [inaudible] stated
that clearly people said

03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:15.890
that they would like to have.

03:38:15.890 --> 03:38:20.240
Okay. This is another view of
another aspect of the software.

03:38:20.240 --> 03:38:26.680 position:56%
This is a chart which explains all
the software tools that were created

03:38:26.680 --> 03:38:32.120
at the -- with the design and
specifications of the Library

03:38:32.120 --> 03:38:36.320
of Congress to enable them to
operate the IRENE machine that some

03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:38.710
of you saw when you
went down to Culpeper

03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:41.370
in a production workflow
sort of environment.

03:38:41.370 --> 03:38:48.400
So the red flowchart is sort of
what the operator would be doing

03:38:48.400 --> 03:38:50.160
when they're scanning a disc.

03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:55.020
The grey stuff here is the analysis
of the data that's being created

03:38:55.020 --> 03:38:57.180
as happening automatically
in the background.

03:38:57.180 --> 03:38:59.990
So here's some database

03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:03.250
and the operator would
enter some information,

03:39:03.250 --> 03:39:05.710
and some information would then
be pulled in from a database

03:39:05.710 --> 03:39:07.290
through this front panel.

03:39:07.290 --> 03:39:10.440
Then there's some automatic kind
of calibration procedures that go

03:39:10.440 --> 03:39:15.430 position:56%
on that quickly figure out where
the disc begins and ends and exactly

03:39:15.430 --> 03:39:19.820
where to focus to start
off the acquisition.

03:39:19.820 --> 03:39:25.270
IRENE, as I said, uses direct
imaging, and so focus control

03:39:25.270 --> 03:39:28.430
and depth of field are
technical specifications

03:39:28.430 --> 03:39:34.790
that are much more detailed and
important to the way it functions

03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:37.170
than when you have a lot of
depth of field as you might have,

03:39:37.170 --> 03:39:39.670
for example, in visual audio.

03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:41.650
So it automatically
finds the record.

03:39:41.650 --> 03:39:43.090
This is sort of the
beginning and the end,

03:39:43.090 --> 03:39:44.890
and it figures out
what the focus is.

03:39:44.890 --> 03:39:49.280
Then it basically gives the
operator an image quality feedback

03:39:49.280 --> 03:39:52.690
and then the person
executes the scan.

03:39:52.690 --> 03:39:54.270
The data gets written into a file

03:39:54.270 --> 03:39:57.170
and there's a program that's
sitting there looking for new data.

03:39:57.170 --> 03:40:01.150
When the new data comes it analyzes
it by pulling in all the images,

03:40:01.150 --> 03:40:04.990
edge detecting, tracking
the position of the groove,

03:40:04.990 --> 03:40:08.390
cutting out the noise if necessary,
and creating an audio file.

03:40:08.390 --> 03:40:16.510
Okay? So this is, I guess,
with some probably improvements

03:40:16.510 --> 03:40:20.570
because this is an older slide,
similar to what NEDCC is using.

03:40:20.570 --> 03:40:22.460
This kind of tool set.

03:40:22.460 --> 03:40:23.760
Okay? Okay.

03:40:23.760 --> 03:40:26.560
So let's listen to an example.

03:40:26.560 --> 03:40:33.190
So this is a laterally-cut
shellac disc, circa 1930,

03:40:33.190 --> 03:40:36.300
which was in pretty good -- no,
I would say moderate condition.

03:40:36.300 --> 03:40:42.270
So it's imaged using the
two-dimensional aspect of IRENE.

03:40:42.270 --> 03:40:45.520
So you're basically ending
up with pictures like this

03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:48.610
and those pictures
have high contrast.

03:40:48.610 --> 03:40:51.400
They're kind of like the
pictures you saw in VisualAudio,

03:40:51.400 --> 03:40:53.280
but they're directly imaged.

03:40:53.280 --> 03:40:56.640
There's no film, intermediate
film step.

03:40:56.640 --> 03:41:00.790
Edge detection is applied, in
this case, just to the bottom

03:41:00.790 --> 03:41:04.820
of the groove, not to the top of
the groove, which we use more worn

03:41:04.820 --> 03:41:07.720
and potentially more
of a source of noise.

03:41:07.720 --> 03:41:13.510
So, if you play this record with
a stylus, it sounds like this.

03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:39.080
[ Crackling Sound and Music ]

03:41:39.080 --> 03:41:42.860
Okay. So I don't know if you can
notice with the sound system,

03:41:42.860 --> 03:41:46.850
but there's obviously the audio and
there's some crackle which is kind

03:41:46.850 --> 03:41:52.480
of a, not a broadband hiss but a
kind of a campfire kind of sound.

03:41:52.480 --> 03:41:56.090
A lot of repetitive small impulses.

03:41:56.090 --> 03:42:01.150
The frequency spectrum
that is represented

03:42:01.150 --> 03:42:03.730
by what the playback
here is the light blue.

03:42:03.730 --> 03:42:07.690
You can see that the audio is kind
of dying out somewhere between,

03:42:07.690 --> 03:42:10.410
I don't know, six or
seven kilohertz.

03:42:10.410 --> 03:42:14.130
Then what's left is just a noise,

03:42:14.130 --> 03:42:17.690
a higher frequency
noise, represented here.

03:42:17.690 --> 03:42:22.260
Now we're going to listen to the
IRENE version of the same disc,

03:42:22.260 --> 03:42:25.400
and what you're going to -- I
believe what you're going to hear,

03:42:25.400 --> 03:42:26.700
this would stay on the page,

03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:32.000
is obviously similar audio,
less crackle, more hiss.

03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:48.110
[ Music and Hissing Sound ]

03:42:48.110 --> 03:42:50.410 position:56%
I believe you heard the hiss, right?

03:42:50.410 --> 03:42:53.970
So the additional hiss that
you're hearing is represented

03:42:53.970 --> 03:42:57.680
in the difference essentially
qualitatively

03:42:57.680 --> 03:43:02.320
between the high frequency
'til here, which is also hidden

03:43:02.320 --> 03:43:05.420
under here obviously,
and the lower noise

03:43:05.420 --> 03:43:08.870
of the shellac, stylus version.

03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:13.260
That maps back to this picture
that I told you, that you've got,

03:43:13.260 --> 03:43:16.740
this texture, and that
texture's in the material.

03:43:16.740 --> 03:43:21.260
Okay. So let me talk a little
bit of the technical aspects.

03:43:21.260 --> 03:43:27.240 position:56%
So sound carriers, discs,
cylinders, they're never really flat

03:43:27.240 --> 03:43:28.780
and they're never really round,

03:43:28.780 --> 03:43:31.600
and in some cases they're
way, way off that.

03:43:31.600 --> 03:43:35.280
So this is this notion of
warpage and depth of field.

03:43:35.280 --> 03:43:41.330
The 2D and 3D systems that
directly image, they have limits,

03:43:41.330 --> 03:43:44.830
just like cameras do,
to the effective depth

03:43:44.830 --> 03:43:46.320
of field that they can achieve.

03:43:46.320 --> 03:43:50.200
For 2D, we're limited
to about 30 microns.

03:43:50.200 --> 03:43:53.260
So it's a really, really
small depth of field.

03:43:53.260 --> 03:43:56.010
But having that small depth of
field gets us these very high

03:43:56.010 --> 03:43:58.070
resolution images.

03:43:58.070 --> 03:44:04.320 position:56%
The 3D systems are limited to about
2- to 300 microns of depth of field.

03:44:04.320 --> 03:44:08.130
That number is typically
smaller than the out-of-roundness

03:44:08.130 --> 03:44:10.810
and out-of-flatness
that you often encounter

03:44:10.810 --> 03:44:13.420
in these things, even that number.

03:44:13.420 --> 03:44:17.360 position:56%
So, both of these situations lead us

03:44:17.360 --> 03:44:20.450
to have active focus
control systems.

03:44:20.450 --> 03:44:23.930
That's the way we deal
with depth of field.

03:44:23.930 --> 03:44:28.930
We follow the surface as best we
can using an additional measurement

03:44:28.930 --> 03:44:33.230
to which we'll just say,
for example, a laser.

03:44:34.930 --> 03:44:40.300
Additionally, the probes that we
use have sub-micron resolution,

03:44:40.300 --> 03:44:41.860
particularly the 3D probe.

03:44:41.860 --> 03:44:45.310
This requires very,
very stable mechanics

03:44:45.310 --> 03:44:49.320
and really good vibration
isolation because it's not hard

03:44:49.320 --> 03:44:53.450
to get two things to move apart
at the hundred nanometer level.

03:44:53.450 --> 03:44:56.090
The images that we take are built

03:44:56.090 --> 03:45:02.510
up by a scanning and/or stitching
method, and so when you do

03:45:02.510 --> 03:45:05.850
that you have to have really good
control of the data collection

03:45:05.850 --> 03:45:08.500
and the systematic, so that
everything stays in phase

03:45:08.500 --> 03:45:11.520
and things don't slip with
respect to each other.

03:45:11.520 --> 03:45:16.030
In 2D imaging, the illuminators
that we use, they need to be DC,

03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:18.140
and I mean really DC, okay?

03:45:18.140 --> 03:45:21.740 position:56%
Because if they're flashing or
flickering at 30 hertz or something,

03:45:21.740 --> 03:45:24.320
that shows up as striping
in the images.

03:45:24.320 --> 03:45:31.260
That gets misinterpreted by the
edge detection as small shifts,

03:45:31.260 --> 03:45:33.340 position:56%
and that shows up as spurious tones.

03:45:33.340 --> 03:45:37.360
So those are the kind of issues
that you really, actually,

03:45:37.360 --> 03:45:40.690
spend a lot of time dealing with
once you put the thing together.

03:45:40.690 --> 03:45:44.110
So I can re-express these
things as challenges.

03:45:44.110 --> 03:45:48.720
The intrinsic characteristics
of mechanical sound carriers,

03:45:48.720 --> 03:45:52.770
so old yet so precise, and one of
the other speakers alluded to that,

03:45:52.770 --> 03:45:55.450
they really drive these
technical requirements.

03:45:55.450 --> 03:45:59.410
Failure to control the technical
aspects can lead to artifacts

03:45:59.410 --> 03:46:02.640
in the data which are
real easy to see.

03:46:02.640 --> 03:46:07.020 position:56%
We've encountered these things and
we've learned how to deal with them.

03:46:07.020 --> 03:46:10.980
Vibration, AC components,
the illuminator,

03:46:10.980 --> 03:46:12.480
lead to spurious audio tones.

03:46:12.480 --> 03:46:17.360
Poor focus control leads to
cross-talk, noise, and distortion.

03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:20.550
Scanning phase shifts leads
to misaligned datasets.

03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:24.710 position:56%
None of these issues are fundamental
in that they're impossible to solve,

03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:28.810
but they have to be handled,
dealing with them and learning how.

03:46:28.810 --> 03:46:31.430
They reappear when
we build new systems

03:46:31.430 --> 03:46:32.780
and they have to be worked out.

03:46:32.780 --> 03:46:36.830
That's an important part of the
R&amp;D, and you shed some blood

03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:39.500
and sweat to deal with those.

03:46:39.500 --> 03:46:45.920
Okay. The IRENE hardware and/or
software has processed already a

03:46:45.920 --> 03:46:48.360
variety of historic materials --

03:46:48.360 --> 03:46:54.330
a number of pre, say1890's
audio milestones;

03:46:54.330 --> 03:46:56.800
personal novelty recordings
from World War II;

03:46:56.800 --> 03:46:59.740
things that soldiers
sent back; aluminum

03:46:59.740 --> 03:47:04.320
and acetate transcription discs
from the '30s and '40s; wax field

03:47:04.320 --> 03:47:08.570
and dictation recordings from the
late 19th and early 20th century;

03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:12.250
the Edison Talking Dolls that
the <i>New York Times </i>seems to be

03:47:12.250 --> 03:47:14.970
so in love with; Berliners;

03:47:14.970 --> 03:47:18.920
items from the Smithsonian
Institution Volta Laboratory

03:47:18.920 --> 03:47:22.770
Experimental Collections; Edison
tinfoils; the Schenectady foil

03:47:22.770 --> 03:47:26.660
that John McBride showed
was eventually scanned;

03:47:26.660 --> 03:47:28.880
and finally the paper
phonoautograms.

03:47:28.880 --> 03:47:31.760
So I'm kind of going
back, back in time.

03:47:31.760 --> 03:47:36.410
The present efforts and the
projects, as we kind of go forward,

03:47:36.410 --> 03:47:40.000
include, obviously, an ongoing
partnership with the Library

03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:45.080
of Congress; tools to process
large collections, workflow,

03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:47.620
and diverse materials along
the lines of some of the work

03:47:47.620 --> 03:47:51.210
that I already showed, but
obviously doing better at that;

03:47:51.210 --> 03:47:56.010
making the hardware faster and
robust and similarly the software.

03:47:56.010 --> 03:47:59.320
We have not targeted
faster than real time,

03:47:59.320 --> 03:48:02.730
but obviously we want
things to go faster.

03:48:02.730 --> 03:48:05.320
A lot of work on at-risk
items, of broken

03:48:05.320 --> 03:48:07.770
and delicate materials
and how to handle them.

03:48:07.770 --> 03:48:09.660
There's an installation recently

03:48:09.660 --> 03:48:11.550
at the Northeast Document
Conservation Center.

03:48:11.550 --> 03:48:13.770
These guys are going to
tell you all about that.

03:48:13.770 --> 03:48:17.030
Then pilot projects and
even major initiatives

03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:20.930
to digitize important collections
and develop best practices

03:48:20.930 --> 03:48:23.540
and specifications, and I'm going
to tell you about a few of those.

03:48:23.540 --> 03:48:28.970
So we've worked -- our
group, the Library,

03:48:28.970 --> 03:48:32.860
and the Smithsonian folks together
on the Volta Lab collection.

03:48:32.860 --> 03:48:35.300
Some of you had the
opportunity to go for the tour.

03:48:35.300 --> 03:48:39.020
If you haven't, I encourage you
to go over to the National Museum

03:48:39.020 --> 03:48:42.320
of American History and listen to
-- or go and see "Hear my Voice,

03:48:42.320 --> 03:48:45.530
Alexander Graham Bell, and the
development of sound recording."

03:48:45.530 --> 03:48:49.370
In the 1880s, Bell establishes
the Volta Lab here in Washington

03:48:49.370 --> 03:48:50.780
with his cousin

03:48:50.780 --> 03:48:53.320
and an instrument-builder
named Charles Sumner Tainter,

03:48:53.320 --> 03:48:54.950
to conduct research.

03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:59.150
They experiment with an astounding
variety of materials and formats,

03:48:59.150 --> 03:49:02.410
and produce numerous patents
before settling on the wax cylinder

03:49:02.410 --> 03:49:03.710
which becomes so important

03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:07.350
that Victoria's voice gets
recorded on a wax cylinder.

03:49:07.350 --> 03:49:09.500
Right now, I think, the
collection is something

03:49:09.500 --> 03:49:12.500
like 400 experimental recordings,

03:49:12.500 --> 03:49:15.790
and in the recent years
we had the chance to scan

03:49:15.790 --> 03:49:17.850
and process just a dozen of them.

03:49:17.850 --> 03:49:21.770
That's what's focused
on the exhibit there.

03:49:21.770 --> 03:49:24.650
I think it's been an ideal
application for IRENE

03:49:24.650 --> 03:49:28.760
and a significant future
opportunity to go and actually try

03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:32.370
to do this entire collection
if we could ever organize that.

03:49:32.370 --> 03:49:35.720
Carlene and Cherry are the SI
Curators, staff folks, that --

03:49:35.720 --> 03:49:40.380
I think they're going
to talk to you later.

03:49:40.380 --> 03:49:41.710
I think tomorrow.

03:49:41.710 --> 03:49:44.770
I'm going to play you one
record from that collection

03:49:44.770 --> 03:49:47.100
because it's my favorite
and it's kind

03:49:47.100 --> 03:49:49.720
of the most unusual one
that I've come across.

03:49:49.720 --> 03:49:53.860
One of the things that Bell did
was, and this is a little off-topic

03:49:53.860 --> 03:49:55.750
because we're talking
about grooves carriers,

03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:57.370
was actually an optical recording.

03:49:57.370 --> 03:50:00.820
He took a glass plate,
coated it with emulsion,

03:50:00.820 --> 03:50:05.440 position:56%
and they brought light in the mirror
through a lens and down this tube.

03:50:05.440 --> 03:50:09.360
They exposed a light
path, a light track,

03:50:09.360 --> 03:50:12.150
a spiral track on this photo disc.

03:50:12.150 --> 03:50:18.620 position:56%
They modulated the light by spraying
a jet of ink or dye and then causing

03:50:18.620 --> 03:50:22.180
that to move in sympathy with the
sound which varied the intensity

03:50:22.180 --> 03:50:24.460
of the light which
varied the exposure.

03:50:24.460 --> 03:50:26.810
They wrote this exposure track.

03:50:26.810 --> 03:50:33.340
Okay? So it starts in the middle
and it spirals until it gets

03:50:33.340 --> 03:50:38.050
to this blotch here which is an
over-exposed moment where the --

03:50:38.050 --> 03:50:39.350
clearly the thing stopped turning

03:50:39.350 --> 03:50:42.830
and the light just
burned into the surface.

03:50:42.830 --> 03:50:46.620
They're doing the usual
nursery rhyme thing,

03:50:46.620 --> 03:50:48.330
and suddenly something goes wrong

03:50:48.330 --> 03:50:52.210
and they say something
spontaneous [laughter],

03:50:52.210 --> 03:50:54.290
which I believe is
a really bad word.

03:50:54.290 --> 03:50:57.900
Some people say it's
not such a bad word,

03:50:57.900 --> 03:51:00.080
but I just think it's
really inappropriate,

03:51:00.080 --> 03:51:04.510
so I'm going to play it [laughter].

03:51:04.510 --> 03:51:12.950
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

03:51:12.950 --> 03:51:16.930
Okay. Only in Washington, right?

03:51:16.930 --> 03:51:21.510 position:56%
Okay. Then, of course, there's a gap
and they pick right back up again.

03:51:21.510 --> 03:51:31.540
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

03:51:31.540 --> 03:51:35.920
Okay. That high-pitch thing was a
trilled R which was then chirped

03:51:35.920 --> 03:51:38.470
because they were speeding up.

03:51:38.470 --> 03:51:41.940
Anyway, go over to the exhibit,
and I think it's a great exhibit.

03:51:41.940 --> 03:51:49.040
Okay. So a major new initiative
for the project is happening now

03:51:49.040 --> 03:51:51.250
at the University of
California at Berkeley.

03:51:51.250 --> 03:51:53.720
It's called "Linguistic and
ethnographic sound recordings

03:51:53.720 --> 03:51:55.940
from early 20th century
California --

03:51:55.940 --> 03:51:58.570
Optical scanning, digitization,
and access."

03:51:58.570 --> 03:52:01.320
It's a collaboration of the
Department of Linguistics,

03:52:01.320 --> 03:52:04.000
the Phoebe Hearst Museum of
Anthropology, the University

03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:09.190
of California Libraries, the
Berkeley Physics Department,

03:52:09.190 --> 03:52:11.610
and the Lawrence Berkley
National Lab.

03:52:11.610 --> 03:52:16.250
It's a three-year project to scan
a collection at the University

03:52:16.250 --> 03:52:22.770
of 2700 wax cylinders from 1900
to 1938 which were collected

03:52:22.770 --> 03:52:25.640
by Professor Alfred
Kroeber and T.T Waterman,

03:52:25.640 --> 03:52:28.620
and document California
Native American language,

03:52:28.620 --> 03:52:31.760
culture, song, and story.

03:52:31.760 --> 03:52:35.090
The project is supported by the
National Science Foundation,

03:52:35.090 --> 03:52:37.950 position:56%
the National Endowment for the
Humanities, through a program called

03:52:37.950 --> 03:52:39.570
"Documenting Endangered Languages."

03:52:39.570 --> 03:52:42.470
It's something that we're really
excited about because it's going

03:52:42.470 --> 03:52:45.890
to be this very focused,
concerted effort that's going

03:52:45.890 --> 03:52:51.120
to run basically 24/7 for three
years just scanning cylinders.

03:52:51.120 --> 03:52:58.440 position:56%
Some of the technical innovations
that we're trying to feature as part

03:52:58.440 --> 03:53:01.250
of this is a more efficient
scanning method.

03:53:01.250 --> 03:53:05.310
So the mandrel becomes longer, and
we plan to stack multiple cylinders

03:53:05.310 --> 03:53:07.650
like a shish kabob
kind of arrangement,

03:53:07.650 --> 03:53:10.620
and then have a control
system that can, overnight,

03:53:10.620 --> 03:53:16.500
work its way through
the entire skewer.

03:53:16.500 --> 03:53:17.970
Also there's fixturing

03:53:17.970 --> 03:53:21.320
to hold individually broken-off
pieces and scan them, so.

03:53:21.320 --> 03:53:24.260
I think this is going to
be a really great project.

03:53:24.260 --> 03:53:26.020
Another project we're doing

03:53:26.020 --> 03:53:30.030
with Harvard is looking
at aluminum discs.

03:53:30.030 --> 03:53:33.500
They were prominent in
the early mid-'20s to '30s

03:53:33.500 --> 03:53:37.350
as an improved material relative
to wax for field recording.

03:53:37.350 --> 03:53:41.340
However, they have a very shallow
and irregularly embossed groove.

03:53:41.340 --> 03:53:43.360
I talked about aluminum
grooves a moment ago.

03:53:43.360 --> 03:53:46.200
The groove is only five
to ten microns deep.

03:53:46.200 --> 03:53:49.170
The groove on a regular
commercial shellac disc is

03:53:49.170 --> 03:53:50.630
like 75 microns deep.

03:53:50.630 --> 03:53:52.300
So these are tiny grooves.

03:53:52.300 --> 03:53:55.950
These are electrically recorded
so they're typically quite loud,

03:53:55.950 --> 03:53:58.260
and there's a problem
to keep the needle

03:53:58.260 --> 03:54:01.280
in that groove and
not fly off, okay?

03:54:01.280 --> 03:54:03.940
So the tendency is to
want to weigh it down,

03:54:03.940 --> 03:54:07.960
but the aluminum is really
soft, so you're in a spot there

03:54:07.960 --> 03:54:09.560
which is not comfortable.

03:54:09.560 --> 03:54:16.220
So optical scanning is
potentially a good choice for this.

03:54:16.220 --> 03:54:19.720
Harvard, through IMLS, has a
grant for a feasibility study

03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:21.120
that we're doing with them

03:54:21.120 --> 03:54:24.160
which could eventually lead
to a future initiative.

03:54:24.160 --> 03:54:27.920
This is an amazing collection
from the historical point of view.

03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:30.830
It's called the Milman Parry
Collection of Oral Literature.

03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:33.290
So Milman Perry was
a classicist who went

03:54:33.290 --> 03:54:37.040
to what was called the South
Slavic Kingdoms at that point,

03:54:37.040 --> 03:54:39.870
with this aluminum
recording machine.

03:54:39.870 --> 03:54:45.660 position:56%
Recorded people like this individual
who were reciting poetry and stories

03:54:45.660 --> 03:54:47.770
that went on for a long
time that they learned

03:54:47.770 --> 03:54:49.860
through an oral tradition.

03:54:49.860 --> 03:54:54.220
He analyzed the structure and
the superstructure behind this

03:54:54.220 --> 03:54:58.110
that created the ability for these
guys to remember these things.

03:54:58.110 --> 03:55:02.390
That analysis of oral song led
to the view that the epic poems

03:55:02.390 --> 03:55:05.240
of Homer and others were
also orally transmitted

03:55:05.240 --> 03:55:07.490
because they feature
the same structures.

03:55:07.490 --> 03:55:14.570
So this is like empirical
data-driven humanities work done

03:55:14.570 --> 03:55:18.850
in the 1930s, looking at a living
laboratory and referencing it back

03:55:18.850 --> 03:55:20.540
to these incredibly important --

03:55:20.540 --> 03:55:22.960
I mean the beginning
of Western literature.

03:55:22.960 --> 03:55:28.570
So there's Parry aluminum disc and
obviously this is to evoke the --

03:55:28.570 --> 03:55:31.210
I guess it's the slaughter
that occurred

03:55:31.210 --> 03:55:33.290
when a disc just got
back home and found

03:55:33.290 --> 03:55:36.780
out what the hell was
going on [laughter].

03:55:36.780 --> 03:55:39.500
This is what one of these aluminum
discs actually sounds like.

03:55:39.500 --> 03:55:42.420
They're striking when
they're optically scanned.

03:55:42.420 --> 03:55:44.510
If I can get the cursor.

03:55:44.510 --> 03:55:57.940
[ Singing and Music ]

03:55:57.940 --> 03:56:03.210
So I mean, they're pretty good,
the quality of those recordings.

03:56:03.210 --> 03:56:06.410
Yeah. Here's actually a
display off the software package

03:56:06.410 --> 03:56:08.950
of what the aluminum
datasets look like.

03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:10.250
Actually we saw that.

03:56:10.250 --> 03:56:13.500
It's a lateral groove, and you
saw the zoomed- in [inaudible].

03:56:13.500 --> 03:56:18.370
Interestingly, on this one, there
was a little burst of noise,

03:56:18.370 --> 03:56:21.070
kind of right in the middle of the
playback, and we traced it down.

03:56:21.070 --> 03:56:26.140 position:56%
You can see that the groove is
actually deformed in this one region

03:56:26.140 --> 03:56:29.960
and it corresponds to just this
little patch in the material.

03:56:29.960 --> 03:56:32.530
So lacquer transcription discs.

03:56:32.530 --> 03:56:35.630
A colleague spoke about
them earlier.

03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:39.090
They're a very, very
important region, area,

03:56:39.090 --> 03:56:40.390
for optical scanning as well.

03:56:40.390 --> 03:56:43.550
There are significant collections
of radio transcription discs here

03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:46.250
at the Library and,
of course, elsewhere.

03:56:46.250 --> 03:56:48.480
This type of disc has
a number of chemical

03:56:48.480 --> 03:56:51.960
and mechanical pathologies
associated with it.

03:56:51.960 --> 03:56:55.110
Typically we see pretty
good performance

03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:58.240
when you scan these optically
relative to a stylus transfer.

03:56:58.240 --> 03:57:04.280
A year or two back, 600 sides
of these discs were done here

03:57:04.280 --> 03:57:07.830
at the Library as a pilot study
using the World War II Armed Forces

03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:09.130
Radio collection.

03:57:09.130 --> 03:57:11.080
So here's a -- I'm going
to first compare a stylus

03:57:11.080 --> 03:57:15.500
to an IRENE transfer on
a lacquer disc from 1950.

03:57:15.500 --> 03:57:17.540
It's a radio show.

03:57:17.540 --> 03:57:21.380
Then I'm going to play one of the
Armed Forces optical transfers.

03:57:21.380 --> 03:57:23.240
So here's the stylus version.

03:57:23.240 --> 03:57:27.660
&gt;&gt; Do you deliberately
keep visitors from me?

03:57:27.660 --> 03:57:30.460
Has the physician told you
to keep my friends away?

03:57:30.460 --> 03:57:31.760
&gt;&gt; Oh no, mistress, no.

03:57:31.760 --> 03:57:33.390
&gt;&gt; Then what is it?

03:57:33.390 --> 03:57:37.580
&gt;&gt; Mistress, I -- unless
I am mistaken [inaudible]

03:57:37.580 --> 03:57:40.900
and all the others will
never enter this house again.

03:57:40.900 --> 03:57:42.880
&gt;&gt; And why not?

03:57:42.880 --> 03:57:45.720
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: I'm dying to
know why not [inaudible].

03:57:45.720 --> 03:57:48.340
Okay. So here's the IRENE version.

03:57:48.340 --> 03:57:52.590
&gt;&gt; Do you deliberately
keep visitors from me?

03:57:52.590 --> 03:57:55.410
Has the physician told you
to keep my friends away?

03:57:55.410 --> 03:57:56.710
&gt;&gt; Oh no, mistress, no.

03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:58.350
&gt;&gt; Then what is it?

03:57:58.350 --> 03:58:02.570
&gt;&gt; Mistress, I -- unless
I am mistaken [inaudible]

03:58:02.570 --> 03:58:05.890
and all the others will
never enter this house again.

03:58:05.890 --> 03:58:07.190
&gt;&gt; And why --

03:58:07.190 --> 03:58:08.490
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: And why not?

03:58:08.490 --> 03:58:11.610
Okay. We still don't know.

03:58:11.610 --> 03:58:14.900
I think you could hear
that that the hiss --

03:58:14.900 --> 03:58:16.600
&gt;&gt; I think you might have
a question over there.

03:58:16.600 --> 03:58:18.040
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: I think
we're going to do -- what?

03:58:18.040 --> 03:58:19.340
Five minutes, yeah.

03:58:19.340 --> 03:58:20.640
No problem.

03:58:20.640 --> 03:58:21.940
It wasn't a question.

03:58:21.940 --> 03:58:23.240
It was an order.

03:58:23.240 --> 03:58:24.540
Yeah. Okay.

03:58:24.540 --> 03:58:27.510
I think you can hear that
the hiss has a quite --

03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:32.460 position:56%
is quite less as compared to what we
heard when we listened to a shellac.

03:58:32.460 --> 03:58:35.320
So I want to remind you of
the media comparison picture

03:58:35.320 --> 03:58:37.580
and the relative smoothness
of those materials.

03:58:37.580 --> 03:58:40.610
Okay. So here's the Armed
Forces Radio broadcast.

03:58:40.610 --> 03:58:43.850
I only have the IRENE
transfer for this one.

03:58:43.850 --> 03:58:47.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; When the lieutenant saw several
of his men wounded and fires started

03:58:47.760 --> 03:58:53.260 position:56%
by Japanese shells, he dashed from
his shelter, braving the enemy fire.

03:58:53.260 --> 03:58:56.180
He brought the wounded back to
cover, saving the lives of several.

03:58:56.180 --> 03:59:00.190
A sweeping order from the War
Production Board tonight ends the

03:59:00.190 --> 03:59:04.700 position:56%
use of iron and steel in more than
400 articles of common civilian use,

03:59:04.700 --> 03:59:08.340
and thereby puts the finishing
touches on the enforced conversion

03:59:08.340 --> 03:59:11.020
of a great section of our economy.

03:59:11.020 --> 03:59:15.510
In 90 days no more fountain pens,
pie plates, cigarette lighters,

03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:18.720
toolboxes, pleasure boats,
automobile accessories,

03:59:18.720 --> 03:59:24.430
street light poles,
not even bathtubs.

03:59:24.430 --> 03:59:25.730
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

03:59:25.730 --> 03:59:29.910
So one area that is really
important for lacquer

03:59:29.910 --> 03:59:34.900
and other materials
are the broken discs,

03:59:34.900 --> 03:59:36.200
and how do you deal with them.

03:59:36.200 --> 03:59:39.790
So the point was made that
once they break they're not

03:59:39.790 --> 03:59:41.170
in a plane anymore.

03:59:41.170 --> 03:59:45.510
Much even worse than sometimes
you have just with warpage.

03:59:45.510 --> 03:59:50.220
For a direct imaging system which
has such a narrow depth of field,

03:59:50.220 --> 03:59:52.600
30 microns, it's an issue.

03:59:52.600 --> 03:59:59.060 position:56%
How do you image something that has
so much, now, vertical differencing?

03:59:59.060 --> 04:00:05.140
So, here's a picture taken with
the IRENE Scanner of this disc,

04:00:05.140 --> 04:00:08.020
which is just broken
into four pieces.

04:00:08.020 --> 04:00:12.170
Even if you break it,
because the stress is changed

04:00:12.170 --> 04:00:16.840
in the broken things, the surfaces
just move even a little bit.

04:00:16.840 --> 04:00:20.980
And with 30 microns' depth of
field, once you cross the crack

04:00:20.980 --> 04:00:23.320
into the next region,
you're not in focus anymore.

04:00:23.320 --> 04:00:27.830
And it's very hard for focus
control to follow so quickly

04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:29.820
across such a sharp transition.

04:00:29.820 --> 04:00:34.260
Okay. So one approach that
we've taken to this is

04:00:34.260 --> 04:00:36.750
to develop a special version
of the scanning software

04:00:36.750 --> 04:00:42.780
that actually scans the
disc in both directions,

04:00:42.780 --> 04:00:52.930
and can accommodate the crack in
this way, getting one side in focus

04:00:52.930 --> 04:00:56.860
in one acquisition,
and the other side

04:00:56.860 --> 04:00:59.500
in focus in another acquisition.

04:00:59.500 --> 04:01:06.760
So with that data, we can actually
tell the control system how to end

04:01:06.760 --> 04:01:09.810
up in focus when you're
here, and how to end

04:01:09.810 --> 04:01:11.130
up in focus when you're here.

04:01:11.130 --> 04:01:14.660
And now we have two images,
and we have to merge them,

04:01:14.660 --> 04:01:21.260
so a process was developed
essentially pixel by pixel

04:01:21.260 --> 04:01:24.390
to decide what is in
focus and what isn't,

04:01:24.390 --> 04:01:28.620
and synthetically create
a super focused image

04:01:28.620 --> 04:01:32.000
by merging these different images
that complement each other.

04:01:32.000 --> 04:01:35.590
Now that works in a case like
this, where you're only broken

04:01:35.590 --> 04:01:37.590
into a couple of pieces,
but when the number

04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:39.340
of pieces approaches infinity --

04:01:39.340 --> 04:01:43.900
which is often what happens on
lacquer discs -- this doesn't work.

04:01:43.900 --> 04:01:47.690
You can't -- you just cannot get
things moving around fast enough.

04:01:47.690 --> 04:01:50.160
So another approach has
been under development,

04:01:50.160 --> 04:01:51.830
and one of our students is
writing his thesis on this,

04:01:51.830 --> 04:01:53.130
is to take actually
a stack of images,

04:01:53.130 --> 04:01:54.430
so that in some image,
everything is in focus.

04:01:54.430 --> 04:01:55.730
You know if you combine.

04:01:55.730 --> 04:01:57.030 position:56%
And then to use a statistical method
to merge, again pixel by pixel,

04:01:57.030 --> 04:01:58.330
to get a super focused
image from this big stack.

04:01:58.330 --> 04:01:59.630
So both of these views,
some related concepts.

04:01:59.630 --> 04:02:00.930
But we view them as good strategies
that I think are going to work

04:02:00.930 --> 04:02:02.730
out for bringing broken
discs together again.

04:02:02.730 --> 04:02:50.690
[ Music ]

04:02:50.690 --> 04:02:52.510
See I didn't put the bad part in.

04:02:52.510 --> 04:02:55.840
Okay. Okay, so the last
point I want to make is

04:02:55.840 --> 04:02:59.790
about the technical performance --
fundamental technical performance

04:02:59.790 --> 04:03:03.950
of 2-D and 3-D sensors, as
used for direct imaging.

04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:07.910
Sensors have spatial resolution,
which is well matched to the kind

04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:11.990
of submicron size of groove
modulations, and John talked

04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:16.670
about this and Ottar talked about
this, the scale of these things.

04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:23.400 position:56%
These sensors easily sample to in
excess of 100 kilohertz if required.

04:03:23.400 --> 04:03:26.960
But the scan speed is
proportional to sampling.

04:03:26.960 --> 04:03:30.150
So if you want to sample at 96
kilohertz, it takes twice as long

04:03:30.150 --> 04:03:32.020
as sampling at 48 kilohertz.

04:03:32.020 --> 04:03:34.540
Just, that's the way it works.

04:03:34.540 --> 04:03:38.230
The groove profile,
okay, the amplitude,

04:03:38.230 --> 04:03:42.250
is measured on many points
and the position is averaged.

04:03:42.250 --> 04:03:45.460
In 2D you measure a
couple of edge transitions,

04:03:45.460 --> 04:03:50.980
but on 3D you measure a dozen, two
dozen, 30 points across a groove,

04:03:50.980 --> 04:03:52.390
and you can combine those.

04:03:52.390 --> 04:03:58.710
Okay. So on a per point basis, one
of these 3D probes, for example,

04:03:58.710 --> 04:04:06.890
confocal probe, it can measure
the surface with a resolution,

04:04:06.890 --> 04:04:10.080
if you like, of something
like 12 or 13 bits.

04:04:10.080 --> 04:04:13.350
Just in terms of the
measurement of the surface.

04:04:13.350 --> 04:04:16.280
But the measurement of the
surface is not the audio.

04:04:16.280 --> 04:04:18.080
It's just a measurement
of the surface.

04:04:18.080 --> 04:04:22.280
Okay? The audio results
from averaging many points

04:04:22.280 --> 04:04:27.580 position:56%
and then differentiating the result,
because the audio is not the surface

04:04:27.580 --> 04:04:32.350
of the record, it's the speed
over which a stylus will move.

04:04:32.350 --> 04:04:36.770 position:56%
Okay. So simply asking how many bits

04:04:36.770 --> 04:04:41.740
of surface height I have is not the
same as what the audio is, okay?

04:04:41.740 --> 04:04:46.670
It's in fact difficult to
uniquely specify an audio bit depth

04:04:46.670 --> 04:04:48.580
in the same way that
people do when they talk

04:04:48.580 --> 04:04:54.840
about a simple voltage converter
of this synthetic result.

04:04:54.840 --> 04:04:58.860 position:56%
The real question, and I believe the
focus should be on this question,

04:04:58.860 --> 04:05:03.640
is whether the measurement
at the end is well matched

04:05:03.640 --> 04:05:06.920
to the effective bit
depth of the data itself.

04:05:06.920 --> 04:05:11.290
How much information is actually in
this audio that we're recovering?

04:05:11.290 --> 04:05:13.400
When we're talking about historical

04:05:13.400 --> 04:05:16.720
and old materials,
they're noise dominated.

04:05:16.720 --> 04:05:21.550
There's a limit to the amount
of information that's present

04:05:21.550 --> 04:05:25.360
in the vicinity of
so much random noise.

04:05:25.360 --> 04:05:29.990
Okay. So, what does
it mean when we say

04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:33.870
that we're digitizing an audio
recording to a certain bit depth?

04:05:33.870 --> 04:05:39.160
Regardless of the bit depth of
the ADC -- 24 bits, 16 bits --

04:05:39.160 --> 04:05:43.760
the effective bit depth, the
real bit depth, is always limited

04:05:43.760 --> 04:05:46.890
by the intrinsic noise
of the recording relative

04:05:46.890 --> 04:05:48.850
to the size of the signal.

04:05:48.850 --> 04:05:52.640
So we studied, for example, recent
stylus transfers that were done

04:05:52.640 --> 04:05:55.820
from field recorded wax cylinders,
like the Jesse Fuchs collection.

04:05:55.820 --> 04:05:58.910
Okay. When we compared
the signal and the noise,

04:05:58.910 --> 04:06:03.190
we found that the available
bit depth in a stylus transfer,

04:06:03.190 --> 04:06:08.350
even if it was digitized with a
24-bit ADC, is only either seven,

04:06:08.350 --> 04:06:12.350
or as little as four bits, when
you compare the noise level

04:06:12.350 --> 04:06:15.830
in those recordings to either the
maximum or the average signal.

04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:20.870
So you can use 100-bit
ADC, but it doesn't exist.

04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:25.800
But when you have random noise
present and a small signal,

04:06:25.800 --> 04:06:30.000
there's a limit to the amount of
information that's actually there.

04:06:30.000 --> 04:06:31.600
And also, when you
talk about bit depth,

04:06:31.600 --> 04:06:35.840
it also depends upon the
frequency and the distribution

04:06:35.840 --> 04:06:38.580
and the bandwidth over which
you make the measurement.

04:06:38.580 --> 04:06:44.040
The IRENE Optical scans in 2D
and 3D are more than sufficient

04:06:44.040 --> 04:06:48.900
to measure these signal-to-noise
levels,

04:06:48.900 --> 04:06:52.390
as well as even lower noise
levels on newer cylinders,

04:06:52.390 --> 04:06:56.890
and are in fact flat to
100 kilohertz if required,

04:06:56.890 --> 04:07:01.220
which I argued in this
morning's presentation.

04:07:01.220 --> 04:07:02.610
The thing to keep in mind is

04:07:02.610 --> 04:07:07.410
that any measured data set has
an effective number of bits.

04:07:07.410 --> 04:07:11.870
Okay. And that effective number of
bits is limited by the relationship

04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:13.530
between the signal and the noise.

04:07:13.530 --> 04:07:16.990
No matter how many bits your
ADC has, the effective number

04:07:16.990 --> 04:07:21.090
of bits is limited by the
random noise in the data.

04:07:21.090 --> 04:07:25.900
Okay, finally I want
to talk a little bit

04:07:25.900 --> 04:07:27.220
about education and training.

04:07:27.220 --> 04:07:28.520
I mentioned that this morning.

04:07:28.520 --> 04:07:31.600
We have had a very significant
student participation

04:07:31.600 --> 04:07:32.900
in this project.

04:07:32.900 --> 04:07:36.230
There have been about 20
University of California undergrads

04:07:36.230 --> 04:07:40.080
and about 20 thesis students from
the University of Applied Sciences

04:07:40.080 --> 04:07:44.750
in Fribourg, and also
from ZHAW in Zurich.

04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:47.470
They have been in fields
like electrical engineering,

04:07:47.470 --> 04:07:51.100
mechanical engineering,
physics, anthropology.

04:07:51.100 --> 04:07:54.280
They've worked on measurements, on
data analysis, on code development,

04:07:54.280 --> 04:07:57.800
algorithms, and it's been a great
opportunity to expose students

04:07:57.800 --> 04:08:00.510
in engineering and physical
sciences to problems

04:08:00.510 --> 04:08:02.280
in preservation and conservation.

04:08:02.280 --> 04:08:07.050
Olivia Dell, she just
graduated from Cal as a physics

04:08:07.050 --> 04:08:08.520
and art history double major,

04:08:08.520 --> 04:08:12.520 position:56%
and she received an undergraduate
research prize that's supporting her

04:08:12.520 --> 04:08:16.000
to work on this big
cylinder transfer project

04:08:16.000 --> 04:08:18.100
over this next year.

04:08:18.100 --> 04:08:22.270
So, I don't know, I'm hoping
that maybe she's going to go

04:08:22.270 --> 04:08:25.170
on to do preservation science
with this great art history

04:08:25.170 --> 04:08:27.080
and physics background,
but we'll see.

04:08:27.080 --> 04:08:28.380
We'll see what it takes her.

04:08:28.380 --> 04:08:29.680
She's brilliant.

04:08:29.680 --> 04:08:33.920
So, to conclude, I hope
that in the greater context,

04:08:33.920 --> 04:08:39.270
and also specifically with
IRENE, I've given you the idea

04:08:39.270 --> 04:08:42.840
that digital technology
of today provides a window

04:08:42.840 --> 04:08:45.670
on this great period
of sound recording

04:08:45.670 --> 04:08:47.150
that we've been focusing on.

04:08:47.150 --> 04:08:49.630
So Bill Veillette from
NEDCC, he told me,

04:08:49.630 --> 04:08:51.690
"Your ultimate audience
is posterity."

04:08:51.690 --> 04:08:54.060
I don't know if he tells
everybody that, but,

04:08:54.060 --> 04:08:56.920
I like that, so I keep
it in my talk.

04:08:56.920 --> 04:09:02.170 position:56%
Irene.lbl.gov is the project website
and there's Phoebe A. Hearst Museum

04:09:02.170 --> 04:09:08.540 position:56%
of Anthropology.html has a more
focused discussion of the importance

04:09:08.540 --> 04:09:13.070
of having a high resolution
flat frequency distribution

04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:15.410
for capturing vertical media,

04:09:15.410 --> 04:09:17.800
so I draw you to that
if you're interested.

04:09:17.800 --> 04:09:19.600
Thank you.

04:09:19.600 --> 04:09:28.460
[ Applause ]

04:09:28.460 --> 04:09:30.650
So, Peter's running away?

04:09:30.650 --> 04:09:35.430
So, we're going to
do questions right?

04:09:35.430 --> 04:09:36.730
For all of us?

04:09:36.730 --> 04:09:38.030
&gt;&gt; Yes.

04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:40.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I can sit down?

04:09:40.880 --> 04:09:42.180
&gt;&gt; Question for Carl.

04:09:42.180 --> 04:09:45.840
This is Martin Jacobson from
the U.S. National Archives.

04:09:45.840 --> 04:09:48.370
You may have said it, I may
have missed it, but I'm assuming

04:09:48.370 --> 04:09:52.230
that the IRENE system uses
a laser light which is close

04:09:52.230 --> 04:09:55.970
to a sign wave, is that right?

04:09:55.970 --> 04:10:00.100
Or are you using a
frequency spectrum?

04:10:00.100 --> 04:10:02.130
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: I'm not sure
what you mean by a light --

04:10:02.130 --> 04:10:03.430
&gt;&gt; Sensor as the [inaudible].

04:10:03.430 --> 04:10:08.170
&gt;&gt; What is the wave length of
the light that you're using

04:10:08.170 --> 04:10:10.850
for reading the information
off the disc?

04:10:10.850 --> 04:10:12.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: For the 2D or the 3D?

04:10:12.150 --> 04:10:14.760
&gt;&gt; Either one.

04:10:14.760 --> 04:10:18.490
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay, basically,
we're talking about white light.

04:10:18.490 --> 04:10:26.780
In the case of the 3D sensor, the
light source is a xenon arc lamp,

04:10:26.780 --> 04:10:29.140
which is a fairly broad
frequency spectrum.

04:10:29.140 --> 04:10:34.470
And because the 3D sensor uses
this color based confocal imaging,

04:10:34.470 --> 04:10:35.910
in fact, that's what you want.

04:10:35.910 --> 04:10:39.060
You want a lot of color
so you can disperse them

04:10:39.060 --> 04:10:42.700
and then use them individually
to find the light.

04:10:42.700 --> 04:10:50.000 position:56%
For the 2D imaging, we've used a
variety of white light sources also.

04:10:50.000 --> 04:10:52.490
Some LED based, some xenon based.

04:10:52.490 --> 04:10:56.610
But you -- some of these
applications are light starved

04:10:56.610 --> 04:11:01.230
and so having bright light
illuminators that are flat

04:11:01.230 --> 04:11:03.510
in time is really important.

04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:04.890
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

04:11:04.890 --> 04:11:06.190
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Sure.

04:11:12.040 --> 04:11:15.390
&gt;&gt; Well, we're talking about
preservation, and so far,

04:11:15.390 --> 04:11:18.460
I don't think I've heard
anyone talk about stampers.

04:11:18.460 --> 04:11:20.770
This would be the equivalent
of going back

04:11:20.770 --> 04:11:23.860
to an original printed book as
opposed to a photocopy book,

04:11:23.860 --> 04:11:28.300
if you wanted to make a microfilm
preservation copy in the old days.

04:11:29.370 --> 04:11:34.450 position:56%
Why is it that -- aside from the
absence of stampers, and, of course,

04:11:34.450 --> 04:11:38.320
many of those were melted
down for the base metal.

04:11:38.320 --> 04:11:43.630 position:56%
Why is it that there isn't a greater
degree of emphasis on going back

04:11:43.630 --> 04:11:47.740
to the or, or text if
you will, the basic text.

04:11:47.740 --> 04:11:50.730
Which is the original.

04:11:50.730 --> 04:11:53.400
And is IRENE, or are
the other systems

04:11:53.400 --> 04:11:56.430
that have been brought forward,
capable of handling stampers?

04:11:56.430 --> 04:11:57.730
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay,
there's no reason

04:11:57.730 --> 04:11:59.410
that you can't scan a stamper.

04:11:59.410 --> 04:12:04.090
It's just upside down,
depending on how you look at it.

04:12:04.090 --> 04:12:08.660
One of the items from the Volta
Lab collection that is on display

04:12:08.660 --> 04:12:13.170
at the Smithsonian is actually a --
or a stamper, I guess, it's like,

04:12:13.170 --> 04:12:15.640
I don't know, Patrick, tell me
if I'm wrong, but I think it's

04:12:15.640 --> 04:12:17.420
like the first stamper, right.

04:12:17.420 --> 04:12:20.550
It's a little laterally cut disc

04:12:20.550 --> 04:12:24.050
that is a copper electrotype
taken off wax

04:12:24.050 --> 04:12:25.860
that they must have sacrificed.

04:12:25.860 --> 04:12:29.710
So, they actually worked
very really well, I have it.

04:12:29.710 --> 04:12:34.190
But from time to time,
stampers have come up.

04:12:34.190 --> 04:12:38.750
We -- as you know, there are
Galvano's, and we did scan --

04:12:38.750 --> 04:12:42.110
I didn't have time to include
it, but we scanned a Galvano,

04:12:42.110 --> 04:12:46.090
which was a sacrificial
Galvano, so it opened up,

04:12:46.090 --> 04:12:49.470
but it's certainly possible to get
a probe now that's small enough

04:12:49.470 --> 04:12:55.580
to fit inside a Galvano and
scan the inside surface.

04:12:55.580 --> 04:12:59.380
So, for folks that don't know,
at the Berlin Phonogram Archive,

04:12:59.380 --> 04:13:05.150
the mode of operation was to
bring in the new wax cylinder

04:13:05.150 --> 04:13:08.420
and immediately make a
copper electrotype of it

04:13:08.420 --> 04:13:13.160
and then sacrifice the original,
and then cast duplicates

04:13:13.160 --> 04:13:16.450
for the customer, or the
user, or the scholar.

04:13:16.450 --> 04:13:19.920
And they've recently
revitalized that process,

04:13:19.920 --> 04:13:24.390
but they have 20,000 Galvanos,
or something in Berlin.

04:13:24.390 --> 04:13:27.430
So that would be the
cylinder version of a stamper.

04:13:27.430 --> 04:13:31.930
But yeah, there's even a
little control in the IRENE,

04:13:31.930 --> 04:13:37.320
in the 3D analysis program, if
it's a stamper, flip it, you know.

04:13:37.320 --> 04:13:41.350
&gt;&gt; So, I showed a Berliner
disc, which is a stamper.

04:13:41.350 --> 04:13:43.300
They're very -- they're
actually easier to measure

04:13:43.300 --> 04:13:45.000
in some respects than
the other discs.

04:13:52.180 --> 04:13:53.480
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: In the front.

04:13:53.480 --> 04:13:56.070
&gt;&gt; Well I guess all of the
cylinders are master records, so.

04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:57.800
Likely directly recorded.

04:13:57.800 --> 04:14:00.000
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Right, so
that's, but they're not stampers.

04:14:00.000 --> 04:14:04.200
&gt;&gt; But, you introduced a social
aspect the university social aspect

04:14:04.200 --> 04:14:06.950
in your slide on educational
factors.

04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:08.560
I noticed that you had --

04:14:08.560 --> 04:14:11.860
you claimed 40 students
involved with these projects.

04:14:11.860 --> 04:14:14.550
And at Berkeley, all
20 were undergraduates

04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:18.120
and no master's or PhD students.

04:14:18.120 --> 04:14:20.950
And the thesis students
were all Fribourg.

04:14:20.950 --> 04:14:22.250
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: [Inaudible] --

04:14:22.250 --> 04:14:26.080
&gt;&gt; Does that imply
that you were not able

04:14:26.080 --> 04:14:30.190
to interest regular faculty
members and departments

04:14:30.190 --> 04:14:32.420
at Berkeley in these projects?

04:14:32.420 --> 04:14:33.800
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: That's
a great question.

04:14:33.800 --> 04:14:39.390
We've been very successful in our
collaboration with our colleagues

04:14:39.390 --> 04:14:44.090
in Switzerland and we've had many
masters and bachelor students.

04:14:44.090 --> 04:14:47.630
By the way, these Swiss
bachelor students are essentially

04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:50.400
like American master students,
in terms of what they have to do.

04:14:50.400 --> 04:14:54.480
They have to write 150-page
thesis, which is original.

04:14:54.480 --> 04:14:58.160
And we actually have twice as many,
because they also come and work

04:14:58.160 --> 04:15:00.460
with us on high energy
physics projects.

04:15:00.460 --> 04:15:03.480
But we -- and -- so we've had
a number of master students

04:15:03.480 --> 04:15:05.690
and bachelor students that
all do major thesis work

04:15:05.690 --> 04:15:07.250
that take months and months.

04:15:07.250 --> 04:15:13.690
But we have never had any Berkeley
professor in a technical field,

04:15:13.690 --> 04:15:18.130
you know, kind of say, "Let's work
together," or something like that.

04:15:18.130 --> 04:15:20.990
With the -- with this new
project with the libraries

04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:25.020
and the linguistics department, we
are linked up now with professors

04:15:25.020 --> 04:15:28.580
and faculty who have a research
interest in the materials.

04:15:28.580 --> 04:15:31.210
But, for example, no
engineering professor, has --

04:15:31.210 --> 04:15:34.250
and I think the reason why is

04:15:34.250 --> 04:15:37.170
because in major research
universities,

04:15:37.170 --> 04:15:41.670
people have big programs
that they're already into.

04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:43.620
That's why they're there
at those universities

04:15:43.620 --> 04:15:47.210
and they're typically not looking
for some cool little project

04:15:47.210 --> 04:15:50.470
to like donate their students to.

04:15:50.470 --> 04:15:53.750
And it's different, New Yorkers
may be more open minded to this,

04:15:53.750 --> 04:15:57.170
but I think it's hard
in American universities

04:15:57.170 --> 04:16:02.720
to make this kind of change.

04:16:02.720 --> 04:16:04.520
Sure.

04:16:04.520 --> 04:16:09.500
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

04:16:09.500 --> 04:16:12.220
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to say
that I worked in the U.K.

04:16:12.220 --> 04:16:19.750
until a few years ago and I was
actually able to get funding

04:16:19.750 --> 04:16:24.420
for Ph.D. students to work on audio
preservation, specifically bring

04:16:24.420 --> 04:16:28.650
in doctoral students to do
audio preservation projects,

04:16:28.650 --> 04:16:31.820
which you can't do the
same kind of thing here.

04:16:31.820 --> 04:16:35.650
I mean, I got HRC funding
specifically to do that.

04:16:35.650 --> 04:16:36.950
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: And you, you...

04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:38.430
&gt;&gt; And that's just a different
way that the funding works.

04:16:38.430 --> 04:16:39.730
&gt;&gt; Well, that's humanities.

04:16:39.730 --> 04:16:41.490
Yeah, in engineering
it's quite difficult.

04:16:41.490 --> 04:16:42.790
I think I did one.

04:16:42.790 --> 04:16:44.090
Yeah.

04:16:44.090 --> 04:16:46.200
&gt;&gt; But the structure is
there in a way that it isn't.

04:16:46.200 --> 04:16:48.530
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: I mean I've
felt that there's a bunch

04:16:48.530 --> 04:16:51.900
of projects would have been
great Ph.D. projects for students

04:16:51.900 --> 04:16:53.240
in electrical engineering,

04:16:53.240 --> 04:16:56.860
information technology,
library science.

04:16:56.860 --> 04:16:58.450
It would be great to collaborate

04:16:58.450 --> 04:17:02.330
with an American colleague,
but it's not happened.

04:17:02.330 --> 04:17:05.920
And you know, I presented this
work on campus numerous times,

04:17:05.920 --> 04:17:08.000
in the statistics department, the
engineering school, and so forth.

04:17:16.340 --> 04:17:20.210
&gt;&gt; Yes, I would maybe
complement what Carl say.

04:17:20.210 --> 04:17:26.550
I had in Fribourg maybe 20 students
working on their bachelor thesis

04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:31.680
or master's thesis, and
one Ph.D. thesis also.

04:17:31.680 --> 04:17:36.240
And, in addition, yes, many
of my students went to Carl.

04:17:36.240 --> 04:17:40.150
It's very easy to convince
them send them to Berkeley,

04:17:40.150 --> 04:17:41.970
California, San Francisco.

04:17:41.970 --> 04:17:46.780
And that's why our students, some
other student, they go to Berkeley

04:17:46.780 --> 04:17:48.720
to do work for Geneva, you know.

04:17:48.720 --> 04:17:54.130 position:56%
For the [inaudible] -- So I
believe sometimes it's the geography

04:17:54.130 --> 04:17:58.680
and probably maybe I would be more
successful than Carl if in trying

04:17:58.680 --> 04:18:01.500
to get Berkeley students,
because coming

04:18:01.500 --> 04:18:06.950
to Switzerland could be
interesting for them.

04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:11.500
&gt;&gt; Yes. I have a question regarding
has there been any discussion

04:18:11.500 --> 04:18:13.720 position:56%
about establishing a business model.

04:18:13.720 --> 04:18:18.410
In particular, if we get the
universal player, the ideal thing

04:18:18.410 --> 04:18:21.040
that we have the Center of
Excellence and we can now go

04:18:21.040 --> 04:18:23.320
from one institution to another,

04:18:23.320 --> 04:18:27.410
and everybody is capturing
the data one way.

04:18:27.410 --> 04:18:29.650
Everything you've been
talking about so far is very,

04:18:29.650 --> 04:18:32.040
very heavily dependent on software.

04:18:32.040 --> 04:18:35.320
Very different than buying a
needle, buying a turntable.

04:18:35.320 --> 04:18:39.470
Once you get into the realm
of software dependency,

04:18:39.470 --> 04:18:44.280 position:56%
who will have ownership of the
source code and how will we preserve

04:18:44.280 --> 04:18:47.390
that and allow this, if we
develop this universal tool,

04:18:47.390 --> 04:18:50.510
to continue for posterity sake?

04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:53.760
Because if we don't
have access to that,

04:18:53.760 --> 04:18:56.490
we are going to become obsolete
in a very different way.

04:18:56.490 --> 04:19:00.420
I appreciate the brilliance
on stage, but like records,

04:19:00.420 --> 04:19:02.140
we all don't live forever.

04:19:02.140 --> 04:19:03.440
So how do you do that?

04:19:03.440 --> 04:19:05.020
&gt;&gt; All right, can I,
can I take this one?

04:19:05.020 --> 04:19:06.320
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Yeah.

04:19:06.320 --> 04:19:09.320
&gt;&gt; Because actually a lot of
the clever software is actually

04:19:09.320 --> 04:19:12.180
in the control system
for the measurement.

04:19:12.180 --> 04:19:14.440
And if you have a system and
it's doing the measurement

04:19:14.440 --> 04:19:17.890
and you're producing the data,
and then circulating the data,

04:19:17.890 --> 04:19:21.180
the data's actually
quite easy to interpret.

04:19:21.180 --> 04:19:24.930
Most people with an
undergraduate degree in physics

04:19:24.930 --> 04:19:27.500
or engineering could just
write a piece of code,

04:19:27.500 --> 04:19:30.480
probably first year,
to get the sound off.

04:19:30.480 --> 04:19:34.220
There's nothing particularly clever
in the way the sound is taken

04:19:34.220 --> 04:19:37.290
from the three dimensional data.

04:19:37.290 --> 04:19:40.470
&gt;&gt; Isn't there in the
algorithms that are then applied?

04:19:40.470 --> 04:19:44.990
So by definition, if you're
capturing raw data, Level 1,

04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:48.730
think like a Photoshop model,
you've got the raw data.

04:19:48.730 --> 04:19:52.570
The very next thing that happens,
and you say it very casually,

04:19:52.570 --> 04:19:54.810
"Okay," and then we get
rid of some of the noise.

04:19:54.810 --> 04:19:57.380
That's a decision someone is making

04:19:57.380 --> 04:20:00.850
in defining what particular
algorithm they're going to use

04:20:00.850 --> 04:20:03.620
versus the algorithm somebody else
might use to get rid of noise.

04:20:03.620 --> 04:20:06.020
&gt;&gt; You can then load
Audacity for free.

04:20:06.020 --> 04:20:09.410
And Audacity is an
incredible sound system

04:20:09.410 --> 04:20:11.690
for actually taking the noise out.

04:20:11.690 --> 04:20:13.120
You can control everything.

04:20:13.120 --> 04:20:14.430
It's free on the internet.

04:20:14.430 --> 04:20:20.200
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So I agree with
John that conceptually a lot

04:20:20.200 --> 04:20:24.300
of the transformations are
not actually that complicated.

04:20:24.300 --> 04:20:27.670
However, I definitely
appreciate the sentiment

04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:30.300
of your question and your comment.

04:20:30.300 --> 04:20:34.550
And I have to say that when
we started down this road,

04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:41.490
because the Library of Congress
engaged so early and so strongly

04:20:41.490 --> 04:20:46.420
to this, we felt like it was a
good -- that was a good way to go.

04:20:46.420 --> 04:20:49.450
Because here we were
working with an institution

04:20:49.450 --> 04:20:53.340
that has this important leadership
role, at least nationally

04:20:53.340 --> 04:20:56.440
and as a collegial institution
with the British Library

04:20:56.440 --> 04:20:58.570
and the others internationally.

04:20:58.570 --> 04:21:04.170
And frankly, mostly we're in
service to public collections.

04:21:04.170 --> 04:21:08.470
So I think that this thing really
belongs in the public domain

04:21:08.470 --> 04:21:10.290
and that institutions
like the Library

04:21:10.290 --> 04:21:14.450
of Congress should be the places

04:21:14.450 --> 04:21:18.450
where these tools have
their ultimate home

04:21:18.450 --> 04:21:24.470
and that they're validated
and they're specified,

04:21:24.470 --> 04:21:28.890
and they're maintained, and they're
distributed freely and openly.

04:21:28.890 --> 04:21:37.710
So a business model of a basically
a not for profit free, open source,

04:21:37.710 --> 04:21:42.390
community of users and
developers, guided by the Library

04:21:42.390 --> 04:21:47.570
or some international consortia
of research libraries, whatever,

04:21:47.570 --> 04:21:52.930
but I think it belongs in the
central publicly controlled

04:21:52.930 --> 04:21:55.810
and publicly spirited in place.

04:21:55.810 --> 04:22:00.170
But, yes, I think there does
need to be a stability to it.

04:22:00.170 --> 04:22:04.370
But I think that's not a -- I think
that belongs at Apple or Google,

04:22:04.370 --> 04:22:08.060
or some company that
has its own agenda.

04:22:08.060 --> 04:22:10.990 position:56%
It belongs in the public institution
like the Library of Congress.

04:22:10.990 --> 04:22:12.290
&gt;&gt; I was hoping you would say that.

04:22:12.290 --> 04:22:14.090
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

04:22:14.090 --> 04:22:17.160
[ Laughter ]

04:22:17.160 --> 04:22:22.330
&gt;&gt; First of all, I love to hear
democratization of access talk.

04:22:22.330 --> 04:22:23.630
That's really great.

04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:29.650
But in general, when you start
talking about archival and,

04:22:29.650 --> 04:22:32.000
you know, sharing these data
sets and things like that,

04:22:32.000 --> 04:22:36.160
one of my concerns is
always size of the data set.

04:22:36.160 --> 04:22:41.170 position:56%
So, could you provide -- I know it's
completely dependent upon sampling

04:22:41.170 --> 04:22:46.400
and the original source
material, how quickly you have

04:22:46.400 --> 04:22:51.280
to sample along that, but could
you bracket perhaps what size

04:22:51.280 --> 04:22:53.360
of data sets we're talking
about in these image sets.

04:22:53.360 --> 04:22:55.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Yeah, so for example,
maybe Bill or Mason, because you're,

04:22:55.740 --> 04:22:59.280
you're producing these data
sets for your customers.

04:22:59.280 --> 04:23:01.170
I mean I can toss out some numbers.

04:23:01.170 --> 04:23:03.780
They're going to have the
gigabyte connected to them.

04:23:03.780 --> 04:23:06.550
But, I don't know, is
Mason and Bill here?

04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:08.490
Yeah. What do you, what
are you giving out?

04:23:08.490 --> 04:23:11.170
&gt;&gt; Sure. Cylinders are
typically about a gigabyte.

04:23:11.170 --> 04:23:13.660
For a four-inch cylinder,
one-and-a-half [inaudible].

04:23:13.660 --> 04:23:15.600
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: The raw,
the raw image data.

04:23:15.600 --> 04:23:16.900
&gt;&gt; For just the raw image data.

04:23:16.900 --> 04:23:21.350
And then discs are 30 to 80,
depending on the speed and size.

04:23:21.350 --> 04:23:22.650
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Right.

04:23:22.650 --> 04:23:25.170
But if you sample at twice the
speed that you're doing, or three,

04:23:25.170 --> 04:23:28.190
then they're just going to grow
linearly with sample speed.

04:23:28.190 --> 04:23:29.490
&gt;&gt; That's right.

04:23:29.490 --> 04:23:30.790
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So,
were talking gigabyte,

04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:32.090
kind of, you know, data sets.

04:23:38.060 --> 04:23:41.250
&gt;&gt; When you're talking about
the commercial or the workflows

04:23:41.250 --> 04:23:43.550
and you're trying to, not
so much commercialize it,

04:23:43.550 --> 04:23:45.670
but send it off to
production, right?

04:23:45.670 --> 04:23:46.970
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Yeah.

04:23:46.970 --> 04:23:48.270
&gt;&gt; How do you quality control?

04:23:48.270 --> 04:23:51.730 position:56%
So if you're reading at three times
the speed, do you still have someone

04:23:51.730 --> 04:23:53.520
that has to listen to
the whole 15 minutes.

04:23:53.520 --> 04:23:55.860
What do you do on that side?

04:23:55.860 --> 04:23:58.310
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay, so it's
not, when you say reading

04:23:58.310 --> 04:24:00.450
at three times the speed,
you're saying you're having

04:24:00.450 --> 04:24:02.700
like many parallel lines
running at the same time?

04:24:02.700 --> 04:24:06.180
&gt;&gt; I guess I'm saying once you scan
it, right, somewhere you're going

04:24:06.180 --> 04:24:09.380
to scan, you're going to
create the sound file, right?

04:24:09.380 --> 04:24:11.410 position:56%
Who quality controls the sound file?

04:24:11.410 --> 04:24:14.140 position:56%
So that you can gain efficient sets.

04:24:14.140 --> 04:24:16.540
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So, Peter, you
pretty much designed the work flow

04:24:16.540 --> 04:24:17.840
that was used.

04:24:17.840 --> 04:24:24.510
So, do you, do you
want to field that?

04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:29.350
&gt;&gt; Well, so, as you turn your
image file into an audio file,

04:24:29.350 --> 04:24:33.440
the way Carl and Earl
designed the IRENE software,

04:24:33.440 --> 04:24:38.580
it effectively has what's called
tracking, so you can visually see

04:24:38.580 --> 04:24:45.100
that it's lining up with the
actual grooves in the media.

04:24:45.100 --> 04:24:49.500
So the biggest problem in
terms of a general sense

04:24:49.500 --> 04:24:51.680
of getting an unacceptable kind

04:24:51.680 --> 04:24:54.770
of output would be
when it missed tracks.

04:24:54.770 --> 04:24:57.690
Now if you want to get into
the weeds and say, you know,

04:24:57.690 --> 04:25:01.370
the absolute best you can get out
of the image, that is more of a,

04:25:01.370 --> 04:25:03.730
you know, you're going to have
to get in there and listen to it

04:25:03.730 --> 04:25:05.580
and tweak parameters and things.

04:25:05.580 --> 04:25:08.770
But we were trying
to do it more in a --

04:25:08.770 --> 04:25:10.870
what would be a high
throughput mode,

04:25:10.870 --> 04:25:13.560
in which case you wouldn't
necessarily listen to everything.

04:25:13.560 --> 04:25:17.190
And in that case, if you
get the tracking right,

04:25:17.190 --> 04:25:20.510
the audio generally
falls into place.

04:25:20.510 --> 04:25:25.740
And so, that's a fairly
easy failure to detect.

04:25:25.740 --> 04:25:28.350
And so that's the way
we approached it.

04:25:28.350 --> 04:25:29.650
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Right.

04:25:29.650 --> 04:25:33.050
So the IRENE analysis code
keeps track of how many defects,

04:25:33.050 --> 04:25:37.170
how many dust particles, how many
scratches, how many conditions

04:25:37.170 --> 04:25:41.840
that fail various cut
levels, threshold levels,

04:25:41.840 --> 04:25:43.710
are accumulated throughout
the analysis.

04:25:43.710 --> 04:25:47.930
So you can also have a report,
a histogram, a bar graph,

04:25:47.930 --> 04:25:51.860
that comes out which is telling
you about the data quality, yeah.

04:25:51.860 --> 04:25:55.680
But, I mean -- yeah, these
issues -- I mean, the closest --

04:25:55.680 --> 04:26:00.350 position:56%
I mean, working like in physics, we
do experiment, we're taking data day

04:26:00.350 --> 04:26:04.020
and night, producing huge amounts,
and there's quality reports

04:26:04.020 --> 04:26:07.060
that just stream out and
somebody watches and looks

04:26:07.060 --> 04:26:09.180
for outliers and things, and yeah.

04:26:09.180 --> 04:26:10.710
So there's many, many approaches.

04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:13.110
And I'm sure in industrial
settings they have all kinds

04:26:13.110 --> 04:26:15.000
of statistical process
stuff that they do.

04:26:20.660 --> 04:26:23.050
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering
in the Swedish --

04:26:23.050 --> 04:26:29.370
you're very close to
getting to the point

04:26:29.370 --> 04:26:31.790
of where you're going
to see the results.

04:26:31.790 --> 04:26:35.590
And given what we heard,
what is your sort

04:26:35.590 --> 04:26:39.200
of prognosis for the outcome?

04:26:39.200 --> 04:26:42.780
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Yeah, we
have first to see the result

04:26:42.780 --> 04:26:48.680
from them now in the end of August
and we have to validate the result

04:26:48.680 --> 04:26:52.510
that we have asked them for.

04:26:52.510 --> 04:26:53.810
And --

04:26:53.810 --> 04:26:57.910
&gt;&gt; I think the reason I asked is
the second one, which was the LP.

04:26:57.910 --> 04:26:59.250
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: LP,
yes, that's right.

04:26:59.250 --> 04:27:02.230
&gt;&gt; It seemed a bit, I don't know,

04:27:02.230 --> 04:27:06.980
not exactly what I expected
from an LP recording.

04:27:06.980 --> 04:27:08.280
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: No.

04:27:08.280 --> 04:27:14.930
I have a bit away, ongoing, and
this is the first result they have

04:27:14.930 --> 04:27:18.400
managed and we -- they're
having the beginning told us

04:27:18.400 --> 04:27:25.380
that 78s is much easier than LP and
they have started with the LP's.

04:27:25.380 --> 04:27:31.670
And when I come back here
to Sweden, they have,

04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:37.900
are going to make a
demonstration of the project,

04:27:37.900 --> 04:27:44.750
so for more precisely,
and I don't know.

04:27:44.750 --> 04:27:50.650
The other two say that the
vinyl discs are a big problem

04:27:50.650 --> 04:27:55.770
and I can't say more about it.

04:27:55.770 --> 04:28:00.730
And I was very surprised
from one of the companies

04:28:00.730 --> 04:28:07.170
that are very promising and they
think, "Oh, this will be for 78's,"

04:28:07.170 --> 04:28:14.040
enough good results in the
reports they will give us

04:28:14.040 --> 04:28:16.650
in the end of this, of the August.

04:28:16.650 --> 04:28:18.140
And I don't worry.

04:28:18.140 --> 04:28:19.440
I am eager to hear.

04:28:19.440 --> 04:28:24.640 position:56%
I'm not expecting in the -- and I'll
take all this information with me

04:28:24.640 --> 04:28:28.220
to Sweden from the
Carl and all others,

04:28:28.220 --> 04:28:35.090
and mix this information together
and give the next step for us.

04:28:35.090 --> 04:28:36.610
I think so.

04:28:36.610 --> 04:28:39.610
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: You know, listening
to the examples that you played.

04:28:39.610 --> 04:28:45.060
I was thinking that maybe they
were not applying a derivative

04:28:45.060 --> 04:28:46.980
to the data that they were taking.

04:28:46.980 --> 04:28:49.250
They were just playing
the shape of the groove.

04:28:49.250 --> 04:28:50.580
That's the way it sounded.

04:28:50.580 --> 04:28:54.580
And it didn't sound like they were
also then applying the normal EQ

04:28:54.580 --> 04:28:55.880
curves to them.

04:28:55.880 --> 04:28:57.180
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: Exactly.

04:28:57.180 --> 04:28:58.480
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So that will
definitely change the sound

04:28:58.480 --> 04:28:59.780
if they do.

04:28:59.780 --> 04:29:01.690
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: And they --

04:29:01.690 --> 04:29:07.000
if they also say is that if you
have the picture, you can go on

04:29:07.000 --> 04:29:11.630
and use the picture
for preprocessing --

04:29:11.630 --> 04:29:16.850
after processing the picture,

04:29:16.850 --> 04:29:23.950
and that's what I know
about imaging and so on.

04:29:23.950 --> 04:29:29.910
I really don't know much more about
the process to make this pictures

04:29:29.910 --> 04:29:35.870
and imaging and I hope
they have the competence

04:29:35.870 --> 04:29:45.940
to make the best result they can
do with our project, and we'll see.

04:29:45.940 --> 04:29:47.240
Yeah.

04:29:49.360 --> 04:29:51.180
&gt;&gt; This is a good sideway
to my question,

04:29:51.180 --> 04:29:58.130
which is about what is the
bottleneck for getting faster

04:29:58.130 --> 04:30:00.190
than real time transfers?

04:30:00.190 --> 04:30:03.570
Is it the size of the light beam

04:30:03.570 --> 04:30:08.130
or why can't it be done
much faster than real time?

04:30:08.130 --> 04:30:09.820
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So the 3D probes,

04:30:09.820 --> 04:30:16.360
the best ones take
nearly 200 points at once.

04:30:16.360 --> 04:30:20.350
And they take them at a
certain exposure time.

04:30:20.350 --> 04:30:22.130
They just need to expose.

04:30:22.130 --> 04:30:27.080
And so, they can run as fast
as 2000 exposures a second,

04:30:27.080 --> 04:30:31.370
for the nearly 200
points, and when you just,

04:30:31.370 --> 04:30:35.970
if you just do the arithmetic of
how many exposures you have to take

04:30:35.970 --> 04:30:40.070
to cover the surface
area of whatever it is,

04:30:40.070 --> 04:30:44.430
that works out to more
than real time.

04:30:44.430 --> 04:30:50.480 position:56%
Depending upon the density, it could
be for say a four-inch cylinder,

04:30:50.480 --> 04:30:53.330
it could be 20 minutes or
it could be a few hours.

04:30:53.330 --> 04:30:54.970
Depending on what you want.

04:30:54.970 --> 04:30:59.220
So you need either faster probes --
and that's going to mean they have

04:30:59.220 --> 04:31:05.380
to be brighter basically,
or probes with more points.

04:31:05.380 --> 04:31:06.680
You could imagine that.

04:31:06.680 --> 04:31:08.900
I mean when we started,
it was a one-point probe

04:31:08.900 --> 04:31:11.340
and then suddenly it
became 180-point probe.

04:31:11.340 --> 04:31:13.340
There's now 190-point probe.

04:31:13.340 --> 04:31:15.770
I've heard them talking
about 1000point probe.

04:31:15.770 --> 04:31:20.300
But once you get to 1,000 points,
you start to get into issues of,

04:31:20.300 --> 04:31:24.100
you know, it becomes big and
systematic things pop up.

04:31:24.100 --> 04:31:27.940
You could run multiple
probes in parallel, okay.

04:31:27.940 --> 04:31:32.690
But your cost goes up by a factor
of twofor -- start adding probes.

04:31:32.690 --> 04:31:36.710
Probes are like $50,000, okay.

04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:42.960
For the IRENE and visual
audio 2D scanners,

04:31:42.960 --> 04:31:46.920
one of the bottlenecks is
just like disc writing speed

04:31:46.920 --> 04:31:48.680
for the data you're generating.

04:31:48.680 --> 04:31:52.460
The 2D scanning I think
has the greatest.

04:31:52.460 --> 04:31:56.100 position:56%
Because right now, it takes like 15
minutes to scan a three-minute disc.

04:31:56.100 --> 04:32:03.360
I think there's hope along those
lines of pushing that, but maybe,

04:32:03.360 --> 04:32:05.870
Earl, you want to comment, because
you've thought about this a lot.

04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:07.640
Where do you see it going?

04:32:07.640 --> 04:32:12.210
&gt;&gt; Right, so we're definitely
sort of a factor to speed limited

04:32:12.210 --> 04:32:13.790
by disc writing currently.

04:32:13.790 --> 04:32:16.430
And that's just because we
haven't taken the time to,

04:32:16.430 --> 04:32:18.950
body, or research the faster.

04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:21.680
And then of course, we're
still light limited as well.

04:32:21.680 --> 04:32:23.880
I mean once you get
past that factor too,

04:32:23.880 --> 04:32:26.040
then it becomes a light
limiting factor.

04:32:26.040 --> 04:32:29.510
&gt;&gt; So, can I make a
comment -- comments here.

04:32:29.510 --> 04:32:33.560
I mean the only reason for
increasing the speed is throughput.

04:32:33.560 --> 04:32:36.960
But if you automate,
then you don't need it.

04:32:36.960 --> 04:32:38.650 position:56%
You know, if you automate the system

04:32:38.650 --> 04:32:40.910
and you can just have
the discs piled up

04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:42.730
and then you can just
feed them through.

04:32:42.730 --> 04:32:47.020 position:56%
So it's actually -- what's more
important -- is actually automation.

04:32:47.020 --> 04:32:50.760
So, it's, you can just
automate the whole thing.

04:32:50.760 --> 04:32:52.320
&gt;&gt; Ottar Johnsen: How
we are inputting in this

04:32:52.320 --> 04:32:56.590
in the beginning was that we have
to take more than 20 years for us

04:32:56.590 --> 04:33:02.660
to make this discs we have
in the archive for audio file

04:33:02.660 --> 04:33:07.910
and we have it continuing
for five years,

04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:11.340
if they put the records
on, and it takes 5 years.

04:33:11.340 --> 04:33:14.230
And we have, what can we do?

04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:17.470
The material in the archive
will be standing in the shelves

04:33:17.470 --> 04:33:19.140
and no one had listened to it.

04:33:19.140 --> 04:33:23.280
We had to find, is it
possible to find a new method

04:33:23.280 --> 04:33:26.380
to make this and listen to them?

04:33:26.380 --> 04:33:30.450
And this was the input for
us to see is it possible.

04:33:30.450 --> 04:33:36.120
And they have to prove it, the
competence was left in the project.

04:33:36.120 --> 04:33:37.490
And so on.

04:33:37.490 --> 04:33:44.150
One input is also, is the
quality enough just for listen.

04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:48.210
We know that vinyl's and
78's records are stable.

04:33:48.210 --> 04:33:52.220
You can take it back
if you don't crush it.

04:33:52.220 --> 04:33:57.070
And you have a listening copy
for researchers and so on,

04:33:57.070 --> 04:34:00.190
not in the high end quality,
but it's enough perhaps

04:34:00.190 --> 04:34:03.010
for hear what they say and so on.

04:34:03.010 --> 04:34:08.810
This is one of the results that we
have to manage in the end of it.

04:34:08.810 --> 04:34:11.160
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: So if
you just want what,

04:34:11.160 --> 04:34:14.520
I guess you would call them access
copies, for listening purposes

04:34:14.520 --> 04:34:18.600
of 78's, you could take a scanner
like the visual audio scanner

04:34:18.600 --> 04:34:21.050
or the IRENE scanner, which
are essentially the same thing.

04:34:21.050 --> 04:34:25.000
You could put four or six
cameras on there and just whoosh,

04:34:25.000 --> 04:34:29.670
and you could just scale it
up and you could get it in,

04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:31.370
if you could deal with
the disc writing,

04:34:31.370 --> 04:34:35.580
you have multiple disc drives and
you just, you just dump the thing.

04:34:35.580 --> 04:34:37.400
I mean that's like a brute force.

04:34:37.400 --> 04:34:42.180
If your goal is really to read a
three-minute record in a minute,

04:34:42.180 --> 04:34:46.970
you probably could make that happen
by just throwing multiples of $6000

04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:49.310
at it until you had enough cameras.

04:34:49.310 --> 04:34:51.690
I mean at some point you
won't fit anymore cameras

04:34:51.690 --> 04:34:53.510
and it becomes a packing problem.

04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:56.670
[ Laughter ]

04:34:56.670 --> 04:34:57.970
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

04:34:57.970 --> 04:34:59.530
&gt;&gt; Question for Dr. McBride.

04:34:59.530 --> 04:35:04.010
In your Journal of
Acoustic Society paper,

04:35:04.010 --> 04:35:09.430
you note that you were getting
10 nanometers of axial resolution

04:35:09.430 --> 04:35:17.540
on a top to bottom groove
dispersion of 10 microns.

04:35:17.540 --> 04:35:20.350
Which is 1000 units of measurement.

04:35:20.350 --> 04:35:23.140
Which is about 10 bits, right.

04:35:23.140 --> 04:35:24.440
&gt;&gt; Okay.

04:35:24.440 --> 04:35:25.740
&gt;&gt; Simple math.

04:35:25.740 --> 04:35:32.320
And you state that the digital
audio bit depth is equivalent

04:35:32.320 --> 04:35:35.550
to the image bit depth.

04:35:35.550 --> 04:35:37.280
Do you still hold to that?

04:35:37.280 --> 04:35:40.010
&gt;&gt; Have you got the paper there?

04:35:40.010 --> 04:35:41.310
&gt;&gt; I do.

04:35:41.310 --> 04:35:42.610
&gt;&gt; [ Laughter ]

04:35:42.610 --> 04:35:45.630
. Okay, well when was
that published?

04:35:45.630 --> 04:35:46.930
&gt;&gt; 2008.

04:35:46.930 --> 04:35:49.730
&gt;&gt; Okay, wow.

04:35:49.730 --> 04:35:54.550
&gt;&gt; The question is,
has this advanced?

04:35:54.550 --> 04:36:00.700
Is there -- I'm understanding from
Dr. Haber that the axial resolution

04:36:00.700 --> 04:36:04.000
in the image domain
does not translate

04:36:04.000 --> 04:36:07.600
to digital audio resolution.

04:36:07.600 --> 04:36:08.900
&gt;&gt; No, you need to --

04:36:08.900 --> 04:36:10.200
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to resolve this.

04:36:10.200 --> 04:36:11.500
&gt;&gt; No, you need to
take the derivative

04:36:11.500 --> 04:36:12.800
of the surface to get
the sound from.

04:36:12.800 --> 04:36:14.130
But you still need to have
the raw data to start with.

04:36:14.130 --> 04:36:15.430
&gt;&gt; Of course.

04:36:15.430 --> 04:36:18.170
No, I've only taken a couple of
college level classes in physics.

04:36:18.170 --> 04:36:21.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you still have to, you
still have to have the raw data.

04:36:21.500 --> 04:36:22.940
&gt;&gt; You have to have the raw
data there, that's right.

04:36:22.940 --> 04:36:25.500
And if the raw data is only there

04:36:25.500 --> 04:36:29.300
with a precision of, in
your case, 10 bits...

04:36:29.300 --> 04:36:30.610
&gt;&gt; I don't recall either.

04:36:30.610 --> 04:36:31.910
&gt;&gt; Okay.

04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:37.050
&gt;&gt; On that slide I showed it
was the 20 kilohertz harmonic.

04:36:37.050 --> 04:36:38.780
Oh no, sorry, two kilohertz
harmonic --

04:36:38.780 --> 04:36:40.080
&gt;&gt; Yes.

04:36:40.080 --> 04:36:41.380
&gt;&gt; In a spoken word.

04:36:41.380 --> 04:36:46.200
&gt;&gt; If the image is measured
with the precision of 10 bits --

04:36:46.200 --> 04:36:47.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

04:36:47.500 --> 04:36:55.360
&gt;&gt; Is there any transformation that
you can do to increase resolution?

04:36:55.360 --> 04:37:00.140
&gt;&gt; You cannot go -- you
cannot change the resolution

04:37:00.140 --> 04:37:01.850
of the sensor that you're using.

04:37:01.850 --> 04:37:05.760
So that graph was actually
about defining.

04:37:05.760 --> 04:37:09.840
It's about the quality of the
potential audio that you can get

04:37:09.840 --> 04:37:12.000
from this and we were
interested in preservation.

04:37:12.000 --> 04:37:14.200 position:56%
So we're at the first stage of this.

04:37:14.200 --> 04:37:19.980
It's about preserving the raw
data, you know, for future use.

04:37:19.980 --> 04:37:21.280
&gt;&gt; Understood.

04:37:21.280 --> 04:37:22.930
&gt;&gt; And that's where that
measurement came from.

04:37:22.930 --> 04:37:25.270
It was a displacement
measurement against frequency.

04:37:25.270 --> 04:37:27.780
If you look at the lower
frequency, I think,

04:37:27.780 --> 04:37:32.730
I pointed that on the slide,
what was it, 600 hertz?

04:37:32.730 --> 04:37:36.430
The magnitude of that particular
harmonic was much higher, yeah.

04:37:36.430 --> 04:37:42.070
So this is -- I was focusing
on the harmonics associated

04:37:42.070 --> 04:37:43.920
with the spoken word, yeah.

04:37:43.920 --> 04:37:49.120
So it's a very kind of
detailed scientific issue.

04:37:49.120 --> 04:37:51.020
&gt;&gt; I understand.

04:37:51.020 --> 04:37:52.400
I do understand.

04:37:52.400 --> 04:37:55.140
But let me ask the question
again, perhaps in a way

04:37:55.140 --> 04:37:56.750
that we can all understand.

04:37:56.750 --> 04:37:59.730
If something's measured
with 10 bits of precision

04:37:59.730 --> 04:38:02.260
in the digital optical domain.

04:38:02.260 --> 04:38:05.620
That's a level precision.

04:38:05.620 --> 04:38:08.560
Is there any transformation
that can be done?

04:38:08.560 --> 04:38:11.530
Because that's the digital,
that's the preservation master.

04:38:11.530 --> 04:38:15.680
Right? Is there any
transformation that can be done

04:38:15.680 --> 04:38:17.730
to bring that up to 16 bits?

04:38:17.730 --> 04:38:19.040
&gt;&gt; So hang on, Actually --

04:38:19.040 --> 04:38:21.150
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay, okay,
so I addressed this --

04:38:21.150 --> 04:38:23.220
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] The 10 bit,
we didn't publish that.

04:38:23.220 --> 04:38:25.470
You've done a calculation
which is the ratio

04:38:25.470 --> 04:38:29.090
of the 15 nanometer height,
which we just referred to.

04:38:29.090 --> 04:38:30.390
&gt;&gt; No, no you published it.

04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:31.690
I'm looking at it right here.

04:38:31.690 --> 04:38:32.990
&gt;&gt; What does it say?

04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:34.290
Does it say 10?

04:38:34.290 --> 04:38:35.590
&gt;&gt; That's not, that's
not my point --

04:38:35.590 --> 04:38:36.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think that's
correct because it actually, that,

04:38:36.890 --> 04:38:38.190
that's -- is that comparing
the depth

04:38:38.190 --> 04:38:40.660
of the groove to the 15 nanometers?

04:38:40.660 --> 04:38:42.000
Is that the number that you said?

04:38:42.000 --> 04:38:45.830
&gt;&gt; Yes. I'll read it to
you so we can have it.

04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:47.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think
that's correct.

04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:49.440
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay,
here's the thing.

04:38:49.440 --> 04:38:50.740
&gt;&gt; Yes.

04:38:50.740 --> 04:38:53.870
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: You measure the
surface at a certain point.

04:38:53.870 --> 04:39:00.330
But you take many points
and you combine those points

04:39:00.330 --> 04:39:03.900
to get an estimate of
the depth of the groove

04:39:03.900 --> 04:39:06.130
at a certain moment in time.

04:39:06.130 --> 04:39:10.870
So the depth of the groove at
that moment in time is synthesized

04:39:10.870 --> 04:39:12.960
from a number of measurements.

04:39:12.960 --> 04:39:16.770
So by combining multiple
measurements

04:39:16.770 --> 04:39:19.890
through an averaging
process, you can improve

04:39:19.890 --> 04:39:23.290
through averaging your measurement.

04:39:23.290 --> 04:39:29.680
So, just taking -- just
interpreting what the resolution is

04:39:29.680 --> 04:39:33.440
on a single point, and then
comparing it to some number,

04:39:33.440 --> 04:39:39.610 position:56%
10 microns, 20 microns, that you're
sort of picking out from some place.

04:39:39.610 --> 04:39:44.430
It's just the beginning of a more
complicated story that leads you

04:39:44.430 --> 04:39:51.200 position:56%
to a certain performance which comes
out from combining all this data,

04:39:51.200 --> 04:39:56.510
taking the surface, differentiating
it, and turning it into audio.

04:39:56.510 --> 04:40:01.310
A statement that you can make
which is very well defined

04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:09.250 position:56%
about the instrument that you buy
is that it has a range of a certain,

04:40:09.250 --> 04:40:13.290
say 200 microns, 300 microns,
depending on the instrument

04:40:13.290 --> 04:40:16.890
that you choose, the
optics that you choose.

04:40:16.890 --> 04:40:22.480
It has a certain resolution
inside that range, 50 nanometers,

04:40:22.480 --> 04:40:25.770
10 nanometers, 120 nanometers,
depending on the one you use.

04:40:25.770 --> 04:40:31.840 position:56%
And that ratio, between its
fundamental resolution and its range

04:40:31.840 --> 04:40:37.160 position:56%
that defines its capability in bits.

04:40:37.160 --> 04:40:38.460
&gt;&gt; Theoretical bit depth.

04:40:38.460 --> 04:40:41.260
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: For a
single point measurement.

04:40:41.260 --> 04:40:42.560
Okay?

04:40:42.560 --> 04:40:43.860
&gt;&gt; Right.

04:40:43.860 --> 04:40:45.160
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: That's
just the beginning

04:40:45.160 --> 04:40:46.460
of a more complicated story.

04:40:46.460 --> 04:40:47.760
&gt;&gt; I understand.

04:40:47.760 --> 04:40:49.060
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: And
there's no -- there's --

04:40:49.060 --> 04:40:50.360
sorry it's very hard to see you

04:40:50.360 --> 04:40:53.940
because Mason [inaudible] is
a little disconcerting, but,

04:40:53.940 --> 04:40:57.130
I feel like I'm talking to,
looking behind somebody.

04:40:57.130 --> 04:41:03.020
But, you know, so that's why
I went into this discussion,

04:41:03.020 --> 04:41:07.900
because there's no simple little
answer and frankly when people

04:41:07.900 --> 04:41:14.410
in audio engineering say, "Oh,
I'll digitize this at 24 bits,

04:41:14.410 --> 04:41:18.980
that's a -- it's a
big simplification

04:41:18.980 --> 04:41:20.680
about what's actually going on.

04:41:20.680 --> 04:41:21.980
And there has to be.

04:41:21.980 --> 04:41:23.280
&gt;&gt; I understand.

04:41:23.280 --> 04:41:24.580
Unfortunately, this conference --

04:41:24.580 --> 04:41:25.880
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Well, just a minute.

04:41:25.880 --> 04:41:32.500
And there has to be a recognition
that noise, random noise,

04:41:32.500 --> 04:41:38.510
sets the scale that we
have to base everything on.

04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:42.570
If you want to measure the
radius of a billiard ball,

04:41:42.570 --> 04:41:45.670
I can give you a pair of precision
calipers and you can measure

04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:47.890
that radius to whatever you like.

04:41:47.890 --> 04:41:50.190
If you want to measure the
radius of a tennis ball,

04:41:50.190 --> 04:41:54.280
the diameter of a tennis ball,
it's a poorly defined problem

04:41:54.280 --> 04:41:56.340
because a tennis ball is furry.

04:41:56.340 --> 04:41:57.640
All right?

04:41:57.640 --> 04:42:01.600
So there's an arbitrariness
due to the random structure

04:42:01.600 --> 04:42:03.170
of the surface of a tennis ball.

04:42:03.170 --> 04:42:04.470
That means that fundamentally,

04:42:04.470 --> 04:42:07.650
you can't measure it the same way
you can measure a billiard ball.

04:42:07.650 --> 04:42:11.560
Audio engineers recognize
this when they say,

04:42:11.560 --> 04:42:17.430 position:56%
"Well a 24-bit ADC is really only 20
bits, or 21 bits, because, you know,

04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:22.500 position:56%
there's fundamental noise in the ADC
electronics that knocks already four

04:42:22.500 --> 04:42:24.540
or five bits out of the game.

04:42:24.540 --> 04:42:28.820
And I tried to build
up that explanation

04:42:28.820 --> 04:42:30.850
and in just a few minutes
it could be the subject

04:42:30.850 --> 04:42:32.890
of an hour long discussion.

04:42:32.890 --> 04:42:37.070
You know, you can go on Wikipedia
and read pages and pages about,

04:42:37.070 --> 04:42:41.860
you know, if you want to run
your clock at three megahertz,

04:42:41.860 --> 04:42:45.790
you can have a one-bit
ADC and digitize audio

04:42:45.790 --> 04:42:47.290
at very, very high quality.

04:42:47.290 --> 04:42:49.780
So there's no simple
little, I know you're trying

04:42:49.780 --> 04:42:53.200
to get a simple little answer
and say, "Well I can do 24 bits

04:42:53.200 --> 04:42:57.110 position:56%
and you can only do 7," or something
like that, but it doesn't work.

04:42:57.110 --> 04:42:58.570
&gt;&gt; Carl, that's not
what I'm trying to do.

04:42:58.570 --> 04:42:59.870
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

04:42:59.870 --> 04:43:01.170
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to get to the bottom

04:43:01.170 --> 04:43:04.650
of a question that's been bothering
me and a lot of other people,

04:43:04.650 --> 04:43:09.930 position:56%
and for which you and Dr. McBride
seem to have very different answers.

04:43:09.930 --> 04:43:11.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, I wasn't...

04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:12.810
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Do we?

04:43:12.810 --> 04:43:14.110
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't think we do.

04:43:14.110 --> 04:43:15.410
&gt;&gt; Okay, but, but --

04:43:15.410 --> 04:43:16.710
&gt;&gt; I mean, maybe a line that's
in a paper which was published,

04:43:16.710 --> 04:43:18.830
you know, what, what would he say?

04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:20.130
Eight years ago [laughter].

04:43:20.130 --> 04:43:21.430
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fine.

04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:24.590
&gt;&gt; You should have given me a
prior warning; I would've looked

04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:25.890
up the background for it.

04:43:25.890 --> 04:43:27.190
&gt;&gt; That's fine.

04:43:27.190 --> 04:43:28.490
&gt;&gt; The sensor -- I've
just did a calculation,

04:43:28.490 --> 04:43:31.180
the sensor that we use is
actually 15-bit resolution.

04:43:31.180 --> 04:43:36.450
You've got a 350-micron range
and it resolves to 10 nanometers.

04:43:36.450 --> 04:43:38.850
&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's where Carl
got his 12 to 13 bits as well.

04:43:38.850 --> 04:43:42.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so all, I think all we were
saying is that it's really important

04:43:42.020 --> 04:43:43.830
that if you want to get
the best quality audio

04:43:43.830 --> 04:43:46.620
from these old recordings,
you have to have a sensor

04:43:46.620 --> 04:43:50.880
that has a minimum resolution of
around 50 -- is it 50 nanometers?

04:43:50.880 --> 04:43:52.320
Oh, what does it say,
you've got it there.

04:43:52.320 --> 04:43:53.620
&gt;&gt; Yes. 50 nanometers.

04:43:53.620 --> 04:43:54.920
&gt;&gt; Whatever it is.

04:43:54.920 --> 04:43:56.220
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: And that thing --

04:43:56.220 --> 04:43:57.520
it depends on the material,
but that's sort of it.

04:43:57.520 --> 04:43:58.820
&gt;&gt; That's the key thing.

04:43:58.820 --> 04:44:00.230
&gt;&gt; We're cutting into the
next session and it seems

04:44:00.230 --> 04:44:03.400
like maybe we have to deal with
this, I definitely want to deal

04:44:03.400 --> 04:44:05.030
with this, but we could --
but maybe John could look

04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:06.330
at the paper again --

04:44:06.330 --> 04:44:07.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

04:44:07.630 --> 04:44:08.930
&gt;&gt; We could pick this up

04:44:08.930 --> 04:44:10.230
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay.

04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:11.530
&gt;&gt; Like at the end of
things, we'd have bigger time.

04:44:11.530 --> 04:44:12.830
&gt;&gt; Carl Haber: Okay, sure.

04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:14.130
&gt;&gt; We're cutting into other
people's talks right now,

04:44:14.130 --> 04:44:17.760
so I think we should have a very
quick coffee break for five minutes

04:44:17.760 --> 04:44:21.510
and move the new talkers
in and then get started.

04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:26.140
[ Applause ]

04:44:26.140 --> 04:44:29.670
&gt;&gt; Okay, so our first
presentation is --

04:44:29.670 --> 04:44:31.800
we actually have kind
of two duos this time.

04:44:31.800 --> 04:44:35.240
From NEH we have Joshua
Sternfeld and Jesse Johnston.

04:44:35.240 --> 04:44:38.240
So, Josh, Joshua's
speaking first right?

04:44:38.240 --> 04:44:39.540
&gt;&gt; Sure.

04:44:39.540 --> 04:44:40.840
&gt;&gt; Yep. So.

04:44:40.840 --> 04:44:45.860
&gt;&gt; Joshua Sternfeld: That's
the best kind of introduction.

04:44:45.860 --> 04:44:47.160
Jump right in.

04:44:47.160 --> 04:44:48.740
So, hello everyone.

04:44:48.740 --> 04:44:50.680
I am Joshua Sternfeld.

04:44:50.680 --> 04:44:54.110
I'm a senior program officer
with the National Endowment

04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:57.250
for the Humanities, Division
of Preservation and Access.

04:44:57.250 --> 04:44:59.710
And I'm here with my
colleague, Jesse Johnston,

04:44:59.710 --> 04:45:03.890
also from the Division of
Preservation and Access.

04:45:03.890 --> 04:45:08.950
So, today we are going to
talk about a few things here.

04:45:08.950 --> 04:45:13.280
I think we're going to move from
the very technical discussions

04:45:13.280 --> 04:45:15.080
that we've heard, up to this point.

04:45:15.080 --> 04:45:19.660
And perhaps in the course of just
talking about our grant programming

04:45:19.660 --> 04:45:23.320
and some of the projects that
we've supported over the years,

04:45:23.320 --> 04:45:28.660
we will begin to kind of see a way
of answering some of the questions

04:45:28.660 --> 04:45:31.460
that Carl was raising
earlier this morning,

04:45:31.460 --> 04:45:33.600
about where do we go from here.

04:45:33.600 --> 04:45:39.300
And how do we take all of
the research and technologies

04:45:39.300 --> 04:45:42.440 position:56%
that have been developed up to this
point and begin to scale them upward

04:45:42.440 --> 04:45:45.960
and begin to apply them to
more and more collections?

04:45:45.960 --> 04:45:49.500
So that will -- for our purposes
here today, that will begin

04:45:49.500 --> 04:45:51.340
with a very, very brief
overview of NEH.

04:45:51.340 --> 04:45:56.100
Many of you are already familiar,
some of you are actually awardees,

04:45:56.100 --> 04:46:00.210
past awardees, but I realize
that there are some that are

04:46:00.210 --> 04:46:04.150
from outside the U.S., so I will
give you the 30-second rundown

04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:05.450
of what we do.

04:46:05.450 --> 04:46:10.270
And that will kind of move
us into some of the projects

04:46:10.270 --> 04:46:14.570
that we have supported along
audiovisual-related projects.

04:46:14.570 --> 04:46:17.510
Mostly through research
and development, but,

04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:20.980
as Jesse will indicate,
we have had support

04:46:20.980 --> 04:46:23.930
through almost all of
our grant programs.

04:46:23.930 --> 04:46:27.710
And so one of the things
that I think will become more

04:46:27.710 --> 04:46:30.460
and more clear as we talk
about those programs is

04:46:30.460 --> 04:46:35.360
that perhaps we could look at the
suite of programs that we offer

04:46:35.360 --> 04:46:37.400
as a kind of paradigm
for how to begin

04:46:37.400 --> 04:46:41.490
to support these new
approaches to preservation

04:46:41.490 --> 04:46:43.130
and access going forward.

04:46:43.130 --> 04:46:49.730
And Jesse will conclude with
a little bit of indication

04:46:49.730 --> 04:46:54.930
of how interested NEH is
currently with the topic

04:46:54.930 --> 04:46:57.990
of audiovisual preservation
and access.

04:46:57.990 --> 04:47:02.010
We are ramping up our interest
more and more as we speak.

04:47:02.010 --> 04:47:04.890 position:56%
And so we're delighted to be here
and we thank the Library of Congress

04:47:04.890 --> 04:47:09.650
for having us and hopefully
we will be able

04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:14.690
to continue this dialogue both in
this panel and perhaps afterwards.

04:47:14.690 --> 04:47:16.350
So, a little bit about NEH.

04:47:16.350 --> 04:47:22.240
We're divided into a collection
of offices and divisions

04:47:22.240 --> 04:47:27.410
that covers the scope of
humanities activities.

04:47:27.410 --> 04:47:31.620
That includes everything from your
very basic individual fellowships

04:47:31.620 --> 04:47:36.940
and research, and educational
opportunities, to development

04:47:36.940 --> 04:47:42.040 position:56%
of public programs, things like your
documentaries, museum exhibitions

04:47:42.040 --> 04:47:45.820
and so forth, and, what
Jesse and I work on,

04:47:45.820 --> 04:47:47.620
the Division of Preservation
and Access.

04:47:47.620 --> 04:47:50.480
So we actually are
devoted to helping

04:47:50.480 --> 04:47:55.460
to preserve humanities-related
collections, of all types,

04:47:55.460 --> 04:48:01.450
audiovisual, archeological,
literary, historical, etcetera.

04:48:01.450 --> 04:48:04.140
And so in the Division of
Preservation and Access,

04:48:04.140 --> 04:48:10.990
we try to cover the entire range
of activities as best we can

04:48:10.990 --> 04:48:14.900
that is related to the
basic care and stewardship

04:48:14.900 --> 04:48:17.120
of humanities collections.

04:48:17.120 --> 04:48:20.330
For all types of institutions,
I should indicate.

04:48:20.330 --> 04:48:22.810
I know there is some
perhaps misperception

04:48:22.810 --> 04:48:26.390
that we're only geared towards
the high research universities,

04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:27.980
but that's simply not true.

04:48:27.980 --> 04:48:32.150
We do our best to also reach
out to smaller institutions,

04:48:32.150 --> 04:48:34.140
things like historical societies,

04:48:34.140 --> 04:48:38.660
public libraries, small
museums, etcetera.

04:48:38.660 --> 04:48:42.220
So that range of activities
of course can cover everything

04:48:42.220 --> 04:48:44.870
from your basic intellectual
control.

04:48:44.870 --> 04:48:48.110
Things like cataloguing,
arranging, describing.

04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:52.580
Things like your basic conservation
treatment, reformatting, of course,

04:48:52.580 --> 04:48:54.410
rehousing of collections.

04:48:54.410 --> 04:48:55.710
We do digitize.

04:48:55.710 --> 04:49:00.130
We have actually gone out into
the academic world and heard that,

04:49:00.130 --> 04:49:02.330
"Well NEH doesn't digitize
any longer."

04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:03.630
That's not true.

04:49:03.630 --> 04:49:05.710
We love to digitize
audiovisual collections

04:49:05.710 --> 04:49:07.230
and see projects of that sort.

04:49:07.230 --> 04:49:11.210
We also do support the
development of databases,

04:49:11.210 --> 04:49:13.580
spatial tools, reference resources.

04:49:13.580 --> 04:49:17.410 position:56%
And we're increasingly, in the
last, I would say five or six years,

04:49:17.410 --> 04:49:22.910 position:56%
moving towards sustainable solutions
for preventative conservation care.

04:49:22.910 --> 04:49:28.160
And those are projects that
are to address the entirety

04:49:28.160 --> 04:49:29.460
of a storage environment.

04:49:29.460 --> 04:49:32.930
And we actually have a
few, a handful of projects,

04:49:32.930 --> 04:49:36.810
related to audiovisual
collections on that front as well.

04:49:36.810 --> 04:49:40.930
So, a little bit about where we
come from in terms of our support

04:49:40.930 --> 04:49:43.550
for audiovisual preservation
and access.

04:49:43.550 --> 04:49:49.210
And mostly, my job here today is
to focus on the R&amp;D side of things,

04:49:49.210 --> 04:49:52.060
since I think that's
kind of most in tune

04:49:52.060 --> 04:49:54.470
with what we're talking
about here today.

04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:58.490
So we can go back all
the way to the 1980s

04:49:58.490 --> 04:50:03.140
and you probably won't find a
program specifically called R&amp;D,

04:50:03.140 --> 04:50:07.250
like you do today, but in
various forms over the years,

04:50:07.250 --> 04:50:11.840
we supported very kind of
specialized research projects.

04:50:11.840 --> 04:50:16.190
At the -- beginnng in the '80s and
'90s, a lot of those awards went

04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:18.900
to the Image Permanence Institute

04:50:18.900 --> 04:50:22.530
over at the Rochester
Institute of Technology.

04:50:22.530 --> 04:50:26.310
Many of you are probably familiar
with the great work that they do.

04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:30.720
They began in the mid to late-80s
working on, actually early '80s,

04:50:30.720 --> 04:50:36.270
working on photographic prints and
then it's almost like a chronology

04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:39.040
of audiovisual formats
and the projects

04:50:39.040 --> 04:50:41.340
that they've worked
on over the years.

04:50:41.340 --> 04:50:44.770
Moving through various formats,

04:50:44.770 --> 04:50:48.910
landing in magnetic
media in the '90s.

04:50:48.910 --> 04:50:53.460
And then in the early 2000s,
we started to see support

04:50:53.460 --> 04:50:56.200
for a number of other institutions.

04:50:56.200 --> 04:50:59.040
Many of you are may be familiar
with the Sound Directions Project

04:50:59.040 --> 04:51:03.740
that was a collaboration between
Indiana University and Harvard.

04:51:03.740 --> 04:51:08.320
Those were a series of projects
that eventually developed a set

04:51:08.320 --> 04:51:11.740
of audio digitization guidelines.

04:51:11.740 --> 04:51:13.420
So we're very proud of that.

04:51:13.420 --> 04:51:16.050
One of the reasons we're proud
of that project is not only

04:51:16.050 --> 04:51:21.180
for the R&amp;D work that they did, but
the fact that it had such an impact

04:51:21.180 --> 04:51:23.290
on the wider cultural
heritage field.

04:51:23.290 --> 04:51:26.630
And so what we love
to see are projects

04:51:26.630 --> 04:51:29.580
in our other grant programs,
particularly, for example,

04:51:29.580 --> 04:51:33.310
in projects to digitize
specific collections

04:51:33.310 --> 04:51:37.460
that are referencing the
sound directions guidelines

04:51:37.460 --> 04:51:42.830
as the standard, or best practice,
that they are trying to adhere to.

04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:46.260
So when we see R&amp;D work
show up in footnotes

04:51:46.260 --> 04:51:47.650
in our other grant programs,

04:51:47.650 --> 04:51:53.270
it gives us a little chill
-- or thrill, if you will.

04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:57.200
And also around this time,
in 2004, we got this kind

04:51:57.200 --> 04:52:00.310
of curious project called
"Developing an Optical Method

04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:02.550
to Recover Sound from
Mechanical Recording Media."

04:52:02.550 --> 04:52:07.110
I was actually able to
dig the original file up

04:52:07.110 --> 04:52:13.020
and it's quite a massive
collection of documents.

04:52:13.020 --> 04:52:18.640
You see here one of the original
images for what then became IRENE.

04:52:18.640 --> 04:52:22.780
So NEH was proud to be at the
kind of ground level for the work

04:52:22.780 --> 04:52:29.140
that Carl and his team did
beginning back in 2004.

04:52:29.140 --> 04:52:34.310 position:56%
And obviously, you can see the
fruits of all that labor here today.

04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:37.550
So, I won't go into the
history of the project,

04:52:37.550 --> 04:52:40.430
since we've already gone quite
extensively, but I thought,

04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:45.120
you know, seeing the early 2000s
kinds of technologies is kind

04:52:45.120 --> 04:52:49.240
of a fun little trip
down memory lane.

04:52:49.240 --> 04:52:55.750
But we do love the IRENE project
as a kind of exemplar of research

04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:59.040
and development projects
that we've supported.

04:52:59.040 --> 04:53:04.370
One is simply that it responded to
a real need in both preservation,

04:53:04.370 --> 04:53:06.790
as well as in cultural
heritage fields.

04:53:06.790 --> 04:53:08.840
And I think all of the speakers

04:53:08.840 --> 04:53:13.660
that you've heard this morning
covered those needs quite well.

04:53:13.660 --> 04:53:18.550
And then, I think a true testament
to the success of an R&amp;D project is

04:53:18.550 --> 04:53:19.990
that it then of course leads

04:53:19.990 --> 04:53:23.020
to additional projects,
additional research.

04:53:23.020 --> 04:53:28.220
And that could be in specifically
in an R&amp;D type setting,

04:53:28.220 --> 04:53:32.540
or it could lead to, as it did with
additional testing and evaluation,

04:53:32.540 --> 04:53:36.200
but it could also lead
to reconsiderations

04:53:36.200 --> 04:53:41.560
of broader stewardship practices,
and as Carl was hinting at,

04:53:41.560 --> 04:53:45.630
shifts in how we think about
education and training as well.

04:53:46.720 --> 04:53:51.830
So, that leads me a little
bit to talking about a few

04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:54.390
of our main grant programs
coming out of the Division

04:53:54.390 --> 04:53:56.220
of Preservation and Access.

04:53:56.220 --> 04:54:00.160
And, again, for some of you this
might be of interest directly,

04:54:00.160 --> 04:54:03.070
in thinking about getting
a project to us.

04:54:03.070 --> 04:54:07.640
And, of course, whenever we go out,
we always love to field questions,

04:54:07.640 --> 04:54:12.820
one-on-one types of questions, of
a project that you have in mind.

04:54:12.820 --> 04:54:18.860
But, I think also, for the purposes
of this panel and for today, again,

04:54:18.860 --> 04:54:23.210
the suite of programs that we
have can also be considered a kind

04:54:23.210 --> 04:54:27.140
of framework for considering
how to expand all

04:54:27.140 --> 04:54:30.050
of these great technologies
going forward.

04:54:30.050 --> 04:54:34.270
So, the way we -- this
is one way of how we look

04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:35.810
at our grant programming.

04:54:35.810 --> 04:54:40.680
The core of what we do, the
foundation of program that we have,

04:54:40.680 --> 04:54:43.960
is called "Humanities Collections
and Reference Resources."

04:54:43.960 --> 04:54:47.130
And that's a program that is geared

04:54:47.130 --> 04:54:50.800
to enhance the preservation
and/or access

04:54:50.800 --> 04:54:53.320
of specific humanities collections.

04:54:53.320 --> 04:54:58.340
So we get, again, institutions of
all shapes and sizes come to us

04:54:58.340 --> 04:55:03.480 position:56%
and say, "We have a great collection
of X and we need to do work,"

04:55:03.480 --> 04:55:07.430
whether it's to rehouse
them, to catalogue them,

04:55:07.430 --> 04:55:09.300
to reform them, etcetera.

04:55:09.300 --> 04:55:13.740
And for us, that really
is our wheelhouse.

04:55:13.740 --> 04:55:15.180
Our humanities collections.

04:55:15.180 --> 04:55:21.740
Because it enables us to bring in
humanities practitioners, scholars,

04:55:21.740 --> 04:55:27.830
curators, folks in the cultural
heritage sector, into our panel

04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:32.370
and review setting and
conversing with preservationists

04:55:32.370 --> 04:55:37.300
of all stripes, archivists,
librarians, and so forth.

04:55:37.300 --> 04:55:40.990
But we realize that
the work that goes

04:55:40.990 --> 04:55:45.690
into preserving a humanities
collection requires a lot

04:55:45.690 --> 04:55:49.540
of other work that kind
of encircles that work.

04:55:49.540 --> 04:55:54.020
And I'll be talking again a little
bit about research and development

04:55:54.020 --> 04:55:57.050
and the particularities
of that program.

04:55:57.050 --> 04:56:00.540
Sustaining cultural heritage
collections, as Jesse will explain,

04:56:00.540 --> 04:56:04.710
tackles the preventative
issues as well.

04:56:04.710 --> 04:56:07.590
And of course, there is education
and training, and we're very proud

04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:13.530 position:56%
to support a few audiovisual-related
projects in that realm as well.

04:56:13.530 --> 04:56:19.740
So, R&amp;D. We underwent an
intensive review of this program

04:56:19.740 --> 04:56:22.520
in the last year-and-a-half or so.

04:56:22.520 --> 04:56:25.440
We just received -- and we
restructured the program,

04:56:25.440 --> 04:56:27.790
and we just received
that first batch

04:56:27.790 --> 04:56:32.940 position:56%
of applications a few weeks ago, so
that's beginning the review process.

04:56:32.940 --> 04:56:36.100
So, in one sense, the good news is

04:56:36.100 --> 04:56:39.070
that the next deadline
is an annual deadline,

04:56:39.070 --> 04:56:42.770
and you have until June
21st of 2016 to think

04:56:42.770 --> 04:56:45.710 position:56%
about getting another project to us.

04:56:45.710 --> 04:56:49.240
Again, this program is designed
to address major challenges

04:56:49.240 --> 04:56:53.500
in preserving and providing access
to cultural heritage collections.

04:56:53.500 --> 04:56:57.210
And it's also designed to support
the development of standards,

04:56:57.210 --> 04:56:59.880
best practices, methodologies,
and work flows.

04:56:59.880 --> 04:57:01.760
It supports applied research.

04:57:01.760 --> 04:57:07.880
And then I know some of the
subsequent presentations coming

04:57:07.880 --> 04:57:11.990
up will be talking about
considerations for how

04:57:11.990 --> 04:57:13.960
to develop best practices
in this area.

04:57:13.960 --> 04:57:16.210
So we have two tiers of funding,

04:57:16.210 --> 04:57:19.190
and I'll give you the quick
specifics around those.

04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:22.010
But I do want to add,
we are very proud

04:57:22.010 --> 04:57:23.980
to support international
collaboration.

04:57:23.980 --> 04:57:28.940
The only requirement being that the
primary applicant institution needs

04:57:28.940 --> 04:57:31.070
to be a U.S. based institution.

04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:35.250
But we have supported and will
continue to support projects

04:57:35.250 --> 04:57:41.760
that show collaboration with
institutions outside the U.S. So,

04:57:41.760 --> 04:57:46.370
again something to
consider going forward.

04:57:46.370 --> 04:57:50.420
So, I mentioned that we have
two tiers of projects here.

04:57:50.420 --> 04:57:54.900
So a Tier 1 project
is for up to $75,000.

04:57:54.900 --> 04:57:58.550
And what we notice -- this
is really the newest aspect

04:57:58.550 --> 04:58:03.550
of our R&amp;D program, what we notice
is that if we only had one tier,

04:58:03.550 --> 04:58:09.600
which was up to $350,000.00,
there can be a lot of great work

04:58:09.600 --> 04:58:11.940
at these lower levels
that are getting squeezed

04:58:11.940 --> 04:58:14.350
out from the limited
funding that NEH has.

04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:20.830
These can be anything from
surveys to case studies,

04:58:20.830 --> 04:58:22.900
to small scale experiments.

04:58:22.900 --> 04:58:26.810
So, particularly in the field
that we're talking about here,

04:58:26.810 --> 04:58:31.260
optical image preservation, I
think there could be a lot of cases

04:58:31.260 --> 04:58:34.640
where these kind of small case
studies could really develop

04:58:34.640 --> 04:58:39.500
valuable data that can be fed
back into the larger community.

04:58:39.500 --> 04:58:43.250
And one of the things that we're
trying to emphasize with this level

04:58:43.250 --> 04:58:46.670
as well is that this can be a
great opportunity for graduate

04:58:46.670 --> 04:58:50.200
and post-doctoral training
and experience.

04:58:50.200 --> 04:58:52.400
Secondly, we have a Tier 2 level.

04:58:52.400 --> 04:59:00.480 position:56%
Again, this is the higher level, for
up to 350,000 for up to three years.

04:59:00.480 --> 04:59:02.340
And this is the whole
enchilada if you will.

04:59:02.340 --> 04:59:05.350
We want to see projects
that are really striving

04:59:05.350 --> 04:59:10.470 position:56%
to develop best practices
standards, methodologies, workflows,

04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:14.230
that can reach a very
broad preservation

04:59:14.230 --> 04:59:17.700
and cultural heritage audience.

04:59:17.700 --> 04:59:20.220
So, one of the things that
we changed with this program

04:59:20.220 --> 04:59:24.660
and this might be something that we
could pick up again during the Q&amp;A

04:59:24.660 --> 04:59:27.390
and beyond, is this
notion of dissemination.

04:59:27.390 --> 04:59:31.400
So we have a lot of great projects
coming out of R&amp;D over the years

04:59:31.400 --> 04:59:35.230
and we always did require
a short section

04:59:35.230 --> 04:59:37.100
that we called dissemination.

04:59:37.100 --> 04:59:41.320
But over the last few years, we
were getting dissemination plans

04:59:41.320 --> 04:59:44.770
that included, "Well, we'll
develop a blog, but we will kind

04:59:44.770 --> 04:59:48.140
of update every once in a while,
and then we'll get on Twitter

04:59:48.140 --> 04:59:50.240
and we'll tweet it
every now and then.

04:59:50.240 --> 04:59:51.670
And -- or on Facebook."

04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:56.650
And somehow this whole community
is going to just magically pick

04:59:56.650 --> 05:00:00.600
up all this great new
knowledge and run with it.

05:00:00.600 --> 05:00:04.170
And in some cases that
was true, and it worked.

05:00:04.170 --> 05:00:09.020
But I think in a lot of cases,
the dissemination plan failed

05:00:09.020 --> 05:00:14.250
to match the great work that was
being conducted at the R&amp;D level.

05:00:14.250 --> 05:00:18.270
And if you are going to be -- if
you are going to develop standards

05:00:18.270 --> 05:00:21.780
and best practices, you have to
really engage the community, right?

05:00:21.780 --> 05:00:26.170
You have to really understand
what the communities' needs are

05:00:26.170 --> 05:00:29.910
and how they are going to receive
that knowledge and work with it,

05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:34.500
and begin to accept those
best practices going forward.

05:00:34.500 --> 05:00:38.550
So, we tried to elevate our
dissemination plan a little bit.

05:00:38.550 --> 05:00:43.310
We require a one to
two-page appendix that --

05:00:43.310 --> 05:00:47.120
and we're asking a
kind of demonstration

05:00:47.120 --> 05:00:49.650
that you understand how
to reach your community

05:00:49.650 --> 05:00:52.310
that you define within
your application.

05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:53.980
And, of course, there's
a whole suite

05:00:53.980 --> 05:00:59.290 position:56%
of possible dissemination
activities that can fall into a kind

05:00:59.290 --> 05:01:02.390
of creative plan, which can run
from workshops and training,

05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:06.490 position:56%
to educational modules,
publications, and then we're getting

05:01:06.490 --> 05:01:08.940
into things like code
sprints and conferences.

05:01:08.940 --> 05:01:14.170
And, of course, if you're looking
at getting a standard accepted,

05:01:14.170 --> 05:01:17.740
of course that will require
communication with a kind

05:01:17.740 --> 05:01:20.650
of regulatory body in some cases.

05:01:20.650 --> 05:01:24.540
So, the bottom line is we
would love to see R&amp;D projects

05:01:24.540 --> 05:01:26.360
that are interdisciplinary.

05:01:26.360 --> 05:01:30.890
And, again, I think this came up
in some of the earlier discussions

05:01:30.890 --> 05:01:35.330
about ways in which the
work being conducted

05:01:35.330 --> 05:01:38.910
on a very technical level can
link up with some of the work

05:01:38.910 --> 05:01:40.920
of the cultural heritage field.

05:01:40.920 --> 05:01:44.430
And I think the project
that Carl mentioned earlier,

05:01:44.430 --> 05:01:46.510
the linguistics project,
which I think Jesse will talk

05:01:46.510 --> 05:01:48.500
about further, is a great example.

05:01:48.500 --> 05:01:51.620
So we're striving to see projects
that are interdisciplinary

05:01:51.620 --> 05:01:54.860
in nature, international, again,

05:01:54.860 --> 05:01:58.960
that sort of merge the
humanities and the sciences.

05:01:58.960 --> 05:02:02.710
And of course, the sciences, when
we're talking about preservation,

05:02:02.710 --> 05:02:05.420
can run the gamut from
the information sciences,

05:02:05.420 --> 05:02:07.680
to computer science,
natural sciences, of course,

05:02:07.680 --> 05:02:12.680
and many cases here today, and
conservation science as well.

05:02:12.680 --> 05:02:15.470
So, I feel -- I think
I would be remiss

05:02:15.470 --> 05:02:23.080 position:56%
if I didn't actually give an
example of an optical audio project,

05:02:23.080 --> 05:02:27.190
besides supporting
IRENE in its early days.

05:02:27.190 --> 05:02:32.210 position:56%
And so we've actually supported a
project coming out of the University

05:02:32.210 --> 05:02:35.650
of South Carolina, which
they call EF -- AEO Light.

05:02:35.650 --> 05:02:38.840
Is anyone familiar with AEO Light?

05:02:38.840 --> 05:02:41.090
A little bit, yeah.

05:02:41.090 --> 05:02:46.040
Okay. So this is again why
dissemination is so important.

05:02:46.040 --> 05:02:49.540
This is actually related
to the film community.

05:02:49.540 --> 05:02:52.310
So, I don't know if I'm committing
heresy talking about film

05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:57.780
in an audio media environment,
but I think it's applicable here.

05:02:57.780 --> 05:03:04.220
So, as you can see in this image
here of a still from a film

05:03:04.220 --> 05:03:06.720
of Martin Luther King, Jr.,

05:03:06.720 --> 05:03:09.620
you see the optical track
running on the side.

05:03:09.620 --> 05:03:16.370
So, what the project director,
who is Greg Wilsbacher,

05:03:16.370 --> 05:03:20.860
he is collaborating with
the mathematical institute

05:03:20.860 --> 05:03:22.160
at South Carolina.

05:03:22.160 --> 05:03:24.070
And what they're doing is
essentially very similar

05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:26.020
to what we've been
talking about here today.

05:03:26.020 --> 05:03:32.500
They are creating images --
digitized images of 60 millimeter,

05:03:32.500 --> 05:03:38.810
35 millimeter film, which
captures both the optical sound,

05:03:38.810 --> 05:03:41.330
as well as the image.

05:03:41.330 --> 05:03:44.750
They're even going so far as to go
all the way out to the sprockets,

05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:46.950
and I'll show you why in a second.

05:03:46.950 --> 05:03:51.430
So -- and then what they
do is run an algorithm

05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:56.340
that extracts the optical
sound and links it

05:03:56.340 --> 05:04:00.020
with the digitized film images.

05:04:00.020 --> 05:04:04.280
Apologies for my email
going off like that.

05:04:04.280 --> 05:04:06.480
So, why is this significant?

05:04:06.480 --> 05:04:07.780
Why was it funded by NEH?

05:04:07.780 --> 05:04:11.570
Well, quite simply, what
they're hoping to accomplish,

05:04:11.570 --> 05:04:17.690 position:56%
and I think they're getting to it by
their second phase of their project,

05:04:17.690 --> 05:04:21.510
is essentially cutting
perhaps not completely in half,

05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:25.250
but close to half, the time
it takes to digitize a film.

05:04:25.250 --> 05:04:31.590
The process traditionally is
to capture the image first

05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:35.440
and then the audio second, and
then link them up afterwards.

05:04:35.440 --> 05:04:41.650
They're saying by capturing
audio and image simultaneously,

05:04:41.650 --> 05:04:48.330
and then linking them through this
mathematical software program,

05:04:48.330 --> 05:04:50.560
you can digitize the
film in half the time.

05:04:50.560 --> 05:04:51.900
And that's the hope.

05:04:51.900 --> 05:04:53.710
And I think they're
getting along their way.

05:04:53.710 --> 05:04:55.010
So if you go to their site,

05:04:55.010 --> 05:04:57.530
you can actually download
their software program.

05:04:57.530 --> 05:04:58.880
It's open source.

05:04:58.880 --> 05:05:02.140
I think they would be thrilled
to hear from a lot of you

05:05:02.140 --> 05:05:04.440
to get your feedback on that.

05:05:04.440 --> 05:05:08.240
And of course I'll play just a
very short clip of a test clip

05:05:08.240 --> 05:05:11.280
that they have on their
website here, so bear with me.

05:05:11.280 --> 05:05:13.580
Hopefully this will work.

05:05:16.560 --> 05:05:21.780
And this is a film of
Benito Mussolini from 1931,

05:05:21.780 --> 05:05:25.510
I believe from their Fox Movieton
[assumed spelling] collection.

05:05:25.510 --> 05:05:48.200
[ Playing Film ]

05:05:48.200 --> 05:05:50.020
So you can see the audio track

05:05:50.020 --> 05:05:54.730
on the left hand side running
simultaneously to the image,

05:05:54.730 --> 05:06:00.090
and you can see, of course, the
words on the very far edge of this.

05:06:00.090 --> 05:06:03.520
And the argument goes
that from a kind

05:06:03.520 --> 05:06:07.600
of digital humanities standpoint,
this is valuable information.

05:06:07.600 --> 05:06:10.000
This is essentially
providential information

05:06:10.000 --> 05:06:13.570
that certain humanity
scholars, media scholars,

05:06:13.570 --> 05:06:16.550
film scholars might find
quite valuable to help date

05:06:16.550 --> 05:06:19.820
and locate [inaudible]
of their film.

05:06:19.820 --> 05:06:24.600 position:56%
So with that I'm going to turn off
my e-mail and hand it over to Jesse.

05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:30.800
[ Applause ]

05:06:30.800 --> 05:06:35.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joshua Johnston: As Josh said,
he's talking more about the research

05:06:35.280 --> 05:06:37.410
and development sorts of
projects that we've supported

05:06:37.410 --> 05:06:44.280
that are somewhat related to the
IRENE and audio imaging efforts.

05:06:44.280 --> 05:06:46.980
And I'm going to talk about
the rest of our programs,

05:06:46.980 --> 05:06:50.140
and hopefully give you an
idea of some of the ways

05:06:50.140 --> 05:06:55.280
that they can support some of
the efforts that are happening

05:06:55.280 --> 05:06:57.970
in the audio preservation world.

05:06:59.450 --> 05:07:02.840
The Humanities Collections
and Reference Sources program,

05:07:02.840 --> 05:07:08.540
which is one that Josh has already
mentioned, is our largest program.

05:07:08.540 --> 05:07:11.640
And it's really focused on
advancing preservation and access

05:07:11.640 --> 05:07:15.510
for specific collections, as
Josh said, or also the design

05:07:15.510 --> 05:07:18.670
of reference resources, like
dictionaries and grammars.

05:07:18.670 --> 05:07:23.590
And in both of these areas it's
actually supported audio projects.

05:07:23.590 --> 05:07:26.460
So as you can see, we're sort

05:07:26.460 --> 05:07:30.310
of illustrating what these
programs can do by way of example.

05:07:30.310 --> 05:07:33.060
But if you have specific
questions about what sorts

05:07:33.060 --> 05:07:36.430
of activities are eligible or
ineligible, technically speaking,

05:07:36.430 --> 05:07:39.030
we can answer those
questions at the end.

05:07:39.030 --> 05:07:41.790
The examples I think are
probably most interesting,

05:07:41.790 --> 05:07:43.890
so I'll focus on those now.

05:07:43.890 --> 05:07:47.370
In 2012 the University of North
Carolina received an award,

05:07:47.370 --> 05:07:49.920
many of you are probably aware

05:07:49.920 --> 05:07:51.440
of the Southern [inaudible]
Collection there

05:07:51.440 --> 05:07:54.240
and they're preserving audio
recordings and photographs

05:07:54.240 --> 05:07:57.270
that document traditional
music and musicians

05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:59.260
of southeastern United States.

05:07:59.260 --> 05:08:03.500
And that actually is a hybrid
collection, so there's a lot

05:08:03.500 --> 05:08:05.780
of audio there, but this
is an archival collection

05:08:05.780 --> 05:08:09.850
that also has photographs,
related field notes as well.

05:08:09.850 --> 05:08:12.010
And so hybrid collections
are certainly something

05:08:12.010 --> 05:08:13.850
that we frequently see, given

05:08:13.850 --> 05:08:20.540
that our collections really cross
the broad range of documentation

05:08:20.540 --> 05:08:23.530
of humanities activities.

05:08:23.530 --> 05:08:25.570
In the Reference Resources category

05:08:25.570 --> 05:08:29.550
of this program we've also
supported discographic projects,

05:08:29.550 --> 05:08:32.410
including what's become the
American Discography Project,

05:08:32.410 --> 05:08:35.520
which grew out of the
Encyclopedia Discography

05:08:35.520 --> 05:08:38.600
of [inaudible] Recordings at
the University of California

05:08:38.600 --> 05:08:42.370
in Santa Barbara, which
received an award in 2011,

05:08:42.370 --> 05:08:44.380
and a couple of other times.

05:08:44.380 --> 05:08:50.190 position:56%
Recently we've supported a new level
in this program called Foundations,

05:08:50.190 --> 05:08:53.750
which offers support for
sort of early stage projects.

05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:57.280
So if all of the technical
details perhaps aren't set,

05:08:57.280 --> 05:09:01.990
hoping to bring together maybe
technical preservation people

05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:06.160
with humanities scholars
to lay the foundations

05:09:06.160 --> 05:09:08.100
as it were for future projects.

05:09:08.100 --> 05:09:11.080
I also want to tell
you about the Education

05:09:11.080 --> 05:09:13.060
and Training program that we offer.

05:09:13.060 --> 05:09:23.050
This is a program that also, like
R&amp;D, has been longstanding priority

05:09:23.050 --> 05:09:27.330
at any age, and we've supported
preservation education and training

05:09:27.330 --> 05:09:33.260
in various forms since the 1980s
when we took over a program

05:09:33.260 --> 05:09:36.220
of regional field services
that was previously funded

05:09:36.220 --> 05:09:38.760
by the National Endowment
for the Arts.

05:09:38.760 --> 05:09:43.750
And these now offer basic
preservation services,

05:09:43.750 --> 05:09:46.270
such as preservation
assessments, rehousing supplies,

05:09:46.270 --> 05:09:49.220
conducting emergency
preparedness workshops.

05:09:49.220 --> 05:09:50.600
And you're going to
hear a lot more from one

05:09:50.600 --> 05:09:53.360
of those services in a moment.

05:09:53.360 --> 05:09:57.720 position:56%
And they can sort of be the example.

05:09:57.720 --> 05:10:01.210
But this program also
supports other things.

05:10:01.210 --> 05:10:05.620
It supports master degree programs,
and it also supports workshops

05:10:05.620 --> 05:10:08.440
that address preservation
and access topics

05:10:08.440 --> 05:10:11.180
of national significance
and broad impact.

05:10:11.180 --> 05:10:15.370
And we include there in our
guidelines that the preservation of

05:10:15.370 --> 05:10:17.910
and provision of access
to recorded sound

05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:21.510
and moving image collections is one
of the priorities in this program.

05:10:21.510 --> 05:10:26.060
I think that it would be
accurate to say that we hope

05:10:26.060 --> 05:10:30.000
to continue that priority.

05:10:30.000 --> 05:10:33.790
And also, to give you an idea,
we have supported in the past.

05:10:33.790 --> 05:10:38.670 position:56%
For example, we've supported an
award to New York University in 2014

05:10:38.670 --> 05:10:40.620
that provides scholarships
to students

05:10:40.620 --> 05:10:43.650
in the Moving Image Archiving
and Preservation program,

05:10:43.650 --> 05:10:49.700 position:56%
for doing up to 24 internships, that
is 24 students doing internships

05:10:49.700 --> 05:10:54.200
at cultural heritage institutions
in the New York metropolitan area.

05:10:54.200 --> 05:10:57.540
The Center for the
Conservation of Art

05:10:57.540 --> 05:11:01.610
and Historical Artifacts also
has offered audio workshops

05:11:01.610 --> 05:11:04.180
through their preservation
field service,

05:11:04.180 --> 05:11:07.250
as have some of the other ones.

05:11:07.250 --> 05:11:12.890 position:56%
The Documenting Endangered Languages
program is a unique program

05:11:12.890 --> 05:11:14.720
that we have, it's a partnership

05:11:14.720 --> 05:11:17.140
with the National Science
Foundation.

05:11:17.140 --> 05:11:21.510 position:56%
Carl has already mentioned the award
that we recently made in partnership

05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:23.150 position:56%
with the National Science Foundation

05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:25.360
to the university of
California Berkley.

05:11:25.360 --> 05:11:28.600
And this, I guess at least the
second award that NHS has made,

05:11:28.600 --> 05:11:31.620
which supports an IRENE
focused project.

05:11:31.620 --> 05:11:36.670
And, as you know, they're
working on digitizing cylinders

05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:39.230
of Native American languages
gathered in California.

05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:43.680
It's a very unique collection
with high value to the humanities

05:11:43.680 --> 05:11:47.310
for documenting early history
of anthropology, as well as,

05:11:47.310 --> 05:11:49.760
and this is why it came

05:11:49.760 --> 05:11:52.090
to the Documenting
Endangered Languages program,

05:11:52.090 --> 05:11:57.840
documentation of languages that
are no longer spoken or they may be

05:11:57.840 --> 05:12:02.160
in a sort of [inaudible]
state and very few speakers,

05:12:02.160 --> 05:12:05.760
or an aging speaker population.

05:12:05.760 --> 05:12:08.370
We feel that these are
invaluable for scholarly research

05:12:08.370 --> 05:12:12.200
and broader purposes of cultural
and linguistic revitalization.

05:12:12.200 --> 05:12:16.580
And as you heard when the
project was mentioned earlier,

05:12:16.580 --> 05:12:20.490 position:56%
this is actually supported an
internal institutional collaboration

05:12:20.490 --> 05:12:22.350
between different units
of the university,

05:12:22.350 --> 05:12:24.760
as well as Lawrence Berkeley labs.

05:12:24.760 --> 05:12:30.660
And so we hope that is an example
that points to sort of the power

05:12:30.660 --> 05:12:33.790
of these programs to help
to encourage that sort

05:12:33.790 --> 05:12:37.630
of cross institutional and
inter institutional work.

05:12:37.630 --> 05:12:44.690
I'll just say a few words in
conclusion about our priority

05:12:44.690 --> 05:12:47.890
on audio/visual preservation.

05:12:47.890 --> 05:12:50.120
You have a better sense
now, I think,

05:12:50.120 --> 05:12:53.860 position:56%
of our divisions main grant programs
and how they related to preservation

05:12:53.860 --> 05:12:56.700
and access of audio/visual
materials.

05:12:56.700 --> 05:13:02.850 position:56%
And we have placed a priority on the
preservation of audio/visual content

05:13:02.850 --> 05:13:04.390
through various efforts,

05:13:04.390 --> 05:13:08.590
some of which I've covered
here, since at least 2000.

05:13:08.590 --> 05:13:11.780
So for about 15 years.

05:13:11.780 --> 05:13:17.480 position:56%
And in 2001, I believe, we supported
a symposium here at the Library

05:13:17.480 --> 05:13:20.410
in cooperation with some of the
other agencies and the Library

05:13:20.410 --> 05:13:23.920
on preserving folklore
documentation.

05:13:23.920 --> 05:13:26.630
And that was kind of a
first step and we hope

05:13:26.630 --> 05:13:29.330
that we're continuing in that vain.

05:13:29.330 --> 05:13:32.170
Our hope in sharing with you
some of the audio/visual projects

05:13:32.170 --> 05:13:37.170 position:56%
that we've discussed today, and that
NEH has supported over the years,

05:13:37.170 --> 05:13:40.680 position:56%
is partly to remind you that our
grant programming can support a wide

05:13:40.680 --> 05:13:43.730 position:56%
spectrum of preservation activities,
from research and development

05:13:43.730 --> 05:13:47.540
to education, to digital
reformatting.

05:13:47.540 --> 05:13:50.070
We also want to communicate
to you that we are interested

05:13:50.070 --> 05:13:52.050
in exploring options
for participating

05:13:52.050 --> 05:13:54.540
and supporting this
effort in better ways.

05:13:54.540 --> 05:13:57.910
We've heard the need to consider
areas as far ranging as format

05:13:57.910 --> 05:14:02.650 position:56%
and playback equipment obsolescence,
mass collection assessments,

05:14:02.650 --> 05:14:05.670
selection and appraisal,
quote storage for films,

05:14:05.670 --> 05:14:09.510
professional training, and
continued research and development.

05:14:09.510 --> 05:14:12.650
But we do hope to hear from those
working in these fields directly

05:14:12.650 --> 05:14:14.510
about how we could
better support that effort

05:14:14.510 --> 05:14:17.580
in a continuing way in the future.

05:14:17.580 --> 05:14:22.100
However, in a restricted
resource environment we do hope

05:14:22.100 --> 05:14:25.230
that in the spirit of the National
Recording Preservation Plan,

05:14:25.230 --> 05:14:29.110
and all other calls to action
that we are aware of as funders,

05:14:29.110 --> 05:14:34.090 position:56%
we do want to facilitate the maximum
impact of what is a small amount

05:14:34.090 --> 05:14:37.070
of financial resources by
fostering collaboration

05:14:37.070 --> 05:14:39.670
and coordination among many
stakeholder communities,

05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:43.600
which is why we've stressed that
theme of collaboration throughout.

05:14:43.600 --> 05:14:46.710
Many people that we've
spoken to have reminded us

05:14:46.710 --> 05:14:49.490
that audio/visual collections are
often overlooked, whether that's

05:14:49.490 --> 05:14:53.450
for lack of funding, preservation
experience, or simply lack

05:14:53.450 --> 05:14:56.420
of interest in relation to
other types of collections,

05:14:56.420 --> 05:14:58.990
or perhaps lacks of
technical familiarity among

05:14:58.990 --> 05:15:01.140
collection stewards.

05:15:01.140 --> 05:15:03.790
Given NEH's connection
to the scholarly

05:15:03.790 --> 05:15:06.540
and professional communities,
we think that our --

05:15:06.540 --> 05:15:11.640 position:56%
one of our contributions as a funder
can be to bring together the voices

05:15:11.640 --> 05:15:16.250
of scholars and researchers and
other audiences for these materials

05:15:16.250 --> 05:15:17.940
with preservation communities.

05:15:17.940 --> 05:15:20.320
That's sort of one of the unique
positions that the Division

05:15:20.320 --> 05:15:23.410 position:56%
of Preservation and Access occupies.

05:15:23.410 --> 05:15:26.080
In fact, we believe that only
with the voice of content

05:15:26.080 --> 05:15:29.630
and subject specialists,
including many that are here

05:15:29.630 --> 05:15:34.080
and who may be speaking tomorrow,
can effective arguments be made

05:15:34.080 --> 05:15:37.810
for the significance and importance
for expending scarce resources

05:15:37.810 --> 05:15:40.300
that are required to
select, access, reformat,

05:15:40.300 --> 05:15:42.970
and use the many audio/visual
resources

05:15:42.970 --> 05:15:45.570
that face uncertain futures.

05:15:45.570 --> 05:15:48.770
And finally, by reaching
out various user audiences,

05:15:48.770 --> 05:15:51.680 position:56%
including researchers and educators,
we hope to raise greater awareness

05:15:51.680 --> 05:15:54.420
of the scale of the challenge
of audio/visual preservation,

05:15:54.420 --> 05:15:57.870
which as many of you know is great.

05:15:57.870 --> 05:16:01.550
And we also hope to foster clearer
understandings of the various uses,

05:16:01.550 --> 05:16:04.210
approaches and ways to make
choices that confront us

05:16:04.210 --> 05:16:09.400
as we face this audio/visual
preservation challenge.

05:16:28.770 --> 05:16:35.070
Very quickly, we're in some
respects the odd man in the room

05:16:35.070 --> 05:16:39.610
because we're actually a paper
and book conservation center.

05:16:39.610 --> 05:16:43.250
And you might ask why are we
involved with audio preservation.

05:16:43.250 --> 05:16:46.530
Well, back in the '70s we
started doing microfilming

05:16:46.530 --> 05:16:48.530
and film duplication.

05:16:48.530 --> 05:16:52.140
And then in 2008, because
it was hard to get film,

05:16:52.140 --> 05:16:55.410
and I'm very impressed that you
can still get it in Switzerland,

05:16:55.410 --> 05:16:58.950 position:56%
the transitioned the imaging over --

05:16:58.950 --> 05:17:02.300
the microfilming and film
duplication to digital imaging.

05:17:02.300 --> 05:17:04.950
And then at that point,
because there's so much involved

05:17:04.950 --> 05:17:09.160
in post processing
with digital transfer,

05:17:09.160 --> 05:17:13.280 position:56%
it didn't become a very big leap for
us to start thinking about audio.

05:17:13.280 --> 05:17:15.400
And in fact most our
clients are archivists,

05:17:15.400 --> 05:17:19.160
not obviously audio engineers.

05:17:19.160 --> 05:17:23.600
And many, many archivists are
also charged with the stewardship

05:17:23.600 --> 05:17:26.990
of audio collections, but
they're scared to death.

05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:32.450 position:56%
So here we are as a nonprofit that's
been serving them for over 40 years,

05:17:32.450 --> 05:17:36.900 position:56%
they're very comfortable with us and
trust us, and they started asking us

05:17:36.900 --> 05:17:38.340
to get involved with audio.

05:17:38.340 --> 05:17:41.060
So that's why we are here today.

05:17:41.060 --> 05:17:44.830
That led to a conversation
with the Institute for Museum

05:17:44.830 --> 05:17:50.410
and Library Services to take a
look at this thing called IRENE.

05:17:50.410 --> 05:17:52.470
This is a few years ago.

05:17:52.470 --> 05:17:56.360
And we ended up writing a
grant to do a pilot to see

05:17:56.360 --> 05:18:02.300
if we could take IRENE from the
lab successfully to the market,

05:18:02.300 --> 05:18:06.100
so to speak, and use it not
as a scientific instrument,

05:18:06.100 --> 05:18:09.920
but as a reformatting
production tool.

05:18:09.920 --> 05:18:15.400
So these were the -- these were
the principle goals of the project.

05:18:15.400 --> 05:18:17.440
There were other questions as well,

05:18:17.440 --> 05:18:19.010
but I thought those
other ones wouldn't be

05:18:19.010 --> 05:18:20.880
as interesting to this audience.

05:18:20.880 --> 05:18:24.430
But the first one -- but
you can read them here.

05:18:24.430 --> 05:18:27.630
We were curious about
these kinds of question

05:18:27.630 --> 05:18:29.140
because these are the
questions that go

05:18:29.140 --> 05:18:32.530
into whether we could
sustain a service,

05:18:32.530 --> 05:18:39.900
and run it without losing money
and going out of -- going bankrupt.

05:18:39.900 --> 05:18:43.930
So I'll just cycle us
through these questions.

05:18:43.930 --> 05:18:47.980
First of all, what we did find
was that it is actually quite easy

05:18:47.980 --> 05:18:51.660
to learn to operate the
IRENE system with a person

05:18:51.660 --> 05:18:55.330
of average intelligence,
however you want to define that.

05:18:55.330 --> 05:18:58.890
It starts to become a
little bit more difficult

05:18:58.890 --> 05:19:04.700
when there are mechanical issues,
so you do need some greater

05:19:04.700 --> 05:19:07.710
than normal mechanical aptitude
to do some troubleshooting.

05:19:07.710 --> 05:19:12.100
If you are all thumbs and
have no mechanical aptitude,

05:19:12.100 --> 05:19:14.850
this is probably not
the technology for you

05:19:14.850 --> 05:19:17.990
at this stage in its development.

05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:23.360
But in terms of the software,
although software is very stable

05:19:23.360 --> 05:19:26.840
and it's not particularly buggy,
which we felt very good about.

05:19:26.840 --> 05:19:29.850
We were concerned that it might
be crashing every 10 minutes

05:19:29.850 --> 05:19:33.580
and we can't get anything done,
that is not the case at all.

05:19:33.580 --> 05:19:38.050 position:56%
But when you want to make an
enhancement or a tweak or something,

05:19:38.050 --> 05:19:41.710
that requires a callback to
Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.

05:19:41.710 --> 05:19:46.170
So almost half jokingly, but not
really, we have said that we need

05:19:46.170 --> 05:19:50.920 position:56%
to take He-Man life insurance out on
Earl Cornell, which is a little bit

05:19:50.920 --> 05:19:52.830
of a morbid thought,
Earl, sorry about that,

05:19:52.830 --> 05:19:56.650
but we haven't gotten
it, don't worry.

05:19:56.650 --> 05:20:00.550
Okay, in terms of the hardware,
we did receive this upgrade model,

05:20:00.550 --> 05:20:03.440 position:56%
you've all heard about that, you saw
pictures of it that Carl presented.

05:20:03.440 --> 05:20:06.250
It has the 2D and the
3D on the same platform

05:20:06.250 --> 05:20:11.300 position:56%
so that we could switch easily to 3D
to scan a disc without having to go

05:20:11.300 --> 05:20:14.110
through a lot of extra setup.

05:20:14.110 --> 05:20:15.670
There are some issues, though.

05:20:15.670 --> 05:20:19.620
As parts get upgraded
or replaced, there is --

05:20:19.620 --> 05:20:23.360
there are some issues with
having to then potentially have

05:20:23.360 --> 05:20:29.120
to modify the software, and even
the firmware, the OEM might have

05:20:29.120 --> 05:20:31.030
to make some modifications.

05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:35.110
So we saw that with I
think our probe, you know,

05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:38.260
early on where we had
to go back to the OEM

05:20:38.260 --> 05:20:40.890
and ask them to make some changes.

05:20:40.890 --> 05:20:44.050
But the good news is
that it's very reliable.

05:20:44.050 --> 05:20:48.120
Once it works, it works,
mechanically

05:20:48.120 --> 05:20:49.890
and in terms of the software.

05:20:49.890 --> 05:20:53.770
Now, there are some challenges,
and we'll segue to Mason

05:20:53.770 --> 05:20:57.450
in a second here where he'll talk
about some challenges that had more

05:20:57.450 --> 05:21:02.840
to do with the carriers themselves
and having to do some fussing

05:21:02.840 --> 05:21:04.490
because of the optical approach.

05:21:04.490 --> 05:21:09.220
Okay, what I really want to focus
on here is some of the questions

05:21:09.220 --> 05:21:12.850 position:56%
that were being asked earlier in the
day which is, so if you're trying

05:21:12.850 --> 05:21:17.470 position:56%
to use this as a tool, how practical
is it, how much can you get done.

05:21:17.470 --> 05:21:23.380
And in our case our clients want to
know, what is this going to cost.

05:21:23.380 --> 05:21:29.620
Now, there are three variables to
providing this kind of a service.

05:21:29.620 --> 05:21:33.970
One is, you're efficiency,
which is how many billable hours

05:21:33.970 --> 05:21:38.430
out of all the paid hours in
the day your staff can work.

05:21:38.430 --> 05:21:43.720 position:56%
The next is the billing rate which
has more to do with NEDCCs overhead.

05:21:43.720 --> 05:21:45.520
And then finally the productivity,

05:21:45.520 --> 05:21:49.220
which is ultimately
the ultimate measure,

05:21:49.220 --> 05:21:53.250
which is how many recording
you can do per billable hour.

05:21:53.250 --> 05:21:57.280
So in terms of efficiency it
actually has nothing to do

05:21:57.280 --> 05:22:01.820
with IRENE or any piece of
equipment that you're using.

05:22:01.820 --> 05:22:05.480
This is how many hours
out of the day you're able

05:22:05.480 --> 05:22:07.000
to bill your time out.

05:22:07.000 --> 05:22:09.750
So you're taking out
any administrative time

05:22:09.750 --> 05:22:13.140
and you're reducing it down to how
many hours am I actually serving

05:22:13.140 --> 05:22:14.580
a client.

05:22:14.580 --> 05:22:17.930
So that really has to do
with the operator, you know,

05:22:17.930 --> 05:22:22.740
their work ethic, the work
ethic in the workplace.

05:22:22.740 --> 05:22:27.930
And we start work at 8:30, are
people serving clients at 8:31,

05:22:27.930 --> 05:22:29.910
or are they kind of getting
around to it after a couple

05:22:29.910 --> 05:22:32.200
of cups of coffee, right?

05:22:32.200 --> 05:22:36.400
The billing rate also
nothing to do with IRENE,

05:22:36.400 --> 05:22:40.140
has all to do with the
costs of labor and overhead.

05:22:40.140 --> 05:22:43.370
But productivity has
to d with two things,

05:22:43.370 --> 05:22:47.750
it has to do with the operator
and their workflow habits

05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:51.710
within the constraints of the tool.

05:22:51.710 --> 05:22:56.010
So, what are the constraints
of the tool?

05:22:56.010 --> 05:22:58.610
Well, in our case one of the
things we were trying to test

05:22:58.610 --> 05:23:00.760
with the pilot was, you know,

05:23:00.760 --> 05:23:06.280
could we operate multiple IRENE
machines at once by one operator.

05:23:06.280 --> 05:23:10.120
And our conclusion at this stage
is, with our current configuration

05:23:10.120 --> 05:23:13.840
of the machine, it would be
impractical to try to have more

05:23:13.840 --> 05:23:19.540 position:56%
than one machine person, and you'll
see why in a second, I have a slide.

05:23:19.540 --> 05:23:25.260
But we need to be mindful that
in the, you know, 12 or 15 years

05:23:25.260 --> 05:23:27.970
of development of IRENE,
the focus has not been

05:23:27.970 --> 05:23:33.140
on its production capacity, it's
been on the science of imaging

05:23:33.140 --> 05:23:35.140
and analyzing those images.

05:23:35.140 --> 05:23:39.760
So there's this now new phase
of opportunity to start focusing

05:23:39.760 --> 05:23:41.840
in addition on productivity.

05:23:41.840 --> 05:23:45.110
So these are not problems
with IRENE,

05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:49.380
these are opportunities
going forward.

05:23:49.380 --> 05:23:52.960
There is a little bit of
multitasking you can do.

05:23:52.960 --> 05:23:55.260
Once you've scanned
your first carrier,

05:23:55.260 --> 05:23:59.030
you could be scanning the second
carrier while you're analyzing the

05:23:59.030 --> 05:24:00.940
first one, okay?

05:24:00.940 --> 05:24:03.980
So there's a little bit of
two to one workflow for all

05:24:03.980 --> 05:24:05.750
but the first and last recordings.

05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:07.380 position:56%
And then, because of that, the first

05:24:07.380 --> 05:24:10.540
and the last recordings
are 50% more expensive.

05:24:10.540 --> 05:24:14.700
So all this means is that we say
to clients, look, if you have more

05:24:14.700 --> 05:24:18.590
than one carrier, don't send
them to us one at a time.

05:24:18.590 --> 05:24:23.750
Bunch them up and help us help
you by making these projects --

05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:27.010
you know, scaling these
projects up a little bit,

05:24:27.010 --> 05:24:31.560
because we can get you
-- save you some money.

05:24:31.560 --> 05:24:34.520
So, you know, here's what we
can do with our one machine.

05:24:34.520 --> 05:24:39.930
We can start a scan and then while
recording one is being analyzed we

05:24:39.930 --> 05:24:43.100
can start scanning
recording two, etcetera.

05:24:43.100 --> 05:24:46.160
Until finally, at the end of the
day, you know, you're just kind

05:24:46.160 --> 05:24:47.670
of analyzing the last one.

05:24:47.670 --> 05:24:50.970 position:56%
Now you could be recording something
for the next morning, of course,

05:24:50.970 --> 05:24:55.140
but this just an example of if
you had an eight carrier project.

05:24:55.140 --> 05:25:02.100 position:56%
Now two to one with IRENE is not the
same as two to one with a stylus.

05:25:02.100 --> 05:25:04.920
Two to one in real time means

05:25:04.920 --> 05:25:08.840
that you can't be doing
two things at once.

05:25:08.840 --> 05:25:12.450
Or rather you're attending
to two things at once,

05:25:12.450 --> 05:25:14.990
so one of those things that
you're not paying attention

05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:17.940
to is not being paid attention to.

05:25:17.940 --> 05:25:21.420
But two to one with a
scanning approach means

05:25:21.420 --> 05:25:23.630
that the imaging can be unattended,

05:25:23.630 --> 05:25:25.270
which is okay because
there's really nothing

05:25:25.270 --> 05:25:26.700
to do while it's being imaged.

05:25:26.700 --> 05:25:29.660
I mean, you could watch
it as it's being imaged,

05:25:29.660 --> 05:25:32.370
but there's no point in doing that.

05:25:32.370 --> 05:25:35.290
But the analysis is
always attended, okay.

05:25:35.290 --> 05:25:40.260
So it's -- there's not this issue
that people are concerned about,

05:25:40.260 --> 05:25:43.900
you know, 12 to 1 workflows,

05:25:43.900 --> 05:25:47.370
because the vendors is
really not paying attention

05:25:47.370 --> 05:25:49.650
to what they're doing, right,
they're just more focused

05:25:49.650 --> 05:25:52.000
on their own bottom line.

05:25:52.000 --> 05:25:53.970
So here's an example.

05:25:53.970 --> 05:25:57.610
At NEDCC we strive
for 90% efficiency.

05:25:57.610 --> 05:26:01.570
In other words, we want 90% of
the seven and a half hour workday

05:26:01.570 --> 05:26:07.070
to be focused on clients and
not on admin stuff and things

05:26:07.070 --> 05:26:08.370
that would be distracting.

05:26:08.370 --> 05:26:10.840
So that translates
to 6.75 hours a day.

05:26:10.840 --> 05:26:13.860
Our billing rate is $125 an hour.

05:26:13.860 --> 05:26:22.500
And if takes 90 minutes to scan
and analyze a single carrier,

05:26:22.500 --> 05:26:25.030
using that graph that I
showed you previously,

05:26:25.030 --> 05:26:27.280
we could do eight carriers a day.

05:26:27.280 --> 05:26:32.480
So if you do the math on
that, it's $105 per recording.

05:26:32.480 --> 05:26:34.870
Now, it can get quite
a bit more expensive

05:26:34.870 --> 05:26:38.620
if the recordings are broken
or cracked or dirty we have

05:26:38.620 --> 05:26:42.530
to clean them, you know,
there could be added costs.

05:26:42.530 --> 05:26:47.830
If they're, you know, large
discs, bigger cylinders

05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:49.570
and those kinds of things.

05:26:49.570 --> 05:26:54.570
So there is this opportunity, as
I mentioned, to now start to --

05:26:54.570 --> 05:26:56.160
now that we know the
technology works

05:26:56.160 --> 05:27:00.000
and in some cases it works
better than the stylus approach

05:27:00.000 --> 05:27:05.340
because we can get more signal,
there is this opportunity now

05:27:05.340 --> 05:27:09.720
to start focusing in
addition on productivity.

05:27:09.720 --> 05:27:11.910
And you've heard Carl talk --

05:27:11.910 --> 05:27:14.670
he gave you the picture
of the shish kabob design,

05:27:14.670 --> 05:27:16.660
which we're very interested in,

05:27:16.660 --> 05:27:20.300
but he also just verbally described
some other approaches you could do

05:27:20.300 --> 05:27:22.970
by just throwing cameras
at the situation.

05:27:22.970 --> 05:27:25.480
I was talking with Earl about
this at lunch and, you know,

05:27:25.480 --> 05:27:29.350
we were talking about some of the
challenges and the bottlenecks,

05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:32.140
and what might seem expensive
in terms of equipment

05:27:32.140 --> 05:27:35.330 position:56%
from our standpoint is a cheap date.

05:27:35.330 --> 05:27:39.810
Because when you're billing
out at $125 an hour, you know,

05:27:39.810 --> 05:27:44.460
if you had to spend $500
for some component or $1000

05:27:44.460 --> 05:27:49.830
for some component to cut the
time in half, that's nothing.

05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:54.260
You know, you can make that back
within hours, you know, or days.

05:27:54.260 --> 05:27:58.870
So really this is -- you know,
this isn't a physicist math,

05:27:58.870 --> 05:28:01.010
this is a business persons math.

05:28:01.010 --> 05:28:06.630
But I would not discount spending
a lot of extra money, frankly,

05:28:06.630 --> 05:28:11.580
to speed up the process, because
you'll get it back in production.

05:28:11.580 --> 05:28:14.690
We just need to do the
back of the envelope math.

05:28:14.690 --> 05:28:20.300
So at this point what I'm going
to do is turn it over to Mason,

05:28:20.300 --> 05:28:24.260
who's going to describe some of the
challenges the physical carriers

05:28:24.260 --> 05:28:30.070
that can throw a big time wrench
into that graph I showed you

05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:32.530
where we could do eight
units per day.

05:28:38.170 --> 05:28:39.950
&gt;&gt; Mason Vander Lugt: Hi
everybody, can you hear me?

05:28:39.950 --> 05:28:43.010
I'm Mason Vander and I
operate the IRENE at NEDCC.

05:28:43.010 --> 05:28:46.470
I'm going to try to make this quick
because I've got a presentation

05:28:46.470 --> 05:28:48.450
of my own that we're
kind of going over.

05:28:48.450 --> 05:28:53.600
So none of us expected IRENE to be
ready off the shelf when we got it.

05:28:53.600 --> 05:28:57.180
We understood we were kind of
inheriting a complicated technology

05:28:57.180 --> 05:29:00.610
that was combining
image sensors, lasers,

05:29:00.610 --> 05:29:02.960
vibration isolation, networking.

05:29:02.960 --> 05:29:08.460
So we expected a lot of that
and had a lot of small problems

05:29:08.460 --> 05:29:11.630
that were mostly kind of bug fixes,

05:29:11.630 --> 05:29:13.940
hours on the phone
with Earl and Carl.

05:29:13.940 --> 05:29:17.330
But kind of one of the
most standing issue

05:29:17.330 --> 05:29:21.210
that we still [inaudible] is
making lacquer disking a little

05:29:21.210 --> 05:29:22.600
more reliable.

05:29:22.600 --> 05:29:27.050
So the biggest problem with lacquer
discs is that they can be difficult

05:29:27.050 --> 05:29:32.360
to image, and we saw this
earlier in Stefano's presentation,

05:29:32.360 --> 05:29:34.750
that the groove bottom isn't
always visible and that's

05:29:34.750 --> 05:29:36.940 position:56%
where we want to get our audio from.

05:29:36.940 --> 05:29:39.950
So this is actually a shellac
disc on the corner of the screen

05:29:39.950 --> 05:29:43.700
and it -- I'll explain a little bit
more about how these images work

05:29:43.700 --> 05:29:47.110
in my own talk, but what you
see is a number of grooves,

05:29:47.110 --> 05:29:48.750
the vertical blank lines.

05:29:48.750 --> 05:29:51.030
In the middle of each black
line is another white line,

05:29:51.030 --> 05:29:53.580
which represents the
bottom of the groove.

05:29:53.580 --> 05:29:55.370
So that's -- you know, when I see

05:29:55.370 --> 05:29:59.190
that I know I can get good
sound from these images.

05:29:59.190 --> 05:30:03.180
Lacquer discs are cut instead
of pressed, and so in the middle

05:30:03.180 --> 05:30:07.560 position:56%
of groove, instead of a clear
groove bottom we often seen nothing.

05:30:07.560 --> 05:30:10.490
If it's an angle it doesn't
really reflect light.

05:30:10.490 --> 05:30:14.120
So we see this, you know,
just the black line.

05:30:14.120 --> 05:30:19.460
So this is an example
of the lacquer disc.

05:30:19.460 --> 05:30:20.760
One of the ways we've tried to get

05:30:20.760 --> 05:30:23.490
around this problem is
by using side lighting.

05:30:23.490 --> 05:30:26.210
So instead of illuminating
the imaging from the top,

05:30:26.210 --> 05:30:29.650
we bring in a light from
the side at an angle

05:30:29.650 --> 05:30:34.510
and it gets a different part
of the groove, and these kind

05:30:34.510 --> 05:30:38.990
of thicker white lines are the
bottom corner of a groove, I guess.

05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:43.110
It can act as a groove bottom and
we can get good audio from that.

05:30:43.110 --> 05:30:47.230
The problem is that
it takes a lot longer.

05:30:47.230 --> 05:30:48.620
Another way to get
around this problem is

05:30:48.620 --> 05:30:50.990
to analyze the groove tops instead.

05:30:50.990 --> 05:30:54.450
Again, this takes a lot longer
and doesn't produce the same kind

05:30:54.450 --> 05:30:57.490
of audio we expect
from a groove bottom.

05:30:57.490 --> 05:31:01.050
I need to go back a minute.

05:31:01.050 --> 05:31:07.430
So these are things that we'd
like to see become more reliable.

05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:08.890
Using either side lighting

05:31:08.890 --> 05:31:12.240
or the groove top analysis we can
usually get something from a disc,

05:31:12.240 --> 05:31:15.120
it's just not the eight
recordings a day that we

05:31:15.120 --> 05:31:19.350
like to keep productive with.

05:31:19.350 --> 05:31:23.510
Another problem we have with
lacquer discs is a loss of focus.

05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:27.960
Lacquer discs, while lacquer itself
is transparent or translucent,

05:31:27.960 --> 05:31:32.560
instead of the kind of opaque
and textured shellac discs.

05:31:32.560 --> 05:31:37.260
So the lasers we use to
detect the recording's surface

05:31:37.260 --> 05:31:42.620 position:56%
and move the camera to stay in focus
sometimes see through the lacquer

05:31:42.620 --> 05:31:45.230
and read the bottom of
the discs, or see texture

05:31:45.230 --> 05:31:47.890
in [inaudible] oxidation.

05:31:47.890 --> 05:31:52.360
And because IRENE uses such
a small depth to focus,

05:31:52.360 --> 05:31:55.930
even very slight misreading
in the [inaudible] system,

05:31:55.930 --> 05:32:00.200
which is the laser, can cause
an instant of loss of focus.

05:32:00.200 --> 05:32:03.340
And there are a couple ways we've
talked about working around this,

05:32:03.340 --> 05:32:08.170
like increasing the depth of
focus, or using a different system

05:32:08.170 --> 05:32:12.010
to detect the recording's surface.

05:32:12.010 --> 05:32:14.640
And then finally one of the
ways we lose time frequently

05:32:14.640 --> 05:32:20.710
with lacquer discs is a
difference in tracking them.

05:32:20.710 --> 05:32:25.760
As Carl described, tracking is
telling the computer software

05:32:25.760 --> 05:32:28.940
where the groove goes through
the image, so from kind of top

05:32:28.940 --> 05:32:31.100
to bottom of the image and across.

05:32:31.100 --> 05:32:33.610
Lacquer discs can be a huge range

05:32:33.610 --> 05:32:35.750
of different types of
recording's, really.

05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:39.460
So from commercial masters that
are predictable and well recorded

05:32:39.460 --> 05:32:42.140
to basically toys and
paper based [inaudible].

05:32:42.140 --> 05:32:46.520
And I'll get into this more
in my next talk as well.

05:32:46.520 --> 05:32:50.050
But this is a shellac disc
and it's a commercial disc.

05:32:50.050 --> 05:32:54.590
But often we see something more
like this, where I don't know

05:32:54.590 --> 05:32:58.790
if the recordist wasn't trained,
or the machine wasn't calibrated,

05:32:58.790 --> 05:33:00.490
but the grooves run together.

05:33:00.490 --> 05:33:04.780
And then when the software is
trying to track this automatically,

05:33:04.780 --> 05:33:09.190 position:56%
it doesn't have the same information
and kind of skips grooves or,

05:33:09.190 --> 05:33:11.280 position:56%
you know, reads in between the lines

05:33:11.280 --> 05:33:13.950
and creates these kind
of blue things.

05:33:13.950 --> 05:33:16.430
And then I have to go
through and manually track.

05:33:16.430 --> 05:33:19.230
So this is the [inaudible]
tracking algorithm.

05:33:19.230 --> 05:33:24.130
And the other automatic
tracking we use is new tracking,

05:33:24.130 --> 05:33:25.750
and that uses the groove bottom.

05:33:25.750 --> 05:33:29.240 position:56%
And so often if there isn't a
groove bottom, or if there's texture

05:33:29.240 --> 05:33:30.540
in the top of the groove,

05:33:30.540 --> 05:33:34.230
like we see in this scratch
here, it just skips grooves.

05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:37.920
And so, again, I can work around
this using manual tracking,

05:33:37.920 --> 05:33:40.340
it's just one of the things that
cuts into our time if we're trying

05:33:40.340 --> 05:33:45.550
to keep any kind of
meaningful workflow.

05:33:45.550 --> 05:33:51.980
So I'll turn it back to Bill
and I'll be back up in a minute.

05:33:51.980 --> 05:33:54.160
&gt;&gt; Bill Veillette: So, you know,
another consequence of some

05:33:54.160 --> 05:33:56.360
of these issues with the
carriers that you don't are there

05:33:56.360 --> 05:34:00.410
until you can scanned is that, you
know, one thing clients expect is

05:34:00.410 --> 05:34:02.440
when you give them a
proposal, they want to know

05:34:02.440 --> 05:34:05.940
that the price is the price.

05:34:05.940 --> 05:34:08.720
So, you know, we do have some
caveats in the proposal to say,

05:34:08.720 --> 05:34:11.970
you know, sometimes we can't
see the groove bottom, etcetera.

05:34:11.970 --> 05:34:16.950 position:56%
And so far so good, you know, people
have been pretty understanding

05:34:16.950 --> 05:34:21.000
that the technology is, you
know, still being developed.

05:34:21.000 --> 05:34:26.130
Okay, just a couple slides to end.

05:34:26.130 --> 05:34:30.030
We got a big grant from the
Mellon Foundation to do a study

05:34:30.030 --> 05:34:33.420
of the audio preservation
market because we're planning

05:34:33.420 --> 05:34:36.210
on getting further
into audio preservation

05:34:36.210 --> 05:34:39.010
by reformatting magnetic media.

05:34:39.010 --> 05:34:43.970
And so we hired AV Preserve
to do this study and they --

05:34:43.970 --> 05:34:47.190
and this is just a little data
point out of it where they found

05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:51.840 position:56%
that there are 46 million
preservation worthy grooved carriers

05:34:51.840 --> 05:34:54.320 position:56%
that require a specialized workflow.

05:34:54.320 --> 05:34:59.750
Now, this 46 million happens to be
the same number as the 46 million

05:34:59.750 --> 05:35:05.870
that the Heritage Health Index came
up with for all audio back in 2005.

05:35:05.870 --> 05:35:11.610
AV Preserve's number now
is 250 million audio items.

05:35:11.610 --> 05:35:13.910
And there's a paper
where they can defend

05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:16.560
that number that I'll refer you to.

05:35:16.560 --> 05:35:17.930
You can Google it.

05:35:17.930 --> 05:35:26.000
But, you know, this 46 million
isn't all rare groove carriers

05:35:26.000 --> 05:35:29.070
like wax cylinders
and lacquer discs.

05:35:29.070 --> 05:35:33.770
But presuming we just use that
number, if we can do 1720 cylinders

05:35:33.770 --> 05:35:37.690
or discs per year based
on 215 productive days,

05:35:37.690 --> 05:35:42.570
in a best case scenario, and
you do the math over 50 years,

05:35:42.570 --> 05:35:46.160
you would need 535 IRENE
machines over 50 years

05:35:46.160 --> 05:35:50.120
to complete all this work, if you
did them all with IRENE machines,

05:35:50.120 --> 05:35:52.240
which is not appropriate.

05:35:52.240 --> 05:35:56.800
They're appropriate for certain
materials, and less so for others.

05:35:56.800 --> 05:35:59.690
But the point here is
that prioritization

05:35:59.690 --> 05:36:02.070
and selection is going
to be critical.

05:36:02.070 --> 05:36:08.040
So our counsel to clients
is that, IRENE is best used

05:36:08.040 --> 05:36:12.480
for delicate recordings
that are unique, rare.

05:36:12.480 --> 05:36:15.400
Recordings that are rare formats

05:36:15.400 --> 05:36:19.200
where the equipment may not be
available to play them otherwise.

05:36:19.200 --> 05:36:21.600
And then the obvious one
that everybody thinks of,

05:36:21.600 --> 05:36:25.120
and we don't need to tell them,
is damaged and broken media.

05:36:25.120 --> 05:36:29.100
But we specifically say to
them, please don't, you know,

05:36:29.100 --> 05:36:32.150
use it for commercial recordings,
we want to reserve our time

05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:36.960 position:56%
on our IRENE machine for people who
have these other types of materials.

05:36:36.960 --> 05:36:41.720 position:56%
The final thing that we were charged
with in our IMLS grant was to figure

05:36:41.720 --> 05:36:47.630
out if there was a way we could
help sustain R&amp;D for IRENE.

05:36:47.630 --> 05:36:50.530
And there were lots of different
things we were talking about,

05:36:50.530 --> 05:36:54.620 position:56%
but this turns out to be really
probably the best way we could help.

05:36:54.620 --> 05:36:58.620
We had some focus groups that
were not part of the IMLS project,

05:36:58.620 --> 05:37:01.640
or part of the that
Mellon funded study,

05:37:01.640 --> 05:37:04.840
but we kind of folded some
IRENE questions into it,

05:37:04.840 --> 05:37:07.890
and found out that
clients are willing to pay

05:37:07.890 --> 05:37:12.270
up to 15% more for
an optical approach.

05:37:12.270 --> 05:37:14.330
And remember, most of these
clients are archivists,

05:37:14.330 --> 05:37:17.420
they're not audio engineers,
and they're just --

05:37:17.420 --> 05:37:19.320
you know, these are
people who don't like to --

05:37:19.320 --> 05:37:21.120
anybody to touch anything.

05:37:21.120 --> 05:37:24.790
So it's very appealing to
them the noncontact approach,

05:37:24.790 --> 05:37:27.730
and they're willing to
pay a premium for it.

05:37:27.730 --> 05:37:32.360
The question is, can we use this
15% to support our R&amp;D and would

05:37:32.360 --> 05:37:35.240
that provide enough
money to move the needle.

05:37:35.240 --> 05:37:39.230
So if you do the math on our
billable hours and our rate

05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:41.690
and whatnot, the bottom
line is it comes

05:37:41.690 --> 05:37:49.690
out to $27,000 per IRENE
machine that we could feed back

05:37:49.690 --> 05:37:54.250
to the effort to develop
the system further.

05:37:54.250 --> 05:37:57.720
So that might seem
like a small amount,

05:37:57.720 --> 05:37:59.780
but really the world needs more

05:37:59.780 --> 05:38:03.130
than one IRENE machine
providing services.

05:38:03.130 --> 05:38:07.020
And so it could end up
being a pretty good amount

05:38:07.020 --> 05:38:09.410
as you multiply this by
the number of machines

05:38:09.410 --> 05:38:12.350
that are put into production.

05:38:12.350 --> 05:38:16.240
Finally, our study
found out that 46%

05:38:16.240 --> 05:38:19.740
of perspective clients
could not proceed

05:38:19.740 --> 05:38:23.020
with their audio projects
unless they had a grant.

05:38:23.020 --> 05:38:28.130
So if you do the math on that
as well, knowing that based

05:38:28.130 --> 05:38:30.520
on the previous slide we
need $208 [sic] per year

05:38:30.520 --> 05:38:36.400
to sustain each IRENE machine at
full capacity, we need to make sure

05:38:36.400 --> 05:38:38.980
that there are enough grant
programs out there to the tune

05:38:38.980 --> 05:38:45.040
of $96,000 per machine
to sustain the machine.

05:38:45.040 --> 05:38:52.230 position:56%
Otherwise we actually get starved of
kind of capital which is the oxygen

05:38:52.230 --> 05:38:56.190
for doing all sorts of
-- any kind of work.

05:38:56.190 --> 05:38:58.550
So that's our presentation.

05:38:58.550 --> 05:39:03.950
If you want to learn more we have a
very robust section of our website

05:39:03.950 --> 05:39:06.690
where we describe the
service in more detail,

05:39:06.690 --> 05:39:12.710
what the deliverables are, you
know, what is part of the proposal,

05:39:12.710 --> 05:39:15.080
these caveats that I mentioned.

05:39:15.080 --> 05:39:20.620
And we also have some very good
examples about how to clean discs

05:39:20.620 --> 05:39:26.000
that we put up there based on
[inaudible] vetted approach and how

05:39:26.000 --> 05:39:27.790
to ship and pack and
all that kind of stuff.

05:39:27.790 --> 05:39:32.790
So it's a very interesting
website in terms of, you know,

05:39:32.790 --> 05:39:36.830
understanding how an optical
scanning service is being presented

05:39:36.830 --> 05:39:39.930
to perspective clients, so I
encourage you to go there to look

05:39:39.930 --> 05:39:41.730
at those kinds of things.

05:39:41.730 --> 05:39:43.420
So at this point I'm going
to turn it over to Mason

05:39:43.420 --> 05:39:46.010
who has a really interesting
presentation.

05:39:46.010 --> 05:39:52.210
I know we're running late on
time, but let me just pause here

05:39:52.210 --> 05:39:55.080
and get his up and
we'll get him going.

05:39:55.080 --> 05:39:56.830
&gt;&gt; Mason Vander Lugt: All right,
so I want to talk a little bit

05:39:56.830 --> 05:40:01.200
about using images for not
their intended purpose.

05:40:01.200 --> 05:40:04.420
What am I going to talk about?

05:40:04.420 --> 05:40:07.150
So we use IRENE because
it is contact free

05:40:07.150 --> 05:40:09.030
and doesn't risk our recordings.

05:40:09.030 --> 05:40:13.140
But as an intermediary step we
are left with these digital images

05:40:13.140 --> 05:40:16.840
that are very high
magnification and high resolution.

05:40:16.840 --> 05:40:19.310
And I think these images
are pretty useful.

05:40:19.310 --> 05:40:21.780
If we take a step back I
think they can teach us

05:40:21.780 --> 05:40:25.840
about the recordings themselves,
the degradation of the recordings

05:40:25.840 --> 05:40:31.590
and also help us improve the
operation of our IRENE system.

05:40:31.590 --> 05:40:35.260
So I think some of you -- everybody
understands this at this point.

05:40:35.260 --> 05:40:38.210
IRENE uses 2D and a 3D camera.

05:40:38.210 --> 05:40:43.110
They're both line scan
cameras, and so we take a pass,

05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:46.590
the cylinder rotates, we
move on to the second pass.

05:40:46.590 --> 05:40:48.360
And over time we're
left with a complete map

05:40:48.360 --> 05:40:51.080
of the surface to the recording.

05:40:51.080 --> 05:40:54.470
So the natural proportions
of the images,

05:40:54.470 --> 05:40:57.870
their width is constrained
by the image sensor.

05:40:57.870 --> 05:41:00.620
But we want to take
enough image samples

05:41:00.620 --> 05:41:03.250
so we can get the desired
audio sample rate.

05:41:03.250 --> 05:41:06.200
So this long black line on the left
is actually the natural proportion

05:41:06.200 --> 05:41:07.600
of the image.

05:41:07.600 --> 05:41:13.680
If we zoom in at full resolution
we're left with this middle image.

05:41:13.680 --> 05:41:16.130
And then there's another
kind of image I'll show today

05:41:16.130 --> 05:41:20.960
that is a little bit
less easy to understand,

05:41:20.960 --> 05:41:22.630
but we call them binned images.

05:41:22.630 --> 05:41:26.240
And this is what we do when we're
analyzing software to help us --

05:41:26.240 --> 05:41:29.470
analyzing the data,
rather, to help us track.

05:41:29.470 --> 05:41:34.640
And we sample the image vertically
so we can get a full picture

05:41:34.640 --> 05:41:37.220
of where the grooves go
without having to scroll

05:41:37.220 --> 05:41:40.080
through a long image like this.

05:41:40.080 --> 05:41:43.130
So this is just a condensed --

05:41:43.130 --> 05:41:46.710
vertically condensed image
like the one on the left.

05:41:46.710 --> 05:41:49.690
So what can we learn
from the pictures?

05:41:49.690 --> 05:41:54.130
One of the things is objective
information like groove width.

05:41:54.130 --> 05:41:56.760
So this is a series of
four different types

05:41:56.760 --> 05:41:59.620
of disc recordings organized

05:41:59.620 --> 05:42:01.320
in descending order
by their groove width.

05:42:01.320 --> 05:42:05.840 position:56%
The top is a voice-o-graph disc, and
the bottom is a microgroove disc.

05:42:05.840 --> 05:42:09.910
So they range from 110
micrometers at the top

05:42:09.910 --> 05:42:12.150
to 50 micrometers at the bottom.

05:42:12.150 --> 05:42:15.210
We can also gain qualitative
information.

05:42:15.210 --> 05:42:18.680 position:56%
So when I see these I know what kind

05:42:18.680 --> 05:42:20.940
of audio we'll get
from the recording.

05:42:20.940 --> 05:42:24.360
On the left it's a commercially
produced wax recording,

05:42:24.360 --> 05:42:27.140
and on the right it's a
field recorded wax recording.

05:42:27.140 --> 05:42:31.880
And just based on the training
of the recordist, the conditions

05:42:31.880 --> 05:42:33.600
in the field where it was recorded,

05:42:33.600 --> 05:42:37.050
and the type of machine
it was recorded on,

05:42:37.050 --> 05:42:38.530
it change the audio quality we get.

05:42:38.530 --> 05:42:41.320
And when I see these images,
I kind of get an idea of what

05:42:41.320 --> 05:42:44.330
to expect from the audio.

05:42:44.330 --> 05:42:47.250
So like I said before, this is
a binned image of the grooves.

05:42:47.250 --> 05:42:51.390
So you can see where the
grooves go throughout the image.

05:42:51.390 --> 05:42:53.530
This is a commercial
shellac recording,

05:42:53.530 --> 05:42:56.350
so this is about as
consistent as it gets.

05:42:56.350 --> 05:42:58.530
The grooves are evenly spaced,

05:42:58.530 --> 05:43:01.300
and they all have groove
bottoms, I believe.

05:43:01.300 --> 05:43:05.650
This is the image that I used
in my other presentation.

05:43:05.650 --> 05:43:10.240
Sometimes they are not recorded
as well and the image --

05:43:10.240 --> 05:43:13.730
the grooves move throughout
the image.

05:43:13.730 --> 05:43:17.100
This is another example, this is
from a paper based lacquer disc

05:43:17.100 --> 05:43:19.540
and the groove spacing is terrible.

05:43:19.540 --> 05:43:22.450
It was planned well for the
excursion of the grooves.

05:43:22.450 --> 05:43:28.000
And I don't know what you would get
if you played this on a turntable.

05:43:28.000 --> 05:43:30.640
But if you look at it under IRENE
you know that you're not going

05:43:30.640 --> 05:43:34.830
to get something that you want.

05:43:34.830 --> 05:43:36.800
This is another kind of
poorly recorded disc.

05:43:36.800 --> 05:43:40.770
You can see the cutting lathe was
not set to record deeply enough,

05:43:40.770 --> 05:43:43.110 position:56%
so once a revolution actually lifted

05:43:43.110 --> 05:43:47.420
from the disc leaving a
section where it was undercut.

05:43:47.420 --> 05:43:50.220
This is something,
again, if you play it

05:43:50.220 --> 05:43:52.130
on a turntable you would
probably come to understand

05:43:52.130 --> 05:43:53.450
that something is wrong
with the disc.

05:43:53.450 --> 05:43:55.860
But we see very clearly
now what's going on.

05:43:55.860 --> 05:43:59.440
And, you know, beyond
assessment one thing we can do

05:43:59.440 --> 05:44:01.570
with IRENE is actually just
trace across these gaps

05:44:01.570 --> 05:44:04.850
and at least get all of the
information that is recorded.

05:44:04.850 --> 05:44:08.210
Obviously can't get
anything that wasn't.

05:44:08.210 --> 05:44:09.510
Here's another example.

05:44:09.510 --> 05:44:14.830 position:56%
I turned the image on its side, just
because I think it's interesting.

05:44:14.830 --> 05:44:20.290 position:56%
It was kind of undercut or maybe
the recording machine wasn't working

05:44:20.290 --> 05:44:24.660 position:56%
at its best that day, but the head
actually skipped across the surface.

05:44:24.660 --> 05:44:29.550
Each of these black lines is
a groove, and at some point

05:44:29.550 --> 05:44:36.750
in the recording process it skipped
across the surface like a stone.

05:44:38.370 --> 05:44:44.220
This is a cylinder that was
overcut, and this is another one

05:44:44.220 --> 05:44:47.270
of these we're comparing
with a mechanical transfer.

05:44:47.270 --> 05:44:51.310
We wouldn't have known exactly
why this happened playing it

05:44:51.310 --> 05:44:54.990
with a stylus, just that in two
sections it would get quiet.

05:44:54.990 --> 05:44:58.450
But looking at it under IRENE we
can see exactly why it got quiet is

05:44:58.450 --> 05:45:00.200
because it was overcutting

05:45:00.200 --> 05:45:04.890
and the stylus wouldn't
have read this fully.

05:45:06.000 --> 05:45:10.100
This is just a fun example,
can't really learn much from it,

05:45:10.100 --> 05:45:12.870
but it's interesting
to look at, I think.

05:45:12.870 --> 05:45:15.870
And another tin foil where
you can see kind of the nature

05:45:15.870 --> 05:45:18.170
of the impression on the foil.

05:45:19.500 --> 05:45:23.550
So my examples up until now have
been about what we can learn

05:45:23.550 --> 05:45:25.800
from the original recordings
as they were recorded,

05:45:25.800 --> 05:45:28.010
but we can also learn a
lot of interesting things

05:45:28.010 --> 05:45:31.650
about how recordings get
damaged or degrade over time.

05:45:31.650 --> 05:45:33.920
This is another paper
based lacquer disc.

05:45:33.920 --> 05:45:36.340
This is the first couple grooves,

05:45:36.340 --> 05:45:38.580
kind of a run in groove,
a lead in groove.

05:45:38.580 --> 05:45:44.990
And you can see that it's
just a mess, it's in tatters.

05:45:44.990 --> 05:45:47.390
It wasn't recorded well,
but you can also see,

05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:50.750
through subsequent playbacks,

05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:54.650
I guess high tracking
[inaudible] dragged across it

05:45:54.650 --> 05:45:56.180
and created extra grooves.

05:45:56.180 --> 05:45:57.820
I think this actually
was recorded twice.

05:45:57.820 --> 05:45:59.790
I think this is another
cutting head was put

05:45:59.790 --> 05:46:03.760
on the disc and cut in the track.

05:46:03.760 --> 05:46:08.430
As we progress through this we
see more new tracks, more wear.

05:46:08.430 --> 05:46:12.320
And as we progress we see
some kind of chattering

05:46:12.320 --> 05:46:16.640
up in the top, some inconsistency.

05:46:16.640 --> 05:46:20.830
If we zoom into that we can
see the disc was actually bent.

05:46:20.830 --> 05:46:22.810
The paper is more flexible
than the lacquer,

05:46:22.810 --> 05:46:26.360 position:56%
and so when you bend the paper based
lacquer disc the surface lacquer

05:46:26.360 --> 05:46:31.220
crazes and leave us with something
we couldn't get a whole lot

05:46:31.220 --> 05:46:33.230
of audio from.

05:46:33.230 --> 05:46:36.160
Here's another example
of a crazing disc.

05:46:36.160 --> 05:46:39.240
You can see the actual
grooves in this image.

05:46:39.240 --> 05:46:41.980
Don't look like the grooves
in most of IRENE images,

05:46:41.980 --> 05:46:45.460
and that's because it's
actually a white disc,

05:46:45.460 --> 05:46:46.800
that leaves us with less contrast.

05:46:46.800 --> 05:46:50.450
And that's another challenge for us
is figuring out how to image these

05:46:50.450 --> 05:46:54.550
and get the same contrast that
will allow us to get good audio.

05:46:54.550 --> 05:46:58.580
So continuing on in the
damage and degradation,

05:46:58.580 --> 05:47:01.120
this is a disc that delaminating.

05:47:01.120 --> 05:47:04.130
And you can see it's a lacquer
disc that was delaminating.

05:47:04.130 --> 05:47:08.050 position:56%
I think you all understand what that
means, but the surface material,

05:47:08.050 --> 05:47:10.800
the lacquer, and the bases
don't always stick together well

05:47:10.800 --> 05:47:16.000
over time, and the pieces kind
of can separate from the surface

05:47:16.000 --> 05:47:17.720
and separate from each other.

05:47:17.720 --> 05:47:22.320
And zooming into this, you
can see that the places

05:47:22.320 --> 05:47:26.050
where it began delaminating the
lacquer was actually pulling apart

05:47:26.050 --> 05:47:28.940
and it separated at the thinnest
part, which is the groove bottom.

05:47:28.940 --> 05:47:30.500
I think that's interesting.

05:47:30.500 --> 05:47:36.300
So we can learn something about the
nature of the delamination process.

05:47:36.300 --> 05:47:40.390 position:56%
Here's another image of a flake of a
lacquer disc that was delaminating.

05:47:40.390 --> 05:47:42.280
There's a bit of an illusion here,

05:47:42.280 --> 05:47:45.800
as the camera loses
focus below this line,

05:47:45.800 --> 05:47:51.420 position:56%
but you can see this piece was
flaking up and didn't keep in focus.

05:47:51.420 --> 05:47:54.790
And you can see the light shines
through the translucent lacquer.

05:47:56.170 --> 05:47:59.250
Here's another condition I think
a lot of you are familiar with.

05:47:59.250 --> 05:48:02.760
This disc was exuding
plasticizer, and looking at it

05:48:02.760 --> 05:48:04.090
under the magnification or IRENE,

05:48:04.090 --> 05:48:06.080
we can actually see the
crystalline structure

05:48:06.080 --> 05:48:08.360
of the fatty acids that came out.

05:48:08.360 --> 05:48:10.870
And it's interesting to me to see

05:48:10.870 --> 05:48:15.050
that the same structure is
present beneath the groove bottom,

05:48:15.050 --> 05:48:18.130
so that's throughout the disc.

05:48:18.130 --> 05:48:21.890
Here's a broken glass based
lacquer disc where you can see --

05:48:21.890 --> 05:48:27.310
so the disc broke, but also chipped
away at the interface of the break.

05:48:27.310 --> 05:48:30.150
And you can see the
sheer of the glass chip.

05:48:30.150 --> 05:48:33.670
And also if you look closely you
can see the texture of the glass,

05:48:33.670 --> 05:48:35.970
the bubbles in the glass.

05:48:37.410 --> 05:48:40.450
Here's a frayed paper
based lacquer disc.

05:48:40.450 --> 05:48:43.130
This is a voice-o-graph
disc, it was a voice letter

05:48:43.130 --> 05:48:46.330
from the Second World War that
had been played too many times,

05:48:46.330 --> 05:48:50.930
and wore away the lacquer
in this area.

05:48:50.930 --> 05:48:53.280
And you can see the
paper base beneath it,

05:48:53.280 --> 05:48:56.900
but you can also see the
lacquer was kind of pulling away

05:48:56.900 --> 05:48:59.620
and the thickest part in
the groove tops remained.

05:48:59.620 --> 05:49:04.590
You can kind of see this when you
look at the disc at eye level,

05:49:04.590 --> 05:49:09.950 position:56%
but this gives us a lot more
information about how this happened.

05:49:09.950 --> 05:49:12.090
Here's a disc that was
covered in adhesive residue

05:49:12.090 --> 05:49:17.930
and left glue covering the groove
bottoms and the groove tops.

05:49:17.930 --> 05:49:19.810
Just we couldn't see
through this at all.

05:49:19.810 --> 05:49:23.450
And a similar one where a disc had
been written in with wax crayon

05:49:23.450 --> 05:49:27.820
and it filled the grooves but
left the groove tops alone.

05:49:29.300 --> 05:49:31.980
And here is a disc that was damaged

05:49:31.980 --> 05:49:33.730
with some kind of mysterious
pitting.

05:49:33.730 --> 05:49:37.780
I don't really know what caused
this, but the disc was very noisy.

05:49:37.780 --> 05:49:42.550
I think you can actually see
the disc is splitting again

05:49:42.550 --> 05:49:44.900
down the middle of
this groove as well.

05:49:46.680 --> 05:49:48.570
Groove-top wear, this
is what it looks

05:49:48.570 --> 05:49:51.620
like when we play a
disc and it's noisy.

05:49:51.620 --> 05:49:54.910
And so I'll go through a couple
similar examples for cylinders.

05:49:54.910 --> 05:49:58.710
This is what we expect to see
from a clean commercial cylinder.

05:49:58.710 --> 05:50:02.400
They're vertically
recorded, as you all know,

05:50:02.400 --> 05:50:05.830
so the grooves don't go side to
side as in a [inaudible] recording,

05:50:05.830 --> 05:50:09.770
but up and down and that's
why you see the pits in here.

05:50:09.770 --> 05:50:13.040
This is what mold damage
looks like under IRENE.

05:50:13.040 --> 05:50:16.370
You see the audio grooves on
the left side of the recording,

05:50:16.370 --> 05:50:19.470
on the left side of the image, and
the mold damage on the right side.

05:50:19.470 --> 05:50:22.330
One thing I think is interesting
about this is that the mold seems

05:50:22.330 --> 05:50:26.990
to have taken up residence in
the pits created by the audio.

05:50:30.070 --> 05:50:33.290
This is -- you can see
impressions made by the fibers

05:50:33.290 --> 05:50:36.740
of original wax cylinder
recording container,

05:50:36.740 --> 05:50:39.320
and this is actually
useful information for us.

05:50:39.320 --> 05:50:42.600
It tells us that you don't really
want to store wax cylinders

05:50:42.600 --> 05:50:45.060
in the original cut
and line containers

05:50:45.060 --> 05:50:50.660 position:56%
because they can leave marks in your
disc that will be audible later.

05:50:50.660 --> 05:50:52.810
Similarly this is a
brown wax cylinder

05:50:52.810 --> 05:50:57.020
that was beginning to
effloresce or bloom.

05:50:57.020 --> 05:51:01.930
This is kind of -- I don't think
there's a lot of research on this,

05:51:01.930 --> 05:51:05.890
but this at least shows
me that this is not mold,

05:51:05.890 --> 05:51:10.850
it's actually a different
failure mode.

05:51:10.850 --> 05:51:12.710
Here's a talk doll
cylinder recording,

05:51:12.710 --> 05:51:14.520
as Carl mentioned earlier.

05:51:14.520 --> 05:51:16.600
This is what they look
like kind of typically.

05:51:16.600 --> 05:51:19.330
And then you can see one
that had been played more.

05:51:19.330 --> 05:51:23.930
I don't know if the first has been
played never and the second once,

05:51:23.930 --> 05:51:28.530
or the first only a few times,
and the second many times,

05:51:28.530 --> 05:51:32.050
but you can see the wear in the
middle, it's these black lines

05:51:32.050 --> 05:51:35.850
that have been played by a stylus.

05:51:35.850 --> 05:51:40.580
So finally we can use the
images and also images produced

05:51:40.580 --> 05:51:44.890
by the analysis software
to assess our performance.

05:51:44.890 --> 05:51:48.260
The reason I have this image
here is because this motor,

05:51:48.260 --> 05:51:53.710
if it's off in alignment by
fractions of a degree vertically

05:51:53.710 --> 05:51:56.780
or in the [inaudible] into
and out of this image,

05:51:56.780 --> 05:51:58.300
we can lose focus throughout
the image.

05:51:58.300 --> 05:52:01.510 position:56%
And one of the ways we can calibrate
that so that doesn't happen is

05:52:01.510 --> 05:52:06.180
by using the depth information
gathered by the 3D probe,

05:52:06.180 --> 05:52:08.670
and the same information
in another plane gathered

05:52:08.670 --> 05:52:11.920
by the [inaudible] laser.

05:52:11.920 --> 05:52:15.570
So in order to prevent
artifacts in our sound

05:52:15.570 --> 05:52:18.430
and 3D we want our images
to align very precisely.

05:52:18.430 --> 05:52:22.570
It's sounds like it would just be
360 degrees around and the width

05:52:22.570 --> 05:52:26.740
of the sensor in a
step, but that leaves us

05:52:26.740 --> 05:52:31.150
with small duplication in the data.

05:52:31.150 --> 05:52:36.950
So what we do is guess and
check until there's no overlap,

05:52:36.950 --> 05:52:40.870
but the features of the
recording are visible smoothly

05:52:40.870 --> 05:52:44.730
across the lines at the end of a
pass, as you see on the left side,

05:52:44.730 --> 05:52:47.570
in between passes as you
see on the right side.

05:52:48.720 --> 05:52:51.970
So this is what we want
to see from tracking.

05:52:51.970 --> 05:52:53.590
When I began working
with IRENE in fall

05:52:53.590 --> 05:52:58.280
of 2013 we couldn't leave the
software to analyze on its own

05:52:58.280 --> 05:53:00.660
because we didn't have any
indication whether tracking

05:53:00.660 --> 05:53:02.070
went successful.

05:53:02.070 --> 05:53:05.910
So we asked them to
add tracking images

05:53:05.910 --> 05:53:10.280
so we could leave the
software to analyze overnight

05:53:10.280 --> 05:53:11.580
and review tracking in the morning,

05:53:11.580 --> 05:53:13.010
which means I can do
other things instead

05:53:13.010 --> 05:53:15.880
of watching the software analyze.

05:53:15.880 --> 05:53:18.000
This is what we have at risk

05:53:18.000 --> 05:53:20.600
if we don't know whether
the tracking was successful.

05:53:20.600 --> 05:53:25.820
But if I see this, looking
at tracking images in review,

05:53:25.820 --> 05:53:30.840
I can go back and redo this and
it won't give us faulty audio.

05:53:30.840 --> 05:53:34.300
We can also see how
blob clean is doing.

05:53:34.300 --> 05:53:37.170
I don't know if anybody has
described blob clean at this point.

05:53:37.170 --> 05:53:42.580
But it's a way of cleaning
up the sound only

05:53:42.580 --> 05:53:52.000 position:56%
because the software can tell, based
on the shape of the pits in 3D,

05:53:52.000 --> 05:53:56.760
and the depth, what's
mold and what's audio.

05:53:56.760 --> 05:54:03.410
If we are too aggressive with this
algorithm, it can remove audio.

05:54:03.410 --> 05:54:07.740
But we can review the images
while we're analyzing and see

05:54:07.740 --> 05:54:12.470 position:56%
that this one actually did a pretty
good job figuring out what was blobs

05:54:12.470 --> 05:54:14.810
or mold spots and what was audio.

05:54:14.810 --> 05:54:16.450
And so we know we're
using the right settings

05:54:16.450 --> 05:54:19.720
for the blob clean algorithm.

05:54:19.720 --> 05:54:22.240
So this is a dirty licensee disc.

05:54:22.240 --> 05:54:27.270
Not really exuding
plasticizer, mostly just dirty,

05:54:27.270 --> 05:54:30.920
but we can't really get
great audio from this.

05:54:30.920 --> 05:54:34.180
So when I began working
with IRENE we looked

05:54:34.180 --> 05:54:36.750 position:56%
into ways we could improve our data.

05:54:36.750 --> 05:54:38.840
Fortunately somebody from
Preservation Research

05:54:38.840 --> 05:54:41.230
and Testing here was
already working on this

05:54:41.230 --> 05:54:44.250
and we adopted a cleaning
method from his process,

05:54:44.250 --> 05:54:47.250
and ended up being
really successful with it.

05:54:47.250 --> 05:54:50.000
This is the same image --
or the same disc, rather.

05:54:50.000 --> 05:54:52.030
You can see the features here.

05:54:52.030 --> 05:54:56.080
The only difference is
before and after cleaning.

05:54:56.080 --> 05:54:59.540
So this tells us that our
cleaning is doing well.

05:54:59.540 --> 05:55:01.510
If you want to know more
about our cleaning process,

05:55:01.510 --> 05:55:03.060
I've got a URL here
but you can just go

05:55:03.060 --> 05:55:06.170
to our website and
it's easier to find.

05:55:06.170 --> 05:55:11.240
And finally, like I said earlier,
we have added side lighting

05:55:11.240 --> 05:55:15.330
to our process for discs
without a good groove bottom.

05:55:15.330 --> 05:55:18.540
When we originally invented this --

05:55:18.540 --> 05:55:23.160
or designed this rig to
hold the light in its place

05:55:23.160 --> 05:55:27.520 position:56%
to illuminate the side of the groove
wall, we had overloaded the motor

05:55:27.520 --> 05:55:30.420
and it left us with an
image that was out of focus

05:55:30.420 --> 05:55:31.720 position:56%
when the camera had to move quickly.

05:55:31.720 --> 05:55:36.660 position:56%
We figured out that we could get rid
of some other weight in the system

05:55:36.660 --> 05:55:41.870
and found immediately that
that helped our focus problems.

05:55:41.870 --> 05:55:48.470
And I think finally, we can see
in our data before we analyze it

05:55:48.470 --> 05:55:52.880 position:56%
if there are bugs in the system, and
don't waste time analyzing the data.

05:55:52.880 --> 05:55:57.440
So when I see these glitches on the
right side, and the detailed view,

05:55:57.440 --> 05:56:01.470
I know that I have to fix something
before I try to keep analyzing.

05:56:01.470 --> 05:56:02.770
So thank you.

05:56:02.770 --> 05:56:04.200
If you have any questions,
I'll be here.

05:56:04.200 --> 05:56:09.510
And I'll be here.

05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:25.040
[ Applause ]

05:56:25.040 --> 05:56:31.730
&gt;&gt; I'm curious as to
[inaudible] with recorded discs,

05:56:31.730 --> 05:56:36.070
about percentage request
3D analysis?

05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:37.500
Do you have enough data on that?

05:56:37.500 --> 05:56:41.720
&gt;&gt; Bill Veillette: Well, the
clients don't -- can you hear me?

05:56:41.720 --> 05:56:43.020
It's on? Yeah.

05:56:43.020 --> 05:56:49.020
The clients don't actually
request 2D or 3D.

05:56:49.020 --> 05:56:54.640
We use the approach that's
the best for that carrier.

05:56:54.640 --> 05:57:01.740
So -- but we've had only one client
that we're proposing to use 3D

05:57:01.740 --> 05:57:05.720
on for their discs, but it's
a vertically cut disc, too.

05:57:05.720 --> 05:57:07.850
So have --

05:57:07.850 --> 05:57:10.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mason Vander Lugt: We do it
sometimes with paper based lacquers,

05:57:10.380 --> 05:57:13.210
and we did it once with an
aluminum transcription disc.

05:57:13.210 --> 05:57:16.060
But yeah, as Bill said,
we don't let people choose

05:57:16.060 --> 05:57:19.680
which process they're going to use,
we just use whatever makes sense.

05:57:19.680 --> 05:57:21.530
&gt;&gt; Well, my question really went

05:57:21.530 --> 05:57:26.470 position:56%
to how many people want all the
information that's in a 3D analysis?

05:57:26.470 --> 05:57:30.260
Because this morning I
inferred that if you really want

05:57:30.260 --> 05:57:33.340
to preserve a document, you want
to preserve all the data you can,

05:57:33.340 --> 05:57:35.750 position:56%
and that made 3D analysis desirable.

05:57:35.750 --> 05:57:38.600
But we're talking so your
clients are not cognizant of that.

05:57:38.600 --> 05:57:39.900
&gt;&gt; Bill Veillette: Right.

05:57:39.900 --> 05:57:42.190
Well, there are image
files for 2D and 3D.

05:57:42.190 --> 05:57:45.820
And the 2D image files
are also very interesting

05:57:45.820 --> 05:57:49.170
to look at, as we just saw.

05:57:49.170 --> 05:57:52.140
We have two different kind
of templates for clients.

05:57:52.140 --> 05:57:55.810
We have one for institutions
and one for private clients.

05:57:55.810 --> 05:57:59.170
We've had actually quite a large
number of private clients initially

05:57:59.170 --> 05:58:04.440
because there was more
publicity through popular media.

05:58:04.440 --> 05:58:07.050
But now the mix is shifting
toward institutional.

05:58:07.050 --> 05:58:11.030
With the instructional
clients, we, as a default,

05:58:11.030 --> 05:58:16.480
give them the image
files, and charge them

05:58:16.480 --> 05:58:21.400 position:56%
for the external hard drive, you
know, that can hold all those files.

05:58:21.400 --> 05:58:24.740
With the private clients we don't,
as a default, but we let them know

05:58:24.740 --> 05:58:27.900
that we're not giving the image
files, but if they want them,

05:58:27.900 --> 05:58:30.620
we could add that to the proposal.

05:58:30.620 --> 05:58:34.370
Most private clients don't
care about the image files,

05:58:34.370 --> 05:58:36.450
they just want the audio.

05:58:36.450 --> 05:58:43.360
But we also have language in our
proposal that tells the institution

05:58:43.360 --> 05:58:50.250 position:56%
to treat those image files as the
master file, and to take care of it.

05:58:50.250 --> 05:58:52.960
We also let them know that there
is no software that they can use

05:58:52.960 --> 05:58:56.810
to do anything with it, but that
we will make our best efforts

05:58:56.810 --> 05:58:58.490
to maintain our software.

05:58:58.490 --> 05:59:03.840 position:56%
And that the ultimate goal is to do
what Carl was talking about earlier,

05:59:03.840 --> 05:59:07.130
to have somebody, perhaps
the Library of Congress,

05:59:07.130 --> 05:59:09.550
maintain an [inaudible]
version of it.

05:59:22.230 --> 05:59:24.730
&gt;&gt; I'm Jim Nye [assumed spelling]
from the University of Chicago,

05:59:24.730 --> 05:59:26.430
and it was wonderful to hear

05:59:26.430 --> 05:59:31.180
that at NEH international
engagements are taking an important

05:59:31.180 --> 05:59:33.610
place in your planning.

05:59:33.610 --> 05:59:35.890
I'd like to press that
a little bit further,

05:59:35.890 --> 05:59:39.230
particularly because I
think arguably the linkages

05:59:39.230 --> 05:59:41.930
that NEH has had with [inaudible]

05:59:41.930 --> 05:59:44.630
over the years have been
enormously productive,

05:59:44.630 --> 05:59:47.330
and also have extended the
funds that are available

05:59:47.330 --> 05:59:50.490
in limited quantity from Congress.

05:59:50.490 --> 05:59:53.410
My question is about
what might be involved

05:59:53.410 --> 05:59:57.870
to initiate new relationships
with counterpart bodies,

05:59:57.870 --> 06:00:00.490
let's say in the developing world?

06:00:00.490 --> 06:00:02.440
And I work in South Asia,

06:00:02.440 --> 06:00:07.130
so I'm thinking specifically
what would be involved in setting

06:00:07.130 --> 06:00:13.130
up a relationship like the
DFG/NEH, but with India?

06:00:13.130 --> 06:00:14.430
&gt;&gt; Joshua Sternfeld: Yeah,
that's a good question.

06:00:14.430 --> 06:00:18.700
I mean, it's a long and
tenuous process to a kind

06:00:18.700 --> 06:00:22.050
of longer term relationship
like the one you're describing.

06:00:22.050 --> 06:00:26.270
I don't know the history of the
DFG program and how long it took.

06:00:26.270 --> 06:00:30.220
I do know that we are
undergoing some talks,

06:00:30.220 --> 06:00:35.950
we're having a Transatlantic,
it's not a conference,

06:00:35.950 --> 06:00:42.950
a coordination amongst I
believe 12 funding bodies

06:00:42.950 --> 06:00:48.150
from both I think South
American and Europe as well,

06:00:48.150 --> 06:00:50.210
it's where you get the
Transatlantic moniker.

06:00:50.210 --> 06:00:53.630
And so I don't -- I think
that's in the early stages.

06:00:53.630 --> 06:00:56.770
I do know that our
director of the Office

06:00:56.770 --> 06:01:01.660
of Digital Humanities actually
went to Korea recently to sort

06:01:01.660 --> 06:01:08.580
of probe possibilities of
creating some Asian connections.

06:01:08.580 --> 06:01:11.890
I don't think I can speak
much further than that,

06:01:11.890 --> 06:01:15.340
it's all sort of -- you
know, we're just sort

06:01:15.340 --> 06:01:17.740
of probing possibilities
at this point.

06:01:17.740 --> 06:01:22.400
The program that is perhaps
the most international

06:01:22.400 --> 06:01:26.200
in its structure is the
Digging into Data program,

06:01:26.200 --> 06:01:30.450
which has had two funding
cycles so far.

06:01:30.450 --> 06:01:33.450 position:56%
That's a coordination of, I believe,

06:01:33.450 --> 06:01:37.030
eight funding institutions,
some U.S. based.

06:01:37.030 --> 06:01:44.360
NEH, [inaudible] NSF, some
of our Canadian counterparts,

06:01:44.360 --> 06:01:46.910
some of our UK counterparts,
and so forth.

06:01:46.910 --> 06:01:51.890
And, you know, I know for example
Carl, I guess he walked out,

06:01:51.890 --> 06:01:55.680
but he was proposing, for
example, a kind of pilot study

06:01:55.680 --> 06:01:58.890
of the possibilities in a kind
of digital humanities sense

06:01:58.890 --> 06:02:02.540
of what we can do with these
datasets, these large datasets.

06:02:02.540 --> 06:02:08.140
That Digging into Data program
is I think a perfect vehicle

06:02:08.140 --> 06:02:11.730
to encourage collaborations --

06:02:11.730 --> 06:02:16.300
international collaborations
to take these datasets

06:02:16.300 --> 06:02:19.390
and to derive new ways

06:02:19.390 --> 06:02:23.600
of understanding them
and analyzing them.

06:02:23.600 --> 06:02:27.530
&gt;&gt; Joshua Johnston: Well, and
also, if I could just add, I think,

06:02:27.530 --> 06:02:31.600
the implication of the
question is that all

06:02:31.600 --> 06:02:35.910
of these examples aren't reaching
some areas of the world, I think.

06:02:35.910 --> 06:02:42.630
And typically those are initiated
with particular people, you know,

06:02:42.630 --> 06:02:45.960
and so if those agencies in
those areas are interested,

06:02:45.960 --> 06:02:49.180
there are probably people
that they can contact at NEH

06:02:49.180 --> 06:02:51.480
if you want to talk further.

06:03:01.030 --> 06:03:03.050
