Washington State Illinois Chicago and I

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690
Washington State Illinois Chicago and I
 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.509
Washington State Illinois Chicago and I
think that it's a number of things where

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519
think that it's a number of things where
 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.400
think that it's a number of things where
it is going to be that you know sort of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
it is going to be that you know sort of
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.770
it is going to be that you know sort of
hard core knowledge economy base but

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
hard core knowledge economy base but
 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.610
hard core knowledge economy base but
also when you talk to people in these

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
also when you talk to people in these
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.220
also when you talk to people in these
worlds they really are thinking about

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
worlds they really are thinking about
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.380
worlds they really are thinking about
sustainability they really are talking

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
sustainability they really are talking
 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.240
sustainability they really are talking
about the do-it-yourself notions the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250
about the do-it-yourself notions the
 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.490
about the do-it-yourself notions the
idea that you really do have to do it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
idea that you really do have to do it
 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.110
idea that you really do have to do it
yourself because you can't have faith

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
yourself because you can't have faith
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.850
yourself because you can't have faith
that it's going to be done for you and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
that it's going to be done for you and
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.490
that it's going to be done for you and
that's where again it's not at the level

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
that's where again it's not at the level
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.160
that's where again it's not at the level
of being an atom it's that you realize I

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
of being an atom it's that you realize I
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.370
of being an atom it's that you realize I
must join with in a group because that's

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380
must join with in a group because that's
 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.220
must join with in a group because that's
the only way that one will survive and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
the only way that one will survive and
 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.039
the only way that one will survive and
do well and so I do think it is going to

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049
do well and so I do think it is going to
 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.360
do well and so I do think it is going to
be that clustering and then when you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
be that clustering and then when you
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.699
be that clustering and then when you
think about the just the resources of

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709
think about the just the resources of
 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.990
think about the just the resources of
what it takes to live in the suburbs

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
what it takes to live in the suburbs
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.270
what it takes to live in the suburbs
it's just it's just very difficult

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280
it's just it's just very difficult
 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.129
it's just it's just very difficult
that's not to say like all suburbs are

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139
that's not to say like all suburbs are
 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.569
that's not to say like all suburbs are
going to like shrivel up and die but I

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579
going to like shrivel up and die but I
 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.940
going to like shrivel up and die but I
just think it's less and less

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950
just think it's less and less
 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.720
just think it's less and less
sustainable and its alienating
