00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.260
Let's see if we can name this
molecule using the-- sometimes

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.740
called the R-S system, or the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.830
And the first thing to do is
just to see if there are any

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.830
chiral centers in
this molecule.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.960
If there aren't, then
we don't even have

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.379
to use the R-S system.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.960
We can just use our standard
nomenclature

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.440
rules and we'd be done.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.760
So if we look here, this carbon
is attached to three

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.230
hydrogens, so it's definitely
not attached to

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.490
four different groups.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.180
Same thing about this
carbon right here.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.950
This carbon right here is
attached to a fluorine, but

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.130
then it's attached to
two methyl groups.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.030
So it's the same group, so
this is also not a chiral

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.480
carbon or an asymmetric
carbon.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.710
This carbon right here is
attached to a hydrogen and

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.740
three other carbons, but each
of these three carbons look

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.700
like different groups.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.340
This carbon is attached to two
methyls and a fluorine.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.820
This carbon is attached to two
hydrogens and a bromine.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.570
This carbon is just
a methyl group.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.110
So this right here does look
like a chiral center.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.880
It does look like a
chiral carbon, and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.250
the other ones don't.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.380
This is just a methyl group.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.200
It has three hydrogens, so
definitely not attached to

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.620
four different groups.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.680
And this is attached to two
hydrogens, and those are

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.960
obviously the same group,
so this is also

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.890
not a chiral center.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
So we have one chiral
center, so the R-S

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.470
naming system will apply.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.110
But a good starting point will
just be naming it using our

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.550
standard nomenclature rules.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.360
And to do that we look for the
longest carbon chain here.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.970
Let's see, if we start over
here, and I don't know what

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.440
direction I'm going to name it
from yet, but I just want to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.780
identify the longest chain.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.280
If we went from here, we
have one, two, three.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.090
We can either go to four or to
four there, so we definitely

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.950
have four carbons, Four
carbon, longest chain.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.410
So that tells us that we will
be using the prefix but-, or

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.290
it will be a butane, because
they're all single bonds here,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.830
so it is a butane.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.250
But to decide whether we branch
off, it doesn't matter

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.930
whether we use this
CH3 or this CH3,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.100
they're the same group.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.750
But to decide whether we use
this part of the longest chain

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.820
or we use that, we think about
the rule that the core chain

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.930
to use should have as many
simple groups attached to it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.590
as possible, as opposed to
as few complex groups.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.550
So if we used this carbon as
part of our longest chain,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.590
then this will be a group that's
attached to it, which

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.670
would be a bromomethyl group,
which is not as simple as

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.500
maybe it could be.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.210
But if we use this carbon in our
longest chain, we'll have

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.830
two groups.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.110
We'll have a bromo attached,
and we'll also

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.180
have a methyl group.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.090
And that's what we want.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.630
We want more simple groups
attached to the longest chain.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.900
So what we're going to do is
we're going to use this

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.400
carbon, this carbon, this
carbon, and that carbon as our

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.350
longest chain.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.980
And we want to start from the
end that is closest to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.930
something being attached
to it, and that

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.980
bromine is right there.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.320
So there's going to be our
number one carbon, our number

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.570
two carbon, our number
three carbon, and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.120
our number four carbon.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.930
And then we can label the
different groups and then

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.630
figure out what order they
should be listed in.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.620
So this is a 1-bromo and
then this will be a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.950
2-methyl right here.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.840
And then just a hydrogen.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.680
Then three we have a fluoro, so
on a carbon three, we have

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.450
a fluoro, and then on carbon
three, we also have a methyl

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.340
group right here, so we
also have a 3-methyl.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.720
So when we name it, we put
in alphabetical order.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.435
Bromo comes first, so this thing
right here is 1-bromo.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.380
Then alphabetically, fluoro
comes next, 1-bromo-3-fluoro.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.140
We have two methyls, so it's
going to be 2 comma

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.390
3-dimethyl.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.690
And remember, the D doesn't
count in alphabetical order.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:11.330
Dimethylbutane, because
we have the longest

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.970
chain is four carbons.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.570
Dimethylbutane.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.680
So that's just the standard
nomenclature rules.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.610
We still haven't used
the R-S system.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.790
Now we can do that.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.959
Now to think about that, we
already said that this is our

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.570
chiral center, so we just have
to essentially rank the groups

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.380
attached to it in order of
atomic number and then use the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.210
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules,
and we'll do all

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.040
that in this example.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.770
So let's look at the different
groups attached to it.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.710
So when you look at it,
this guy has three

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.350
carbons and a hydrogen.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.010
Carbon is definitely higher
in atomic number on

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.900
the Periodic Table.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.580
It has an atomic number 6.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.160
Hydrogen is 1.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.680
You probably know
that already.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.150
So hydrogen is definitely
going to be number four.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.940
So let me put number four there
next to the hydrogen.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.560
And let me find a nice color.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.710
I'll do it in white.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.640
So hydrogen is definitely
the number four group.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.830
We have to differentiate between
this carbon group,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.870
that carbon group, and
that carbon group.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.690
And the way you do it, if
there's a tie on the three

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.940
carbons, you then look at what
is attached to those carbons,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.280
and you compare the highest
thing attached to each of

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.330
those carbons to the highest
things attached to the other

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.760
carbons, and then you
do the same ranking.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.940
And if that's a tie, then you
keep going on and on and on.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.140
So on this carbon right here,
we have a bromine.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.390
Bromine has an atomic
number of 35, which

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.410
is higher than carbon.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.940
So this guy has a bromine
attached to it.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.190
This guy only has hydrogen
attached to it.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.730
This guy has a fluorine
attached to it.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.160
That's the highest thing.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.180
So this is going to be the third
lowest, or I should say

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.800
the second to lowest, because it
only has hydrogens attached

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.480
to it, so that is
number three.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.430
The one has the bromine attached
to it is going to be

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.020
number one, and the one that has
the fluorine attached to

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.270
it is number two.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.720
And just a reminder, we were
tied with the carbon, so we

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.100
have to look at the next highest
constituent, and even

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.990
if this had three fluorines
attached to it, the bromine

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.060
would still trump it.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.610
You compare the highest to the
highest. So now that we've

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.120
done that, let me redraw this
molecule so it's a little bit

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.545
easier to visualize.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:23.540
So I'll draw our chiral
carbon in the middle.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.440
And I'm just doing this for
visualization purposes.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.420
And right here we have
our number one group.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.010
I'll literally just call that
our number one group.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.190
So right there that is
our number one group.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.600
It's in the plane
of the screen.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.710
So I'll just call that
our number one group.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.500
Over here, also in the plane
of the screen, I have our

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.750
number two group.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.210
So let me do it like that.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:02.260
So then you have your number
two group, just like that.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.390
And then you have your number
three group behind the

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.375
molecule right now the
way it's drawn.

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:10.200
I'll do that in magenta.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.860
So then you have your
number three group.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.490
It's behind the molecule, so
I'll draw it like this.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.930
This is our number
three group.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.480
And then we have our number
four group, which is the

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.690
hydrogen pointing
out right now.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.620
And I'll just do that
in a yellow.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.910
We have our number four
group pointing out

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.260
in front right now.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:38.480
So that is number four,
just like that.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.860
Actually, let me draw it a
little bit clearer, so it

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.190
looks a little bit more like the
tripod structure that it's

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.790
supposed to be.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.970
So let me redraw the
number three group.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:51.380
The number three group should
look like-- so this is our

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.140
number three group.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.390
Let me draw it a little
bit more like this.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.080
The number three group
is behind us.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.140
And then finally, you have
your number four group in

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.630
yellow, which is just a
hydrogen that's coming

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.100
straight out.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.620
So that is coming straight out
of-- well, not straight out,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.240
but at an angle out
of the page.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.020
So that's our number four group,
I'll just label it

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:14.610
number four.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.480
It really is just a hydrogen,
so I really didn't have to

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.030
simplify it much there.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23.120
Now by the R-S system, or by the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.440
we want our number four group
to be the one furthest back.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.300
So we really want it where the
number three position is.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.909
And so the easiest way I can
think of doing that is you can

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.720
imagine this is a tripod that's
leaning upside down.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.140
Or another way to view it
is you can view it as an

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.490
umbrella, where this is the
handle of the umbrella and

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.880
that's the top of the
umbrella that would

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.300
block the rain, I guess.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.000
But the easiest way to get the
number four group that's

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.210
actually a hydrogen in the
number three position would be

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.070
to rotate it.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.580
You could imagine, rotate it
around the axis defined by the

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.300
number one group.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.670
So the number one group
is just going to

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.940
stay where it is.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.440
The number four is going
to rotate to the

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.670
number three group.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.630
Number three is going to rotate
around to the number

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.190
two group, and then the number
two group is going to rotate

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.340
to where the number four
group is right now.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.330
So if we were to redraw
that, let's

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.140
redraw our chiral carbon.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.220
So let me scroll over
a little bit.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.110
So we have our chiral carbon.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.430
I put the little asterisk there
to say that that's our

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.630
chiral carbon.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.295
The number four group
is now behind.

00:09:28.295 --> 00:09:29.590
I'll do it with the circles.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.300
It makes it look a little bit
more like atoms. So the number

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.840
four group is now behind where
the number three group used to

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.230
be, so number four
is now there.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.650
Number one hasn't changed.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.030
That's kind of the axis that
we rotated around.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.270
So the number one group
has not changed.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.140
Number one is still there.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.410
Number two is now where number
four used to be, so number two

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.920
is now jutting out
of the page.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.670
And then we have number three
is now where number two was.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.030
So number three is there.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.280
And now that we've put our
fourth group behind the

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.630
molecule, we literally just
figure out whether we have to

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.640
go clockwise or counterclockwise
to go from

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.080
one, two to three.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.310
And that's pretty
straightforward.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.530
To go from one to two to
three, we have to go

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.780
counterclockwise.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.520
Or another way to think of it,
we're going to the left,

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.800
counterclockwise.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.510
At least on the top of
the clock, we're

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.710
going to the left.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.390
And so, since we're going to
left, this is S or sinister.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.770
This is S, which stands
for sinister, which

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.610
is Latin for left.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.360
So we're done.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.370
We've named it using
the R-S system.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.870
This molecule is (S)--
sinister--

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.120
1-bromo-3-fluoro-2,3-di--
