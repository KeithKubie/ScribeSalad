00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.669
Apparently, no calories does NOT equal no
consequences, and artificial sweeteners, like

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.020
the kind you may find in diet drinks, may
be just as bad for you as sugar, with your

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.849
brain and your gut responding in surprising
ways to that delicious, synthetic sweetness.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.640
The FDA has approved six artificial sweeteners
as a low-calorie or no-calorie options to

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.180
help us curb things like obesity.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.019
So, they’re not sugar but studies have shown
that your body may still be reacting to them

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.019
negatively.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.390
How is it processing these seemingly magical
compounds?

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.939
The main theories come down to your brain
and your gut.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.770
Multiple studies have shown that sustained
artificial sweetener use can induce insulin

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.399
resistance, and this probably involves your
brain.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.610
It could be when your tongue tastes something
sweet, your brain is expecting the physical

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.530
presence of sugar, and tells your pancreas
to start producing insulin, which lets your

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.129
body absorb the sugar.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.739
Only when there’s no sugar to absorb, you
still have the insulin in your body.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.920
Repeating this process every time you drink
a diet soda leads to insulin build-up with

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.450
no place for it to go, and then, systemic
insulin resistance, the precursor to diabetes.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.090
Turns out, we can’t turn our brains off.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.329
It’s just trying to do its job, guys.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:09.110
Artificial sweeteners are anywhere between
200 to 20,000 times sweeter than table sugar,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.320
and aside from the insulin issue, we’re
still unsure how our taste receptors process

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.830
these substitutes.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.640
Science does suggest, however, that your brain
can distinguish between the two.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.420
It knows when you’re eating real sugar,
and even though it still releases insulin

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.560
in response to artificial sweeteners, they
light up a different neural reward pathway

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.710
than real sugar.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.700
So at the same time that we’re exposing
our taste receptors to extremely, intensely

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.890
sweet-tasting foods, These factors lead some
experts to say that we’re training our palate

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.490
to crave sweeter and sweeter things while
our brain still isn’t receiving ‘true’

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.900
sugar satisfaction, so we’re just exacerbating
a sugar craving, not treating it.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.220
But it’s not just our brains, it could be
our guts too.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.720
Because, microbes!!

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.580
Or at least a little bit.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.710
These faux sugars aren’t digestible, hence...no
calories.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.200
You literally just poop them out.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.100
But that means that those molecules just hang
out in your intestines, with certain microbes

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.110
that can digest them.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.340
Those microbes can then trigger a ‘glucose
response’ leading to, you guessed it, insulin

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.340
resistance.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.610
A changed gut microbiome in response to artificial
sweetener use could also produce hormonal

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.750
changes in your body, quite possibly a hormone
that influences your appetite...and not in

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.750
a good way.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.750
The researchers are careful to say, though,
that everyone’s microbiome is different,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.410
so the severity of these effects definitely
vary from person to person, and experts advocate

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.670
a personalized approach to nutritional and
medicinal recommendations in this st area.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.310
And on top of all this, those who regularly
use artificial sweeteners may start to find

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.260
healthy foods, even naturally sweet ones like
fruit, unpalatable because they’re so used

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.890
to a more intense taste.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.290
Faux-sugar may help some diet-cola lovers
justify consuming extra calories that they

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.320
wouldn’t otherwise, because they just drank
something with zero calories.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.850
And artificial sweeteners may prevent us from
associating a sweet taste with weight gain,

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.590
training our brain to think we can eat whatever
we want with no repercussions.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.510
This is only the beginning of the ways that
artificial sweeteners may actually be contributing

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.940
to the very epidemic they were supposed to
help fight: obesity, diabetes, and other weight-related

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.940
diseases.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.319
So, that’s kinda nuts.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.620
We’re trying to bypass our body’s natural
mechanisms so we can eat super sweet stuff

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.830
with nothing bad happening but it looks like
nature is not letting us get away with that.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.460
That information is a little tough to swallow,
but rest assured that we here at Seeker will

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.290
always keep your science craving satisfied,
so subscribe so you can always decide what

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.780
not to drink, and check out my other video
on how your gut controls you brain.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.430
Fun Fact: The first artificial sweetener was
discovered in a lab accident.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.900
The scientist spilled a food preservative
on his hand and forgot to wash his hands before

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.900
lunch.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.900
Spoiler: it was sweet I’m Maren.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.680
Thanks for watching!
