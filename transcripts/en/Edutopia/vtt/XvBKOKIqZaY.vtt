00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.760
- Because of professional development
at Kettle Moraine,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.740
teachers have the skills
and the tools that they need

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.020
to really meet the needs
of all of our students.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.840
Everyone is working towards

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.460
creating a culture of growth,

00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:23.519
and taking risks to interact and
engage with their class

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.436
as a whole.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:34.945
At Kettle Moraine, we have a
vision of continuous growth.

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:38.235
Whether that's students,
teachers, it's about

00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:40.245
how can we get there together.

00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:43.195
Visible learning is a strategy where staff

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:47.136
will actually get behind a camera and

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:49.923
have the opportunity to look at themselves

00:00:49.923 --> 00:00:52.715
and to watch and reflect on
their teaching practices.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.085
- It helps me see what
the learning looks like

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:56.940
in my classroom through a different lens.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.580
We did a few test filming sessions

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.060
and I saw students all over the
place, as far as engagement.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.160
And, so, for my goal I chose to try to increase

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:10.980
student engagement through
use of vocabulary words.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.800
More vocabulary, I've
defined as more engaged.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.560
When students walk into
the classroom, it is nice

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.200
to let them know, like hey, 
I'm going to be filming you today.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.336
They are all part of the
process and I share my goal

00:01:22.336 --> 00:01:23.675
with them as well.

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:26.622
I'm usually filming about thirty
minutes of discussion time;

00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:28.555
so I can see who's really interacting,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.480
if they're writing things
down, if they're drawing,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.700
if they're showing each
other different things.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.120
- [Woman] The swivel is set
up for an iPhone or an iPad.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.880
Sometimes, teachers choose to have the camera on students

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.235
and then, sometimes they will
put the camera on themselves.

00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:51.336
So that really just depends
on what their goal is.

00:01:51.336 --> 00:01:53.474
- We often fall into the habit
of making assumptions about

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:55.064
what's going on in the classroom.

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:59.560
And visible learning gives
us a chance to see our habits

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.640
and our patterns and recognize

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.200
maybe why they aren't effective all the time.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.460
Just having a little bit
of a shift in our practice

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.100
can lead to gains on the students' part.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.460
- It's really important
for a teacher to have

00:02:14.464 --> 00:02:17.485
the ability to reflect on
what they're seeing initially.

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:19.656
It just allows teachers
to get comfortable with

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:20.906
the experience.

00:02:23.553 --> 00:02:25.285
- I try to watch those films on

00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:27.064
the same day they've been recorded.

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:28.915
Just so they're fresh in my mind.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.833
What I do is I watch it through once

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.980
without really tracking anything.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.616
The second time through is
really when I start to track.

00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:40.325
I'm gonna stop the video
every minute and tally

00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:42.235
which students are authentically engaged

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.115
and which students are not.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.520
I'm writing down which vocabulary
words they're using

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.485
and what I was seeing on film

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:52.040
was a lot of non-engagement
with their peers.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.580
- After a teacher watches
their video, they meet with the coach

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:58.580
to talk through some of their ideas.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.418
To get another set of eyes
either on what they think

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.029
that they're seeing in the classroom

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.279
or some possible solutions.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.589
- In order to change the
students' interaction in class,

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.090
I needed to give a little bit
more direct instruction on

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.018
how to interact with your peers

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.820
and how to use science vocabulary words.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.980
- Individually, the teacher
is going to be the one that

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.980
determines what
that success looks like.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.660
- Visible learning gives us a chance

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.720
to reflect on our practice, to align

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.320
what we believe is happening 
in the classroom

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.140
to what really is happening.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.580
And also, it gives us a chance to adapt

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.300
to reach as many students as possible.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.400
- [Bearded Teacher] We are all trying to grow

00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:54.228
in our professional career
and it's all gonna help

00:03:54.228 --> 00:03:56.000
the students at the end of the day.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.750
And that's really the goal of
the whole teaching process.
