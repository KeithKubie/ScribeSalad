00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.530
&gt;&gt; BRAY: Okay. Let's talk. So welcome to the
second of the four talks in the Android session,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.169
Android track at Google Developer Day, Brazil.
My name is Tim Bray. I'm an Android advocate

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:25.279
in the Android group at Google. And you'll
be happy to hear that the next talk in the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.820
track is being given by somebody else. So,
today, we're going to talk about how to make

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.920
applications that will make users happy. Now,
how many of you are Android developers? Oh,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.470
more than the last session. Okay. Excellent.
Good. So, today, I'm here to be unfriendly.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.140
I'm going to lecture you and tell you to behave
better, okay? So I apologize in advance. Because,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.040
you know, one of the main criticisms--one
of the main criticisms that we get about Android

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.340
being compared to the competition and, you
know, I don't want to mention Apple's name,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:12.270
but--is that the Android apps are not as beautiful
as their apps and they're right. So fix that,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.950
okay? So here's the story that we want to
see. You know, we want to have a better UI.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.749
People are happier. We want people to perceive
quality. We want to get better ratings. You

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:29.740
want to get better rankings. You want to get
more installs. You want to get more money.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:38.569
Do you know where money comes from? Money
comes from quality. One thing we've learned

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.749
is that even if an app does something that's
incredibly useful and incredibly difficult,

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:53.700
if it's ugly or confusing or slow, people
will not use it. They just won't. Now, in

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.840
the world of enterprise software where your
boss says, "Write a program to do this" and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.840
then you write the program and he go and says,
"You must use his program," then they will

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.459
use his program. I'm sorry boys and girls;
it's not like that anymore. Software that

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.640
goes in somebody's pocket is very personal
statement. And you're talking to consumers;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.760
you have no way to force them to use the software.
You have to make them want to use the software.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.500
Of course, it's possible that some of you
may be writing Android applications for your

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.860
boss in big companies where users will be
required to use them, so you can leave now.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:39.490
No? Okay. So you have to take your app and
throw it out into the deep waters of the Android

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:48.290
market and it has to find love based on appeal.
And we see so much of this. You know, if somebody

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.100
launches an application and it crashes and
they give it one star and they uninstall it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.930
and they put a nasty comment on the Android
Market and they blog about it and they Tweet

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.210
about it. And I tell you, if you publish an
app that's not good, it's really, really hard

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.570
to recover, okay? On the other hand, five
star apps--we're starting to see some huge

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.290
success stories. In terms of business success,
people are starting to make some real money,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.310
people starting to do some wonderful thing
with Open Source. So the rest of the talk

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.770
today, I'm going to talk about our advice
for how you can avoid the left hand side and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.230
get on the right hand side of this picture.
But this requires some mental modeling. We

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.720
need to think before we start about in the
most general way, what makes people happy?

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.431
Well, when somebody goes and gets your app,
they have some expectations. They say, "Okay,

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:49.560
here's an app to play Dominos or to find restaurants
or to take my temperature or to measure a

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.360
running distance" or something like that.
So they will have an expectation in their

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.900
mind of what your app does. And also, even
though this is not fair, they will also have

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.710
an expectation in their mind of how difficult
it will be to use and, you know, how it should

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:14.190
work. And basically, the measurement of quality
in the user's mind is expectation versus reality.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.560
You know, if the expectation is low, it's
easy to have high quality. If the expectation

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.120
is high, it's very, very difficult. So, really,
the absolute measure of quality seems to be

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.180
the difference between the expectation and
the actual experience. So that's really the

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.790
right way to think about it. You have to try
terribly, terribly, terribly hard to figure

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.550
out what it is that users expect and need
and to do better than that. So how are you

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:51.790
going to do that? It's really hard to do that.
So very few people are smart enough to guess

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:58.250
accurately what it is that people want from
an application. So the Google solution for

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.770
this is the public beta, right? The idea is
get the code out in front of users as soon

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.770
as you possibly can and don't try and guess
what they want. Ask them what they want, show

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.190
them the software and, you know, if you want
to write software to, I don't know, to help

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.280
you train for a long distance run or something
like that, you know, you have your own ideas

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.990
but you can't guess what people are going
to want. You have to put it in their hands

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:33.680
and find out. Now, we actually think you should
be even braver than that and start to gather

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.050
the experience even before it seems reasonable.
Now, I have some advice. When you're doing

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.169
the public alpha, don't put it in the Android
Market, right? Because any alpha is going

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.240
to get some bad reviews and the bad reviews
don't go away. Now fortunately, unlike some

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.610
other operating systems, and I don't want
to mention Apple's name, they--you can't--you

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.169
don't have to get an app from the market.
You can get an Android app from a website,

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.360
you can send it in e-mail, you can, you know,
put it on a USB key, you can even present

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.840
that. So as soon as you have something that
works at all, you really need to give it to

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.710
a few of your friends and family and your
mom and your girlfriend and your boyfriend

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.120
and see what--see what they think of it because
you'll start to get some real honest user

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.850
reactions that will be incredibly valuable
to you. And then one of the other advantages

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.770
of Android Market is that the release process
is instant. So, most of the successful Android

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.699
Apps that I see have a habit of releasing
regularly. Once per month, sometimes even

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.960
once per week. For example, there are many,
many Twitter apps out there. The one that

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.300
I use is called Twidroid. I'm very fond of
it. And Twidroid releases several times a

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:49.669
month, absolutely regularly. And it just gets
better and better and better and better because

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.590
they listen to what people are saying and
they adopt the policy of continuous improvement.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.550
Now, somehow you have to find a way for people
to tell you what they think. You know, the

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.500
Android Market comments, there's too many
of them; they're hard to track. So there are--there

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.530
are many websites like, you know, Get Satisfaction
and we have one of our own. You can go to

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.110
places for people who can, you know, leave
a discussion forum and leave their comments

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:15.010
and give feedback. And you should definitely
do that. There's a problem with doing that

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.620
which is that when people give feedback of
what applications, unfortunately, they lie.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.260
You know, they say, "I tried this and it didn't
work." Well, actually, if you look at what

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.450
they really did that wasn't what they said
they did. Or they said, you know, "This didn't

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.760
work" or "That didn't work" or "That's fast"
or "That's slow" and it's very hard to replicate.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:38.350
So there's this thing you can do called Analytics--oops--Analytics
for Android. And it will give you reports

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.150
like this, showing you all the different activities
and services and screens in your--in your--in

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:48.169
your application and exactly how often they
were visited and what people did and what

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:53.050
path people took through the application.
And it's absolutely invaluable. If you're

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:59.020
serious about your application, this will
tell not what your users said they did but

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:06.729
exactly what your users really did. And it's
actually pretty easy to do this. So, you know,

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:11.440
one of the most common things is people report
a bug. Now, serious application has some settings

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.690
that people can change. And if you have more
than three settings, you have a, you know,

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.050
a very large number of possible combinations
and it's hard to figure out what could have

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.470
gone wrong. Well, with Analytics, you can
find out what settings were, you can find

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.940
out all about errors and exceptions and so
on. And if you look at the code, there's really

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:35.330
not much to it, okay? So maybe, you know,
one of the single most important things is

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.710
you got to pay attention to your users and
you got to measure your users. Another thing

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:45.030
is that bugs are unacceptable. You know, in
an enterprise--in an enterprise app where

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.460
you get people at desktops, if it crashes
sometimes "Nah" they just restart it. And

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.800
also, as we at Google know very well, in many
cases when you have a bug in a web application,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.770
the user never even notices. I mean, sometimes
you use to do a Google search and it doesn't

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.450
comeback and you say "Oh, stupid web" and
you refresh and there it is. Well, what happened

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:08.020
was there was a bug on the first search and
you never noticed. So you really got to--got

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.700
to fight bugs. And once again, one of the
nice things about the Android Market is that

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:18.040
when you find a bug, you can get it out to
all your users very, very, very, quickly.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:24.890
So for those of you who are not doing test-driven
development, please start doing test-driven

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.631
development. This is the idea that came out
of the Agile Software Movement that when you

00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:34.850
write a new routine, you should write the
tests first and then write the code until

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:41.440
it passes the tests and then stop. And test-driven
development does enable you to produce high

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.820
quality software. But even more important,
if you do test-driven development, it gives

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.880
you the courage to do big refactorings to--when
you see some part of your code that's running

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.770
badly, you can tear it apart and put it back
together. And as long as you have a good test

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.860
suite that keeps running, you have courage
and you know that you can--you can be brave

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.190
and rebuild your software as much as it needs.
So, test-driven development is really, really

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:09.430
important. Now, unfortunately on Android,
it's much more difficult to do test-driven

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.320
development than it is with web applications.
It requires a little bit of extra work, but

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.620
it's worth the work. If you're going to be
living with and maintaining your app into

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.890
the future, you really, really, really need
a good test suite so that you can sleep at

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:28.181
night. Most people know about this but some
don't. Inside the Android SDK there's a thing

00:10:28.181 --> 00:10:33.620
called the Monkey. That it's--it's called--it's
a testing monkey and what it does is it simulates

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.610
a bunch of random user interface actions,
touching the screen everywhere, swiping it,

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.481
pressing all the buttons, all the things that
a user can possibly do. And you should never,

00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:48.100
never release an app unless you have exposed
it to the monkey first. It is very, very effective

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.830
of finding stupid bugs that you would never
think of because you would never do those

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:59.589
things but lots of users will do those things.
You should--you should have a public bug tracker,

00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:05.959
a place you can register bugs. One of my favorite
Open Source software projects has a bug tracker

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:10.740
and you register bugs there. And whenever
they release a new release of the software,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.660
they send a personal email to everybody who
reported the bug saying, "Oh, by the way,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.300
in release 6.1.8, we fixed this bug that you
reported last April 14th." And, you know,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:25.870
that really--that's a really nice thing to
do. Okay. So you got to be super aggressive

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:34.300
about bugs. The next thing you have to worry
about is speed. If you--an application not

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.750
responding is a horrible, horrible thing you
should never allow to happen. People are incredibly

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.640
sensitive to the performance of mobile applications.
And we do have another--last talk in the Android

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.529
track this afternoon is about how to make
your app--Android applications responsive

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:54.339
and fast. It's super important. You just absolutely
have to worry about it. So I'm not going to

00:11:54.339 --> 00:12:01.029
talk too much more about that. Let's move
on. So assuming it doesn't crash and assuming

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:05.769
it does more or less what people want and
assuming it's reasonably fast, the next thing

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:13.940
you have to worry about is this very abstract
notion called usability. And it's incredibly

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:21.170
hard to define--to design ordinary things
in a way that they're usable. And this, by

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.490
the way, is a totally wonderful book. It's
been revised a few times. It's quite old,

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:31.240
but it's a--it's a wonderful book and it talks
about how to make things that are actually

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:39.470
usable in a day to day sense. You know, the
slogan is that in any piece of product, software

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:45.110
product included, "Easy things should be easy
and hard things should be possible." And for

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:50.450
the basic everyday operations on a mobile
phone which somebody is using with one hand

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:55.760
while they're holding on to the pole in the
bus going around corners being crowded by

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:01.700
strangers, the basic things that your application
does have to be one or two clicks. Anything

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:08.450
more is unacceptable. So this is the usability
stuff. There are all sorts of methodologies

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:14.250
and tools and so on for increasing usability,
but I think that unfortunately there is some

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:19.529
magic in here. You know, usability is one
of the things that separates great developers

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:26.959
from not so great developers. And it--it's
really about talent. And, you know, if there's

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:35.050
error that is possible, somebody will absolutely
make it because even--you know, I have this

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:39.779
very, very small simple Android app in the
market which is for transferring your phone

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:43.800
log from an old phone to a new phone; the
simplest thing imaginable. It's got over a

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.740
thousand downloads. I mean, it's crazy. The
Android market is getting so big, the Android

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:54.250
humidity is getting so big, it's very, very
easy to get 10,000 downloads. If you get 10,000

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.220
users, some of them will be crazy. They will
do all sorts of stupid things. They will make

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:04.690
errors that you can't possibly imagine, okay?
So what do you do about that? You--the right

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:13.550
answer is to try to make the errors impossible,
okay? Just set it up so it simply can't get

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:19.981
into a fix. Now, there are also some very
simple, straight forward techniques you can

00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:24.959
do to improve usability. And people are used
to seeing lists of things and they know how

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:29.459
to click on them. You know, they know what
the controls on a music player should look

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:33.300
like, they know what a back button should
look like, they know what a search icon should

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:38.480
look like, they know what a menu should look
like. Don't invent new stuff, okay? When there

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:44.930
are existing patterns, the people are well
trained to do, just use them, okay? Also,

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:50.399
please bear in mind that a lot of Android
phones are very small devices and a lot of

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:58.740
people like me have big, fat, clumsy fingers.
So please, no small buttons. Big buttons,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.851
big targets, things that are easy to hit.
Also, I don't know how old you are, but you're

00:15:03.851 --> 00:15:09.370
all going to be one year older in one year
and I guarantee that none of you have eyes

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:15.329
that are getting better. So--and, you know,
I'm over 50 and my eyes are not what they

00:15:15.329 --> 00:15:23.899
once were and, please, no teeny tiny texts.
You know, I have to wear reading glasses to

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:29.080
read anything that's small and I love Android
apps that have, you know, the important stuff

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.649
in big letters so that I don't have to put
on my reading glasses to see it; big fonts.

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:39.230
And finally, in usability, remember those
analytics that I was talking about? The analytics

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.990
are incredibly important for usability because
they show the patterns that are--people are

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:49.420
taking through your code. Now, in any application
is going to be subject to an 80-20 rule, which

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:55.089
means there's probably 20% of the application
where people spend 80% of their time. And

00:15:55.089 --> 00:16:00.300
in that 20%, you really have to work hard
so that everything is one or two clicks at

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:11.209
most. And here's another way to think about
it is if--to use your App, if people have

00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:17.320
to read a bunch of complex instructions you,
are doing it wrong, okay? It's worse than

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:27.460
that. Okay. I'm serious. People are used to
picking up very complex computer games. My

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.550
son, you know, this little boy this big, he
goes to a complex computer game and it always

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.690
comes with a book of instructions. I give
him the instructions, "No, Dad, I don't need

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:40.210
that. Go away," you know. He just starts playing
and he figures it out. And people--we have

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:48.769
trained people that they should not need training,
okay? And every time you add one minute of

00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:54.060
instruction that's required to use your App,
you lost 50% of your audience. I'm not exaggerating.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:17:01.550
It's not--sometimes you have to do a little
bit. Even I've seen some popular games where

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:10.140
you need that, but, you know, any instruction
is a bug; you know, instructions are a bug.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:16.600
So if you're--once--so let's assume you're--you
do useful stuff, you don't have bugs, you're

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:24.230
fast, you're usable, what else do you need
to be? You need to be beautiful, okay? You're

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:30.080
application has to be beautiful. And what
is beauty? Well, beauty is in the eye of the

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.320
beholder, we say in English, and the eyes
are very sharp. I mentioned that in the area

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:41.110
of Twitter, in particular, there are lot of
Twitter clients and I actually--I'm interested

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:46.100
in that area so I watch that area quite closely.
And here's the secret, most of the Twitter

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.720
clients are about the same. They do about
the same things and most of them are actually

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.840
pretty good. And what people talk about when
they talk about it is how they look, you know,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.240
"Oh, this just looks great. This looks great."
People respond very, very, very strongly to

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.730
aesthetic beauty. So how do you make your
application beautiful? Well, it's easy. First

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.330
of all, you have good typography which means
that you have, you know, kerning which is

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:13.000
how close letters are to each other. You put
a good font that's appropriate for the application,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.350
you do the justification, justified left,
justified right, justified center, both sides,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.690
you pick the right font weight and you pick
font weights so they contrast with the other

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.460
font weights and you worry about letting which
is how close the lines of text are to each

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:29.030
other. And then, you talk about the color
and, you know, you worry about the color transparency

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:33.220
which is the Alpha channel and you worry about
color spaces. Do you want SRGB or Adobe color

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.280
space and what--do you need a--you need a
palette of a small number of strongly related

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.940
colors. And then you need to worry about the
contrast level, particularly as it applies

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.179
to different kinds of screens. And then once
you've solved that, you have to worry about

00:18:44.179 --> 00:18:49.110
the lay out, you know, should it be landscape
or portrait? And one of the important aspects

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.679
of design is where you leave empty space on
the screen. People need empty space for their

00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:58.350
eyes to focus on the important things. And,
you know, you need to worry about whether

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.080
it's for handset or a tablet. And then, you
know, any application that's interesting is

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.230
going to have some motions. You have to worry
about animations and graceful transitions.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:10.640
And when somebody touches, what visible indication
do you give them that it's touched? So do

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.330
you about all that stuff? I don't see a lot
of hands going up. I have to say, most computer

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:25.020
programmers are idiots when it comes to this
stuff. It isn't easy. You need a lot of talent,

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.150
you have to go to school, you have to practice,
you have to be good at this stuff to do it.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:36.360
There's only one answer; hire a professional,
okay? Would you hire a painter to write your

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:42.120
code in your application? Well, then, why
are you doing the design, right? So are there

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.090
any professional designers in the crowd today?
Stand up, please. Stand up. Come on, hire

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:54.980
those people, okay? You need them. I'm serious.
Let me give you an example. One of the guys

00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:00.160
in the--in the--in my group at Android, this
guy named Reto Meier and he's--he wrote the

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.870
best book on Android by the way--and he wrote
an application that's quite popular to track

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.240
earthquakes everywhere in the world, okay?
And it turns out there's a lot of people who

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.400
are really, really interested in earthquakes.
And he's down--they've downloaded a huge number

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.970
of copies and Reto is a really good programmer,
and so this was his application. And he wrote

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.080
it and then he got the idea of talking to
a designer. And the designer he talked to

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.670
is another guy in our group called Roman Nurik
who's a pretty good designer, and then it

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:42.810
looked like that. Uh-huh, that, that. How
many of those ideas would you have thought

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:53.030
of? Okay. Designers, it's difficult sometimes
because designers and software creators tend

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:59.169
to have different values, different world
views, different ways of thinking about things.

00:20:59.169 --> 00:21:04.140
Also, they dress differently from us, you
know? They spend a lot of money on clothes

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.549
and they still wear black all the time. I
don't know, I can't figure it out. But, you

00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:13.520
know, we need these people. One of the main
things that will make a difference between

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:19.480
having a successful application and a not
so successful application is whether you have

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:27.202
a good design pro working on it. Okay. So
you've all agreed for your next App you're

00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:33.410
going to go get a designer, right? So you're
fast, you're bug-free, you're usable, you're

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:40.230
beautiful, what else is important? Well, you
need to look like an Android App. We see too

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.799
many cases were people go and say, "Oh, I'll
just port my Java MA App over" or even worse,

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:51.250
"I'll just go port my Windows App over and
put it on Android." And this never ever gets

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.250
a good result. Well, sorry, it does with games
sometimes because, you know, once you're into

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.020
the game and, you know, the game is just what
the pictures are on the screen. But even for

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.280
games, the things like, you know, the instructions
menu, the high scores, the stuff like that,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.770
we see these people hoarding over buttons
and menus and things from other systems and

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:15.600
it always looks wrong. The Android applications
tend to have a strong look; they have a lot

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.320
of things in common. This is incredibly valuable
for the users because they just know how to

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.740
use things. Things like the back button. The
back button is one of the best things about

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.380
Android. Don't steal it for your application.
You know, don't go and use it for something

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:35.620
else. If you have a list in your application,
please don't code up your own list. Just--the

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.540
Android framework includes eight kinds of
lists. They all work; they're good. Please

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:47.750
use them. Don't invent your own. Please do
not invent your own menu system, okay? Android

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.740
has a very good menu system built in. It comes
more or less for free when you press the menu

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:57.480
button. If you're--if you don't look like
an Android App, people will notice this and

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.671
they won't--they won't be able to say clearly
why they don't like it. They won't say, "Oh,

00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:03.720
it doesn't look like Android." They'll just
say, "Oh, it looks weird. I don't like it."

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:10.660
So be a good citizen of the Android ecosystem.
Okay. So those, I think, are the essential

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:17.490
characteristics of a--of a highly successful
quality user interface. I'm going to give

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:22.850
you some things, some general principles that
we believe in that this applications you have.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:28.500
So the first thing we believe in is clarity
over simplicity. There's a gentleman named

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.850
Edward Tufte who's written several books about
the display of information. And the big lesson

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.980
that he taught us--and he's got lots of studies
that prove this--people say they want simplicity

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.700
but that's not true. People want information.
People want a lot of information but they

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:48.260
want it displayed in a totally clear way so
that it's easy to understand. Consider a,

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.090
you know, this view of the--this is the App
that's running on Android when you put it

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.750
in the dock and it's sitting there on your
desk or beside your bed, and there's actually

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.610
quite a lot of information in there. There's
the--it tells you when the alarm's going to

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.550
off, it tells you the current time, there's
a control to dim the screen, you got the current

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:08.590
weather, where you are, how the battery's
charging, your branches to music into alarm

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:15.070
clock and things like that but it's not crowded.
You got a good designer on there. They achieved

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:22.030
clarity. So do not starve your users of information.
You have to go to a lot of work to crowd it

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:28.000
in. Now, another principle is that chrome
is bad. What is chrome? Chrome is all the

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.169
stuff--oh, jeez, I shouldn't--I should use
a different word because chrome is something

00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:35.530
else at Google, doesn't it? Anyhow, so when
people--when browser people talk it, they--when

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.580
they say chrome, they're talking about stuff
around the browser; the tool bars and the

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.960
switches and the sliders and the buttons and
the decorations. And on desktop applications

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:48.400
because we have a lot of room, we have the
temptation to put a lot of chrome around our

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.789
stuff. And you just can't do that on a phone.
So this is one of my favorite applications.

00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:59.150
This is an application called TripIt, which
I really recommend. And it is a travel application.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.240
And the great thing about it is you don't
have to tell it. What happens is when you

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:08.040
book a trip, the travel agency or the airline
sends you an email, you send the email to

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.179
TripIt and it automatically creates your schedule
for you. It's really brilliant. And so, look

00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:18.950
at this. I mean, they've just packed an incredible
amount of information onto the screen without

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.320
losing clarity and because they just got rid
of all the--all the stuff that wasn't totally

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:32.380
essential. So if you get rid of the non-essentials,
you win. Another thing that we believe strongly

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:39.220
is that it's really a mistake to store any
information--important information permanently

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:45.220
on the phone, okay? I think--we also believe
that it's a real mistake to store important

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:51.280
information on a personal computer. Telephones
can fall into the toilet. Telephones can be

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.360
stolen. Computers are heavy. Often, you don't
have your computer with you. We think it's

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.490
completely wrong that to put information onto
a phone, you should have to plug it in to

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:05.200
a computer. I mean, suppose the computer the
computer isn't here? Suppose the computer

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.799
is stolen? Suppose the computer crashed? For
anything that matters, it should really live

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:15.789
in the Cloud, which means it's available anywhere
and it can't fall in the toilet. So this is

00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:20.790
an app--this is a screen shot of Dropbox.
I assume lots of people know about Dropbox.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.660
If you don't know about Dropbox, you should
get it. It's just one of the world's great

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.610
applications. It's just a--it's just a network
disk drive. Nothing fancy about it, but it's

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:32.580
got a really nice client for Mac and Windows
and--I don't know with Linux, but it's got

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.590
a nice Android client. It's got--Linux, yes?
It's got a nice Linux client. It's got a great--a

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.640
great iPhone client. It basically works from
anywhere. You just put stuff on it and then

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.440
it's there for anybody and it's really easy
to share. So get anything that matters off

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:53.470
of your fragile, insecure, local computers.
So--and Google clearly has bet on this. And

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:59.130
we're going to be doing some things in music
and so on that follow the same principle.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:05.730
Here's another principle that's just more
subtle, which is that people hate being warned,

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:12.010
okay? They don't like a dialogue coming up
and saying, "Oh, are you sure?" So a better

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:16.440
principle is to never do that. So if you look
at Gmail, for example, this is the Android

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.810
Gmail app, if you delete some mails, it doesn't--it
doesn't come up and say, "Are you sure? Did

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:25.480
you really want to delete those mails?" It's
just, "Okay. Oh, and by the way, you can undo."

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.029
So an undo is better than a warning. And,
in fact, particularly if you're using a Cloud

00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:36.630
as backup for your operations, you should
really be able to have almost infinite undo

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.730
in any application. Really, people should
be able to work for an hour and then say,

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.270
"Oh, I didn't really mean that. Make it all
go away." And the more undo you have, the

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:48.650
better. The fewer warnings you have, the better.
Don't get in people's way. When somebody wants

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:54.150
to delete a mail, they want to delete a mail.
They don't want to see a dialogue. So that's

00:27:54.150 --> 00:28:00.820
good. One thing that's coming at us very,
very fast is multiple screen sizes. So, here,

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:09.720
we have some small Android phone, a Nexus
One, a Samsung Galaxy Tab and a Google TV.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:17.490
This is great news. Anybody who says that
one size is the right size for everybody is

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:23.400
just crazy. That's arrogant. Some people carry
phones in their pockets. Some people carry

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:30.350
phones in their purses. Some people carry
phones in their briefcase. Some people want

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:36.070
to--want to run Android on their TV. All those
things are just fine. So it's a good thing.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:40.710
And whether you like it or not, it's coming.
There are going to be a huge number of different

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:45.830
sizes of devices coming at us and you, as
the developer, have to do a good job with

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:51.020
that, okay? Now, the Android ToolKit is full
of facilities to help you with this stuff

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:57.400
so that you can provide alternate application
layouts for different sizes and shapes and

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.730
screen densities and things like that. And
start getting ready for that now because it's

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.429
coming at you very, very quickly. And from
your point of view as a developer, this is

00:29:05.429 --> 00:29:13.370
basically a good thing because it means that
there are more devices to run your apps on.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:20.460
Very closely related to that, please don't
lock--you see, Android allows you to lock

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.230
your application. It's running only landscape
or only portrait mode. Don't do that. That's

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:29.460
a really, really bad idea. Maybe it's okay
for a game, but not for anything else. Don't

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.150
tell people how they can hold their phones.
This subject is so important in the last two

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:39.010
slides that we're going have a whole session
on it. The next session after the break is

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.240
going to be on how to make sure your Android
app will run on lots of different kinds of

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:52.529
devices. And it's not going to be by me. Another
thing, you're going to laugh, but I mean this.

00:29:52.529 --> 00:29:57.460
Icons are really important, okay? When somebody
picks up their Android screen--phone and looks

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:04.320
at it, what do they see? They see a bunch
of icons. If yours is the ugly one, that's

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:10.289
no good. So we've recently published a new
set of guidelines that say, you know, how

00:30:10.289 --> 00:30:13.750
icons should look; a bunch of rules for how
the lighting should be, what the shape should

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.260
be like, what the color should be. Please,
go read those. And we're starting to get some

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:24.280
good tools out there to help you develop icons.
So focus on your icons because they really

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.120
matter. When people interact, it's absolutely
wrong if you're--when people touch the screen,

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.720
something should happen. They should see that
they've touched the screen. That means that

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.450
for most buttons that are in your applications,
you need to have them in four forms, okay?

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:46.000
Another thing that we believe is that your
application should cooperate with other applications.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.289
I--you know, so if you hate a URL, don't try
and be the web browser; call the web browser.

00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:55.630
If they want to send mail, don't send mail.
Just give control to the mail program. Android

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.250
is just carefully designed so that the user
experience is presented as a combination of

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.490
a lot of different applications working together.
Here's a beautiful example; two applications

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:09.900
whose names that I forget; one of them is
Open Table and I'm not sure with the other

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:15.890
one. Anyhow, one is a thing for finding and
reviewing restaurants and the other is an

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.080
application for booking tables, for making
reservations at restaurants. And so, the rep--the

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.179
apps--so they got together and they agreed
on an intent, Android has intents. And so

00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:24.260
the application finds restaurants. When you'd
find it, you'd say, "Oh, we'll try and book

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.850
a table," and it gives control to the restaurants
booking up the table. Isn't that great? Each

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:38.110
of them is focusing on the things that they
do really well. Finally, we believe that some

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:43.990
things are sacred. Don't fool around with
them. These are the things that are sacred.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:49.179
So first of all, the status bar. We see a
few applications that take over the status

00:31:49.179 --> 00:31:52.600
bar and make it go away because I want the
whole screen to be red and it's gray. That's

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:57.559
really a totally evil to do and you should
never do that. People really, really care

00:31:57.559 --> 00:32:02.159
how much battery they have left. People really,
really care if they're getting a mobile signal

00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:06.919
or not. They really, really care if they've
had emails arrive and they're in there. And

00:32:06.919 --> 00:32:12.020
if you take the status bar over, you are taking
that away and I, personally, will uninstall

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.809
an app. If an app takes away the status bar,
I'm done with it. Games, once again, are allowed

00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:21.111
to do this and that's why, you know, you miss
emails and your wife's phone calls and all

00:32:21.111 --> 00:32:26.520
sorts of things when you're playing games,
but, you know, that's life anyhow. The other

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:32.899
thing that's sacred is the back button. Everybody
in the world has been using browsers for as--you

00:32:32.899 --> 00:32:37.720
know, anybody under 30 has been using browsers
for as long as they could sit up. And we've

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.731
trained the entire population of the user--of
the world that wherever you've been, you can

00:32:42.731 --> 00:32:48.210
get back there. Just press the back button.
So please be careful. When you--when your

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:51.480
application is built with a bunch of activities,
you know, think about where should the back

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.770
button take you. Sometimes you've got a particular
error condition and you don't want to go back

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.610
to the previous screen, when they hit back,
you want to go to the front screen or something

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.890
like that, okay? So you need to think a lot
about where should the back button take people.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:11.350
And if people hit the back button and they're
surprised, you've really failed as a developer.

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:19.540
The menu button, once again, the menu button
acts the same on all Android apps. And it's

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.710
really important because the menu button is
very powerful because it allows you to put

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:27.040
the 20% of controls that people use all the
time on the screen and not try and squeeze

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.090
in the minor controls because everybody who
uses Android for more than about a day learns

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:35.960
that "Oh, I want to do something. I don't
see how to that. Well, I'll hit the menu button,"

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.789
right, and they expect to find it there. So
don't fight that. Go with it. And there are

00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:43.490
a few applications where you hit the menu
bar and nothing happens and that makes you

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.060
feel something's deeply wrong and the application
must be broken or something like that. At

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.260
least it should say, "Oh, this is version
1.5 of the application" or something. I don't

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:56.559
know. And then, finally, the search button.
Speaking as a representative of Google, I

00:33:56.559 --> 00:34:00.899
think I can say that we've proved that there
are many different navigation schemes through

00:34:00.899 --> 00:34:06.440
information. But by far, the best is to open
a search window, type in a few characters

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.319
and press enter and let the system find it.
So I was reviewing a new application the other

00:34:11.319 --> 00:34:16.669
day, it was a newspaper reading application
and it has hundreds of newspapers in it from

00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:20.510
hundreds of countries and I had to scroll
through this huge list of all the countries

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.649
in the world. And then I went to, I think,
U.K. Britain and they had 300 newspapers from

00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:27.809
Britain and I had to scroll through this huge
list of newspapers. Well, I just want to see

00:34:27.809 --> 00:34:35.129
if they had the Guardian. This is crazy. Just
"Search", "Guardian", find it, right? So basically,

00:34:35.129 --> 00:34:43.599
the majority of screens in your application
should have a search button.

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:47.789
Okay, now I'm going to talk about a few tools.
I'm almost finished here, but I'm going to

00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:53.080
talk about a few tools and leave time for
a little bit of questions at the end. This

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.940
is stuff that we're going to be talking about
in the next the talk, but the amount of work

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:02.759
that it takes to support multiple different
screen sizes and densities and orientations

00:35:02.759 --> 00:35:11.839
is not that high. Learn how to this stuff,
okay? There's an incredible number of possible

00:35:11.839 --> 00:35:15.509
combinations of screen sizes and densities
and orientations and you don't have to fill

00:35:15.509 --> 00:35:19.450
them all in because the Android framework
is actually pretty good. It's scaling things

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:26.119
to fit the sizes and densities available.
But the more you fill in, really, the better.

00:35:26.119 --> 00:35:31.400
Another thing that you should learn how to
use is 9-patch graphics. I don't know--a lot

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.130
of people don't even know about this stuff,
but it's really valuable. This is just a little

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:39.220
PNG file and the system will stretch the last
row of pixels, the border pixels, all the

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.650
way across. So this is absolutely the best
way to do a fancy border or to fill in odd

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:48.039
places in your application. Learn about 9-patches.
They are a really great way to make your applications

00:35:48.039 --> 00:35:53.770
look great. And if you're going to have buttons
on your thing--on your--on your screen that

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:59.640
people push, there's this thing that not enough
people use called the Selector. So you put

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:04.180
a button in there and then as the people press
it, it will automatically switch in different

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:09.329
renditions of your button. So--and the difference
that it makes when buttons change color as

00:36:09.329 --> 00:36:15.890
you touch them, it just makes the whole thing
more enveloping, more pleasant, more friendly.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:21.729
So I'm about finished but, you know, I want
to show you a graph. One of the good things

00:36:21.729 --> 00:36:30.479
that can happen if you have a good app is
that it can be featured in the Android Market,

00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:36.440
okay? So when you go to Android Market on
your phone, you see a list of featured applications.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.829
And the process by which an application gets
featured is a combination of an algorithm

00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:45.041
and some human judgment, okay? And one of
the things that goes into the human judgment

00:36:45.041 --> 00:36:52.079
is usability, beauty, speed, the kind of things
that I have been talking about here today.

00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:55.349
You'd think that there are thousands of great
apps out there, you know, wanting to be featured.

00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:58.839
We actually have to work pretty hard to find
the apps to be featured. So if you got an

00:36:58.839 --> 00:37:03.440
app that's good, it stands out from the crowd
and is beautiful and fast and usable, you

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.249
have a pretty good chance of getting featured.
When an app gets featured in Android Market,

00:37:08.249 --> 00:37:14.529
the number of downloads goes up by a factor
of from 600 time--from six times to about

00:37:14.529 --> 00:37:19.470
200 times. So this is an app, just a typical
app. In fact, it's the Earthquake App that

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.259
Reto Meier wrote. So that was just his number
of total downloads and he was featured there

00:37:23.259 --> 00:37:32.329
for a couple of weeks and look what happened.
Okay? So that's the reward. But if your app

00:37:32.329 --> 00:37:37.749
is slow, it won't be featured. If your app
is ugly, it won't be featured. If your app

00:37:37.749 --> 00:37:45.769
crashes, it won't be featured. If your app
doesn't have good usability, it won't be featured.

00:37:45.769 --> 00:37:51.049
And not only will it not be featured, it will
not succeed. It's really, really easy to write

00:37:51.049 --> 00:37:56.769
an Android app. Writing a beautiful, fast,
useful Android app is more difficult. It's

00:37:56.769 --> 00:38:01.349
a real test of your talent and the job isn't
finished until you've hit all the things that

00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:05.930
I've been talking about here today. So I'm
going to stop there. Thank you kindly. Okay.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.659
Thank you very much. Time for coffee.
