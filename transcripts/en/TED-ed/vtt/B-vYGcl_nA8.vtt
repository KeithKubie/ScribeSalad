00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:09.485
When you think of natural history museums,

00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:14.116
you probably picture exhibits 
filled with ancient lifeless things,

00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:15.435
like dinosaurs

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:16.463
meteroites,

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:17.867
and gemstones.

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:20.695
But behind that educational exterior,

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:25.032
which only includes 
about 1% of a museum's collection,

00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:29.558
there are hidden laboratories 
where scientific breakthroughs are made.

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:31.196
Beyond the unmarked doors,

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:34.087
and on the floors 
the elevators won't take you to,

00:00:34.087 --> 00:00:37.488
you'd find windows into amazing worlds.

00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:42.017
This maze of halls and laboratories 
is a scientific sanctuary

00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:45.744
that houses a seemingly 
endless variety of specimens.

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:49.507
Here, researchers work to unravel 
mysteries of evolution,

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.261
cosmic origins,

00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.579
and the history of our planet.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.013
One museum alone 
may have millions of specimens.

00:00:57.013 --> 00:01:00.103
The American Museum of Natural History
in New York City

00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:04.079
has over 32,000,000 in its collection.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.164
Let's take a look at just one of them.

00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:09.478
Scientists have logged exactly
where and when it was found

00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:14.035
and used various dating techniques 
to pinpoint when it originated.

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:17.307
Repeat that a million times over,
and these plants,

00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:18.371
animals,

00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:19.228
minerals,

00:01:19.228 --> 00:01:20.106
fossils,

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:25.239
and artifacts present windows 
into times and places around the world

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:28.066
and across billions of years of history.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.872
When a research problem emerges,

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:34.880
scientists peer through these windows
and test hypotheses about the past.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.702
For example, in the 1950s, 
populations of predatory birds,

00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:41.331
like peregrine falcons,

00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:42.393
owls,

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:45.014
and eagles started to mysteriously crash,

00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:48.668
to the point where a number of species,
including the bald eagle,

00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:50.929
were declared endangered.

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.553
Fortunately, scientists in 
The Field Museum in Chicago

00:01:54.553 --> 00:01:58.283
had been collecting the eggs 
of these predatory birds for decades.

00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:01.811
They discovered that the egg shells 
used to be thicker

00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:04.059
and had started to thin around the time

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:09.616
when an insecticide called DDT 
started being sprayed on crops.

00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:12.436
DDT worked very well to kill insects,

00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:16.239
but when birds came and ate
those heaps of dead bugs,

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.372
the DDT accumulated in their bodies.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.401
It worked its way up the food chain

00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:26.473
and was absorbed by apex predator birds
in such high concentrations

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:28.299
that it thinned their eggs

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.086
so that they couldn't support 
the nesting bird's weight.

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:33.669
There were omelettes everywhere

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.103
until scientists from 
The Field Museum in Chicago,

00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:37.642
and other institutions,

00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:40.493
helped solve the mystery and save the day.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.778
America thanks you, Field Museum.

00:02:42.778 --> 00:02:45.341
Natural history museums 
windows into the past

00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:48.326
have solved many other 
scientific mysteries.

00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:50.706
Museum scientists have used 
their collections

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:53.077
to sequence the Neanderthal genome,

00:02:53.077 --> 00:02:56.129
discover genes that gave mammoths red fur,

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.176
and even pinpoint where 
ancient giant sharks gave birth.

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:04.476
There are about 900 
natural history museums in the world,

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.306
and every year they make 
new discoveries and insights

00:03:07.306 --> 00:03:10.934
into the Earth's past, present and future.

00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:14.208
Museum collections even help us 
understand how modern threats,

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:16.172
such as global climate change,

00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:17.861
are impacting our world.

00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:20.404
For instance, 
naturalists have been collecting samples

00:03:20.404 --> 00:03:24.029
for over 100 years from Walden Pond,

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.139
famously immortalized 
by Henry David Thoreau.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.426
Thanks to those naturalists,
who count Thoreau among their number,

00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:32.735
we know that the plants around Walden Pond

00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:38.132
are blooming over three weeks earlier 
than they did 150 years ago.

00:03:38.132 --> 00:03:40.566
Because these changes 
have taken place gradually,

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:44.710
one person may not have noticed them
over the span of a few decades,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.635
but thanks to museum collections,

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:51.535
we have an uninterrupted record 
showing how our world is changing.

00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:54.375
So the next time you're exploring 
a natural history museum,

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:57.361
remember that what you're seeing 
is just one gem

00:03:57.361 --> 00:04:00.716
of a colossal scientific treasure trove.

00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:05.448
Behind those walls and under your feet
are windows into forgotten worlds.

00:04:05.448 --> 00:04:06.609
And who knows?

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.697
One day some future scientist may 
peer through one and see you.
