00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
I think we have a respectable
sense of how muscles contract

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.520
on the molecular level.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.080
Let's take a step back now and
just understand how muscles

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.720
look, at least structurally, or
how they relate to things

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.375
that we normally associate
with muscles.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:16.140
So let me draw a flexing
bicep right here.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.940
That's their elbow and
let's say that's

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.540
their hand right there.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.435
So this is their bicep
and it's flexing.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.890
I think we've all seen diagrams
of what muscles look,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.820
at least on kind of a macro
level and it's connected to

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.010
the bones at either end.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.090
Let me draw the bones.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060
I'm not going to detail where--
so it's connected to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.060
the bones at either
end by tendons.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.610
So this right here would
be some bone.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.910
Right there would be another
bone that it's connected to.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.330
And then this is tendons, which
connects the bones to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.580
the muscles.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.560
We have the general sense--
connected to two bones, when

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.310
it contracts it moves some part
of our skeletal system.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.025
So we're actually focused
on skeletal muscles.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.660
The other types are smooth
muscles and cardiac muscles.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.280
Cardiac muscles are those, as
you can imagine, in our heart.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.000
And smooth muscles are-- these
are more involuntary, slow

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.610
moving muscles and things like
our digestive tract.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.740
And I'll do video on that in
the future, but most of the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.330
time when people say muscles,
we associate them with

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.545
skeletal muscles that move our
skeletal system around, allow

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:38.720
us to run and lift and talk
and do and bite things.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.940
So this is what we normally
associate-- let's dig in a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.960
little bit deeper here.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.670
So if I were to take a cross
section of this bicep right

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.130
there-- if I were to take a
cross section of that muscle

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.285
right there-- so let
me do it big.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.400
And then it looks something
like this.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.020
This is the inside of this
muscle over here.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.960
Now I said back here,
we had our tendon.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.880
And then there's actually a
covering; there's no strict

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.100
demarcation or dividing line
between the tendon and the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.100
covering around this muscle,
but that covering is called

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.060
the epimysium and it's really
just connective tissue that

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.450
covers the muscle, kind of
protects it, reduces friction

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.120
between the muscle and the
surrounding bone and other

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.620
tissue that might be in this
person's arm right there.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.960
And then within this muscle, you
have connective tissue on

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.980
the inside.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.570
Let me do it in another color.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.820
I'll do it in orange.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.460
This is called a perimyseum,
and that's also just

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.860
connective tissue inside
of the actual muscle.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.780
And then each of these things
that the perimysium is

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.700
dividing off-- let me say if we
were to take one of these

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.410
things and allow it to go a
little bit further-- so if we

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.870
were to take this thing right
here-- what this perimysium is

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.800
dividing off-- and if we were to
pull it out-- actually, let

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.260
me do this one right here.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.600
If we were to pull this one out
just like that-- so you

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.050
have the perimysium surrounding
it, right?

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.840
This is all perimysium, and
it's just a fancy word for

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.630
connective tissue.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.600
There's other stuff in there.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.940
You could have nerves and you
could have capillaries, all

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.920
sorts of stuff because you have
to get blood and neuronal

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.150
signals to your muscles of
entry so it's not just

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.680
connective tissue.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.800
It's other things that have to
be able to eventually get to

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.950
your muscle cells.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.320
So each of these-- I guess you'd
call it subfibers, but

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.220
these are pretty big subfibers
of the muscle.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.470
This is called a fascicle.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.600
The connective tissue inside of
the fascicle is called the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.850
endomysium.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.680
So once again, more connective
tissues, has capillaries in

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.650
it, has nerves in it, all of
the things that have to

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.370
eventually come in contact
with muscle cells.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.015
We're inside of a
single muscle.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.320
All this green connective
tissue is endomysium.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.220
And each of these things that
are in the endomysium are an

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.240
actual muscle cell.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.150
This is an actual muscle cell.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.320
I'll do it in purple.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.700
So this thing right here-- I can
pull it out a little bit.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:37.110
If I pull this out, this is
an actual muscle cell.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.990
This is what we wanted to get
to, but we're going to go even

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.610
within the muscle cell to see,
understand how all the myosin

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.920
and the actin filaments fit
into that muscle cell.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.595
So this right here is a muscle
cell or a myofiber.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.970
The two prefixes you'll see
a lot when dealing with

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.010
muscles-- you're going to see
myo, which you can imagine

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.710
refers to muscle.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.990
And you're also going to see
the word sarco, like

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.930
sarcolemma, or sarcoplasmic
reticulum.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.970
So you're also go see the
prefix sarco and that's

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.980
flesh-- so sarcophagus-- or you
can think of other things

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.900
that start with sarco.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.850
So sarco is flesh.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.760
Muscle is flesh and
myo is muscle.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.220
So this is myofiber.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.650
This is an actual muscle cell
and so let's zoom in on the

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.320
actual muscle.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.490
So let me actually draw it
really a lot bigger here.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.570
So an actual muscle cell
is called a myofiber.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.760
It's called a fiber because it's
longer than it is wide

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.380
and they come in various--
let me draw the

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.880
myofiber like this.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.200
I'll take a cross section of
the muscle cell as well.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.110
And these can be relatively
short-- several hundred

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.520
micrometers-- or it could be
quite long-- at least quite

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.500
long by cellular standards.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.340
We're talking several
centimeters.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.160
Think of it as a cell.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.330
That's quite a long cell.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.760
Because it's so long,
it actually has to

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.770
have multiple nucleuses.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.280
Actually, to draw the nucleuses,
let me do a better

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.470
job drawing the myofiber.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.510
I'm going to make little lumps
in the outside membranes where

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.740
the nucleuses can fit
on this myofiber.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.330
Remember, this is just one of
these individual muscle cells

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.760
and they're really long so they
have multiple nucleuses.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.600
Let me take its cross section
because we're going to go

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.800
inside of this muscle cell.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.210
So I said it's multinucleated.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.340
So if we kind of imagine its
membrane being transparent,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.930
there'd be one nucleus over
here, another nucleus over

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.200
here, another nucleus
over here, another

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.170
nucleus over there.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.630
And the reason why it's
multinucleated is so that over

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.830
large distances, you don't have
to wait for proteins to

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.980
get all the way from this
nucleus all the way over to

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.090
this part of the muscle cell.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.020
You can actually have the DNA
information close to where it

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.680
needs to be.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.850
So it's multinucleated.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.735
I read one-- I think it was 30
or so nucleuses per millimeter

00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:10.700
of muscle tissue is what
the average is.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.680
I don't know if that's actually
the case, but the

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.370
nucleuses are kind of right
under the membrane of the

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.610
muscle cell-- and you remember
what that's called from the

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.010
last video.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.040
The membrane of the muscle
cell is the sarcolemma.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.630
These are the nucleuses.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:43.690
And then if you take the cross
section of that, there are

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.070
tubes within that called
myofibrils.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:53.300
So here there's a bunch
of tubes inside

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.210
of the actual cell.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.380
Let me pull one of them out.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.050
So I've pulled out one
of these tubes.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.300
This is a myofibril.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.360
And if you were to look at this
under a light microscope,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.380
you'll see it has little
striations on it.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.190
the striations will look
something like that, like

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.560
that, like that, and there'll
be little thin ones

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.110
like that, like that.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:24.200
And inside of these myofibrils
is where we'll find our myosin

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.260
and actin filaments.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.170
So let's zoom in over here
on this myofibril.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.910
We'll just keep zooming until we
get to the molecular level.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.300
So this myofibril, which is--
remember, it's inside of the

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.220
muscle cell, inside
of the myofiber.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.090
The myofiber is a muscle cell.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.640
Myofibral is a-- you can view
it as a tube inside of the

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.580
muscle cell.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.390
These are the things that
are actually doing the

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.600
contraction.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.270
So if I were to zoom in on a
myofibril, you're going to see

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.830
it-- it's going to look
something like that and it's

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.020
going to have those
bands in it.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.040
So the bands are going to look
something like this.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.445
You're going to have these
short bands like that.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.170
Then you're going to have wider
bands like that, like

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.020
these little dark-- trying my
best to draw them relatively

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.410
neatly and there could be a
little line right there.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.670
Then the same thing
repeats over here.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.100
So each of these units of

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.030
repetition is called a sarcomere.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.550
And these units of repetition go
from one-- this is called a

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.490
Z-line to another Z-line.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.060
And all of this terminology
comes out of when people just

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.430
looked under a microscope and
they saw these lines, they

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.070
started attaching names to it.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.450
And just so you have the other
terminology-- we'll talk about

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.060
how this relates to the myosin
and the actin in a second.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.330
This right here is the A-band.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.410
And then this distance right
here or these parts right

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.850
here, these are called
the I-bands.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.380
And we'll talk about really in a
few seconds how that relates

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.610
to the mechanisms or the units
that we talked-- or the

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.300
molecules that we talked about
in the last video.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.710
So if you were to zoom in here,
if you were to go into

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.440
these myofibrils, if you were
to take a cross section of

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.060
these myofibrils, what you'll
find is-- if you were to cut

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.960
it up, maybe slice it-- if you
were slice it parallel to the

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.190
actual screen that you're
looking at, you're going to

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.660
see something like this.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.390
So this is going to
be your Z-band.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.540
This is your next Z-band.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.160
So I'm zooming in on
sarcomere now.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.560
This is another Z-band.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.290
Then you have your
actin filaments.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.920
Now we're getting to that
molecular level

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.170
that I talked about.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.250
And then in between the actin
filaments, you have your

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.910
myosin filaments.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.540
Remember, the myosin filaments
had those two heads on them.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:36.670
They each have two heads like
that, that crawl along the

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.390
actin filaments.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.260
I'm just drawing a couple of
them and then they're attached

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.810
at the middle just like that.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.680
We'll talk about in a second
what happens when the muscle

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.650
actually contracts.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.070
And I could draw it
again over here.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.440
So it has many more heads than
what I'm drawing, but this

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.070
just gives you an idea
of what's happening.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.320
These are the myosin, I guess,
proteins and they all

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.660
intertwined like we saw in the
previous video and then

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.460
there'll be another
one over here.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.950
I don't have to draw
in detail.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.890
So you can see immediately that
the A-band corresponds to

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.032
where we have our myosin.

00:13:15.032 --> 00:13:17.260
So this is our A-band
right here.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.680
And there is an overlap.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.780
They do overlap each other, even
in the resting state, but

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.070
the I-band is where you
only have actin

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.740
filaments, no myosin.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.410
And then the myosin filaments
are held in place by titin,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.460
which you can kind of imagine
as a springy protein.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.186
I want to do it in a different
color than that.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.520
So the myosin is held
in place by titin.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.790
It's attached to the
Z-band by titin.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.760
So what happened?

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:07.340
So we have all of these-- when
a neuron excites-- so let me

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.600
draw an endpoint of a neuron
right here, the endpoint of an

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.470
axon of a neuron right there.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.280
It's a motor neuron.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.960
It's telling this
guy to contract.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.670
You have the action potential.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.460
The action potential travels
along the membrane, really in

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.580
all directions.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.860
And then it eventually, if we
look at it from this view,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.690
they have those little
transverse or T-tubules.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:35.860
They essentially go into the
cell and continue to propagate

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.140
the action potential.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.980
Those trigger the sarcoplasmic
reticulum to release calcium.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.580
The calcium attaches to the
troponin that's attached to

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.340
these actin filaments that moves
the tropomyosin out of

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.290
the way, and then the
crawling can occur.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.130
The myosin can start
using ATP to crawl

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.060
along these actin filaments.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:03.210
And so as you can imagine, as
they crawl along, their power

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.050
stroke is going to push-- you
can either view it as the

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.130
actin filaments in that way or
you can say that the myosin is

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.490
going to want to move in that
direction, but you're pulling

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.440
on both sides of
a rope, right?

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.040
So the myosin is going to stay
in one place and the actin

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.715
filaments are going to
be pulled together.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.740
And that's essentially how the
muscle is contracting.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.830
So we've, hopefully, in this
video, connected the big

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.230
picture from the flexing muscle
all the way over here

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.920
to exactly what's happening at
the molecular level that we

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.000
learned in the last
few videos.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.500
And you can imagine, when this
happens to all of the

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.850
myofibrils inside of the muscle,
right, because the

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.550
sarcoplasmic reticulum's
releasing calcium generally

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.690
into the cytoplasm of-- which
is also called myoplasm,

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.110
because we're dealing with
muscle cells-- the cytoplasm

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.370
of this muscle cell.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.210
The calcium floods all
of these myofibrils.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.910
It's able to attach to all of
the troponin-- or at least a

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:05.305
lot of the troponin on top of
these actin filaments and then

00:16:05.305 --> 00:16:07.000
the whole muscle contracts.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.340
And then when that's done, each
muscle fiber, myofiber,

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.030
or each muscle cell
will not have that

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.350
much contracting power.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.930
But when you couple it with all
of them that are around

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.040
it-- if you just have one,
actually, working, or a few of

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.240
them, you'll just
have a twitch.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.710
But if you have all of them
contracting together, then

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.270
that's actually going to create
the force to actually

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.420
do some work, or actually pull
your bones together, or lift

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:28.920
some weights.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.980
So hopefully you found
that mildly useful.
