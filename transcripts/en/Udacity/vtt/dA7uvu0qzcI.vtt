00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.120
Don just provided examples of a good

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.850
conceptual model. And an ineffective conceptual model,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.510
using the two refrigerators at Udacity. We'll

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.170
talk more about why the ineffective example, was

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.110
ineffective in a moment. But first, let's

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.870
step back. And talk about what conceptual models

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.080
are. So a conceptual model is an

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.140
explanation. Usually highly simplified, of how something works.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.125
Sometimes conceptual models are inferred from a

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.790
product itself. Sometimes they're learned over a, a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.080
course of time. In other situations they're passed

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.570
down from person to person. They're really good

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.810
at helping people predict, how something will work.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.580
And what to do in case something goes

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.230
wrong. I think conceptional models will like a

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.630
lot more sense, if I provide an example.
