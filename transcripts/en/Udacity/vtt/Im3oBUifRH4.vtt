3- 2 is different than 2- 3.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.080
So this is the correct answer.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.490
If Kathleen starts
with three cupcakes and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.760
promises two to friends,
she's left with one cupcake for herself.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.040
But if she starts with two cupcakes and
promises three to friends,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.220
Kathleen owes one more cupcake
than she actually has.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.170
She's left with -1 cupcake.
