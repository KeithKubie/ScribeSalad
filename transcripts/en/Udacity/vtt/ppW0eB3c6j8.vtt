00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.589
And I like this one the most.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.530
I don't like this T chart because it
involves using really huge values of x,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.150
and there's no reason to plug in such
large values if we don't have to.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.400
This one smaller values of x, but
look they're all over the place,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.730
negative 10 and a 100.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.620
Those are pretty far
apart from each other.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.757
And 100 and 101 are really close.

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:19.231
Why would we do that to ourselves?

00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.240
Here we have nice,
small manageable values of x and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.139
separated by a nice easy value of 2.

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:27.690
That seems like it should work fine.
