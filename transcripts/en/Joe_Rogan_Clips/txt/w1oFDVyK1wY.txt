Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. I love Uber. I wonder how much that's preventing drunk driving. I just had this conversation. Yeah. I think what, you know, mothers against drunk driving mad, you know, maybe even the government should like kick in and go like, you know, these guys are saving lives. Yeah. For sure. If you get, cause if you're not doing that, then you're drinking and driving most likely, most likely. So it gives you a real easy option. Yeah. Yeah. And it's so quick. It's so convenient. You don't have to pull cash out. It's, it's great. It's kind of a weird organization of both of them. It's like they're trying to figure out if their employees, right. With their contractors. Yeah. And then there's like this fact that you're just getting into someone's car, you don't know them. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you assume that if you get a limo, but there's a background check, right.

Speaker 1:          00:49          If you get a cab, you living on the edge. Right. That's how I was going to say. If he never know exactly. Robert Deniro, a hundred people looking at me. Yeah. That's all. I'm going to fucking psychopath. Right. That's what you'd like. But you would get like New York City cab driver, he'd get characters and you get either like a angry white dudes or like a guys who come from other countries. I can tell you cool stories. Yeah. You get like characters, weird smells and shit. Crazy smells, lots of weird music. Possibly a Voodoo doll, but now you know what you get when you get in New York City cab driver, you get advertisements and you'd screens like they have little laptops facing. Yeah, and the play these these credit card machine back there and they play these, these videos about things about restaurants and this and that shows that's its own network at this point.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Yeah, like just the cab network. It is kind of right. It must be, yeah. I've seen that. Probably has their own little loop that they pledged Jimmy Fallon and I mean I've seen him down there many times doing stuff. I remember they used to do that HBO show Taxi Cab Confessions. Yeah. That was crazy. I enjoyed that. I was like, Hula Fuck is signing this release. We've given these people. It's like, I just want to be on TV. And I would say the worst stuff, like if you're fucked up on coke and you get into a a cab and you start just talking shit about all the crazy sexual stuff that you like, and then, and then afterwards they're like, hey, you're going to be on HBO. You're like, fuck yeah, I'm inside that thing. And then you wake up in the morning. No, that's true. Call doing that. This, this waiver at the right time. Yeah, that's gold. That's a good move. How does that work? Does that mean to you if you're hammered, I, there's gotta be some loophole.
