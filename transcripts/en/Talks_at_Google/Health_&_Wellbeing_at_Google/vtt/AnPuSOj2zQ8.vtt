00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.844
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:06.344
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:09.272
PAUL HODSON: Thank you.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:11.850
Thank you.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.680
Now, can I just check?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.010
Everybody can hear me, yeah?

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.600
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.350
PAUL HODSON: Cool.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.410
OK.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.015
Listen, I am honored
with your presence.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.940
Look at this, for
a group of people.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.460
Thank you so much.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.430
It's going to be my
pleasure to share

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.750
a bit of my experience with
you guys today, and girls.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.040
And really talk about the theme
of what we're all about today.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.240
It's Be the Best
Person You Ever Met.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.860
I mean, it's so important.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.330
One of the things that I
learned very early on--

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.960
scouting and doing my coaching,
training, whatever-- is,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.960
what was the journey that
I had with my good self?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.230
And often, I was
very disappointed.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.470
So in the next 40 minutes
I want to share with you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.290
a path forward in your life
that you can also pursue.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.540
But you need to
know about me first.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.445
Now, while we start I just want
to share something with you,

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:16.820
because you're
all looking at me.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.740
Very powerful.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.010
Always bear that in mind.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.620
OK.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.810
So what you're going to hear
today is a bit about myself,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.170
my story, how
BodyFitMind came about,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.960
the vision that I have for the
future-- it's in its infancy--

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.330
the three pillars
of well-being--

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.850
what happens to
all of us when you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.610
get the balance, the
synchronicity of those

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.690
three elements correct, my
moments of breakthrough.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.050
And I'm 65 now.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.150
And I spent a long
time getting it wrong.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.060
But just to show you
younger people there's hope.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.760
Now I want to share
a secret with you.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.100
And this is just
between us today.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.880
I wouldn't want it
to go anywhere else.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.890
I'm not perfect.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.289
I'm not perfect.

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.080
I don't know what you
were expecting today.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.710
Some fantastically built
person who's super fit,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.690
has got his life in order.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.010
I'm not there yet.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.730
And no one is.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.750
But what we are, and what
you are, and I'm included,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.720
is as human beings
we are amazing.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.575
And we are full of potential
yet to be explored.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.340
I want to share this with you.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.890
I was born in
Birmingham, England.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.517
I-- Does anybody watch
"Peaky Blinders"?

00:02:59.517 --> 00:03:00.100
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.100
PAUL HODSON: Great show.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.402
I was actually-- the
area where that's set,

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:04.360
that's where I grew up.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.000
Small Heath.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.250
So what you might
find is periodically

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.747
I might just slip into a
bit of a Brummie accent.

00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:16.830
So just put your hand up
and get me back on track.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.750
I was grammar school-educated.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.210
I got that accent knocked
out, I can assure you.

00:03:27.064 --> 00:03:28.230
Let me just go back to that.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.800
So eldest of five kids,
working class family.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.740
University wasn't
an option for me.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.070
I grew up, I did
my GCSEs, which is

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.060
Leaving Cert equivalent here.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.420
I got the right grades,
and then I was out to work.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.070
It was no ifs and buts.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.110
University was
for the rich kids.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.940
And my father was
an engineer, and I

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.250
was encouraged to take up an
apprenticeship in engineering--

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.330
five-year apprenticeship.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.210
I can only say I hated
every moment of it.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.600
Every moment.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.330
But there was
nothing I could do.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.067
And I-- It's the
one thing I learned.

00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:13.150
You have to stick with it.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.774
It was on the other
side of Birmingham.

00:04:14.774 --> 00:04:17.430
The journey was
maybe an hour a day.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.600
I know that for some people
now that's quite short.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.010
But it was something
that I really disliked.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.920
But because I was expected
to do the right thing

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.110
I did the right thing.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.890
That's one thing I
learned very early on.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.760
When I came out of that I
just wanted to get out of it,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.620
and I was searching
for a couple years.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.400
Various jobs--
recruitment, sales,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.080
estimating for a door company.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.220
And I got a job working
in the automotive industry

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.620
as an estimator.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.970
Nothing grand,
nothing fantastic.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.030
And I'd been in the job two
weeks when the manager--

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.150
god bless him-- came out.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.960
He said, I've got some
good news and bad news.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.010
And I went, Arthur, what is it?

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.900
He said, I know you've
only been here two weeks,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.830
but we're closing
down the department.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.140
And we're moving
it to South Wales.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.740
Now I don't know if
you know England,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.500
but South Wales is a
fair distance away.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.990
And whilst I loved
Welsh people, I

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.300
didn't fancy working in Cwmbran,
which I had read a lot about.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.630
So I said, well, Arthur, really,
I'm not ready to do that.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.256
I was 23, 24.

00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:36.380
He said, well, don't worry.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.960
He says, you work
for the Lucas group--

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.570
big group as it was at the time.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.550
He says, we'll find
another job for you.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.130
So every morning he came in
with this big pile of jobs.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.450
And he calls-- those who
agreed not to go to South Wales

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.290
were going to be found
another job within the group.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.760
And he came with
his pile of jobs.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.362
Literally, like a stack
of papers like this,

00:06:01.362 --> 00:06:02.070
thumbing through.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.610
And he called me
and he said, Paul, I

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.650
have got the job for you.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.900
And I says, have you?

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.760
And he said, no, no.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.560
I have.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.510
I've got the job for you.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.500
He said, and it's here.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.230
And he placed it on
the side of the table.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.760
And he put his
hand on the others.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.850
Before anything
else, he said, I want

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.620
you to go for the
interview for this one.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.600
And I said, what is it, Arthur?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.000
He said, press and
public relations

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.050
officer for Lucas group.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.125
How does that sound?

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:35.420
I've got no idea what
you're talking about.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.350
No idea.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.680
I hadn't heard what press
and PR was all about.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.764
And I said, look, can you
just show me the others.

00:06:41.764 --> 00:06:42.721
He says, no, I'm sorry.

00:06:42.721 --> 00:06:44.770
He says, this is the one
you're going to go for.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.540
If you don't get this job, he
said, I'll show you the others.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.120
So I agreed.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.060
But what he did, he
saw something in me.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.200
Because obviously,
he could see I could

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.670
write, as you can as well.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.280
And he saw something in
me that pushed me forward.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.240
And I went to that interview.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.170
And it started a 25-year
career in PR for me.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.010
Now, I call that
divine intervention.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.440
I hadn't chosen my career path.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.350
I was searching for where
I was going forward.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.900
But I had opened myself
up to opportunity,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.450
and that's the key thing.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.030
So 25 years in PR.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.440
I got married, I got
divorced, I had a son.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.760
Led a pretty normal life.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.820
I didn't have any
major disasters.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:42.140
I did set up my own
business in the PR side.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.851
And then my big moment came.

00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:45.350
I remember.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.310
I remember very well.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.750
And I'm going to talk to
you about emotion today.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.750
The whole business went.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.390
It was in the crash in the 90s.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.300
And I realized at
the point I'd lost

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.050
track of keeping my eye on it.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.870
I got a partner who was
active in the business,

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.400
and we just got it so wrong.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.210
We were the fastest
growing marketing and PR

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.670
company in the Midlands area.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.770
And we just lost it.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:20.030
We went from four
people to 30 people

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.360
in the space of 18 months.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.180
Too fast.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.070
And I remember handing
him the keys to my car,

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.410
getting on the train to go home.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.890
I was living in
Litchfield at the time.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.120
And I was finished.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.260
I was absolutely finished.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.270
The only thing
that kept me going

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:42.010
was at the time my
partner, and my son.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:50.110
If anything else, I could have
done something seriously wrong.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.160
By luck, I got introduced
to Tony Robbins.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.790
So I remember I got 300
pounds to buy a computer

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.500
to get myself set up properly.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.030
And I ended up buying a ticket
to go and see Tony Robbins.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.380
The sales guy was brilliant.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.150
And I hadn't really
checked him out.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.860
I'd seen an ad in Richard
Branson's "Virgin" magazine

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.440
when I was traveling
down to see a friend.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.100
And it was black and white.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.160
It was terrible.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.610
So I rang him up and
said, your ads are awful.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.130
I can help you with that.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.884
And then he sold me a ticket to
see Tony Robbins-- my last 300.

00:09:32.884 --> 00:09:35.924
And I walked in there
not really knowing much.

00:09:35.924 --> 00:09:36.590
And I walked in.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.530
I got my pack.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:45.770
There are 5,000 people in the
center in Docklands in London--

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.220
the ExCeL Center.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.310
And I walked in--

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.432
it was a Thursday afternoon--
and they're all there,

00:09:51.432 --> 00:09:53.390
[INAUDIBLE] large and dancing.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.520
And I walked in.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.192
And I went, oh my God,
it's a religious cult.

00:09:58.192 --> 00:09:59.150
I could not believe it.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.816
And there was a group
of us at the back,

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:02.880
sitting at the back
like this going,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.120
oh my God, these
people are mental.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.060
Absolutely mental.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.350
And then a big build-up.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.910
Big screens,
everything, you know?

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.950
It was just like a rock show.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.450
And in he comes.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.450
And he comes out.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.835
Does anybody know Tony Robbins?

00:10:15.835 --> 00:10:16.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:16.900
PAUL HODSON: Yeah?

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.250
You're all familiar with him.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.694
If not, he's one of the
world's best life coaches.

00:10:21.694 --> 00:10:22.360
And he comes on.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.510
He's about six foot, 28.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.810
He's a big guy, and he
comes on-- these big hands.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.690
"Hi, my name's Tony Robbins."

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.120
And I went, shit, he's American.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:39.420
Not only is it a religious
cult, but he's American.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.760
And he's taken all my money.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.970
Listen.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.810
Within five minutes I could
see he was talking from here.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.070
Not here.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.620
And he said, anybody
who's new here today--

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.604
"Anybody new here
today?" he said.

00:10:52.604 --> 00:10:53.770
We're all at the back there.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.210
"We are."

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.430
He said, "At any point
during this weekend,

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:04.150
if it's not right for you,
then please," he said,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.074
"go to the Administration
desk, and give your pack back,

00:11:08.074 --> 00:11:09.490
and we'll give you
a full refund."

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.500
And that put my mind to rest.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.420
So the first night
was the fire walk.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.170
I wasn't doing that, by the way.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.742
So the fire walk.

00:11:18.742 --> 00:11:22.390
I think it was 7,000 or
8,000 people at our gig,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.570
the fire walk 11 o'
clock at night in the car

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.280
park of the ExCeL Center.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.160
He's got everybody psyched up.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.220
Jungle drums playing.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.355
We will take our
shoes and socks off.

00:11:33.355 --> 00:11:35.140
And I felt, I might
give this a go.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.880
And as you walk out
into the car park

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:46.390
it's aglow with hot coals,
and ambulances, and firemen,

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.280
which didn't help.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.560
And he gets you in a state,
and you're in that stage,

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.720
and you go, cool moss, cool
moss, cool moss, and you do it.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.990
And guess what?

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.590
Not one burnt foot.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.930
And it showed me the power
that we have within ourselves.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.670
The power that we
have within ourselves

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.680
to do anything, really.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.580
I mean, with sensible,
but anything,

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.060
really, that we can do
to achieve what we want.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.630
So I come out there, saved me.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.326
Absolutely saved me.

00:12:21.326 --> 00:12:22.450
I was on a downward spiral.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:32.190
One of the things that I did,
and I was working on me--

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:38.100
searching to be the best
person that I'd ever met--

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.490
was that I got--

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.490
I was never really abused, or
anything like that as a child.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.230
But I did have
some scary moments.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.710
I remember being on the
beach in Cliftonville,

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.970
in Margate, east of England
at a very young age.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.310
Being sat in a rubber ring
that my dad had put me in

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.365
and pushed me out to sea.

00:12:57.365 --> 00:12:59.490
I don't know whether he
was trying to get rid of me

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.580
then or later.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.630
But I had a moment.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.790
It was between the
age of six and eight.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.140
And the thing turned over.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.830
But because I sat in it
so deeply I was stuck,

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.280
and I was drowning.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.160
I had that moment.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.480
I don't know if anyone's
had that moment where

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.660
they might have drowned.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.240
But I was stuck in
that rubber ring,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.120
and everything slowed down.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:32.520
And I had taken in water, and
it was a most unreal experience.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.880
It was scary, but it was
kind of surreal as well.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.920
And then my dad came and
lifted me out, rescued me.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:46.610
And what I find with
that is whatever moments

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.140
you've had in your
life associated--

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.230
that your subconscious
works very well.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.380
And it will repeat the
emotions attached to things

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.860
that happened in your life.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:02.850
Subconscious doesn't know
whether it's real or a replay.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.050
So you get to the--

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.360
Has anyone got a favorite song
that brings back a memory?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.140
And when you play that song
you get the same emotion.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.420
You get that feeling.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.580
It could be something--
could be a loved one,

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.380
could be when you
first time you met

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.960
your partner, the
first time you kissed.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.580
Whatever it was, that
emotion is attached

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.560
to you and your subconscious.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.420
And what it does,
it pushes it forward

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.200
into the conscious
mind, and you relive it.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.840
This is what happens
to a lot of people.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:45.730
So moving forward, I got my
PR consultancy on the way.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.490
I went to see him again.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.590
Because you can't take in four
days everything in that Robbins

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.750
teaches you.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.880
So I went there
again, and out of it,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.710
on the last day was the
Nutrition and Fitness

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.940
Day, which I hadn't
really paid much attention

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.475
to the first time I went.

00:15:01.475 --> 00:15:05.610
And I came out of there,
and for the first time

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.670
I joined the gym.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.535
I wasn't fit at the time.

00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:09.495
I'm not fit now.

00:15:09.495 --> 00:15:13.060
But I wasn't as fit as
I am now at the time.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.040
So I joined a gym, and
I picked up some work

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.060
with a company called Fitness
First doing some evening

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.707
work on member services.

00:15:22.707 --> 00:15:25.290
Ringing people up and going, why
aren't you coming to the gym?

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.750
We love you and miss you.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.340
Because I'm not
coming to the gym.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.960
I didn't realize I was a member.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.553
Can you cancel my membership?

00:15:32.553 --> 00:15:33.460
Goodbye.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.070
You know those calls.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.570
So after a period of
time, the manager left.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.530
I was working at home.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.820
Single, just me, working
alone, doing my stuff.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.630
It was OK.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.100
I wasn't complaining.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.580
And they said, would you like to
be general manager of this gym?

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.061
We like what you've done so far.

00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:54.060
So I took that on board.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.150
And that's how I
then spent my next 15

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.930
years in the gym business.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.510
I moved from--

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.340
I was living in
Coventry at the time.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.770
Then to Dublin, to run
a gym based in Dublin 6.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.640
At the time LA Fitness,
now the Dartry Health Club.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.360
Great club.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.170
And great people.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.540
And I loved the members.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.540
I'm a people person.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.490
I just absolutely loved
the stories, the journeys,

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.340
that people were having.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.000
So it was kind of like a great--

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.990
if you like-- experience
for me to be in Dublin.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.985
I came.

00:16:37.985 --> 00:16:41.310
I met the girl of
my dreams, finally.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.660
Lovely Mags.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.360
I inherited three
teenage daughters.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.980
That was scary.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.740
Still is.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.680
They're all grown up now.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.560
My own son, his life
has moved forward,

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.130
so he's now a head chef
in Lemington in England.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.590
So life changed for me.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.490
Dublin was the--

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:08.579
Dublin was the first
real opportunity for me

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.819
to come and get a
grip, and really

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:16.859
get excited about the future of
my life, even at the age I was.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:22.410
I felt-- I was never confident
that my life was going

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.810
to turn out to be anything.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:25.800
And I was so wrong.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.390
I was so, so wrong.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.910
And we're going to
cover today the reason--

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.320
what held me back.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.960
And it's the reason that holds
so many other people back.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.530
So for me it's been a
great learning process.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.910
I've done my coaching training.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.610
The one thing I embraced very,
very full on-- was passionate

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.360
about--

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.810
the one thing that held me
back will be negatively.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.700
So it kind of ended up for me
like a bit of an awakening.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.250
The great thing that I
learned during that time--

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.000
and I want to thank you all--

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.570
is Google opened
the world to me.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.380
I set up--

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.940
I took a settlement
from the gym.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.890
And I decided that I'm
going to be a life coach.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:25.030
But the settlement was generous,
so for the first six months

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.210
Google was my best friend.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.720
Now what you've done, Google,
is you have let some people out

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.940
of the asylum.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.650
Because I learned in that
time that the Earth is flat,

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:43.020
aliens do live on
the moon and Mars.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.450
There are so many
things out there

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.610
that I was being-- the
rabbit hole is incredible.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.630
And it just shows you that you
have to be very careful what

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.600
you observe.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.520
So I did.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.350
I got myself back on track.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.270
I learned and connected
with a lot of great people.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.040
Life coaching is
one of the biggest,

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.810
fastest growing businesses,
certainly in the States.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.940
And it's the area that I
feel very passionate about.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:16.950
And I started, and I was--
yesterday I had my hair cut.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:23.250
And it's my first
ever client who

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.340
was looking to change,
and move herself forward.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.360
And this is what I
love about coaching.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.820
She only ever had a dream
of having a hair salon.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.630
Only a dream.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.810
And all of the self-doubts,
all of the restrictions,

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.320
all of her disbelief that
it could happen to her,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.280
we managed to get through that.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.660
And she opened a small--

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.600
with her partner-- a
small salon in Smithfield.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.050
And it's called Hair Cafe Salon.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:56.130
And yesterday I had the
pleasure of going over

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.640
there to their new salon, which
is just a couple hundred yards

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.570
away--

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.880
five times the size of the
small one that they've got.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:10.020
And she came up to me and
said, "Paul, do you remember

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.650
when I said this was a dream?

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.760
And you showed me
the path forward."

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.380
And gave me the biggest--

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.140
I'm sorry-- gave me
the biggest hug ever.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.970
It was so beautiful.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.730
That is the satisfaction,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.260
about coaching.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.460
I don't want to
be massively rich,

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.770
but I'd like a little
bit more money, please.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.240
So I've invested a lot so far.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.830
So it's kind of like a great
reward, a great passion for me.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:47.210
What I learned in the
health club business

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:52.440
is there are a lot of people who
are physically fit but mentally

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.900
unfit.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:58.760
A lot of people that used
my gym were on the treadmill

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.010
for 15 minutes.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.280
And I'd say, you're
training for a marathon?

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:02.780
No, no.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.690
I always come and do
this, with their sad eyes.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.900
That was their life.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.220
And it showed me
that whilst fitness

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:15.890
is so very important for all
of us, there is more to it.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.850
Nutrition is so important.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.570
And your mental
fitness is affected

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.920
by both of those areas.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.580
So I decided that
my coaching approach

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.959
was A, yes, as a
life coach, but I

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:33.250
want to work with other people.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.370
I don't want to be a
singular person going, hey,

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.720
I'm Paul Hudson.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.180
And they all go,
God, He's English,

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.180
I don't want-- I want to
work with other people.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.346
And I came up with the
concept of BodyFitMind, which

00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:48.280
is going to be a collaboration.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.420
A collaboration of
like-minded people,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.630
professionals in the
nutritional area,

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.850
professionals in
the fitness area,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.060
professionals in
the coaching area.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.770
But a go-to source of
information, training,

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:04.610
online courses.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.710
So many things to
improve our lives.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.340
Now you've got
the three of them.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.800
Mental fitness, physical
function, and nutrition.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:26.540
So integrated approach
about maximizing well-being.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.780
And once one of those
is out of sync--

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.250
if you are fit--

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.900
and I know a lot of
people who were--

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:40.160
but were eating badly,
or mentally not right,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.700
then you're not well.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.660
Period.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.740
You think you're well,
but you're not well.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.070
You haven't got those--
if you take those-- three

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.310
spokes in the wheel
of life you're

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.770
not rolling forward
perfectly like you should do.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.390
And you're able to do that.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:59.872
You're all capable of
getting that right.

00:22:59.872 --> 00:23:01.080
And I hear somebody say, how?

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.455
And I'm going to
share this with.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.225
It's early days.

00:23:07.225 --> 00:23:09.100
I'm going to fall down
this hole in a minute.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.450
It's early days.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.700
It's designed to be a
collaboration of like-minded

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.420
people, self-improvement of--

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.990
a go-to resource.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.310
And what I want to be
able to do as well,

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.450
at some point when
we are succeeding,

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.740
is to give something back
to those who need it most,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.160
but who may not be
able to afford it.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.770
We have to do that.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.070
In all of us, in being the
best person you've met,

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.250
you've got to give
something back.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:44.290
Growth and contribution
are very important elements

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.690
in our lives.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.820
And I'm going to cover that
in more detail as well.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:24:00.790
I remember it was 2008.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.540
I was two years into the
health club in Dublin.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:10.660
And my assistant manager,
Lisa, who was also a fitness

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.830
professional, gave me a book--

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.780
you may well have read this book
yourself-- called "The Secret."

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.130
Has anyone read that?

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.487
Yeah?

00:24:22.487 --> 00:24:24.820
Out of interest, how many
people have read "The Secret,"

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.560
or watched the DVD?

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.728
So it's a good number of you.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:36.060
It sold 20 million
copies worldwide,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.960
and it's been translated
into 50 languages.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.910
I didn't even know
there were 30 languages.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:46.610
50 languages I'd
always been interested

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.590
in personal development,
but had failed

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:53.055
to carry the momentum
of those events forward.

00:24:53.055 --> 00:24:56.460
But you go along to
a Robbins event--

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.610
and if you can go, it's
on every year in London.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.190
Unless you want
to go to America--

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.430
there's a few on there.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.010
You get to the event,
you get out there,

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:06.510
and everybody's like-minded.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.570
You're having a great
time, and it's high fives,

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.650
and then you get back
into the real world.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.880
What happens is people go, is
he a bit tapped now or what?

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.460
You've lost your mind.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.840
Family and friends
go, calm down.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.580
What's the matter with you?

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.650
Are you OK?

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.170
What did they do to you
when you went down there?

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:35.160
And gradually, you slip back
into normality, as they see it.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.952
Not your normality.

00:25:35.952 --> 00:25:37.493
Because you're going
around to them--

00:25:37.493 --> 00:25:38.995
I went to this great event--

00:25:38.995 --> 00:25:42.060
oh, here he is again.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:48.300
What I found is the great thing
about becoming aware and awake,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.830
is spiritually--

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.960
because that comes
into it later once you

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.760
start getting up there--

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.320
spiritually, you
become two foot taller.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.250
So when you walk into a bar,
or a room, or a gathering,

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:09.820
as you look metaphorically
across the room,

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.820
you only connect with
like-minded people.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.660
Now, I'm not dismissing those
people who are not as spiritual

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.280
as you are, or connected,
or as learnt as you are.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.561
But those are the people that
you want to be connecting with.

00:26:25.561 --> 00:26:26.060
,

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.100
Because one of the things
that I had to do was

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.430
change my peer group.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.530
I had one point where even my
son went, oh, don't give me

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.405
that nonsense, Dad.

00:26:34.405 --> 00:26:36.030
I mean, he's different
now because I've

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.220
been working on him.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:42.600
But it is the people that
you are going to be around.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:48.260
And I think, as Robbins
says, the five people

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.190
that you spend most
of your time with

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.330
are the people that will
shape you for the future.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.360
Because it's their
influence on you.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.720
So be mindful of that.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.430
So I got my spark.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.470
It was amazing.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.440
And that book-- thank
you, Lisa Martin--

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.840
set me on the path.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.400
I was doing my stuff.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.750
And then what did I do?

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.385
I went and told everybody I
was going to be a life coach.

00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:17.840
Fantastic.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.720
I went, and six years
later I was still

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.060
telling people I'm going
to be a life coach.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.070
2012 came.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:26.832
I'm going to be a life coach.

00:27:26.832 --> 00:27:28.040
I'm going to be a life coach.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.000
I've just spent 5,000
quid on the course.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.810
Brilliant.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.860
Two years later, 2014,
there was the course.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.760
I'd started it.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.390
In fairness, I'd
done two modules.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.490
But I was telling everybody.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.700
And all I was doing
was talking the talk.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.370
And as Robbin says,
don't talk the talk.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.407
Walk the walk.

00:27:51.407 --> 00:27:52.490
So what was wrong with me?

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:59.810
I just went into myself.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:01.940
I didn't have the self-belief.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.070
I didn't have the commitment.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.110
I wasn't ready
for it, obviously,

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:12.570
because my journey
with me was more about

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.180
learning from my experiences.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.870
But not being the
best pupil, perhaps.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.100
So there was one
thing holding me back.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.620
This is what I Iearned.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.230
Being kinder to myself
is what I also learned.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.200
I stopped blaming
others for where I was.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.390
I was livid when I
lost my business.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.860
I blamed everybody.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.360
It was my fault. I took
my eyes off the ball.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.610
I got what I deserved, but
I can now live with that.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:50.040
And also, I was beginning to
understand how my mind worked--

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.590
the power of my emotions
and my thinking.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.940
So the one thing I realized--
being kinder to myself.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.890
I got rid of my
stinking thinking,

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:04.460
I looked deep within myself.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.610
I exercised, and
I woke up earlier.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.780
I reviewed what
food I was eating.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.000
And I practiced gratitude
on a daily basis.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.780
And that's not like
going, oh, thank you.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.770
It's just being
grateful that you've

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.740
got another sunny morning,
as we've had in Dublin

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.800
for the last three weeks.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.260
Just be grateful for the
smallest things in your life--

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.510
that you've actually
got a bed to sleep on.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.772
Be grateful.

00:29:30.772 --> 00:29:31.730
And I'll tell you what.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.780
When you're being grateful
you can't be depressed.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.240
Those two don't live together.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.655
So gratitude is a powerful lift.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.951
I haven't really read
anything for 20 years.

00:29:55.951 --> 00:29:56.450
Really.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.760
I pick a book up, I buy a
book, and I put it down.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.190
And nothing was inspiring me.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:05.232
And with "The Secret,"
that opened up

00:30:05.232 --> 00:30:07.550
a whole new world for me.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.794
So "The Secret" was a--

00:30:09.794 --> 00:30:10.710
"The Four Agreements."

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.385
Has anyone read "The
Four Agreements,"

00:30:12.385 --> 00:30:14.780
by Don Miguel Ruiz?

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:20.480
Goes back to the Toltec
civilization in South America.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.430
And it's the most amazing book.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.860
Just four agreements
that we live with.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.020
And if I can find my slide
I'll tell you what they are.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:42.000
The agreements
are life-changing,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.970
if you can embrace them.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:50.460
I have a slide on
this in a few moments.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:54.005
But I'd read books early on--

00:30:54.005 --> 00:30:57.060
"Grow Rich While You
Sleep," "As a Man Thinketh,"

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.730
which is one of
the very earliest

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:05.310
personal development
books-- goes back to 1918.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.610
"Psycho-Cybernetics,"
"The One Thing,"

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.920
"Man's Search for Meaning."

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.250
My book-- it's my
Kindle, actually.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.520
My Kindle is heavy.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.430
Probably I have
40, 50 books now.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.190
I've probably read more
books in the last 12 months

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.340
than I had in the last 20 years.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.480
Seriously.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.380
And that's where
you've got to be.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.090
You really have to be there.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.040
Because it's about your journey.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.740
So this had a real impact on me.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.200
Four simple things
to lead you forward.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.880
Be impeccable with your word.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.650
Speak with integrity.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:45.120
Saying what you mean.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.390
Avoid using the word to speak
against yourself, or to gossip

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:49.410
about others.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.500
Use the power of your word in
direction of truth and love.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.950
I'm laughing because I can know
some of you are going, no way.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.120
I love gossiping about people.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.910
Love that.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.880
It's a powerful, powerful thing.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.220
It's a powerful
discipline to have.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.080
Don't take anything personally.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.410
Usually, if someone is
giving you a bad time

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.380
it's because they are having
a bad time themselves.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.750
Really.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.820
Don't make assumptions.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.900
Don't assume.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.850
What is the
definition of assume?

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.200
Makes an ass out of you and me.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:23.830
Assume.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.070
Simple.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:29.130
So very clear and obvious, but
we do make those assumptions.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.270
And always do your best.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:34.000
Some days will be
better than others.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.480
Some days you will
be on top form.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.390
Other days you won't.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:42.630
But as long as you go home, and
you can say I've done my best,

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.670
that's fine.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:46.290
So powerful stuff.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.450
All of this stuff, all
of this information

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:52.100
is available to you.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.730
Read more.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:53.750
Exercise more.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:54.740
Learn more.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.240
Learn something new.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.190
I was speaking earlier
about Eckhart Tolle's book,

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.620
"The Power of Now,"
which is kind of

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.260
fundamental about mindfulness.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.370
So if you are into
learning something new,

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.350
look at yoga and mindfulness.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.300
Because that is such
a powerful thing

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:19.370
to get your head in the right
place, to learn and grow.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:20.670
Being in the now.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:22.760
You know when your
head's racing forward

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.290
and you're thinking back?

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.560
And all of that's
distracting you.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.490
Change your story.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.040
That's what Robbins--

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.010
I was blaming everyone.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.885
I came out of there--

00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:34.460
Robbins going,
"Change your story."

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.910
My story was I lost my
business because, you know,

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.300
he ran off with the money.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.105
And they never liked me anyway--

00:33:41.105 --> 00:33:42.230
the people who worked for--

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.365
I gave them a job.

00:33:43.365 --> 00:33:45.020
Oh, I was pathetic.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.310
I was pathetic.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.470
But change your story.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.140
Volunteer.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.510
I did a year with a
ALONE, I went and looked

00:33:53.510 --> 00:34:00.120
after a guy who was deaf
and partially sighted.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.850
And when they
coupled me with him

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.520
I went, well, how am I
going to talk to him?

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.380
I mean, he's deaf.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.239
And he won't even see me.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.920
And he was partially sighted.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.210
And we used to have a little
white board with a pen.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.800
And I'd say, hello, Michael.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.730
How are you?

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:21.170
And he'd take it off me with
his big, thick, spyglass.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:21.830
And he'd write.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.190
And that's how we
communicated for nine months.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:29.540
And you know, I got to the point
where I said to Mags one night.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.570
I said, look, Mags, I
really haven't got time

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.570
to go and see Michael anymore.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.429
And she went, are
you sure about that?

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:38.469
I went, yeah.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:39.370
I'm really busy.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:43.840
She said, you spend one
hour a week with him.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:50.092
She said, his week is when
you arrive to see him.

00:34:50.092 --> 00:34:51.050
That's what it's about.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.040
Think about that.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.040
So I did, and I carried on.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:00.260
And ALONE, you only look after
or connect with an older person

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.180
for 12 months.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.560
So I'm going to do it again.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.190
And do it with something else.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:06.380
But so rewarding.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.990
So rewarding.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.860
Food.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:15.120
I'm not going to give you
a super diet plan today.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.740
There are so many
things out there.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.260
But be sensible about your food.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.560
Sugar is the worst
thing, and it's

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.660
got 67 disguises when you look
at the contents on the back

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.990
of any food that you buy.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.240
Oh, there's no sugar in this.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:31.840
Fructose.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.340
What's that?

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.890
Is that-- yeah, it's sugar.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.370
Understand how
sugar is disguised,

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.610
because it's worse than heroin.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.660
You're addicted to it.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.980
It is worse.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.360
And it's killing people.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.130
And it's making them obese.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.710
And it's damaging their health.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.120
You.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:51.810
You.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.380
Look at what you're
eating, and lots more.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:01.680
I didn't become vegetarian,
but I tried a 60-day no meat

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.532
program.

00:36:02.532 --> 00:36:03.990
And it worked for
me, It was great.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.860
But I'm not saying--

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:09.330
I have probably red meat
once or twice a week.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.200
Organic, if you can get it.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.400
Same with your vegetables.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.760
Go fresh.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:19.450
Anything in a tin or a packet
might be full of preservatives.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.090
Just be mindful.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.960
You can live and
eat a better way.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.210
Get a coach.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.740
There's loads of us now.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.110
But seriously, if you want
a change in your life,

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.110
you might need someone just
to give you that direction.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.230
To be that hand of support,
to be that person that you

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.045
can share some of your
deepest fears with,

00:36:40.045 --> 00:36:42.480
without being judged.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.630
To help you through what
might be a challenge.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:51.330
To give you that courage to
step out onto a fire walk.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.280
All of that is available
to you, but find a coach.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:55.920
OK.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.090
Very quick interlude.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.420
I can see that we're all
kind of rearing to go.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:04.590
I'm going to just
give you some of the--

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:08.110
I'm very visually
empowered, so I

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:13.560
like to have a lot of
things that influence me.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.482
So you can do that.

00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:16.440
And I just wanted to
share some stuff with you.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.070
All of these are on my
Instagram page, by the way.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.960
BodyFitMind Instagram.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.810
So these are some of the
things that have inspired me,

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.909
or I've heard, or
I created myself.

00:37:30.909 --> 00:37:32.700
Somebody is always
doing what somebody else

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.616
said couldn't be done.

00:37:33.616 --> 00:37:35.400
How true is that?

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.650
How true is that?

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:40.800
You hear the story about
Colonel Sanders and KFC.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.740
1,000 stops he made.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.550
Thousands.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.110
He traveled the country.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:49.650
You've traveled America with
this recipe for chicken.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.810
1,000 nos he got.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.390
1,000-plus nos.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.050
And he was my age.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.200
He was in his 60s.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.410
But he never gave up.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.370
He never gave up.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:04.630
"The perfect day.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:08.560
Going to bed with a dream,
and waking up with a purpose."

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.530
How powerful is that?

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.490
I love that one.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.110
This is very powerful as well.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.720
"With this journey,
find, becoming,

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.970
and meeting the better
person that's within you.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.790
When you love yourself enough
you begin to see your purpose,

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.700
and you can gently wean
yourself off distractions."

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.590
This is very close
to me as well.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:37.540
We all know people who may
suffer with eating disorders--

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.220
I do.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:45.970
Or addictions, who know that
they're damaging their bodies.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.980
This is a quote by E.E Cummings.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:52.360
"And I said to my body softly,
'I want to be your friend.'

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.600
It took a long
breath and replied,

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.162
'I've been waiting my whole
life for this.'" How powerful is

00:38:59.162 --> 00:38:59.661
that?

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.120
That's me in a
couple years time.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.185
Stretch the wrinkles.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.120
"Searching for happiness?"

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.940
Everybody is searching
for happiness.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:17.450
The tools that you need to find
that happiness are within you.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.500
Be more helpful.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.340
Be more grateful.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.330
Be kinder.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:21.380
Share more.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.190
And love more.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.860
"How you feel in
the morning is going

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.150
to determine the
rest of your day."

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:35.300
Now I bought into the idea--

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.680
my most creative time.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.155
Some people are morning
people, some people

00:39:39.155 --> 00:39:42.560
are afternoon people, some
people are evening people.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.530
That's BS.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.120
I was an afternoon
person, because I

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.829
lay in bed for the first
four hours of the day.

00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:52.370
I'm going to be
great this afternoon,

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:53.870
but I'm not a morning
person anyway.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.830
The best time, your
most creative time,

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.470
is when you wake up.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.660
The first two hours of your day.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.460
The discipline that
you need to be doing--

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.900
don't-- I'm guilty myself.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.090
You wake up, and
you're like this.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.040
Morning, love.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.220
I'm just going through this.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.100
I've got a message.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.480
Everybody's doing it.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.856
Don't turn your phone on.

00:40:22.856 --> 00:40:25.730
Go and sit yourself
outside if you can.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:26.330
Have a coffee.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.330
Embrace what's around you.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.340
One of the things
that we've done--

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.040
my partner and I--

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.050
and that's why we're so
happy to see the dog here--

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:39.710
in order for us to move
forward we sat down,

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.944
and we said, what do we want
to do that we can do together.

00:40:42.944 --> 00:40:44.360
And we listed
everything we liked.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.870
And we liked dogs.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.530
And last year we launched
Naturally Barking Mad.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:52.730
Doggie Daycare.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:53.390
Dog walking.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.490
A few dogs here.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:57.050
It's unbelievable.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:02.330
People think more about their
dogs than they do themselves.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:08.420
And through that-- it's a
bit tough at the moment,

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:13.490
because dogs obviously
don't know the time.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:19.880
So when they see that
it's light they bark.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.630
So June the 21st being the
longest day of the year,

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:28.100
at 4:30 we're up, because
the dogs need to go outside.

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.570
We have two dogs of our own.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:30.980
They need to be fed.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.980
And it's dark at 11 o'clock.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.270
So we [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.010
We've had some long, long days.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.950
But it's brilliant,
because we love dogs.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:42.230
And this is how I
came here today.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:46.230
Through Leanne,
looking after her dog.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.480
There he is.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.620
One of my favorites.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.000
Todd.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.890
Absolutely gorgeous, man.

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:56.120
He's got attitude, but
I love him to bits.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:02.220
So we looked beyond what we
thought were our capabilities.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.770
And just by doing that,
just by me looking in,

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:07.850
with Mags looking in,
we found something

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.620
that really excited us.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.950
And we haven't looked
back, really, on that.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:18.450
So-- sorry about this.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:27.730
One of the things I learned
on my Robbins training

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.320
is these are the six
human needs that we

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.300
will have as human beings.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.520
Everyone.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:45.460
And usually two of these are
driving forward in your life.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.160
Mine was-- and it
changes as you grow.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.690
So there is a test.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.830
And if anyone wants to do
a test please contact me,

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:57.520
and I'm more than happy
to give you a free--

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.810
it's not like a tarot card
reading or anything like that.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:05.000
A free analysis that you
can use to direct yourself.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.820
Certainty.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:07.990
Certainty.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.280
That's the first need.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.200
There are four needs that
are important in terms

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.060
of human needs.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.110
Concept.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:20.829
But growth and contribution are
a little bit more spiritual.

00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:21.370
So certainty.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.660
We all need to have certainty.

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.880
We all need to know that
when you go home tonight

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.290
you've got a house to live in.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:28.480
Got all that.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.092
But also, we need variety.

00:43:30.092 --> 00:43:31.300
Because if you were certain--

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.600
you need some
variety in your life.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.200
Significance.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.727
And people can use these both
positively and negatively.

00:43:40.727 --> 00:43:41.560
Love and connection.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.780
We all need that
love and connection.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.180
If a baby is born, and is
disconnected from its mother,

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.340
and left alone, it will die.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.860
It needs that physical
contact to thrive.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.160
Growth.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.450
Big one for me.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.370
We've got to be growing
all of the time.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:01.180
If we're not
growing we're dying.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.200
And contribution.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.620
At some point in time,
give something back.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.182
I see people--

00:44:08.182 --> 00:44:09.640
We've got a lot of
homeless people,

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.940
but I see people, regularly,
helping people out

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:13.900
on the streets.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.680
It's sad that they're
in that situation.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.160
If I could help and change
that I would do that.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.800
We all need to think
hard about that.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.660
I know that they've
got problems.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:28.630
But if I give that guy a coffee,
and I do, or a two euro piece.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:31.400
People will go
and be judgmental.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.496
He's going to buy drugs
with that, What if he's

00:44:34.496 --> 00:44:35.620
going to buy drugs with it?

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.120
I'm sorry.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.610
I'm not feeding his habit,
but I'm trying to help him.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.110
Don't judge people.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:42.130
Just help them.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:43.240
Give them some help.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.310
And sometimes don't
give them money.

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:46.480
Give them food.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.070
Give them something to drink.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:51.170
So growth and contribution.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:52.420
Those are the six human needs.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.790
There's a whole
presentation, and I'm not

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.480
going to keep you too
much longer on that.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.620
So I can do that for you.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.540
If anyone is interested,
please contact me.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.239
I'd be honored to share
the information with you.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:12.750
So the one thing.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:13.570
Any ideas?

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:16.570
What is the one thing that
holds most people back?

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.640
The one thing?

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.205
Sorry?

00:45:18.205 --> 00:45:18.705
AUDIENCE: Fear.

00:45:18.705 --> 00:45:19.454
PAUL HODSON: Fear.

00:45:19.454 --> 00:45:20.360
Yeah.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.216
Anything else?

00:45:21.216 --> 00:45:22.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:22.881
PAUL HODSON: Sorry?

00:45:22.881 --> 00:45:24.481
AUDIENCE: Doubt.

00:45:24.481 --> 00:45:24.980
Doubt.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:25.880
Self-doubt.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.070
PAUL HODSON: Self-doubt.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:28.510
Yeah.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.908
Anything else?

00:45:30.908 --> 00:45:32.680
AUDIENCE: Other
people sometimes.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.020
PAUL HODSON: Sorry?

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.436
AUDIENCE: There's things that
other people may [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:35.436 --> 00:45:36.860
PAUL HODSON: So being judged?

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:37.443
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:37.443 --> 00:45:38.410
PAUL HODSON: Yeah, OK.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.200
Those are all collective
items, and they are all

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:45.020
very, very, very significant.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.990
But this is the
simplest thing of all.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:48.180
This is the one thing.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.140
When I got my head
around it, I didn't

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.180
realize that this was me.

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.960
When I got my head
around it I thought,

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.430
how can I be like
this for so long?

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.940
How could I have been
like this for so long?

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.580
Procrastination.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.000
It's such a simple thing.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.610
Everybody does it.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:08.080
You have your to-do list.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.910
You build the barriers .

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:13.750
You don't get off your
backside and do the things

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:15.420
that you need to do.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.210
You're scared to do the
things you need to do.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.620
You dislike-- you're bored
with the things you need to do.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.060
And it's easily,
easily resolved.

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:29.280
Because once you get that
right, and you take action,

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.410
your life changes.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:33.820
Your life will change.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.250
I was the world's worst.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:41.700
My training to be a coach,
I thought about it in 2008.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:47.670
And I didn't become a
coach until 2015, '16.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.410
Those were the things.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:53.790
Purely for no other reason
than procrastination.

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:55.180
No other reason.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.780
I didn't do what was necessary
to do what I needed to do.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.760
So in doing that, by taking
action, by having a plan--

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.360
and yes, I know
it's a sales pitch--

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.160
I've written a book.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.450
And it's my first book.

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:15.600
And it's the first book in
the series of other books

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.272
I'm working on.

00:47:16.272 --> 00:47:17.730
And I'm trying not
to procrastinate

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.700
to write the second, but
I have a title for it.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.620
And it's just about
getting that done.

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:27.840
And I've read-- and if
you do Amazon search

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.120
there's loads of books
on procrastination.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.000
There's science on
procrastination.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.010
There's people trying to
understand what procrastination

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.362
is all about.

00:47:36.362 --> 00:47:39.610
It's-- just do it.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.720
Just be active.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.120
Get to do what you need to do.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.370
Five steps.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:52.280
Stop the distraction
and get a grip.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.260
Do the one thing.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.830
There's a great book on that.

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:57.240
Do the one thing.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.710
Don't try and multitask.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.320
We cannot multi-- we
think we can multitask,

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.720
but we can only do
one thing at a time.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.270
Get organized.

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:08.920
Get organized.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.400
I now have a diary.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.120
A paper diary.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.745
Does anyone keep a journal?

00:48:17.745 --> 00:48:19.110
No.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.290
No one keeps a journal.

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:24.200
Some of the greatest minds
in the world keep a journal.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.830
This is your journey
with yourself.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:28.690
Do this every day.

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.100
Get yourself a book.

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.880
And don't go, ugh, I really
hated my hair this morning,

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.380
and I feel so fat.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.670
I can't-- No, no.

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:38.140
It's not designed for that.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.310
Keep it positive.

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:41.890
Capture all your memories.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.860
And as they build
up, you'll be amazed

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.850
how many great ideas you've
had that you forgot about.

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.010
And do what you need to do.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.590
So focus.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:57.580
Focus is the one thing
that really worked for me.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.280
Once I found-- some used to
say, Paul, you're not focused,

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.890
and I get really negative.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:03.130
They were right.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:04.840
I get really negative.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.140
Focus is the one great
thing that we all

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.870
need to explore and find.

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.680
Don't go back.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.280
Once you've mastered
procrastination don't go back.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:16.780
OK.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.900
So energy.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.820
Brain scientists can
measure energy levels

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.460
in key areas of our body now.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:28.330
There's a Ted talk by
Dr. Wendy Suzuki who's

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:31.720
a neuroscientist,
who shows, and can

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.540
measure the power of exercise.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.760
And all those great
things it releases

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.510
in the chemistry of our brains.

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:43.330
Measurements, electrically
within our brains.

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:46.420
The very skin that
we have, it wasn't

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.700
the skin we had 12 months ago.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.720
Every cell in our body
is being replaced.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.380
So the you that sits
here now is not the you

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.290
that was here last year.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:02.150
Don't worry about that too much.

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:04.040
So thoughts and energy.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:04.970
Jodi Spencer.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.670
Dr. Jodi Spencer
talks about the quan--

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:10.100
I know it's a little
bit woo, but he

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:14.030
talks about the quantum
field, where what we think

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:16.130
is what we attract.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.950
That is so-- that so works.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.470
Our vision board at home--

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:23.240
vision boards are good as well--

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.980
it's got dogs on it.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.960
When we first did
it 18 months ago--

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.880
doggie business.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.470
And I said, Mags, take it down.

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:33.410
We have enough
dogs to look after.

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:34.190
It works.

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.980
Believe that it works.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.840
And our subconscious
runs in the background

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.510
but drives our experience,
and forms our habits.

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:47.510
It's not conscious of what is
real, or what is not real--

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.400
whether it's a memory
or it's happening now.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.420
It still stirs up the
same emotions within you.

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.240
I think you've had
enough of me talking.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.780
I'm going to show you how the
energy works in your body.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.112
I want you all to stand up.

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:07.400
Find a little bit of space.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.190
Put down your stuff, obviously.

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:14.050
I'm going to show you
a two-minute exercise.

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:16.095
Here's the runners.

00:51:16.095 --> 00:51:18.620
I want to show you
in two minutes,

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:25.950
and demonstrate to you, just
how energized your body is.

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:29.900
Now you're going to have
to bear with me on this.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.070
All you've got to do--

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:36.410
and watch me-- is I want
you to bounce like this.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:40.040
And I want you to really
shake those hands.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.920
So we've actually got
some really good momentum.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.844
Are you good with that?

00:51:44.844 --> 00:51:46.760
I know there's a few
wobbly bits going around,

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.885
but don't worry about that.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:51.320
Are you ready?

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.158
Two minutes.

00:51:53.158 --> 00:51:55.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.500
PAUL HODSON: If I
can get this started.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:58.860
There's a timer here.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.441
Can you get that to start?

00:52:01.441 --> 00:52:01.940
Ah.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:02.856
Didn't move the mouse.

00:52:02.856 --> 00:52:03.980
OK, here we go.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:04.490
Here we go.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:06.800
Two minutes of this now.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.450
You grunt.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:09.840
We've already gone 10 seconds.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.380
Look.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.150
Keep that going.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.970
Keep that energy going.

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:15.320
Bounce.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.880
I can feel the floor moving.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:17.700
It's brilliant.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:22.400
Our combined weight brought
down the Google building.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.400
So just keep that going.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:29.030
And just bounce, and
feel those legs moving.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:32.390
If you want to jump up a bit you
can, but don't hang your head

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:33.920
on the TV there.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.140
So we've got--
and this is what--

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.460
all of this energy is
going through your body.

00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:44.000
And at the end of
this, you're going

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.430
to be so amazed, because we got
this shared electrical energy

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:50.750
going through.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:52.650
Really [INAUDIBLE] now.

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:53.660
OK, good.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.510
Good, I like that handshake.

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:56.750
We're nearly a minute in.

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:58.020
Come on.

00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.910
Let's stay with it.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:00.410
OK.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.850
You can have a drink afterwards.

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:04.890
You can lie down
afterwards if you want.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:05.960
So let's keep that going.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.640
Those shaky hands.

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.706
Those wobbly bits.

00:53:09.706 --> 00:53:11.330
Can you feel your
calves tightening up?

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:11.829
I can.

00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:12.470
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:13.340
PAUL HODSON: Yeah?

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.910
OK.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:17.870
If you're feeling a little
bit hard on the legs just

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:19.270
do the upper body.

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:20.580
Keep that going.

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.750
42 seconds in.

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:24.650
OK.

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:25.253
Are we good?

00:53:25.253 --> 00:53:28.094
Anybody tired yet?

00:53:28.094 --> 00:53:29.050
Two minutes.

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:30.350
This is killing me.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:31.550
Oh, my God.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:33.080
30 seconds.

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.580
Counting down.

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:35.160
OK.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.170
Are we ready?

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:40.280
This is an exercise you can do
every morning when you wake up.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.999
Obviously not naked, because
that could damage you.

00:53:43.999 --> 00:53:45.300
So we've got it.

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.210
We're moving.

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:47.680
16.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.210
OK.

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.150
Nearly there guys.

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:51.680
Two minutes of this.

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.570
Seems so long, doesn't it?

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:54.735
Since we started this.

00:53:54.735 --> 00:53:55.235
Yeah?

00:53:55.235 --> 00:53:55.818
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:55.818 --> 00:53:56.810
PAUL HODSON: OK.

00:53:56.810 --> 00:54:01.039
And you've not really done
much, except shake around a bit.

00:54:01.039 --> 00:54:01.580
There you go.

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:02.500
Now stop.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.120
Stop.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.800
Stop.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:05.480
OK.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.510
Now put your arms out.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:11.017
Can you feel that tingle?

00:54:11.017 --> 00:54:11.600
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.380
PAUL HODSON: Can you feel
the tingling in your body?

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.777
Anybody?

00:54:16.777 --> 00:54:17.360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.530
PAUL HODSON: Yeah?

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:21.410
That is energy that
you've just released

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:25.610
by moving around, rushing
through every cell

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:26.210
in your body.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:27.740
Look at that.

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:30.000
That is so simple.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.650
If you ever feel tired
do that for two minutes.

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:36.140
But try and do that
every morning if you can.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.328
Thank you.

00:54:37.328 --> 00:54:38.284
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:38.284 --> 00:54:40.674
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:40.674 --> 00:54:41.960
PAUL HODSON: OK.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.300
We're nearly done.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.000
Hang on.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:44.840
We're nearly done.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.930
I have one-- four
minutes of your time,

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:51.480
to share something with you
that I saw the other day.

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.960
And it's just a bit of
a motivational speech.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.471
So please, bear with me.

00:54:57.471 --> 00:54:57.970
Hang on.

00:54:57.970 --> 00:54:59.094
I'm doing this wrong again.

00:54:59.094 --> 00:55:00.041
Oh, no.

00:55:00.041 --> 00:55:02.961
There we go.

00:55:02.961 --> 00:55:03.460
OK.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:11.090
Oh, it's an ad.

00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:11.270
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:13.235
- So many of you are
looking for fulfilment--

00:55:13.235 --> 00:55:13.505
PAUL HODSON: Any volume?

00:55:14.005 --> 00:55:16.660
- --where it can never be found.

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:22.950
You were looking for fulfilment
in things, possessions, money,

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.040
recognition.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:29.180
You're looking for fulfillment
in another person, praise

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.590
from a parent, love
from another person,

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:33.600
a "well done" from the world.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.797
But here's the problem.

00:55:34.797 --> 00:55:38.150
You can never find
it outside of you.

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:40.920
It can only be found within you.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:44.890
All the happiness and joy
you could ever hope for,

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:49.300
and more, it is within you now.

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.930
- The truth is we don't
need all those other things

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.550
to complete our life.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.560
We don't need anything
outside ourselves

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.670
to be happy right now.

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:59.770
Think back to a
time in your life

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.862
you didn't have those
things you seek.

00:56:01.862 --> 00:56:03.310
You were still happy.

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:07.490
Perhaps when you were a child,
perhaps not too long ago.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:10.420
The reason why you were
happy without those things

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:13.045
is down to what you
chose to focus on.

00:56:13.045 --> 00:56:16.220
And your focus wasn't
on what was not there.

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.000
It was on what was there.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.890
And happiness is
always there if you

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:24.740
choose to focus on finding it.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.410
We tend to always look for
happiness outside ourselves,

00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:31.830
but we all know that it
doesn't come from there.

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:37.364
Whatever we perceive as
reality becomes our reality.

00:56:37.364 --> 00:56:40.560
If you listen to the world,
and the opinions of others,

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:43.170
you will come to believe
that happiness is only

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:46.570
gained once you make money,
or get that nice car,

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:47.630
that great house.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.120
Why do we want
those things anyway?

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.680
Why do we want the car,
the house, the money,

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.840
that perfect person?

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.270
All of it, without
exception, we want

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:04.510
because we believe getting
it will make us better.

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:07.699
We believe it will make us feel
better, make us feel happier.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:16.860
- Don't get dragged into
the expectations of society.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:21.084
You don't need things like
that to be happy and complete.

00:57:21.084 --> 00:57:24.020
What you need is
always within you.

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.370
It never goes away.

00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:29.375
You are complete right now.

00:57:29.375 --> 00:57:30.848
- Look within you.

00:57:30.848 --> 00:57:33.794
Feel the truth that is.

00:57:33.794 --> 00:57:38.213
You can decide to
be happy right now.

00:57:38.213 --> 00:57:40.177
- Find something
to be grateful for.

00:57:40.177 --> 00:57:42.632
Choose to lift others up.

00:57:42.632 --> 00:57:46.070
Give attention,
rather than seek it.

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:48.815
Find your life purpose,
and set goals that

00:57:48.815 --> 00:57:50.630
light the spark within you.

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:52.220
Believe in yourself.

00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.585
Believe you deserve it all.

00:57:54.585 --> 00:57:56.890
Believe your life has meaning.

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.660
There is nothing you cannot
accomplish when you are free

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:05.043
from the burden of looking
for things outside of yourself

00:58:05.043 --> 00:58:06.540
to fulfil you.

00:58:10.033 --> 00:58:14.524
Just know you have the answers.

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:16.021
Trust your intuition.

00:58:16.021 --> 00:58:19.015
Trust everything will
be OK in the end.

00:58:19.015 --> 00:58:22.508
Everything will be
great in the end.

00:58:22.508 --> 00:58:26.001
Everything will be
magical in the end.

00:58:35.482 --> 00:58:37.520
[END PLAYBACK]

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.750
PAUL HODSON: That's it, guys.

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:42.260
I just want to say
one thing to you.

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:42.830
Sorry.

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:46.280
Can I just get that back
to the final screen?

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.870
I want to say thank you so much
for sharing this time with me

00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:51.810
today.

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:56.840
It's been my pleasure, and
an honor to be amongst you.

00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:00.920
You've been a great
group to talk to.

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:05.690
And it's-- that's it--

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:08.040
it's all about that journey.

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.920
It's all about your search.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.150
And I want to thank you.

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:16.340
I want to thank Leanne for
bringing the dog into my life,

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:20.000
and bringing me into
contact with the team.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.920
The team themselves
have been brilliant.

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.970
You've been the best
audience I've ever talked to.

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:27.830
Seriously.

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:31.880
I'm working hard to be the
best person I've ever met.

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.580
And I want you to do the same.

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.550
You can all do it individually.

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:41.480
We can make the world a
better place for our children.

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.560
We worry about what's happening
in the world, but individually,

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.370
one by one, we can
make a difference.

00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:53.090
And maybe we can make a
better world for our children.

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.430
And our children's children.

00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:58.010
Just by being the best
person you've ever met.

00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:59.010
Thank you very much.

00:59:59.010 --> 00:59:59.968
I'm honored to be here.

00:59:59.968 --> 01:00:03.260
[APPLAUSE]
