00:00:00.243 --> 00:00:02.704
- [Voiceover] "Which of the
following values is equal

00:00:02.704 --> 00:00:04.051
"to the value above?"

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:05.910
And we have the square root of 0.4,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.718
times the square root of 1.25.

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:11.134
Well, one, we could use
an exponent property here,

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:12.665
I guess we could call
it a radical property,

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:14.453
that if I have the square root of a,

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:16.566
times the square root of b,

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:20.258
that's going to be equal to
the square root of a times b.

00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:24.321
So, in this case, a would
be 0.4 and b would be 1.25,

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:25.482
so this is going to be the same thing

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:30.482
as the square root of 0.4 times 1.25.

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:33.609
And what is that going to be?

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.571
Well, let's see, that's going to be...

00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:40.249
Four times 1.25 would be five,

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.731
but this is 0.4 times 1.25,
so this is going to be 0.5.

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:50.211
So, this is going to be
the square root of 0.5.

00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:53.670
And if I look at the choices over here,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.316
let's see, this is the fourth root of 0.5,

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:57.803
so that's not what it's going to be.

00:00:57.803 --> 00:01:00.334
This is the square root of 1.65,

00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:01.704
so that's going to be a different value.

00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:06.186
This is 0.5, not the square
root of 0.5, this is just 1/2,

00:01:06.186 --> 00:01:08.809
but we want to get the square root of 1/2,

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:10.109
so that's not going to be that.

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.269
So, this should be the same thing

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:13.918
as the square root of 0.5.

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:15.032
Let's see if that's the case.

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:17.934
So, the square root of 0.5,

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:23.436
that's the same thing as the
square root of 1/2, 0.5 is 1/2.

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:25.783
This is the same thing as the square root

00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:27.964
of one over the square root of two.

00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:30.170
The square root of one is just one,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.306
so it's one over the square root of two.

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:33.913
And then we could do

00:01:33.913 --> 00:01:35.883
what's often called
rationalizing the denominator.

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:39.134
A lot of folks don't like
dividing by an irrational number.

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:40.967
So, we can multiply both the numerator

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.941
and the denominator by the same value,

00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:44.312
in this case square root of two,

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:46.151
and then we're gonna get
one times square root

00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:48.211
of two is square root of
two, and then square root

00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:51.510
of two times the square root
of two is going to be two.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.157
So, the square root of 0.5 is indeed equal

00:01:54.157 --> 00:01:57.104
to the square root of two over two.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:58.940
And we are done.
