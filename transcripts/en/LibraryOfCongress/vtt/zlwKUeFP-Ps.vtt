00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.780
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good
evening and welcome.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.400
I'm Anne McLean from the
library's music division.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.210
It's my great pleasure tonight
to welcome Janet Eilber,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.850 position:56%
artistic director of the Martha
Graham Center for Contemporary Dance

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.500
and choreographer and
filmmaker Pontus Lidberg.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.480 position:56%
Tonight as part of our Martha Graham

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.590
at the Library Festival we're
presenting the world premiere

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.420
performance of his Woodland
set to a score by Irving Fein,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.000
Fein's Notturno for
Harp and Strings.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.380
Thank you've both for being here.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.400
It's very, very exciting for us.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.930
Today the Washington Post has a
wonderful headline for the Library

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.180
of Congress and Martha
Graham the legacy lives on,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.550
exactly on the mark, exactly.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.490
So this is truly an
exciting moment for us.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.690 position:56%
We mark a long time partnership
with the Martha Graham Dance Company

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.350
that began over a half century ago.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.290
It began with the now
historic evening

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.270 position:56%
of three Graham ballets commissioned

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.190
by the library's Coolidge
Foundation, Appalachian Spring,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.210
Herodiade and Darius
Milhaud's Imagined Wing.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.830
Through that astonishing
exhilarating collaboration the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.530
library has established a
relationship that has continued

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.040
to grow and flourish and your
new work, a joint commission

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.630
of the library's Verna
and Irving Fein Fund

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.110
and the Martha Graham Center
is a beautiful blossoming

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.410
of this tradition.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.850
We look forward to seeing it
and you will be mounting this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.730
in New York very soon, right?

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.910
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: April 18th
will be its New York premiere

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.460
and that is actually the
company's 90th birthday.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.750
Martha Graham had her first
concert with a group of dancers,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.790
a trio of young women,
on April 18 in 1926.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.300
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: So we really
have a lot to celebrate.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.270 position:56%
We have 180 years, we're going to be
saying this throughout the evening,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.850
180 years, 90 for you
and 90 for the library

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.350
and it's an amazing serendipity so
we'll be talking about our history

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.560 position:56%
with you and about the Martha Graham
collection here at the library

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.500
which you were instrumental in
bringing and what that is about

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.570
and our shared commitment to
supporting new work plus a preview

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.970
of Pontus' new piece and
maybe a quick glance at some

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.640
of the impressive new ventures
from the Graham Company

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.330
like their new forthcoming
YouTube channel.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.310
So let's talk about how this
developed, how we got to be able

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.670
to be so fortunate as
to have this new piece.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.650
This was a discussion that took
place over three or four years

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.330
with Janet and LaRue Allen and we
were very, very excited and hopeful

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.690
when we knew you were
going to be involved

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.340
and this I know is a huge
part of your forward path

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.780
for the Graham Company's new work.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.590
I wanted to ask you Pontus
what was the experience

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.950
like of working with
the Graham Company?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.680
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: So
the Graham dancers just

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.670
like ballet dancers have
a very strong foundation

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.370
but it's not ballet it's different.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.420
They are trained equally
specifically and clearly

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.030
but in a different way and
I'm rather used to working

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.360
with ballet dancers
and these dancers came

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.330
with definitely equal amounts
of physicality and clarity

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.970
in their movement but coming
from a different place

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.430
which has informed me as
a choreographer as well

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.070
and it has definitely
informed the work.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And you studied this
technique at some point yourself.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.020
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yes, well so
I was a trained ballet dancer

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.310
but as part of my education
was various forms

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.820
of contemporary dance movement and
Graham technique was the first one

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.090 position:56%
that I was exposed to but I think
in general Graham was one of the few

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.230
who really codified a technique.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.230
Other choreographers have a
lineage or a style of training

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.200
but she actually codified
a technique

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.080
but most contemporary
training is not

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.060
like that, it's much more nebulous.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.600
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And you've also
commented on the expressivity

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.610
of this particular troupe,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.920
their facial expressions
and the whole aesthetic.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.550
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: This is also
something I very much appreciate

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.130
because the company, the
dancers have a strong confidence

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.020
in their facial expression.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.860
There are certain movements
of contemporary dance

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.280
where the face is kind
of forgotten on purpose

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.290
where the movement is supposed
to speak and you're not supposed

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.280
to emote with your face but these
dancers' faces are very alive

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.230
and I find that very
inspiring and true to people.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.410
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And that's
something that you studied,

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.480
I mean I know it's a
10-year process, right?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.780
The Graham technique, I think.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.090
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: That's what Martha
used to say that it takes 10 years

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:22.250
to make a dancer but I think what
Pontus is describing is just the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.330
element of the Graham
technique which is

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.210
that she created this vocabulary
sort of born out of body language,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.170
out of natural gesture,
because she wanted

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.700
to describe what she called the
inner landscape, the human emotions

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.510
and conditions rather than
swans and flowers and kings

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.140
and queens she was going for
what was really going on here

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.940
in the late 1920s and 30s

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.240
and the vocabulary she developed
is a combination of the core,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.740
emotion riding on the breath and
coming from the core of the body

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.000
and her famous contraction and
release which is the energizing

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.540
of the torso and it is a perfect
marriage between that physicality,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.540
the physical vocabulary, and
the emotion that it's describing

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.140
so for Graham dancers
they are really trained

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.600
to illuminate the physical movement

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.970
with an emotional image
in the classroom.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.330
It's a marriage between the two.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.450
You will see in Medea tonight

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.040
and Appalachian Spring the
dancers really have to be actors

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.780
as well as incredible athletes.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.210
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And even
just in their carriage,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.460
I mean anyone who has seen a Graham
performance the way they step

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.210
onto the stage is like actors
in a [inaudible] theater

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.240
or anything else, immediate
presence and charisma.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.300 position:56%
That's something I took away with me

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.500
from the first time I
saw a Graham performance.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.340
Thinking about the music watching
your work there's such musicality

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.010
and I know you are a musician
first, what was your instrument

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.930
and what made you choose
the path to dance?

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:13.320
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: I was trained as
a pianist as a young boy and it was

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.460
as I remember, and
I was pretty young

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.230
so I might not remember everything,
but at 10 you kind of have

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:27.230 position:56%
to choose professional training for
both music or dance and I auditioned

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:33.880
for both professional schools
that were available in Stockholm

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.000
and I was accepted into both so I
had to make a choice then and there

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.490
and the one thing I
remember is that the audition

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:47.750 position:56%
for the music classes were on a
Sunday in the winter and I was alone

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.060
with the teacher in a
room and I was singing

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.430
and I guess they were just
testing me and the audition

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.450
for the ballet school was on a
Thursday night and it was full

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.840
of people in the corridors
and in their classrooms

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.890
and on stage training
and running past

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.080
and it felt like a dynamic place.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.390
I honestly think that that was
a deciding factor [laughter].

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.730
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Interesting.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:16.020
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: And to add
to that I know many musicians

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.260
and they have a wonderful rich
life and also solace especially,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.870
a rather lonesome life sitting
by themselves practicing.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.570
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yes, or in a hotel
room touring constantly, it's true.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:34.250 position:56%
Thinking about the music for your
work, Irving Fein's lyrical Notturno

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.510 position:56%
for Harp and Strings it's very
interesting for us to see this work,

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.950
people who know the work as a
chamber piece, to see it come

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.650
into a new dimension through
your dance and this reminded me

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.420
of Janet's phrase seeing the
classics through new eyes

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.950
and I was wanting to,
I was thinking too

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.180
about how you re-envisioned
the classic ballet Raymonda.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.190
Would you like to talk
a little bit about that?

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.970
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: So
Raymonda is a work I made

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.350
for the Royal Swedish
Ballet about one

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.930 position:56%
and a half years ago was the
premier and it's a classical ballet,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:17.050
one of the classics
by Glazunov but not

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.410
that often performed
actually and it's huge.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:27.260
It's very long and very big
work and I reinvented it

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.350
by writing a new libretto because
the libretto has a lot of problems

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.810
for our contemporary times.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.870
It's very racist and it's also
kind of all over the place.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.680
It's one of those librettos
where you think,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.780 position:56%
I mean I don't exactly know but I'm
pretty sure that it was written more

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.460
to be able to showcase we want
this kind of Oriental dance here

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.760
and then we want this there,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.220
kind of like wrote their
libretto haphazardly

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.270
to suit various inspirations.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.950
But I completely rewrote it
while keeping certain elements

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.040
and it was kind of coming full
circle for me because I was trained

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:17.390
in ballet but I very early
chose to go a contemporary path.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.670
I felt like there was more
to do in contemporary dance

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.020
and definitely more to
explore but that training just

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.860
like Graham training is
something you just can't undo.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.610
I mean it's in my body
so it was interesting

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.120
to come full circle
and revisit that again.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.390
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: In the
piece with the music,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.620
with the Fein piece you
actually reordered it slightly

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.520
and made it cyclical I
think you read about -

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.100
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: So that I did
with Raymonda too by the way.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.920
I reordered it to suit the
new libretto but with this

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:00.910 position:56%
with the Notturno for Harp and
Strings I thought that I didn't want

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.160
to illustrate the work
only but I wanted

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:13.610
to somehow add a new structure
to it and so I added a repeat.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.430
I framed the work with a
fast section, the animato,

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.170
and then I reordered the two
slow sections and it kind

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.380
of almost became a
mirror or a cycle both.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.530
It kind of goes to the middle
and then it almost rewinds

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.240
but takes a different path back and
I found that that was interesting

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.940 position:56%
because it also talks to Irving Fein

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.110
which I can't do but
I can add a comment.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.930
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: It was so nice to
see in the film about your work

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.480
and about this project which you
can see in our lobby here tonight.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.720
It's so nice to see the
pictures of the composers

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.130 position:56%
that to the Graham Company has
worked with including now this music

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.630
from Irving Fein but you I guess
you found in your archives some

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.080
of those photos to bring out

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.230
and music has always been
a hugely important part

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.610
of what you do choosing
the music and so on.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.020
For us it's exciting tonight
to have a live orchestra.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.320
We try every time to
have a live orchestra

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.290
when we can possibly do it
and it sounds fantastic.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.380
It's a little challenging and we'll
get to the challenges of working

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.500
in the Coolidge in just
a minute [laugher].

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.460 position:56%
Regarding your work as a filmmaker
I wanted to ask you to touch on that

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.660
and ask you about how it affects
your vision for your choreography.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:33.080
&gt;&gt; Pontus Linberg: It's a
question I get fairly often.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.170
The first thing I would
say is that when I create

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.980
for film the option I have
which I don't have on stage is

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.210
to completely direct
the eye of the audience.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.420
I can zoom in on a
button for example

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:50.680
and that is what everyone will see
in film but when you put something

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.890
on stage you can't do
that, in fact you leave it

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:58.450 position:56%
to each individual audience member
to follow their own path so you have

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.070 position:56%
to think differently about structure

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.850
and there are very different
ways of working actually.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.670
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I was
wondering I was thinking

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:13.720
about Martha Graham's experiments
in technique and her inspiration

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.360
from the visual arts
and her statement

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.870
on seeing a Kandinsky painting

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.720
in 1926 before she
had even become known

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.570
as a choreographer in New York.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.870
She looked at the painting

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.820
and her response later was
I will dance like that.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.400
It's just an extraordinary
comment and I wanted to see Janet

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.690
if you had thoughts on the
visual arts in later Graham works

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.880
and today too how you
are working with visuals.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.080
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Well Martha
drew great inspiration

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.800
from such a variety of things.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.910
She was a voracious
reader, she loved poetry.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.380
When she saw the Kandinsky in '26

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.520
or I thought it was '23 she
was visiting the first exhibit

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.470
in America at the Chicago
Art Institute

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:06.840
of the European abstract
painters, modern painters,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:13.160
and she said she was relieved to
see the exhibit because she was

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.110
so relieved to see that there were
other people who thought the way

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.860
that she did to see
this abstract work

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.400
and the Kandinsky had
a streak of red in it.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.960 position:56%
She said she would make a dance like
that and that's our dance Diversion

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:32.380
of Angels from 1948 which is
unfortunately not in this program

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.300
but when she was choreographing
she would bring

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:43.630
in huge coffee table art books with
specific paintings or sculptures

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.050
or sometimes natural
things, leaves and trees

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.750
that she was drawing inspiration
from on whatever new work

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:56.780
that she was creating
and it was just one

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.900
of the many ways she filled herself

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.320
with inspiration before
she started to choreograph.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.130
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And she
was also very much involved

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.810
in union psychology
studying that as well, right?

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.530
Joseph Campbell and -

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.980
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Joseph Campbell
was married to one of the members

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:20.470
of her company, Jean Erdman,
yes, so that was in the '40s.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.680
Erick Hawkins who Martha married

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.810
for a short time had studied the
classics at Harvard and we think

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:33.340 position:56%
that is why the Greek period
appeared and Erick was inspiring her

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.840
and after she divorced Erick she
was [inaudible] analysis [laughter]

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.460
so she was kind of drawing
inspiration from all over the place

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.720
but the Dark Meadow suite on
tonight's program is a suite

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.740
of highlights from the much
longer work, Dark Meadow,

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.790
and Dark Meadow is considered

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.780
to be her [inaudible] piece
created while she was in analysis

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:03.600
about life's greatest
adventure, I'll quote it tonight

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.290
in our introduction,
the adventure of seeking

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.740
so it's a ballet about questioning.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:16.590
There's no dramatic narrative,
it's about life's journey.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.920
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And
this is something,

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:24.040
these areas that we're talking
about the psyche and myth of poesis

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.080
and so forth, these are very
much in the line of thinking

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.700
of Isamu Noguchi and as many of you

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.440
in the room know we've had the
pleasure of having an exploration

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.060
of the connection between Graham
and Noguchi in the past week.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.240
It's been really exciting and fun,
something very different for us,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.770
but I was thinking back to the
art again how she took Noguchi

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.710
to the I think MoMA to
look at a work there

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:54.450 position:56%
and said this is what I have in mind
and then he said okay I understand

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.910
and I don't think the book that
we were reading [inaudible]

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.220
or his biography sort of says
he didn't really want to go

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.320
to the museum or he didn't
need to go to the museum

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.910
but it just showed me how much
she was involved with this kind

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.100
of visual impetus and so on.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.170
In talking about him I really got
a kick out of reading an article

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:18.700
by you where you talked about
the challenges of working

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.030
with these Noguchi set pieces
as a dancer and I'd love it

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.980
if you would talk to
the audience about that.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.150
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Well it was
a little bit tongue in cheek

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.020
but the dancers really have to --

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.610
, they have a very intimate
relationship with these sets,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.510
Noguchi designed sets that
are totally practical.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:42.500 position:56%
We scramble all over them, we swing
off them, doors open, chairs a spin.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.440
Tonight in Medea you'll see she
climbs inside this beautiful brass

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:52.770 position:56%
bush of thorns but they don't always
act exactly as you'd like them

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:59.010
to act [laughter] and for
example in Appalachian Spring

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.190
because Noguchi used to the angles
of the house to create perspective

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:09.110
and to give such a beautiful
provocative design to the audience

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:13.290
but the rocking chair that the
pioneering woman has to sit on for

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.090
so long is about as
big as a bicycle seat,

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.980
you know it's almost
two dimensional.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.320
At one point you will see
the four followers sit

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.260
on the little bench that's up
against the wall of the house.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.420
Well that bench is only about
four inches wide and it's raked,

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.470
it's on an angle so they
really can't even perch on it

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.650
so there's all sorts of stories.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.980
In Cave of the Heart, the
big aorta that is at the back

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:45.110
of the center stage has
corners, we call it the elephant

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.090 position:56%
because it looks like an elephant on
the back with his feet sticking up,

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.520
and dancers have to step from
corner to corner and not look down

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.990
and look very self-assured as
they walk around this thing

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.030
and it takes a lot of rehearsal.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:04.310
There's a little bit of swearing
that goes on I think [laughter].

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.820
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And I wanted to,
following up on this I wanted

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.260
to ask you both about
the experience of working

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.790
in the Coolidge Auditorium,
what it's been like for you,

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.330
and I was thinking about
Noguchi's comment that he tried

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.880
to make our very small stage
which is only 19 feet deep

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:23.420
and 31 feet wide appear larger
than it is and he said I tried

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:28.930
to create a really new theater
with hallucinatory space

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.750
so we were all amazed to see how
much you Pontus and you Janet

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.720
and your dancers are able
to do with the space.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.040
How has it been for you?

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.320
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Well we taped
it out in rehearsal studio.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.980
We just arrived yesterday
so I only had an idea.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.500 position:56%
I had seen pictures and we had taped

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.210
out the measurements
so I knew it was small.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.590
I don't think it looks
that small though.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:59.090
I mean it's small but
it's also the room

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.200 position:56%
or the auditorium itself has angles,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.840
perspective that makes it
look bigger than it is.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:11.480
And I actually to be honest
I thought that first I need

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:17.010
to create the piece knowing
that it will be here of course

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:24.340
but I don't want to have in my
mind that there will be limits.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:31.780 position:56%
Rather I created things and they are
adapted to reality when needed to

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.360
but actually not much
needed to be adapted.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.160
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Well we're
adapting entrances and exits

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.120 position:56%
because in the Coolidge there's only
a downstage entrance on each side

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.820
and we're used to being able
to exit in four different wings

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.320
so you'll see sometimes dancers
sort of running along the side

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.450
and then coming in and
we did remove one couple

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.010
from the Dark Meadows suite.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.630
There are usually four on stage,
just in one section we went

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:05.330
down to three, so we've been
adjusting for the last few weeks

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.340
to make sure no one got kicked
or anything like that [laughter].

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.240
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I was
amazed to see how completely

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.760
at ease they all seemed
on our stage.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.610
That's a tribute to what you've
done to plan and so forth.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.720
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: There's also
one thing to note that part

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.620
of the Noguchi set for Appalachian
Spring does not fit on this stage.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.730
At the very center of the back

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:30.750
of the stage there is usually
a doorway framed with the beam

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:37.280 position:56%
of the house coming to it and like
Martha did at the premier that frame

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.850
of a doorway is not
present on this stage.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.430 position:56%
We are actually using the upstage
door that is built into the Coolidge

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:51.240
but that's a historic
adjustment at this point.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.510
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Today
somebody mentioned thinking

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.500
about Martha Graham and the
library's long connection to her

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.270
that today is the 25th anniversary
of her death which I didn't know,

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:05.300 position:56%
April 1, and we were looking earlier
in the afternoon at some quotes

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:10.340
from her talking about walking
the high wire of circumstance,

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.190
practicing living at the
instant for a dancer.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.280
She says at times I fear walking
that tight rope, I fear the venture

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.490
into the unknown but that's
part of the act of creating

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:22.790
and the act of performing.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:27.110
That is what a dancer does
venturing into the unknown.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:33.040
And I was just wondering this is
maybe a good spot to talk with both

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.090
of you about you each have a
troupe, you are responsible

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.460
for a big aesthetic vision and
maybe something about the world

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.480
of contemporary dance today
and what you see for it

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.730
and your hopes and plans.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.250
I know you for example I heard
you had a big film project

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.710
with your company coming up.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:58.070
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Well my
company is more realistic

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.850
for contemporary times.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.900
What I mean by that is that there
are very few actual institutions

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.200
made anymore.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.830
It just doesn't work out that
way rather dance has always been

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.130
very fluid.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.040
Dancers have been fluid, ephemeral
and moving around and wanting

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.990
to experience different kinds
of choreographers and cities

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:26.730 position:56%
so that's not new but it's certainly
been solidified that that's kind

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.260 position:56%
of the lifestyle of dancers nowadays

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:36.140
and my company is not
an institution.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.790
We come together when there is
funding and work and projects

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.550
and sometimes that's a lot
and sometimes that's a little

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.690
and then I also create
works for companies

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.090
such as the Martha Graham
Dance Company and many others

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.820
and so my time is filled.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.090
Sometimes I'm with my own group
and sometimes I'm with others

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.380
and actually that works out
really well for me because I get

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:07.400
so much more information from my
work this way but yes I am working

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.200
on another film right
now with my company.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.340
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Janet and I talked
a little bit the other night

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.950 position:56%
about the amazing new paths that you
are leading for the Graham Company

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.860
and I wanted to ask you to talk
about your expanding access

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.820
to audiences through
these innovative ventures.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.260
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Well that kind
of also speaks to what's going

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.880
on in the dance world these days,

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.120
you know modern dance is
a really young art form.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.360
It's just over 100 years old now
and it was born out of revolt,

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.940
each generation rejecting what
had gone before and moving forward

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:49.390
but as we hit our 100th birthday or
so the field itself is looking back

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.400
and saying wait a minute
there are things in our past

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.230
that we don't want to throw away.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:25:00.110
The art form has new classics
and Graham certainly has many

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:05.500
of these classics but the modern
dance has really not focused on how

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.030
to keep their classics,
how to celebrate them,

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:12.830
how to keep them relevant, how
to engage audiences with them.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.810
The audiences for modern
dance really have been trained

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:20.460
and the funders to appreciate
the new, it's all about the new

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:27.440
so we've really been experimenting
with how to bring more points

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.990
of access for today's audiences
to our classic works everything

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.720
from simply spoken
introductions on our programs.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.320
We started by asking well what's
the modern dance equivalent

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:45.670 position:56%
to a museum's audio tour or to opera
super titles you know how do you

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:52.130
bring context to the classics so
that audiences can enter into them

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:57.260
and appreciate their
[inaudible] and beauty.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.000
So we've done spoken introductions,
we've done contextual programming,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.960
we do season themes like
inner landscape focusing

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.960
on the psychological ballets.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.590
We're the first company to
stream a rehearsal live.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.190
We've done online video
competitions.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.990
We partner with all sorts of
different educational institutions

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:26.950
and cultural institutions and our
school has many creative projects

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.940
and this has all led us
to commissioning new work

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.100
because we believe there's a real
conversation between new work

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.150
and the classic works and
we've discovered by having both

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:40.790
on our programs it's really kind
of a one plus one makes three.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:45.290
The classics bring a
context to the new work

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.020
and the new work brings
fresh eyes to the classics

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.740
and so that's a very short --
, it's not such a short answer,

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.800
but I could be much longer
on that topic I'll tell you.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.330
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's the
exciting thing about tonight.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.170
We'll have this chance to see both
the master works and a new one

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.550
and I was thinking
back just to finish

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:08.570 position:56%
up on your technological innovations
but I was also interested

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:12.210 position:56%
in your comment about Graham herself
and the company have always been

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.820 position:56%
on the cutting edge and you now have
a new mobile app that's downloadable

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.010
if anybody is interested -

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.890
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: And free, free -

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.310
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: What's
exactly on there?

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.960
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Well Google
came to us about a year ago

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.570
and said you know we're expanding
our Google Cultural Institute

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:34.150
which you are able to take
virtual tours of museums

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.630
on their Cultural Institute
and we're expanding it

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.730
into the performing arts and
you were the first dance company

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.750
that we have invited to be part
of this so we were delighted

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.020
because we have been spending
a lot of time organizing

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.690
and digitizing our archives which
are the largest dance archives

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.970
for any single living
artist, dance, not living,

00:27:55.970 --> 00:28:00.290
sorry any single dance artist
so we were kind of poised

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:04.120
to help share them on the
Google Cultural Institute

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:10.380
and on December 1 they launched
this new part, the performing arts.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.040
We're part of it as well
as the Bolshoi as well

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.110
as the Royal Shakespeare
Company, I mean there are a number

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:22.410
of wonderful institutions and if
you go to the Cultural Institute

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:27.000
in search Martha Graham you'll
see our exhibit which is going

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.120
to be expanded but it's
a wonderful foundation

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.060
about the Martha Graham technique
and Martha Graham herself

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:40.830
and the Martha Graham Dance Company
and you can go to the iTunes store

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:45.170 position:56%
and download it as an app as well
but there's more information online.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.680
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's so
cool I wish we had an app.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:53.360 position:56%
We share some passion for digitizing
our archives and I was going to say

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.800
in addition to the Graham
Company we are also very fortunate

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.790
in having a vast archive of
Martha Graham works and sketches

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.550
and manuscripts and
memorabilia and photographs.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.820
You can look at the
library's website too and look

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.710 position:56%
up Martha Graham Dance Collection
or just the Martha Graham Collection

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.740
and you can access these online
too so we are very proud of that

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.040
and we're very, very proud of this
collaboration for this celebration.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.330
So now we want to just give you a
chance to ask a couple of questions

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.530
and then we'll let them go
back and get ready for tonight.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.510
Does anybody have a question?

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:42.230
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.530
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Can you hear?

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:44.960
He's asking what the difference is

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.180
between the Martha Graham
technique and ballet?

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.900
You know you've got
two arms, two legs,

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:55.130
how many different
things can you do?

00:29:55.130 --> 00:30:00.270
But Martha discovered as she was
searching for a style of movement

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:07.010
that would reveal emotion she
discovered that emotion rides

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:10.560 position:56%
on the breath when you laugh or when
you sob or when you are nervous,

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.780
it changes your breath and she
developed a style of dancing driven

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:20.010
by the torso, her contraction
being the exhale and the coiling

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:25.370
in of the torso and the release
being the inhale and the sending

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:29.100
out of energy and tonight
on stage all of the movement

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.090
in the Martha Graham
works are driven

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:36.420
by the torso, the core muscles.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.230
She used this energy to
also leverage herself

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.160
against the floor and
to use gravity.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.900
She wanted to show effort.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.700
She wanted to show the human
condition as opposed to ballet

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:55.550
which was very sort of antigravity
and above the ground she went

00:30:55.550 --> 00:31:00.940
into the ground and you will see
there's a series of wonderful falls

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.790 position:56%
that she created that are part of
the Graham technique tonight in Cave

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:10.150 position:56%
of the Heart you'll see Medea as her
heart is breaking just legs opening

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:15.840
and the whole torso drops down
into the floor and then rebounds

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:23.860
and recovers so it's a much more
shall I say gutsy percussive

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.700
earthbound technique than ballet.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.510
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Anyone else?

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:35.300
[ Inaudible ]

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.600
&gt;&gt; One of the films
the library showed

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.750
on Saturday was the wonderful
film that WQED in Pittsburgh made

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.740
with Martha Graham and I think
an introductory material talked

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.140
about the challenge to them
at the time was shooting it

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.870
from multiple angles with different
cameras and it dawned on me

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.740
that it must have taken multiple
takes and been a real challenge

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.620
for the dancers perhaps so
I was wondering since both

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.840
of you are working in film if
you could talk a little bit

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.780
about that both what it's like
for the dancers to have to go

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.720
through the same piece especially
if the cameras could be moving

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:12.500
or shooting them from
different angles?

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:17.550
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Well that's
kind of normal for film work.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:21.660 position:56%
Either you have a lot of money and
you have and A camera and a B camera

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.600
and a C camera and you have
somehow arranged that they are not

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.520
in each other's path
so they are not filmed,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.530
that one camera doesn't
film the other camera,

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.090
and you try to have few takes
and that's very expensive

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:40.090
but you win time or you usually
have smaller budgets and that's 99%

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:44.140
of the time true and you have
only one crew and one camera

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:48.730
and instead you have to do one
set up and then you have to move

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:54.420
to another one and change the lens
and so on but there's enough rest

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.790
in between and it's
not really a problem.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.560
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: I don't
know about that [laughter].

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.100
I've been in a few dance films
where we did it again and again

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.900
and you had to stop and prepare -

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.200
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg:
It's certainly tiring.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.050
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: the needs
of the costume, it's tiring,

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:15.520 position:56%
and of course dancers -- , Bob Fosse
said dancers are the last soldiers

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.320
of the theater because they
really are disciplined and work

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.940
to get something right so we will
do take after take after take.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.970
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yes
but I think what's --

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.460
, as long as there's a clear
goal why it's not a problem

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.300
and of course you don't destroy
anyone, that's never clever,

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.000
but you might have to
work very hard [laughter].

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.950
&gt;&gt; I studied with Bill [inaudible]

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.250
&gt;&gt; -- microphone.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.960
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I studied with
Bill Bales, who was early Graham

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.180
and it was very swoopy,
much more lyrical.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.570
I was at the studio
in the 50s and 60s

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.530
which had become much more
percussive and angular.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:05.270 position:56%
Has the technique itself evolved as
it seemed to do while she was alive?

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:09.930
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: Yes and she
lived for such a long time

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:15.060
that she set us a good
example because the physicality

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.790
of each generation keeps changing.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:22.300
It's like the Olympics every
few years people break a record.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.060
The legs go higher, the jumps
go higher, the turns are faster,

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.120
the falls you know, and
Martha actually loved that

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.080
and would keep incorporating
it into her classroom exercises

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.270
and her choreography as
she was creating new work

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.920
but also into the classic works.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:44.770
She didn't expect us to dance
like the casts from 1947 or 1957

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:47.090
or 1967 had danced the works.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:53.840
She wanted to use our facility
and the effort was she wanted

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.370
to maintain the dramatic intent.

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:00.980
She felt that that could happen,
that you could let the legs go

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.170
that you could use the facility
of the contemporary dancers and

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.850
yet remain true to the message of
the work so that's a lesson I take

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:16.520
from Martha and of course today's
dancers are absolutely astounding.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.640
The job is to use that
in the service

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.770
of the dramatic intent of the work.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.830
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Anyone else?

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:33.190
I think - oh yeah one there, okay.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.520
&gt;&gt; Hi, I was curious, the dance

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.900
that you choreographed did
you have an idea of the dance

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.370 position:56%
and then apply the music to the
dance or did you listen to the music

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:48.150
and then create the
dance from the music?

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.340
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: I listen
to the music first and I work

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.950
in many different ways actually.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.920
I work in both of those ways
in combinations of the two

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.700
and I didn't decide
which way I would work

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.070
because first I did research.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:08.100
I didn't even choose the music
straight away I had some pieces.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.280 position:56%
In fact I chose another piece first
that I really wanted to choreograph.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.710
I think it's a beautiful piece
of music, great for dance,

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.080
called Serious Song for Strings

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.540
but then I had a problem
combining it with something else.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:24.150
It was such a standalone piece
and as such it was too short

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:32.770
so I changed my mind but I think
one of the challenges of working

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.990
with Irving Fein's music
is that it is particular.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:39.480
There is a lot of music that is
popular among choreographers today

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:46.940
that is more like a
landscape or an ambience

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.670
that goes on for a long time.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:54.210
It's less specific but this music
is very specific and so I found

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:58.870
that it would be difficult for me
to superimpose something on that.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:02.460
It just didn't work
so then I decided well

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.650
in that case I will really work
with the music and listen to it

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:12.130
and choreograph what I hear
and work with it that way so in

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:13.840 position:56%
that way it's not a conceptual piece

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.660
because sometimes I
do conceptual pieces

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.350 position:56%
and then you choose all the
elements that strengthen the concept

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.350
but this is not one of them.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:25.760
This is a musical piece and it's
also the encounter with the dancers

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.730
and the encounter with the
music is really the piece.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:32.190
&gt;&gt; Do you let the dancers
contribute to the choreography?

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:33.990
&gt;&gt; Pontus Lidberg: Yes.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:37.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.430
Yes I can explain that [laughter].

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:46.370
As a young choreographer I was very
interested in creating steps not

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:49.390
to the point of codifying a
technique or anything like that

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:54.720
but I was certainly interested
in this is my step which is

00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:00.280
of course not really true
because the patterns that you move

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.860
in are conditioned so
they are not mine at all

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.750
but anyway I was interested
in making the choices.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:11.310
This is the step, this is the
phrase, this is the sequence,

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:14.670
these are the angles, this is
the you know all of it and I did

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.700
that for quite a long
time to the point

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.110
where that wasn't inspiring anymore

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:24.440 position:56%
but rather I started being more
interested in seeing what can I draw

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:29.680
out of someone else and so then
I kind of just throw a ball

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.930
and then see what they do with it
and from then I start like okay

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:37.990 position:56%
and I saw something in what they did
and I said actually if you just do

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.320
with slightly different,
go this way instead,

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.620
and that way it's conversational

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:47.380
so I can shape the
choreography with the dancers.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.230
The strange thing is that
the choreography always,

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.590
well to this point at least,
turns out instantly recognizable

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:58.340 position:56%
as my choreography even though I
don't give steps anymore [laughter].

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.370
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Maybe one
more question, over there.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:06.670
&gt;&gt; This is wonderful.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:11.000
I'm learning about Martha Graham's
approach and style to dance.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.720
What else will be demonstrated

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.400
about her particular style
in the pieces tonight?

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.070
You mentioned a few other things.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.760
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: What else
will be demonstrated?

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.030
&gt;&gt; That's peculiar
to Martha's approach.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.020
&gt;&gt; Janet Eilber: To Martha's
style and her vocabulary?

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:34.110
Well tonight's program actually
the three Graham works give you a

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:38.830
wonderful overview of
several different periods.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:42.200
You know she lived so long
it's almost like Picasso

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:48.590
and Appalachian Spring of course
is from her Americana period

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:52.540
and Dark Meadow and these dances
are fairly close together.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:57.210
Appalachian Springs '44,
Dark Meadows '47 and Cave

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:06.050
of the Heart is '46 but Dark Meadow
is very abstract modernist work.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:13.360
The chorus work is very
geometric and the patterns

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.180
that the dancers make on the stage
really harken back to experiments

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:22.190
that she did in the early 1930s
before she started using the Gucci

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:26.760
sets, experimenting with the
geometry of the stage and the lines

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:31.990
of force and drawing inspiration
from Guggenheim Fellowship she had

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:38.140
where she traveled and lived in the
Southwest and visited the rituals

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.190
of the Pueblo communities there.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:44.990
There's a lot of the Southwest
and the Native American ritual

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:49.670
in several of Graham's works
and particularly in Dark Meadow

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.550
and then Cave of the
Heart inspired one

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:56.560
of her wonderful Greek
works by Medea.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.530 position:56%
Again of course she's a modernist so
the thing about Cave of the Heart is

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:06.170
that she distilled the story
into only four characters

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:11.930
to represent this emotional battle
of Medea and Jason the princess

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:18.510
and the chorus so you're
really getting a nice view

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:21.740
of different approaches,
different inspirations for Martha

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:26.190
but I do encourage you
to watch for those torsos

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:32.610 position:56%
because really everything comes -- ,
even when a Graham dancer lifts his

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:38.480 position:56%
or her arm it's because the shoulder
blade is dropping down the back

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.230
and you are leveraging the power
from the floor to lift that arm.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.030
It's never just a simple arm.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.050
I have to demonstrate one thing.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.790
When a baseball pitcher pitches,

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.510
when I watch a baseball
pitcher pitch I see him first go

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.690
into big Martha Graham contraction
[laughter], so if home plate is

00:41:54.690 --> 00:42:01.530
down there -- , he comes way
back here, his torso is coiled,

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.780
it's leveraging off the
mound and he throws the ball

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.350
from the center of
the planet, right?

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:07.970
He presses away.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.280
All of the energy goes all the way
through the release of the torso,

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.180
the contraction and bam
the ball goes, right?

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.480
So a Graham dancer does
not dance like this.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.040
Every movement is coming
from the center of the body

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.040
from the floor so look for it.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.500
They're not going to throw a ball
at you but they're throwing energy

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.350
in the same way [laughter].

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.440
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Wonderful,
that's a great way to end.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.810
I think we're about to the point
of going into the concert hall.

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:38.870
Please take a look at
our exhibits by the way.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.510
