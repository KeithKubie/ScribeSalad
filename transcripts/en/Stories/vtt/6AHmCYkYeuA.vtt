00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:02.370
NARRATOR: "The
tyranny of distance"

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.370
is a phrase that keeps coming
back to Elliott Ross when

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.320
he thinks about this picture.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.010
The scene feels so small
that at first blush,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.600
talking about distance
and isolation seems weird.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.440
That is until you learn
that the man in the picture

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.680
intends to make this cave his
home and that outside the cave,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.015
is the whole of the
Australian Outback.

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:23.640
(MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.060
This cave is actually
part of a small mining

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.340
town called Coober Pedy,
which is a name with a pretty

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.620
great history.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.840
ELLIOT ROSS: Coober Pedy,
in the indigenous tongue,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.327
means "white man's hole".

00:00:38.327 --> 00:00:40.035
NARRATOR: That's
Elliot, the photographer

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:42.010
who led us through this place.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.530
Anyway, Coober Pedy got that
name because 100 years ago,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.680
European miners found opal here.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.780
And true to form,
white men have been

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.920
digging holes and excavating
the precious stone ever since.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.020
Though nowadays, miners from
all over the world live here.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.010
For Elliot, who
traveled to Coober Pedy

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.820
to learn about the community,
it was a shocking place

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.580
to see for the first time.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.110
ELLIOT ROSS: For
miles and miles,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.850
it's just plain red clay with
lumps and little hills of dirt

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.210
where people dug holes
looking for opal.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.460
And abandoned cars.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.860
And I was like, oh my gosh.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.400
What is this place?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.380
This is incredible.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.840
NARRATOR: What the place
is is a study in extremes.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.350
This part of the
Australian Outback

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.440
is scorchingly hot, bone
dry, and more than 300 miles

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.700
from any kind of civilization.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.730
And it's prone to dust
storms that sound like this.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.870
[DUST STORM]

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.510
A place this extreme
certainly feels tyrannical.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.650
But according to Elliot, it
also creates a certain frontier

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.330
spirit.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.950
Take for example opal mining,
which the residents have

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.865
managed to keep in
their own scrappy hands

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:52.920
and away from big
mining corporations.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.210
ELLIOT ROSS: People have made
these incredible machines.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.952
Every single part is homemade.

00:01:57.952 --> 00:01:59.510
It's really a special thing.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.170
NARRATOR: Or consider the
subject of that first photo.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.380
Most of the residents of Coober
Pedy live in underground homes

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.880
to avoid the sun and the heat.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.560
And the man in this photo,
who Elliot called Eddie,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.610
was looking to build a
new home for himself.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.380
Elliot met him and
toured what was

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.757
so far a hole in the ground.

00:02:18.757 --> 00:02:20.340
But it was Eddie's
hole on the ground,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.570
and like any good frontiersman,
he saw it as much more.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.357
ELLIOT ROSS: I was
like, hey, Eddie,

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:26.440
can you sit in that chair?

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.750
He looked at me like-- I
think we need a picture of you

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.430
as the benevolent dictator
of this underground lair.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.390
NARRATOR: Elliot has visited a
lot of distant, isolated places

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.350
in his travels.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.710
And after being welcomed in
and shown all of Coober Pedy,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.050
he's got a theory
about places like this,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.980
and it's a theory that's
really gotten under his skin.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.180
ELLIOT ROSS: You need to
have some sort of hospitality

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.770
to survive and for your
neighbors to survive.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.440
So there's this
codependence that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.560
builds and grows and nurtures
in this sort of environment

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.900
that I think is beautiful.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.350
And a lot of people kept
repeating this one thing

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.275
like, you know, if you
stay more than 10 days,

00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:08.104
you never leave--
[INAUDIBLE], 10 days.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.520
10 days, you fall under our
curse, and you'll never leave.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.650
I ended up staying, I think, two
and a half weeks there, it was.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.837
I didn't stay, but a lot
of me wanted to stay.

00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:19.295

like to take a

isolated country in the world.

00:03:38.587 --> 00:03:40.170
MATT PAISH: You did
get the impression

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.090
that they had just
been created purely

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.320
for tourists to go to on a bus.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.500
There were no other
people around there.
