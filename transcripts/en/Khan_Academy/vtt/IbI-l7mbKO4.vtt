00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
I have an equation right here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.500
It's a second degree equation.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.760
It's a quadratic.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.280
And I know its graph is
going to be a parabola.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.495
Just as a review, that means it
looks something like this or it

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:12.850
looks something like that.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.470
Because the coefficient on the
x squared term here is positive,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.130
I know it's going to be an
upward opening parabola.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.372
And I am curious about the
vertex of this parabola.

00:00:24.372 --> 00:00:26.080
And if I have an upward
opening parabola,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.880
the vertex is going to
be the minimum point.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.421
If I had a downward
opening parabola,

00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:31.490
then the vertex would
be the maximum point.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.410
So I'm really trying
to find the x value.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.910
I don't know actually where
this does intersect the x-axis

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.150
or if it does it all.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.050
But I want to find
the x value where

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.520
this function takes
on a minimum value.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.970
Now, there's many
ways to find a vertex.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.060
Probably the easiest,
there's a formula for it.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.680
And we talk about where that
comes from in multiple videos,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.270
where the vertex of a
parabola or the x-coordinate

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.170
of the vertex of the parabola.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.710
So the x-coordinate
of the vertex

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.030
is just equal to
negative b over 2a.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.360
And the negative b, you're just
talking about the coefficient,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.030
or b is the coefficient
on the first degree term,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.830
is on the coefficient
on the x term.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.150
And a is the coefficient
on the x squared term.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.555
So this is going to be
equal to b is negative 20.

00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:28.295
So it's negative
20 over 2 times 5.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.930
Well, this is going to
be equal to positive 20

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.920
over 10, which is equal to 2.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.470
And so to find the y
value of the vertex,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.900
we just substitute
back into the equation.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.710
The y value is going
to be 5 times 2 squared

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.520
minus 20 times 2 plus 15,
which is equal to let's see.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.300
This is 5 times 4, which is 20,
minus 40, which is negative 20,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.942
plus 15 is negative 5.

00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:06.400
So just like that, we're able
to figure out the coordinate.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.740
This coordinate right over here
is the point 2, negative 5.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.730
Now it's not so
satisfying just to plug

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.904
and chug a formula like this.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.570
And we'll see where
this comes from when

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.060
you look at the
quadratic formula.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.530
This is the first term.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.180
It's the x value that's
halfway in between the roots.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.350
So that's one way
to think about it.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.330
But another way to do
it, and this probably

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.990
will be of more lasting
help for you in your life,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.700
because you might
forget this formula.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.530
It's really just try to
re-manipulate this equation

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.070
so you can spot
its minimum point.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.370
And we're going to do that
by completing the square.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.470
So let me rewrite that.

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.300
And what I'll do is out
of these first two terms,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.680
I'll factor out a 5, because I
want to complete a square here

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.370
and I'm going to leave
this 15 out to the right,

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.578
because I'm going to have
to manipulate that as well.

00:02:55.578 --> 00:03:00.770
So it is 5 times x
squared minus 4x.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.040
And then I have
this 15 out here.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.650
And I want to write this
as a perfect square.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.470
And we just have
to remind ourselves

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.550
that if I have x plus
a squared, that's

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.730
going to be x squared
plus 2ax plus a squared.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.130
So if I want to turn something
that looks like this, 2ax,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.920
into a perfect
square, I just have

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.830
to take half of this coefficient
and square it and add it

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.530
right over here in order
to make it look like that.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.340
So I'm going to do
that right over here.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.980
So if I take half of negative
4, that's negative 2.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.810
If I square it, that is
going to be positive 4.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.220
I have to be very careful here.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.750
I can't just willy nilly
add a positive 4 here.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.816
I have equality here.

00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:49.440
If they were equal
before adding the 4,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.689
then they're not going to
be equal after adding the 4.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.490
So I have to do proper
accounting here.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.120
I either have to add 4 to both
sides or I should be careful.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.580
I have to add the same
amount to both sides

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.387
or subtract the
same amount again.

00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:03.220
Now, the reason why I
was careful there is I

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.850
didn't just add 4 to the right
hand side of the equation.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.900
Remember, the 4 is
getting multiplied by 5.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.440
I have added 20 to the right
hand side of the equation.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.450
So if I want to make
this balance out,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.570
if I want the equality
to still be true,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.660
I either have to
now add 20 to y or I

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.930
have to subtract 20 from
the right hand side.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.750
So I'll do that.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.300
I'll subtract 20 from
the right hand side.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.970
So I added 5 times 4.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.970
If you were to distribute
this, you'll see that.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.320
I could have literally, up
here, said hey, I'm adding 20

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.110
and I'm subtracting 20.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.390
This is the exact same
thing that I did over here.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.950
If you distribute the 5, it
becomes 5x squared minus 20x

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.930
plus 20 plus 15 minus 20.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.100
Exactly what's up here.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.750
The whole point of
this is that now I

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.890
can write this in
an interesting way.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:57.430
I could write this as y is equal
to 5 times x minus 2 squared,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.820
and then 15 minus 20 is minus 5.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.390
So the whole point of this is
now to be able to inspect this.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.810
When does this equation
hit a minimum value?

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.830
Well, we know that this
term right over here

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.423
is always going to
be non-negative.

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:16.180
Or we could say
it's always going

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.760
to be greater than
or equal to 0.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.760
This whole thing is going
to hit a minimum value

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.740
when this term is equal
to 0 or when x equals 2.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.160
When x equals 2, we're going
to hit a minimum value.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.690
And when x equals
2, what happens?

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.440
Well, this whole term is 0
and y is equal to negative 5.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.060
The vertex is 2, negative 5.
