00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:02.254
- [Voiceover] Let f be
a function such that

00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:04.010
f of negative one is equal to three,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.367
f prime of negative one is equal to five.

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.372
Let g be the function g of x is

00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:10.485
equal to two x to the third power.

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:13.207
Let capital F be a function defined as,

00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:16.224
so capital F is defined
as lowercase f of x

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:19.028
divided by lowercase g
of x, and they want us

00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:21.247
to evaluate the derivative of capital F

00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:23.809
at x equals negative one.

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:25.040
So the way that we can do that is,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.672
let's just take the
derivative of capital F,

00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:30.728
and then evaluate it at x equals one.

00:00:30.728 --> 00:00:32.713
And the way they've set up capital F,

00:00:32.713 --> 00:00:34.331
this function definition, we can see that

00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:36.595
it is a quotient of two functions.

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:38.852
So if we want to take it's derivative,

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:40.175
you might say, well, maybe the

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:42.419
quotient rule is important here.

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:44.005
And I'll always give you my aside.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.110
The quotient rule, I'm
gonna state it right now,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.148
it could be useful to know it,

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.470
but in case you ever forget it,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.043
you can derive it pretty quickly

00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:52.905
from the product rule, and if you know it,

00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:54.220
the chain rule combined, you can

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.059
get the quotient rule pretty quick.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.130
But let me just state the
quotient rule right now.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.554
So if you have some function defined as

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:03.303
some function in the numerator

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:07.330
divided by some function
in the denominator,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.911
we can say its derivative, and this is

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:11.579
really just a restatement
of the quotient rule,

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.573
its derivative is going to
be the derivative of the

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:17.573
function of the numerator, so d, dx,

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:23.966
f of x, times the function
in the denominator,

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:28.133
so times g of x, minus the
function in the numerator,

00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:34.591
minus f of x, not taking its derivative,

00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:38.171
times the derivative in the
function of the denominator,

00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:40.838
d, dx, g of x, all of that over,

00:01:45.657 --> 00:01:48.156
so all of this is going to be over

00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:50.513
the function in the denominator squared.

00:01:50.513 --> 00:01:54.680
So this g of x squared,
g of x, g of x squared.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.948
And you can use different
types of notation here.

00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:01.570
You could say, instead
of writing this with

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.022
a derivative operator,
you could say this is

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:06.772
the same thing as g
prime of x, and likewise,

00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:12.090
you could say, well that is
the same thing as f prime of x.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.340
And so now we just want
to evaluate this thing,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.046
and you might say, wait, how
do I evaluate this thing?

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:17.356
Well, let's just try it.

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:20.100
Let's just say we want to evaluate F prime

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.396
when x is equal to negative one.

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:26.563
So we can write F prime of
negative one is equal to,

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:30.443
well everywhere we see an x,
let's put a negative one here.

00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:33.825
It's going to be f prime of negative one,

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:36.914
lowercase f prime, that's
a little confusing,

00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:41.081
lowercase f prime of negative
one times g of negative one,

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:46.062
g of negative one minus f of negative one

00:02:51.803 --> 00:02:54.303
times g prime of negative one.

00:02:57.708 --> 00:03:02.359
All of that over, we'll
do that in the same color,

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.692
so take my color seriously.

00:03:04.692 --> 00:03:08.859
Alright, all of that over
g of negative one squared.

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:15.252
Now can we figure out what
F prime of negative one

00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:17.075
f of negative one, g of negative one,

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:19.721
and g prime of negative
one, what they are?

00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:21.309
Well some of them, they tell us outright.

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.674
They tell us f and f
prime at negative one,

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:26.865
and for g, we can
actually solve for those.

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:28.766
So, let's see, if this is, let's

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:31.804
first evaluate g of negative one.

00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:34.175
G of negative one is going to be two

00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:37.916
times negative one to the third power.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:40.293
Well negative one to the third
power is just negative one,

00:03:40.293 --> 00:03:43.113
times two, so this is negative two,

00:03:43.113 --> 00:03:47.113
and g prime of x, I'll
do it here, g prime of x.

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:50.956
Let's use the power rule,
bring that three out front,

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:55.479
three times two is six, x,
decrement that exponent,

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.729
three minus one is two, and
so g prime of negative one

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:03.572
is equal to six times
negative one squared.

00:04:03.572 --> 00:04:04.989
Well negative one squared is just one,

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.764
so this is going to be equal to six.

00:04:06.764 --> 00:04:09.241
So we actually know what
all of these values are now.

00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:10.914
We know, so first we wanna figure out

00:04:10.914 --> 00:04:13.475
f prime of negative one.

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:14.852
Well they tell us that right over here.

00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:17.928
F prime of negative one is equal to five.

00:04:17.928 --> 00:04:19.261
So that is five.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.939
G of negative one, well we
figured that right here.

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:28.503
G of negative one is negative two.

00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:30.503
So this is negative two.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.333
F of negative one, so f of negative one,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.237
they tell us that right over there.

00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:42.472
That is equal to three.

00:04:42.472 --> 00:04:45.222
And then g prime of negative one,

00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:50.490
just circle it in this green color,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.633
g prime of negative
one, we figured it out.

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:54.464
It is equal to six.

00:04:54.464 --> 00:04:56.662
So this is equal to six.

00:04:56.662 --> 00:05:00.059
And then finally, g of
negative one right over here.

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.011
We already figured that out.

00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:04.594
That was equal to negative two.

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:09.276
So this is all going to simplify to...

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:12.113
So you have five times negative two,

00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:15.780
which is negative 10,
minus three times six,

00:05:16.627 --> 00:05:21.004
which is 18, all of that
over negative two squared.

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:24.120
Well negative two squared is
just going to be positive four.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.632
So this is going to be equal to

00:05:25.632 --> 00:05:28.215
negative 28 over positive four,

00:05:29.082 --> 00:05:31.963
which is equal to negative seven.

00:05:31.963 --> 00:05:33.019
And there you have it.

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:34.481
It looks intimidating at first,

00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:35.786
but just say, okay, look.

00:05:35.786 --> 00:05:39.175
I can use the quotient
rule right over here,

00:05:39.175 --> 00:05:40.833
and then once I apply the quotient rule,

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:42.155
I can actually just directly figure out

00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:44.907
what g of negative one,
g prime of negative one,

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:46.510
and they gave us f of negative one,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.874
f prime of negative one, so
hopefully you find that helpful.
