00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.638
- Saved the plate of just
gorgeous prawns, for the last.

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:06.221
Oh, the head oil!

00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:08.388
Oh, all the shrimp juices!

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:18.602
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:21.660
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.621
with migrationology.com,
in Barcelona, Spain,

00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:29.078
just took the metro to
Barceloneta station,

00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:31.555
and we are taking a little
walk into the neighborhood

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:33.174
on our way to go eat.

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:36.674
(lively electronic music)

00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:42.957
Have some bad news.

00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:46.362
The restaurant, which is
called La Cova Fumada,

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.309
and it's a restaurant that
many of you recommended,

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.703
and I was really looking
forward to eating here

00:00:50.703 --> 00:00:53.809
in Barcelona, they are on vacation,

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.015
looks like for the entire
month of August, so,

00:00:58.015 --> 00:01:01.307
that's alright, no
problem, I'm a little bit

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:04.198
disappointed, though, the
food here looks amazing.

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:06.879
If you come to Barcelona, even though

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:09.388
I won't have a chance to eat here,

00:01:09.388 --> 00:01:11.516
it will probably be an
amazing place to eat.

00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:14.685
Trying to figure out
now where to eat next.

00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:17.054
Found another place, on our way there now,

00:01:17.054 --> 00:01:19.069
should be just a little short walk away.

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.569
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:31.739
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:41.042
I'm at a restaurant called Can Mano,

00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:43.589
and this is just a little restaurant,

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:46.476
sort of a hole-in-the-wall,
but this is an amazing

00:01:46.476 --> 00:01:49.704
little place, we are very
close to the beach here,

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:50.948
and it feels like you're on the beach,

00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:52.901
this is like a beach type of restaurant,

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:56.196
they specialize in many
different seafood dishes,

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:58.703
I've just ordered a few different plates,

00:01:58.703 --> 00:02:00.268
but I'm starting off with a coffee,

00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:02.851
and I ordered a cafe Americano.

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:09.258
I'm loving the ambiance in here, though,

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:12.175
it is a friendly, kinda local spot,

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:15.610
people come here to
socialize, to hang out,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.143
and especially, to eat the seafood.

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:19.532
Gracias.

00:02:19.532 --> 00:02:22.327
He just brought out a
plate of fried eggplant,

00:02:22.327 --> 00:02:25.556
and it's so hot and fresh that
I can actually feel the heat

00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:26.827
coming off of it.

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:27.660
Okay.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.493
Gracias.

00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:34.651
Gracias.

00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:35.484
Oh, wow!

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:37.592
All the other dishes
have all just arrived.

00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:39.901
Oh, this is overwhelmingly beautiful,

00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:43.793
but I still have to
start with that eggplant.

00:02:43.793 --> 00:02:47.503
Yeah, I can actually feel the
heat of the fried eggplant

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:51.199
coming onto my face,
radiating onto my face.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.032
Gracias!

00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:57.348
That's hot and fresh.

00:02:57.348 --> 00:03:01.384
It's creamy on the inside,
and crispy on the outside,

00:03:01.384 --> 00:03:04.185
just the right amount of
batter so it's not too heavy,

00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:06.355
but it gives it a nice crispiness.

00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:09.159
I am overwhelmed with joy right now.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.604
Everything is hot and
fresh, right out of the oil,

00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:13.039
or right off the grill.

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:15.047
This one is the fried eggplant.

00:03:15.047 --> 00:03:17.338
I think these ones are anchovies,

00:03:17.338 --> 00:03:19.841
and these little fish, I'm not
totally sure what they are,

00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:21.447
but they're little fish, and then also

00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:24.995
I got some grilled
sardines, and then also,

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:29.162
this is just an insanely
beautiful plate of prawns,

00:03:30.104 --> 00:03:33.444
which I think they are grilled,

00:03:33.444 --> 00:03:35.787
I think they're grilled and
then topped with this beautiful

00:03:35.787 --> 00:03:38.299
oil sauce, looks like with parsley,

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.720
and looks like a lot of
garlic in that sauce as well.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.896
Oh, this is just such pretty, delicious,

00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:45.358
amazing-looking seafood.

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.012
I'll start with some of these little fish.

00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:50.345
Actually, let me just grab a little guy.

00:03:54.374 --> 00:03:56.751
You don't even feel the
bones in that, at all!

00:03:56.751 --> 00:03:59.523
Oh, those are like little fish chips.

00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:00.694
They're just soft all the way through,

00:04:00.694 --> 00:04:02.688
and then crispy with that batter.

00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:04.429
Let me take a forkful.

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.012
A forkful of these little guys.

00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:11.569
Next, let me go in for these sardines,

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.749
and I will turn the face
over towards you guys.

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.666
Let me grab that lemon.

00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:22.618
Okay.

00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:27.414
Oh, I'm going for this
middle guy right here.

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:28.679
That is beautiful.

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:29.762
All sardines.

00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:35.766
I wonder, these are kinda big, so,

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:37.896
yeah, I think I can eat the whole thing.

00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:39.646
I'm going head-first.

00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:48.881
Oh, that sauce!

00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:52.548
Oh, that garlicky, like
garlicky herb sauce.

00:04:53.972 --> 00:04:54.860
Is it parsley?

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.978
That is just awesomely
simple, and wonderful,

00:04:58.978 --> 00:05:00.581
and refreshing.

00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:04.115
The fish, you can just bite
through the entire face

00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:05.948
and everything.

00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:10.605
And then, they're just
cooked perfectly, they are

00:05:10.605 --> 00:05:14.201
light and creamy on the
inside, and then with that,

00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:17.309
that topping of garlic
and herbs, it's fantastic,

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:21.886
and then just with that
squeeze of lemon juice.

00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:26.416
And I may as well finish off
that tail while I'm at it.

00:05:26.416 --> 00:05:29.416
And I think these are the anchovies.

00:05:30.338 --> 00:05:32.005
Little bit of lemon.

00:05:32.961 --> 00:05:34.628
Let me pick up my...

00:05:38.032 --> 00:05:39.824
And that's nice and salty.

00:05:39.824 --> 00:05:42.548
The sardines are not too salty,

00:05:42.548 --> 00:05:46.216
this is one more of a,
like fried, salty snack.

00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:48.547
Equally as delicious.

00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:50.232
And again, I love eating little fish,

00:05:50.232 --> 00:05:53.520
because they're slightly
dry, but then you can taste

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.073
the oils that are in them,
you can taste the fleshiness

00:05:57.073 --> 00:05:58.817
of them, and what I
love is that you can eat

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.093
the entire thing.

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:03.436
The bones, the tail, these are headless,

00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:05.126
but they are fantastically good.

00:06:05.126 --> 00:06:08.827
And finally, I saved the
plate of just gorgeous prawns

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:11.581
for the last, and I love
how they've arranged them

00:06:11.581 --> 00:06:16.479
in a circular, they're
like spokes, on the plate.

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.910
I'm gonna, oh, that's pretty.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.317
Aw, all of their heads
are meeting in the middle.

00:06:21.317 --> 00:06:24.900
I'm gonna go in with
a little bit of lemon.

00:06:26.904 --> 00:06:30.404
The lemon on everything is just fantastic.

00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:34.173
Take one of these guys.

00:06:35.844 --> 00:06:38.087
Then break off his head, and I,

00:06:38.087 --> 00:06:38.920
oh!

00:06:39.948 --> 00:06:41.355
Oh, the head oil!

00:06:41.355 --> 00:06:44.815
Oh, all the shrimp juices,
okay I'm gonna eat that first!

00:06:44.815 --> 00:06:47.732
This is the best part of the prawn.

00:06:58.815 --> 00:06:59.648
Wow!

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.250
That is insane!

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.342
That is so buttery!

00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:10.248
And it has a sweet flavor to it.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.232
Wow.

00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:13.732
That's remarkable.

00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:16.385
Oh, and that sauce that is on it

00:07:16.385 --> 00:07:19.083
has a wonderful, garlicky taste,

00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:22.416
and also, again, that same parsley herb,

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.560
some kind of herb flavor.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.426
But that shrimp butter is just remarkable.

00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:33.015
It's an amazing thing in the world.

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:33.848
Wow.

00:07:34.848 --> 00:07:39.606
These are just insane, look
at that vein running down it.

00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:43.773
I'm so excited that I'm
fumbling with the peeling.

00:07:58.568 --> 00:07:59.401
Wow.

00:08:02.653 --> 00:08:06.669
This is one of the best things
I've eaten in Barcelona.

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:10.669
Wow, those are impressively,
insanely delicious.

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:14.419
I am loving everything about this meal.

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:17.309
But the two dishes that
I just can't get over,

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:19.305
number one, are those sardines,

00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:22.272
and number two, are those prawns,

00:08:22.272 --> 00:08:24.605
just absolutely sensational.

00:08:25.687 --> 00:08:27.937
These prawns are just gems.

00:08:29.515 --> 00:08:31.250
Just get a really close-up look

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.007
at what is inside of this head.

00:08:34.007 --> 00:08:37.018
I'm gonna squeeze it, and
what's gonna come out,

00:08:37.018 --> 00:08:38.593
be careful for this!

00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:39.426
Oh!

00:08:50.377 --> 00:08:53.148
That sort of reminds
me of a runny egg yolk,

00:08:53.148 --> 00:08:55.566
except it's richer and creamier,

00:08:55.566 --> 00:08:57.722
with a little bit of a sweetness,

00:08:57.722 --> 00:09:00.773
and a hint of a bitterness,
and then with that garlicky

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:02.190
oily sauce on it.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:08.111
Yeah, you can eat the shell
and all, it's so soft.

00:09:10.256 --> 00:09:14.720
That was a remarkable meal
in Barcelona, I loved it,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.035
I especially love those
prawns, the sardines were good,

00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:20.338
the anchovies were good,
the eggplant was good,

00:09:20.338 --> 00:09:24.130
the little fish were good,
amazing food, amazing place,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.318
a family-run restaurant,
and actually, they just,

00:09:27.318 --> 00:09:30.908
they closed as I was eating in here, so,

00:09:30.908 --> 00:09:33.287
many people have left,
and we are one of the last

00:09:33.287 --> 00:09:35.380
people remaining, but I
just finished, so we're

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.952
about to get out of here, this
was just a meal experience

00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:42.495
in Barcelona that I would
not trade for anything.

00:09:42.495 --> 00:09:45.995
(lively electronic music)

00:09:48.972 --> 00:09:50.820
We are walking over to the metro,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.199
and we are heading to Camp Nou,

00:09:53.199 --> 00:09:56.949
which is the home of
Barcelona Football Club.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.531
Actually, change of plans, I looked it up

00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:03.411
and it will be more
direct to take the bus,

00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:05.828
so we're at the bus stop now.

00:10:19.022 --> 00:10:22.191
That took about 30 minutes,
but we are right at the base

00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:23.396
of the stadium.

00:10:23.396 --> 00:10:25.093
And unfortunately, I'm in Barcelona,

00:10:25.093 --> 00:10:27.835
and it is not the football season,

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:31.842
I would have really loved
to watch a match live

00:10:31.842 --> 00:10:35.536
at the stadium, but instead,
we're gonna just take a tour

00:10:35.536 --> 00:10:38.536
of the stadium and go to the museum.

00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:44.425
For football, soccer fans
from around the world,

00:10:44.425 --> 00:10:47.738
and especially for Barcelona
football club fans,

00:10:47.738 --> 00:10:50.488
this is a pilgrimage destination.

00:10:58.143 --> 00:11:00.968
And again, I pre-booked my tickets online,

00:11:00.968 --> 00:11:04.169
it was easy to get in, and
we are gonna walk around

00:11:04.169 --> 00:11:07.146
and explore, I think we'll be
able to get into the museum,

00:11:07.146 --> 00:11:10.396
and hopefully into the stadium as well.

00:11:21.677 --> 00:11:22.759
Wow.

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:24.926
That is a lot of trophies!

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.329
When I was a kid, I
watched a lot of football,

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:42.693
a lot of soccer, I was a big
fan, and recently, though,

00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:45.044
I haven't had a lot of
time to follow football,

00:11:45.044 --> 00:11:48.207
but I still love to when
I can, and I remember

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:51.742
a lot of the names, the
players that I used to follow.

00:11:51.742 --> 00:11:54.984
Rivaldo was one of my childhood heroes.

00:11:54.984 --> 00:11:58.229
I am about to view the cabinet
of UEFA Champions League

00:11:58.229 --> 00:11:59.465
trophies.

00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:01.628
And at the time of making this video,

00:12:01.628 --> 00:12:04.699
they have five European championships.

00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:05.616
2014 to 15.

00:12:08.215 --> 00:12:11.715
(lively electronic music)

00:12:18.554 --> 00:12:21.330
I'm just getting my
first view of Camp Nou,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.247
the whole stadium, it
has a capacity of 99,354,

00:12:27.618 --> 00:12:30.191
and what really strikes
me as amazing is that,

00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:32.167
I mean, the field is at the bottom,

00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:34.305
but there's very little space,

00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:36.865
there's not a track around the outside,

00:12:36.865 --> 00:12:39.705
the field is right there,
and so you can imagine

00:12:39.705 --> 00:12:42.838
if the stadium was full
of people cheering,

00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:46.021
and the players, they seem so close,

00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:48.668
because there's so little
space around the field,

00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:51.001
other than the field itself.

00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:07.621
And then the final part
of this experience,

00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:10.032
walking up the steps where the players,

00:13:10.032 --> 00:13:14.199
the Barcelona players come
to enter the football match.

00:13:19.088 --> 00:13:21.119
And now entering into the changing room.

00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:22.702
Oh, massage tables!

00:13:31.072 --> 00:13:35.318
That was definitely an
experience, pretty cool to see,

00:13:35.318 --> 00:13:37.832
not only does it walk you
through all of the trophies

00:13:37.832 --> 00:13:40.998
in the museum, but then you
get different perspectives

00:13:40.998 --> 00:13:42.848
and views of the stadium.

00:13:42.848 --> 00:13:45.805
If you are a sports
lover, this is a must-do

00:13:45.805 --> 00:13:47.888
when you visit Barcelona.

00:13:48.999 --> 00:13:50.710
It never ends.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.346
And I did that little
ending a little premature!

00:13:53.346 --> 00:13:55.218
There's still one more place to see,

00:13:55.218 --> 00:13:59.134
and that is the gigantic
Barcelona superstore,

00:13:59.134 --> 00:14:04.025
where you can buy any kind
of jersey, shoes, clothes.

00:14:04.025 --> 00:14:07.948
Just look at the size
of the store, it's huge!

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:10.949
That took about two hours,
and also, I just wanted

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:13.843
to share that, the
reason I originally know

00:14:13.843 --> 00:14:16.737
about the city of Barcelona
from when I was a kid,

00:14:16.737 --> 00:14:19.088
is because of their
football team, originally,

00:14:19.088 --> 00:14:22.453
so that was cool to see,
couldn't compare for me

00:14:22.453 --> 00:14:25.720
to watching a real match at the stadium,

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.897
that would've been really amazing,

00:14:27.897 --> 00:14:31.122
but it was still interesting
to see the museum,

00:14:31.122 --> 00:14:33.440
and then also get a look at the stadium.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.905
We just walked back to the bus stop,

00:14:34.905 --> 00:14:38.123
and we are taking the bus
back to our area of town.

00:14:38.123 --> 00:14:41.623
(upbeat electronic music)

00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:55.211
I think this afternoon, we're just gonna

00:14:55.211 --> 00:14:57.677
kinda walk around leisurely, maybe do

00:14:57.677 --> 00:14:59.281
a little bit of shopping.

00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:00.281
Right, Ying?

00:15:01.238 --> 00:15:03.367
And, we're just gonna kinda take it easy,

00:15:03.367 --> 00:15:06.867
because this is our last day in Barcelona.

00:15:21.622 --> 00:15:22.705
Hello!
- Hola!

00:15:23.768 --> 00:15:27.685
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:34.203 --> 00:15:35.359
House wine?

00:15:35.359 --> 00:15:36.762
- [Employee] Yeah, red?

00:15:36.762 --> 00:15:37.595
- Red.

00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:46.237
Okay, so, we did a little bit of shopping,

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.433
and we just happened to
be walking in this area,

00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:52.693
and I noticed Tapas 24,
and it is about four p.m.

00:15:52.693 --> 00:15:54.189
in the afternoon, so I thought,

00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:57.757
this is the perfect time to
have a little afternoon snack,

00:15:57.757 --> 00:16:00.755
and I know this place
can get extremely busy

00:16:00.755 --> 00:16:03.840
in a couple of hours, they
have a few tables outside,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.017
but then you come downstairs,
kind of in the basement area,

00:16:07.017 --> 00:16:09.476
and that's where the real tapas bar is.

00:16:09.476 --> 00:16:11.731
This is a place that many
of you recommended me,

00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:15.964
so I am happy to be here,
oh, and here comes the first.

00:16:15.964 --> 00:16:16.979
Which one is this?

00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:18.062
- Hi!
- Hello!

00:16:19.569 --> 00:16:20.402
Is this the--

00:16:20.402 --> 00:16:21.490
- [Employee] The king crab salad.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.382
- Oh, this is the king crab salad, okay.

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:26.382
I got a glass of the house red wine.

00:16:28.544 --> 00:16:32.286
This is a king crab salad with avocado,

00:16:32.286 --> 00:16:35.703
and it's quite an interesting look to it,

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:38.242
I'm not sure what's all in here,

00:16:38.242 --> 00:16:40.648
but it's served with these
little pieces of toast,

00:16:40.648 --> 00:16:42.210
there is roe on the bottom.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.154
I'm not where the king
crab, or where the avocado,

00:16:45.154 --> 00:16:48.929
oh, there's the, oh
there are layers to this.

00:16:48.929 --> 00:16:52.846
I will add some of this
to this piece of toast.

00:16:56.938 --> 00:16:59.918
Might need to add a little bit more.

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:03.001
Oh, yes, how's that for a first bite?

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:12.280
That is a little blob of cream, I think.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.666
Then with the king crab,
with the pureed avocado,

00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:19.677
and then with the salty
salmon roe in there,

00:17:19.677 --> 00:17:23.677
just kind of exploding
with salty, fishy juices.

00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:27.792
One of the most famous tapas here

00:17:27.792 --> 00:17:30.599
is what they call the bikini sandwich,

00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:33.830
and it's a little sandwich,
there's cheese in the middle,

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.913
as well as jamon, and so,
I just had to try this.

00:17:41.065 --> 00:17:44.126
That's like the ultimate grilled cheese.

00:17:44.126 --> 00:17:48.624
And I love the ratio of
bread to cheese and ham.

00:17:48.624 --> 00:17:49.903
Oh, wow.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:52.243
And what I like is, it's not too salty,

00:17:52.243 --> 00:17:56.067
but it's filled with cheese,
it's just that one layer

00:17:56.067 --> 00:17:58.507
of jamon which gives it flavor,

00:17:58.507 --> 00:18:01.424
and then the crispy, buttery bread.

00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:06.961
Wow.

00:18:08.503 --> 00:18:11.170
That is an amazing little snack.

00:18:16.526 --> 00:18:18.755
And then I also ordered la bomba,

00:18:18.755 --> 00:18:22.873
and this is a potato cutlet,
with, I think there's some,

00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:25.929
some kind of meat in the middle.

00:18:25.929 --> 00:18:29.179
Oh, that is deep-fried to a crispiness!

00:18:30.411 --> 00:18:32.386
I'm gonna take a spoon
and just crack it open

00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:33.939
and see what's inside.

00:18:33.939 --> 00:18:35.924
Oh yeah, it's filled with meat.

00:18:35.924 --> 00:18:36.757
Fantastic.

00:18:46.641 --> 00:18:47.474
Oh, wow!

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.020
That's awesome!

00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:56.429
It's so crispy around the
crust, around the edges,

00:18:56.429 --> 00:18:59.358
and then it's so creamy in the middle,

00:18:59.358 --> 00:19:01.504
and then with that salty mincemeat.

00:19:01.504 --> 00:19:02.337
Mm!

00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:07.304
That is extraordinarily tasty and salty.

00:19:13.969 --> 00:19:15.409
That's a wonderful little tapa.

00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:19.159
That is a very trendy
tapas bar in Barcelona,

00:19:20.063 --> 00:19:24.378
the sandwich and the la
bomba, that was delicious,

00:19:24.378 --> 00:19:28.536
it's a little cozy place,
but I'm if it gets really

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:31.940
packed in there, it has
an amazing feeling to it,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.231
I'm glad I had a chance to try it,

00:19:34.231 --> 00:19:37.154
but it is a pretty expensive place.

00:19:37.154 --> 00:19:40.228
If you kept on eating, you
could spend a fortune there,

00:19:40.228 --> 00:19:42.005
it's not cheap.

00:19:42.005 --> 00:19:43.923
Oh, this one is the cod salad?

00:19:43.923 --> 00:19:44.997
Okay, gracias.

00:19:44.997 --> 00:19:47.167
We hung out at the hotel
for a little while,

00:19:47.167 --> 00:19:49.657
and now have come out for dinner,

00:19:49.657 --> 00:19:53.342
eating kind of an early
dinner, by Barcelona standards,

00:19:53.342 --> 00:19:56.121
but we are hungry, and
tomorrow we're leaving,

00:19:56.121 --> 00:19:57.445
so I wanted to have dinner.

00:19:57.445 --> 00:19:59.732
Just came to a restaurant
that is very close

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:01.756
to where we're staying,
just around the corner.

00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:05.225
This is a salad de bacalla, which is cod,

00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:08.436
and there's tomatoes in
here, there are onions

00:20:08.436 --> 00:20:12.027
drizzled in a sauce,
and some parsley on top.

00:20:12.027 --> 00:20:13.917
Oh, this looks fantastic!

00:20:13.917 --> 00:20:15.938
Oh, so the cod, I think
the cod is just on the top,

00:20:15.938 --> 00:20:19.819
and then on the top, is that
cod too, or just onions?

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:21.236
Let me taste, oh.

00:20:27.501 --> 00:20:28.334
Mm!

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:34.210
I think that's salted cod, and then,

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.956
that's very refreshing, with
the tomatoes and the onions.

00:20:36.956 --> 00:20:39.772
And then I also got a plate of bread,

00:20:39.772 --> 00:20:41.197
this is a beautiful plate of bread

00:20:41.197 --> 00:20:43.792
which is rubbed in
tomato, maybe some garlic

00:20:43.792 --> 00:20:46.542
and some olive oil, I'm thinking?

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:50.714
Mm!

00:20:51.955 --> 00:20:55.532
I love how they rub the bread
with a little bit of tomato,

00:20:55.532 --> 00:20:59.486
to give it a little bit of
an extra taste dimension

00:20:59.486 --> 00:21:00.569
to the bread.

00:21:02.603 --> 00:21:03.436
Gracias.

00:21:15.134 --> 00:21:16.428
Thank you.

00:21:16.428 --> 00:21:18.921
That was just the appetizer,
and now the main dishes

00:21:18.921 --> 00:21:19.950
have arrived.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.286
Ying and I are splitting
two different dishes.

00:21:22.286 --> 00:21:25.442
This one is hake, which is a type of fish,

00:21:25.442 --> 00:21:29.654
and look at the size of this
hake steak, or is it stuffed?

00:21:29.654 --> 00:21:32.237
No, there's just a piece
stuck in the middle of it.

00:21:32.237 --> 00:21:34.566
But I don't think it's, it's
just a whole piece of fish.

00:21:34.566 --> 00:21:37.388
And then I also ordered
the beef short ribs.

00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:40.417
And these are huge as well,
just at the size of this plate,

00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:43.500
it's like, this is a huge plate of...

00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:47.834
Alright.

00:21:49.898 --> 00:21:51.481
Let me sample this!

00:21:52.887 --> 00:21:54.537
I think this fish is similar to a cod,

00:21:54.537 --> 00:21:57.870
I don't know if I've ever had it before.

00:22:01.995 --> 00:22:02.828
Mm!

00:22:03.853 --> 00:22:07.174
The texture is very soft, and it has that

00:22:07.174 --> 00:22:10.782
little rubbery factor when
you press your teeth together,

00:22:10.782 --> 00:22:14.287
but at the same time, it feels
kind of like a light fish.

00:22:14.287 --> 00:22:15.120
Mm!

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.335
Delicious, and then that's just a white,

00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:19.228
maybe buttery sauce.

00:22:19.228 --> 00:22:20.061
Gravy.

00:22:25.378 --> 00:22:30.208
It's quite plain, but it's
just a good piece of fish!

00:22:30.208 --> 00:22:32.944
Okay, let me reach over
for the short ribs.

00:22:32.944 --> 00:22:35.571
There are huge, and two
of them, not just one

00:22:35.571 --> 00:22:37.994
piece of short rib, but two!

00:22:37.994 --> 00:22:39.012
Wow.

00:22:39.012 --> 00:22:42.595
Let me slice right into
the middle of this.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.024
Oh, that's a lot of meat.

00:22:46.024 --> 00:22:46.857
Okay.

00:22:46.857 --> 00:22:49.344
Okay, I'm gonna need to
get a little stronger

00:22:49.344 --> 00:22:50.677
with my cutting.

00:22:53.076 --> 00:22:53.909
Alright.

00:22:57.828 --> 00:22:58.661
Mm!

00:23:00.858 --> 00:23:05.575
It's a little bit tough, but
I think it's quite plain,

00:23:05.575 --> 00:23:08.440
maybe just with a little bit
of salt before it's grilled.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.357
Maybe with some pepper.

00:23:22.341 --> 00:23:23.724
Mm!

00:23:23.724 --> 00:23:24.864
That is good meat, though.

00:23:24.864 --> 00:23:27.326
Finished with dinner, that food was

00:23:27.326 --> 00:23:29.179
a little bit on the plain side for me,

00:23:29.179 --> 00:23:31.184
and the steak was pretty tough,

00:23:31.184 --> 00:23:34.087
I'm working my jaw right now, but that's,

00:23:34.087 --> 00:23:37.061
that's a decent little neighborhood place,

00:23:37.061 --> 00:23:39.328
a lot of people came just to have a drink

00:23:39.328 --> 00:23:43.028
and to have some tapas
while we were eating there,

00:23:43.028 --> 00:23:45.855
we're just slowly walking
back to the hotel right now,

00:23:45.855 --> 00:23:48.855
so I'm gonna end the vlog for today now,

00:23:48.855 --> 00:23:50.978
this is our last full day in Barcelona,

00:23:50.978 --> 00:23:52.842
tomorrow, we are flying to Lisbon,

00:23:52.842 --> 00:23:55.584
so many more vlogs to come.

00:23:55.584 --> 00:23:56.645

00:23:56.645 --> 00:23:58.704
