00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.220
It's become hard to say anything 
especially on social media

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.960
that won't upset someone somewhere rather a lot.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.220
There's a myriad of things 
people get deeply offended by.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.000
There are perceived slights around economics, nationality, social group, sexual tastes, 
and commitments  of every kind.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.540
This is the result of something extremely positive: democracy.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.180
Democracy makes us, and this is a lovely word gloriously disputatious.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.480
We're no longer surf-like, submissive people 
who just bow to authority.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.460
We're brought up to speak up for ourselves 
and respect our rights.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.540
The problem is that this can, on a bad day, tilt over into a settled, unquestioning kind of self righteousness.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.980
It's an attitude that quickly assumes we know what someone else means when they say something

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.380
about our areas of concern and that they're deliberately trying to cause us offence and, therefore,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.400
that we must respond at once with anger and with pride.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.660
Taking offense can be a gloriously solipsistic emotion where we're always ready to pull up the drawbridge and fire,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.520
rather than work towards achieving 
and understanding of another person.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.320
One takes comfort in why one is right

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.240
rather than attempting that much more daring and interesting exercise:

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.020
trying to imagine why the other person may feel the way they do.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.420
We've forgotten the art of civility:

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.400
the art of trying to work through to an agreement, the art of not necessarily saying when you don't agree.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.820
These may be slightly old-fashioned traits, for their virtues too,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.660
especially in a small world where we can't all shout at the same time

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.120
and we sometimes may have to just learn to live with disagreement rather than always hoping to resolve it.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.800
Furthermore, we should bear in mind that almost all offence is caused inadvertent,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.180
but the person who takes offense readily treats everything as deliberate

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.440
-it's a fatal misunderstanding of others' intentions.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.900
Then there's the issue of perspective:

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.760
we live in a world of larger and smaller offenses;

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.920
there are some properly big offensive things in the world.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.260
The things really to be offended by are that Africa is in chaos,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.380
that certain countries have a proclivity for bombing as a solution, that it's so hard to make a living especially doing something that's tolerable;

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.560
sometimes focus on micro-offenses gets in the way of seeing the big offenses.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.700
We're emerging from thousands of years of history when only a tiny group in society was allowed to get offended;

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.680
the rest of us just how to do the plowing very quietly.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.640
So perhaps wer're still just letting off steam, but on a bad day it can look like everyone is wailing

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.880
and insulting, cursing, and cussing; no one is looking to empathize or find agreement.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.800
Being offended is a choice; it's a way of allowing what someone says to get deep into you,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.760
and it's a way of imagining people's motives as very negative.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.600
Perhaps sometimes we should just look the other way and not let it get to us;

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.500
sometimes, not getting offended should be the truly great and prestigious choice.
