Thinking about whether a method is an accessor or a mutator is really helpful

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.310
when you're trying to decide what a sequence of statements prints. So, let's

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.980
take this sequence of statements for example. We make a string greeting and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.400
fill it with hello. We print out greeting and call replace with arguments h and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.580
j. Looks like I forgot a parantheses at the end. And then, we print greeting

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.518
again. What does this sequence of statements print? Is replace and accessor or

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:26.532
a mutator?
