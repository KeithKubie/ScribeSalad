Now let's help our users find our app
and get some organic traffic for free.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.130
We can do this by search engine
optimization, or SEO for short.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.020
We can also do the same
thing in the App Store,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.550
which is called App Store optimization,
ASO.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.830
&gt;&gt; How does it work?

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.350
The search engine uses an algorithm that
scans all of the information on the web

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.530
and for app stores, the algorithm
scans all of the information in

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.510
all listings of the App Store.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.350
The algorithm will decide
what is the most relevant

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.860
based on the content of your site and
the most relevant sites and apps

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.280
will appear at the top of the results
but under the paid ads of course.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.790
Let's talk about some of the techniques
you can use for SEO and ASO.
