00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.193
As you can see, there are many different
types of resources available to you.

00:00:04.193 --> 00:00:07.689
So it's important to have a way of
determining whether a particular

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.050
resource should be used.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.826
Here are three things you want to
consider before deciding to rely on

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:14.028
a resource for help.

00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:19.371
One, is it up to date, software
versions are constantly changing.

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:22.405
Two, is it accurate, or in other words,

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:27.803
is the person providing the information
knowledgeable enough to trust.

00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:31.445
Three, is it relevant?

00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:35.143
This one can be difficult, especially
when you're just starting out.

00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:40.266
The resources you find may not exactly
match up with what you're trying to do.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:44.306
In that case, you may need to do more
research to verify that it can be used

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:45.650
to solve your problem.
