BEN KONYI: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.060
So my name is Ben Konyi.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.430
I'm an engineer on the
Dart VM, and I also

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.034
do some work with
the Flutter engine.

00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:10.700
And I'm here to talk
to you a little bit

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.040
about my 20% project, which is
the Dart Reddit API Wrapper,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.200
and how you can use it to
moderate Reddit comments.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.180
So basically, how the
Dart Reddit API Wrapper

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.820
came to be was I was really
looking for an excuse

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.630
to be on Reddit at
work So here we are.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.258
So this is my first Dart
package and really my first--

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:37.578
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.870
So this is my first
Dart package and really

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.470
my first major project
written in Dart.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.951
So DRAW is an open-source
API wrapper for Reddit,

00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:51.450
and it's written
completely in Dart,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.980
unlike some of the other Reddit
wrappers for other languages.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.855
And it's very similar
to PRAW, if anyone here

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.610
has used PRAW with Python.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.650
So it's a relatively
simple interface

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.550
and makes it really easy
to query Reddit and perform

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.380
actions.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.830
And of course, it's
open source on GitHub.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.280
So as I'm sure many of you
know, comments on the internet

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.676
are absolutely awful.

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:23.370
It's the main reason I don't go
and look at YouTube comments.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.960
So these are just some comments
that I scraped from Reddit

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.200
today.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.320
And these are the tame ones.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.100
So as you can see,
moderating is difficult,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.670
and this is how I feel on a
day-to-day basis moderating

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.930
a moderate-sized subreddit.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.540
You're trying to plug
holes constantly,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.860
and you can never get them all.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.080
So what I've done is,
using my Reddit API DRAW,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.110
I've also combined it
with another Google

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.670
API called Perspective.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.910
So for those of you who haven't
heard of the Perspective API,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.979
basically, you can take a
comment, send it to this API,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.600
and it will rate it
on various criteria--

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.185
so how toxic a comment
is, if it's coherent

00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:20.190
or not, how inflammatory
it is, if it's

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.780
an attack on the
author, or if it's

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.760
an attack on the commenter.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.390
So without further ado, I have
a quick demo of how this works.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.440
So we take a look here.

00:02:34.284 --> 00:02:35.950
So first of all, as
you can see, there's

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.810
really not much code to this--

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.910
maybe a combined total
of 25 lines of code.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.170
But if we give it
a quick run here,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.351
hopefully we'll see some
comments coming in that--

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:48.850
come on.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.150
There we go.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.900
As you can see here,
we just had a comment

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.907
that came in that
was labeled as spam.

00:02:56.907 --> 00:02:58.740
And here's another one,
attack on commenter,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.130
attack on commenter.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.350
So these are all comments
that exceeded a threshold

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.910
for these criteria.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.190
And I've redacted the
actual comments out of fear

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.580
that some of them might be a
little bit not safe for work,

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.930
and I do value my job.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.770
So this is all built
using DRAW, my API,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.440
and just hitting up the
Perspective API endpoint.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.000
And yeah, this will
continue to go indefinitely

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.310
until, of course, stop it.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.440
And basically, what
I have here, what

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.690
I'm going to be
using this for, for

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.750
my daily moderating activities,
is to make active reports.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.050
So I've commented out the line
that actually sends reports

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.190
to the moderators because I
don't want to spam moderators

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.360
on the funny subreddit.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.460
But as you can see,
it doesn't take

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.350
much to write a
simple Reddit bot.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.980
Yeah.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.140
So thank you.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.290
That's all I have.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.800
So you can find
me here on GitHub,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.140
and I'm always looking
for contributors.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.769
So if anyone wants to
help, I'd be more than

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.130
happy to take your help.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.330
Thank you.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.180
[APPLAUSE]
