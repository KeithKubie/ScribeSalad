00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.460
Congratulations, you've finished lesson three.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.619
In this lesson, you used remotes to push changes up to GitHub and

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:07.738
pulled down changes made by other people.

00:00:07.738 --> 00:00:10.850
You also got practice using pull request to collaborate with other people.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.380
This is also the end of the course.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.380
We hope you enjoyed it.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.880
We certainly had fun making it.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.230
What was your favorite part about making the course, Sarah?

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.380
&gt;&gt; Oh, I really enjoyed thinking about how all the concepts fit together, so

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.566
we could draw the concept map.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.854
What about you?

00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:25.053
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:25.053 --> 00:00:26.320
It's a tough question.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.740
But I really enjoyed adding color to the Asteroids game.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.310
I was so excited when I got that working.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.810
&gt;&gt; What about you guys?

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.920
What did you like about the course?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.980
Or what do you wish that we had done differently?

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.360
Go to the forums to tell us what you think.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.670
&gt;&gt; Thanks again for joining us.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.300
And remember to use Git on your next project.
