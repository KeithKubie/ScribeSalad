[ Applause ]

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.300
Good afternoon.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.600
Thank you, thank you.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.230
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.580
I am a son of Maryland,
I was born in Maryland,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.250
so it's really nice to be home.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.630
So, like I said, it's
a pleasure to be here.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.720
I am thrilled to talk to you about
my new book "Blue Sky White Stars".

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.060
It's written by Sarvinder
Naberhaus and it is a celebration

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.390
of the American flag,
of the symbolism

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.590
of the flag and the people.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.250
Now, if you not familiar
with my work,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.810
I've been illustrating
books for quite some time.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.520
I've illustrated probably
about 30 books.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.350
I've been drawing since I was
very little, about 3 years old.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:23.200
Do we have any 3 year olds here?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.500
Any 3 year olds?

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.550
Does anybody have a 3 year
old brother or sister?

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.090
Is anybody ever been 3 years
old before, at least once?

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.480
Yep, I've been drawing that
long, since I was that little

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.990
and I've been practicing every day.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.760
And if you want to get good
at something, what do you do?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.530
You practice right?

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.270
That's the only way
to get better at it.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.590
So I've been practicing
for a very, very long time.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.780
And recently I was asked
to illustrate this book

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.350
"Blue Sky White Stars" and I
thought it was a really great way

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.220
to celebrate where I'm from.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.310
I'm from America and I wanted
to celebrate the American flag.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.850
Its people, the diversity of its
people, the diversity of the land

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.680
and this was a great opportunity
to celebrate all those things.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.300
So I'm going to take you, has
anybody seen the book yet?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.430
No, well if you haven't you're
going to get to see it now.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.460
So here are a few images from
the book "Blue Sky White Stars".

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:57.330
So basically what the author
did, the text is very sparing

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.810
but it's very powerful and
poignant and it makes a parallel

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:11.620 position:56%
between the colors of the flag, the
symbolism of the flag, and the land,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.630
the people, and its history.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.420
So the book starts off
with very simple text,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:30.120
it says "Blue sky white stars" and
of course, in the American flag,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.450
you'll see the blue
behind the white stars.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.650
And each of the flags,
they correlate to the time

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.640
in history that's being shown in
the image on the opposite page.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:53.660
So here you'll see a picture
of the Statue of Liberty,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.900
blue sky white stars [inaudible]
opposite page you'll see the flag

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.290
so you can make a connection
between both images.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.530
The next page, it says "Red rows"
so you'll see a red row of what?

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:25.360
Of trees. And then on the opposite
side you see red rows of the flag.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.870
The next page says "White
rows" so you'll see white rows

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.390
on the right hand side
on the American flag

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.350
and on the opposite side
you'll see images of,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.010
anybody know what that is?

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.130
What is it?

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.540
A carriage.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.990
It's from the Oregon Trail,
see all the covered wagons.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.540
And you'll see white lines
of the covered wagons.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.640
And then it says "Red,
white, and blue" so you get

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.660
to see the colors of
the flag in nature.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.940
So you see a red barn and red
white and blue sky and snow.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.720
Old Glory, so you'll
see a contrast of nature

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.180
and then a man-made demonstration
of Old Glory, which are fireworks

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.120
over the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.930
Sea waves and then see waves.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.360
Sew together won nation.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.360
Now you see it's a play on
words, you see how she's written

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.930
"Sew together" s-e-w
"won nation" w-o-n nation

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.160
and then "So together one
nation" which is, again,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.510
my focus on this book was to
celebrate America as I know it.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:06.970 position:56%
America is a very diverse land, full
of diverse people, and it was made,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.030
built by a very diverse people.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.580
Well-worn, look you
see Abraham Lincoln,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.320 position:56%
his face after having been President
for several years and faced a lot

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.140
of adversity, so his face
became very well-worn just

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.440
like the American flag.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.850
Woven together, so you see marchers

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:38.830
on the mall during the civil rights
movement on the March on Washington

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.980
and everyone is there together
marching for jobs and freedom.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.930
And here's another
image, it's all American.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.540 position:56%
So you'll see on the left-hand side,
you'll see a baseball game played

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.630
at Wrigley Field and then you'll
see a grandfather and his son

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.790
or great=grandfather and his
son, a great grandson listening

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.390
to the game on the radio.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.860
Now this one was interesting
because I wanted to,

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.760
whenever I'm illustrating
a book I think of images

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.540
that make me feel good and one of
my precious memories was sitting

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.010
on the porch with my
grandmother eating Crackerjacks

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.360
when I was a little
kid in Atlantic City.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.210
I figured I'd tie those two
images, those memories together.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:38.690
And also, quite interestingly
enough, I painted this in;

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:45.510
it was well before, I think it
was in April or May of last year.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.680
And then the following
fall, the Cubs ended

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.070
up winning the World Series,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.760
so that was my prediction
of the World Series.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:05.430
Stand proud, so here we have
an image of many of the people

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.330
who participated or experienced
the American Civil War

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.850
of all races and genders.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.990
There's actually a woman who's
standing second from the right,

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.790
well there's Harriet
Tubman on the right,

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.810
and then there's a woman
who's posed as a male soldier.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:31.120
Apparently there are a
number of women who fought,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.130
who saw battle during the Civil War

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.310
who had donned Civil War
uniforms posing as men

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.130
so that they could
participate in the battle.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.550
And also there's Native Americans,
there's a Japanese soldier,

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.580
a Spanish soldier all the way
on the left and a white soldier

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:56.600
on the second from the right,
so it was a combined effort,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.510
so I wanted to emphasize that
part of American history.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:06.040
And on the right, you have the
graduate, who's a female graduate,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:12.640
who's a doctoral candidate who's
graduating, receiving an honor.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.310
My girlfriend, very
graciously, posed for this one,

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.440
so that was very nice of her.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.050
Here's one of [inaudible] rising
up, so you have a parallel

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:32.160
between an Army vet, military
veteran flying a flag as well as,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.980
on the right-hand side, you'll see
the, I think it's the Apollo 11,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:43.680
the first spacecraft
that landed on the moon,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.420 position:56%
not the rocket, but what was inside.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.220
And initially, actually
when I was doing this image,

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.960
I made a mistake of, I had
like the Challenger shuttle,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.950
one of the shuttles, the
space shuttles that was,

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.580
it was not launched until years and
years later, so I had to go back

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.120
and change that to make sure
that it was historically accurate

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.810
because I'm sure, I know there
are a lot of people out there

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.780 position:56%
who really love history and they
love to tell you what you did wrong.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.010
So I didn't want that to happen,
so I went back and changed it.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:28.930
And there's the same rocket flying
past the American bald eagle.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.390 position:56%
So I thought the author did a really
great job of making a parallel

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:41.760
between the symbolism of the
flag and the actual history,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.400
actual people, landscape
and so forth.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.070
So here, they've landed on the moon
and is planting the flag there,

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.750
so you'll see reflection
in the flag.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.270
But I did make one
mistake on this image

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.410
but I'm not going to
share that with you.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.070
I'll let you find that,
it's not that hard to find.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:07.130
Red, white, and blue
sky, white stars forever,

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.870
so you'll see the flag
has been planted

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.190
and the astronauts are
heading back to the,

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:19.440 position:56%
I forget what that thing is called,
whatever the spacecraft is that land

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.750
on the moon to go back home.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.210
And you see the Earth, the
lander, what did you call it?

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:27.190
Lander, that makes perfect sense.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.510
Okay, hold your question;
I'm almost done, almost done.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.250
That is awesome.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:41.510
So on the back cover, you'll
see an image, it's a reverse

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:49.840 position:56%
of what you see on the cover except
now you can see what they're looking

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.590
at, all the people are looking up
at something and you see the stars

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.020
in their eyes and you
can see the fireworks.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.930
And I don't know if you can see it
very well but my favorite detail

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.800
of this image is the light coming
through the little boy's ears,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.770
I don't know if you can see that.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:09.500
So this book, I think I worked
on it for about maybe four

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.200
or five months creating the
art work, usually it takes

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.310
about that long, between three
and five months to create images

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.760
for a thirty-two or
so page picture book.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.610
Most of the paintings are
about the same size as you see,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.400
actually that's not right, the
paintings are about twice as large

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.490 position:56%
as what you see in the book or more.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:29.870
Some of them are even much larger,

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.410
the image of the fireworks
is probably the largest image

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:37.290
in the book, largest
painting in the book.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:45.150
People often have questions
about my technique or the way

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:50.250
that I create the paintings
and it's very interesting.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:56.220
I have a video and it shows exactly
how fast I can create a painting,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.760
I'm really fast.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.060
Okay, you've got to pay attention.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.360
Here we go.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.580
I'm working on the
all-American painting here,

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.850
the great-grandfather,
great-grandson.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:24.570
Fast. So I work subtractively,
so I put paint on the canvas

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:30.020
and then I wipe the paint
away to create values.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.440
That's just the first step.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.330
And then after that, I'll paint
over that and then I'll paint

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.800
over that again, it
usually takes about three

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.370
or four days per painting.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.030
So we have a little bit less
than ten minutes to go and I want

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.280
to give you an opportunity to
ask questions if you have them.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.580
Who had a question?

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.880
Someone over here had a question.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.150
What's your question?

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.970
Oh yeah, you can go up to the
microphone to ask your question.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:58.870
He forgot?

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.340
Oh, that happens.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.640
Okay, we have another.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.300 position:56%
If you have a question, just walk up
to the microphone and stand in line

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.200
so we can get through it.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.210
No, not this microphone,
that microphone.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.510
He said "microphone".

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.930
&gt;&gt; How'd you draw the
picture so fast?

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.290
&gt;&gt; Oh, well that was a joke.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:25.850
That was, I think it's called
time lapse on your phone.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:30.440
It records you in real time and
then it speeds it up real fast.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:37.880
&gt;&gt; When did you, like when would
you normally finish any book?

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.820
&gt;&gt; When do I normally
finish any book?

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:49.320
&gt;&gt; I work on probably one
or two books per year.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.740
&gt;&gt; Whoa.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.770
&gt;&gt; Why [inaudible] so fast?

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.970
&gt;&gt; Say that again.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:03.100
&gt;&gt; Why do you finish books so fast?

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.480
&gt;&gt; I don't really work that fast,

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.840
that was just kind
of a camera trick.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.140
It takes a lot longer to do that.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:20.150
&gt;&gt; How do you, like how do
you draw the pictures so well?

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.530
&gt;&gt; Oh, because I have been
doing this for a long time

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.070
and the more you do something
the better you get at it.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.750
So when you practice and practice,
you get better, that's the key

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.700
to getting better,
repetition, doing it over

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.990
and over again til you master it.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.290
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:40.250
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.960
&gt;&gt; How good are you?

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.660
&gt;&gt; Okay, well I think
you answer that question.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:16:00.700
[inaudible]

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.870
&gt;&gt; I can draw so fast and
I can draw a building.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:11.520
&gt;&gt; Nice. I don't like drawing
buildings; I don't like it at all.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.820
That makes sense.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.060
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite book--

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.360
&gt;&gt; My favorite-

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.660
&gt;&gt; that you like to draw?

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.060
&gt;&gt; That I like to draw?

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.880
I always say my favorite book is
the next one that I'm working on,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.000
so the next book that I'm
working on, there's two books,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.300 position:56%
one book is called "This is for us".

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.660
It's written by Kwame Alexander.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.070
And then the next book after
that is a book that I've written

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.310
and will illustrate called
"Basketball" it'll be

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:47.670
about the history of basketball.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.020
I'm really excited about that.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:55.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I know the question you
answered in the middle of the story,

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.240
"No Shadows on the Moon".

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.540
&gt;&gt; No shadows on the booth?

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.840
Oh, on the moon.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.310
Oh, there are no shadows
on the moon?

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.340
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.210
[inaudible] go back and fix it.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:18.260
&gt;&gt; Do you talk to the author before
you write like draw the pictures,

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.900
like talk to the author about what
you want to paint [inaudible]?

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.660
&gt;&gt; Do I talk to the author?

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.960
Usually, I don't.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.360
Usually I like to have
my own creative space

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.660
to create the artwork.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.030
Sometimes the author likes to tell
me what to do but that doesn't work

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.180
out because I don't get to
tell the author what to do,

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.480
so they don't get to do the same.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.830
&gt;&gt; How did you come up
with the title of the book?

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:51.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't come up with the
title for "Blue Sky" the author came

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.380
up with the title for that one.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.620
But usually if I'm working on
a book, if I've written it,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.760
and I'm thinking about a title,
I try to think of something

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.230
that will encompass the whole
book, that'll make sense,

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.010
that'll put it all in a
nutshell and make people think

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.270
about what the book might be about,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.700
something that will
grab their attention.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.000
&gt;&gt; Did you mix colors?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.770
&gt;&gt; Do I mix colors?

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.890
All the time, half of
the painting is done

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.190
on a palette, is mixing colors.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.490
That's half of the painting.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.060
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite book--

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.480
&gt;&gt; What's my favorite
book that I've written

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.630
or my favorite book of all time?

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.010
&gt;&gt; When you were a kid.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.700
&gt;&gt; Oh, I really liked
"Where the Wild Things Are".

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.000
That was my favorite.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.160
&gt;&gt; Where do you get
your inspiration from?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.560
&gt;&gt; I get my inspiration from
all over, something that I read,

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.160
something that I might see,
from music, from an experience

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:15.000
that I've had, everything finds
its way into the work that I do.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.610
&gt;&gt; Do you paint from
photos or real life?

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:22.910
&gt;&gt; I do both.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:29.840 position:56%
Sometimes I'll take photos of myself
posing as my subject or friends

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:36.590
or family or I'll find
photographs in books in the library

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:42.330
or on the Internet and film,
wherever I can find it.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.660
&gt;&gt; When did you start drawing?

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.100
&gt;&gt; When did I what?

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.620
&gt;&gt; start drawing.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.920
&gt;&gt; When did I start drawing?

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.220
I started drawing when I
was about three years old.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; What was your first illustration?

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.430
&gt;&gt; My first illustration, well
the first drawing I ever did was a

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.860
self-portrait when I
was probably about three

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.890
but it didn't really look
like me, it was pretty bad.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.560
I was new you know.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.030
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite colors?

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.910
&gt;&gt; I don't have a favorite
color, I like all the colors.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.880
&gt;&gt; What year [inaudible]
you start drawing?

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.850
&gt;&gt; I started drawing in 1977.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.910
He's like "that means
nothing to me."

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.600
&gt;&gt; Who's your favorite artists?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:42.040
&gt;&gt; Oh, I have a lot of
artists that I really like.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.780
It's a very long list.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.620
You ever heard of John
Singer Sargent?

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.520
Really like him.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.040
M.C. Wyatt.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.780
It's a very long list.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.240
Those are some of my favorites.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.710
Michelangelo, I like him too.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.420
Everybody likes him.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.550
&gt;&gt; How do you get your
ideas for your books?

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.940
&gt;&gt; I think of my past experiences.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.060
When I read the words, I
see pictures, when you read,

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.190 position:56%
you see pictures in your head right?

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.230
You can imagine what's going on?

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.390
So whatever I think about when I
read the words then I'll make a

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.690
sketch of that.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.980
And if it works, great,
if it doesn't,

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.480
then I have to keep working on it.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.190
&gt;&gt; How long does it
take you to decide what

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:35.600
to incorporate into [inaudible]?

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.290
&gt;&gt; How long does it
take, say it again.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.500
&gt;&gt; How long does it
take you to decide what

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.230
to incorporate into [inaudible]?

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.090
&gt;&gt; How long does it take what
to incorporate in the drawings?

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.640
I'm actually pretty quick.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.400 position:56%
I can read a manuscript and have
all the sketches done in a few days.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.670
You know I just read it over
and over and over again.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.970
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.150
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think we're about,
I think we've almost ran,

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.510
we've run out of time but
thank you all so much.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.500
Thank you for all your
questions and getting in line,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.370
thank you, I appreciate it.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.030

of the Library of Congress.
