00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.501
FREEZING ANTIFREEZE?
WHAT?

00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:05.067
Man: OH, YEAH.
THERE'S A NICE HEALTHY CHUNK

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:06.334
OF ANTIFREEZE RIGHT THERE.

00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:08.567
WHAT?! NO!
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:11.534
Narrator: SO HOW DOES HE FREEZE
ANTIFREEZE?

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:14.801
"ANTIFREEZE" IS THE COMMON NAME
FOR ETHYLENE GLYCOL,

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:17.234
WHICH IS USED TO STOP
CAR RADIATORS FREEZING.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:19.701
THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S GOT
AN INCREDIBLY LOW

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:22.300
FREEZING POINT
OF MINUS 36 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.167
OR MINUS 37.7 DEGREES CELSIUS.

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:28.267
THIS MEANS THAT EVEN THOUGH
IT'S CALLED ANTIFREEZE

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:31.200
YOU CAN STILL FREEZE IT
IF YOU GET IT COLD ENOUGH.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.701
TO FREEZE THE ANTIFREEZE

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.300
GRANT USES LIQUID NITROGEN.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.067
NOW, NITROGEN
HAS A BOILING POINT

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:40.300
OF MINUS 321 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.167
THAT'S MINUS 196 DEGREES
CELSIUS.

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:45.767
THAT MAKES IT A LOT, LOT

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.300
LOTS COLDER

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.634
THAN THE FREEZING POINT
OF THE ANTIFREEZE.

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:51.234
THE ANTIFREEZE
AND THE NITROGEN

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:53.701
WANT TO REACH WHAT'S CALLED
THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM.

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.667
WHEN HE PUTS THE RELATIVELY
WARMER ROOM-TEMPERATURE

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.667
ANTIFREEZE
INTO THE MUCH COLDER

00:00:58.667 --> 00:00:59.901
LIQUID NITROGEN

00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.968
THEY BOTH WANT
TO REACH THE SAME TEMPERATURE.

00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:05.334
THE LIQUID NITROGEN
WILL DO THIS BY HEATING UP,

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:07.033
WHICH IS WHY WE SEE IT BOILING,

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.100
WHILE THE ANTIFREEZE IS GONNA
LOSE SOME OF THAT HEAT,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.067
AND THIS IS WHY IT FREEZES.

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:14.334
Linsell: BECAUSE
THE LIQUID NITROGEN IS SO COLD

00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:16.133
IT TAKES VIRTUALLY NO TIME

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.767
FOR THE HEAT
TO LEAVE THE ANTIFREEZE

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:21.000
BRINGING IT BELOW
IT'S FREEZING TEMPERATURE,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.534
TURNING IT INTO A SOLID.

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:23.968
Man: OH, YEAH.
THERE'S A NICE HEALTHY CHUNK

00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:25.400
OF ANTIFREEZE RIGHT THERE.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.834
ANTIFREEZE
IS INCREDIBLY POISONOUS,

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:30.534
AND LIQUID NITROGEN
IS DANGEROUSLY COLD.

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:33.000
SO DEFINITELY DO NOT
TRY THIS AT HOME.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.968
