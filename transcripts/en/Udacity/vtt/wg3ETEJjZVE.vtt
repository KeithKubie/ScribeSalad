00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.443
And the answer is A, this vertical line right here. Since every single point

00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:08.932
along a vertical line has the same x-coordinate, but a different y-coordinate,

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:13.230
this definitely doesn't fit the criterion for a function that we've put up.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.256
However, for every other curve or line on this graph, each horizontal position

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:21.380
only has one corresponding vertical position. Even though, two of the graphs on

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.340
here, F and D, don't represent equations that you've seen before, you can still

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.389
tell, right off the bat, that both of these are functions. Even though you don't

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:30.940
know anything else about them.
