&gt;&gt;Stephanie: My name is Stephanie Magin and
I'm on the Leadership Development team as

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:28.960
part of Google EDU and I manage a program
called, "Managing Your Energy," of which many

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.380
of you are alumni. Exciting thing is that
we have the man behind the content here--

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.380
[man coughs]

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.380
to talk to us today, so we're really excited.
I just wanted to mention, too, as I was kind

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.380
of running the numbers this morning, over
1200 Google-, Googlers, so over that number

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.380
of people here have been exposed to this content.
Tony Schwartz, like I said, is kind of like

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.380
the man behind the, you know, the class that
we do here called Managing Your Energy; co-author

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.380
of the book that spurred that, which was The
Power of Full Engagement.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.380
Managing energy, not time, so helping us as
well as Google to, to kind of go through that

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.380
paradigm shift and he's to talk to us today
about his new book that came out in May. And

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.380
it is already a bestseller on The New York
Times and Wall Street Journal called, Why

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.380
the Way We're Working Isn't Working. And he's
gonna share some kind of new research with

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:54.000
us today that gets at a lot of that we already
know, but kind of looking at it in a new way.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:10.080
And we're also gonna get to hear from some
of the alumni of the class about the changes

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080
that you guys have been able to, to make through
exposure to the content, so that's gonna be

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.210
fun. So, Tony is the founder and CEO of The
Energy Project, which helps individuals in

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.039
organizations increase their capacity through
the science of, of higher performance.

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.820
So, all of this stuff that we're going to
be hearing today is based on science and research,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.859
which is great for us data, data driven Googlers.
So, just really quick, background on Tony,

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.729
started his career as a, as journalist and
had lots of different kind of journalistic

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.969
and editorial positions, working at such publications
as The New York Times, Newsweek, The New York

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:36.979
and Esquire magazines and Fast Company, and
he also co-authored the number one, worldwide

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:50.670
best-selling book on The Art of the Deal,
which he co-wrote with Donald Trump. So, without

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.979
further ado, let's welcome Tony Schwartz.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:54.979
[applause]

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:03.630
&gt;&gt;Tony: Thanks, Stephanie. Hi, Googlers. It's
good to be here with you. How's everybody

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.149
doing?

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:12.750
&gt;&gt;female audience member 1: Great.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:23.030
&gt;&gt;Tony: Good? All right. So, it's, it's, I
wanna see if this resonates with you. I want

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.330
you to think about yourself as "Johnny," in
this little story I'm gonna tell you and I

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.570
want you to s-, tell me if at the end it,
it resonates with your own experience in your

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.430
own life. So, it's 7 AM somewhere in Mountain
View, or wherever you happen to live--

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.430
[baby crying]

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.120
and you, Johnny has just woken up and he needs
to get downstairs for breakfast by 7:15, out

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.900
the door to school by 7:30. But on this particular
morning, he doesn't get downstairs and his

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.590
father is downstairs making his breakfast
cause he's a modern dad.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.930
Mother has already gotten off to work. Goes
to the bottom of the stairs, yells up to Johnny,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.900
"Johnny, your breakfast is getting cold. You're
gonna be late. Hurry on down." And Johnny

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.939
says, "I'm not going to school today."

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.239
So his father trots up the stairs, he sits
down on the foot of Johnny's bed. Johnny's

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.689
got the covers pulled up all the way to his
chin. Says to him, "Johnny, gimme three good

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.980
reasons why you're not gonna go to school
today."

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.769
Johnny says, "Fine. Number one: I don't like
the kids. Number two: The kids don't like

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.040
me. And number three: It's too hard."

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.969
Father says, "Ok, Johnny, now I'm gonna give
you three good reasons why you are going to

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:37.459
school today. Number one: I'm your father
and I'm telling you, you're going to school

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.550
today. Number two: You're 47 years old.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.209
[laughter]

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.819
And number three: You're the principal of
the school."

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.159
[laughter]

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.140
So this is, this is where we find ourselves,
right? You know, there are those days where

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.499
you'd rather stay there with covers, you know,
with the cover right up to your chin and not

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:01.099
get out of bed. I mean, how many of you would
say that in the last two or three years that

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.409
demand in your life has been higher than it's
ever been before? How many would say that?

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.799
Ok, so that's almost the whole room.

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:15.120
Over a thousand people, by the way. How many
of you would say, given that these last couple

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.000
of years have been so intense, and, of course,
with the economy the way it is and all that,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.251
there's someone, some reason why, you know,
it's been harder the last couple of years?

00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:27.332
How many of you would say that you would expect,
given all that, things are starting to look

00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:34.509
a little better now, the bar in the upcoming
year will finally be lowered? Hahahaha.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.490
We got one person and he just lost his job.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.680
[laughter]

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.770
But everybody else says, "No, no." Here's
the $64,000 question: You're, you're demand

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.729
is going up, you think it will continue to
go up, how many of you expect your capacity

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:58.380
to meet that demand to rise right along with
the demand? So, that's not good, right?

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.710
That's not good and that's really the, the
absolute core. We really never, in human history,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.960
have had this particular challenge before,
and here's the challenge. The challenge is

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.700
that this is the volume of your demand in
the vertical axis here, this is the, this

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.220
is your age in the horizontal axis, so from
early to late, how many of you are getting

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.220
older?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.220
[laughter]

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:31.120
About half? So, so, the demand in your life
starts to go up and sure enough, and the great

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.389
thing is, that almost no matter what you do
to yourself, and do to your body, up until

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.830
a certain age your capacity stays out ahead
of your demand. But then in a certain moment,

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.940
it peaks out and that moment actually, physically,
is about 30 years old. About 30 years old.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.830
So, actually, we're-, for rare for my talks,
in this room there's some people who are still

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.240
got the capacity out at the demand, but guess
what? That won't last forever. And then what

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.740
happens is, the, there is a point at which
this crosses and that's a bad moment. That's

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.800
a bad moment because all kinds of terrible
things happen when demand exceeds your capacity.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.819
And when I say this has never been the case
before in human history, our capacity, given

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:18.680
the demands we've had, has always basically
been sufficient until the last ten or twenty

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.259
or thirty years, to meet the demands we're
facing. And, of course, you know all the reasons

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.009
why the demand has gone up so high relative
to our capacity because you're responsible

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:30.620
for most of them. You know, at Google.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.289
Meaning it's the volume of information now
available to us and flooding into our lives.

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.300
It's the number of ways we can communicate
with each other. It's the difficulty of being

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.389
in a situation where you don't have to communicate.
All those things are going on and they're

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:52.690
affecting it. So, the problem is that in the
face of this rising demand, we don't stop

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.770
to ask the question, "What's the cost?"

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.759
And we have lived since the Industrial Revolution
with a certain paradigm about how work should

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:07.490
happen in a modern, in a, in a market economy,
and it's that "more, bigger, faster" is the

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:15.039
way to go. But the premise that I operate
on and that I think we're beginning to see

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:20.690
progressive leaders and progressive companies
begin to embrace is that "more, bigger, faster"

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.800
leads to value that is narrow, shallow, and
short-term. Could there be a better example

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.789
in the, the world today than BP, right?

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:37.050
That was all, entirely, about "more, bigger,
faster." What about Toyota? It was about,

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.210
even they acknowledge, BP may not fully acknowledge
this yet, but Toyota acknowledges that "more,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.349
bigger, faster" was the problem. Toyota b-,
I, Mr. Toyota himself.

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:53.319
So, this is not a way we can go and part of
the problem is that we don't have the capacity

00:07:53.319 --> 00:08:00.379
to go "more, bigger, faster" without all kinds
of consequences. And the, the reason we can

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:04.879
continue to operate as if we do, is that we
take capacity for granted. If there's more

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:09.099
to do, we'll simply expand our capacity, and
we'll be able to do it. So when I ask you

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:14.470
the question, "Do you expect your capacity
to rise right along with your demand?" you're

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.730
brought up a little short.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.190
It's like, what do you, what you mean by that?
I, I'm, I'm not quite sure wh-, I never thought

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.380
about capacity before. I have a lot of skills
or a lot of talents. What's this thing with

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.710
capacity? Well, capacity is the fuel in your
tank.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:34.690
Capacity it what makes it possible for you
to bring your skill and talent to life. So,

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.190
without capacity, no matter how much skill
and talent you have, and you have a ton, it's

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.330
not gonna be able, it's not gonna be possible
for you to produce it. And the other thing

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:52.089
is that though our resources are finite, we
treat them as if they're infinite. And I'm

00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:56.420
talking about our inner resources. This same,
exact issue exists in the planet, doesn't

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.420
it?

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.050
We have made the assumption for a long, long
time that it doesn't matter how we spend down

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.700
the planet's resources because there's plenty
more where that came from. Well, those of

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.140
us who are even half clued in know that's
nonsense. And that in a world in which we

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.930
do not find ways to discover either alternative
resources or to renew the existing resources

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:23.960
after we use them, we're in all kinds of trouble.
The same exact thing is true for us as human

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:31.600
beings, personally, internally. So, up until
now, we've used as the vehicle to meet rising

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.850
demand, we've used time, right? So when there's
more to do, we simply invest more hours.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:46.890
But the problem with that is this: there ain't
any more time. You got 168 hours in your week,

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.890
you're never gonna have another hour, and
almost everybody in this room has a dance

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:56.450
card that's full. Nobody is looking for ways
to fill their free time, are they? So that's

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.130
a problem. That's one of the capacity problems.
We have assumed that the way that you can

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.300
get more done is to put in more hours, but
there aren't any more hours.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:11.800
And that's where this other way of looking
at the world really evolved for us. And that's

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.010
because energy can be expanded. Now, look,
there, energy can't be expanded, actually,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:24.260
as you know, but energy can be converted from
one form to another form. So in practical,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.610
in practical terms for you as a human being,
you have the potential to bring more energy

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:36.070
to the table depending on how you manage and
cultivate your energy, and you can regularly

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.660
renew your energy. And here's the thing: time
is outside you.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.160
Time is something which over you, ultimately,
have no control. It moves past you like a

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:51.690
train moving off into the distance, but energy
is inside you. You have the power to influence

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.519
your own energy. So as soon as you begin to
understand what energy really is all about,

00:10:56.519 --> 00:11:01.150
you're in a whole different kind of situation
in terms of being able to take more control

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:09.250
of your life. So, energy, we define energy,
the folks here who teach it at Google, define

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.240
energy in pure, simple physics terms.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:19.370
Energy is the capacity to do work. More energy,
more capacity. So the question is, can we

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:27.620
get you, can I help you and can the folks
here help you to systematically build the

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:34.840
energy available to you? That's really the
issue. And there are four kinds of energy.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.410
Those of you who been through the class know
that there are four sources of energy that

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.170
a human being needs.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.950
A car can run on gas or, you know, more recently,
a car can run on electricity, but a human

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:51.480
being actually needs four. So you need physical
energy, quantity. You need emotional energy.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.370
That's a particular quality of energy. You
need mental energy -- that's the focus of

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:01.089
your energy. And you need spiritual energy,
which we're -- the energy of the human spirit,

00:12:01.089 --> 00:12:05.870
which we define simply as the energy derived
from the experience that what you do, really

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:11.130
matters wherever you do it. Or the alignment
of your energy, meaning that your energy is

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:16.000
aimed toward a very unconscious goal. So,
there they are -- four sources of energy.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.670
If you can recruit all of those and regularly
renew them, you're gonna fire on all cylinders,

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:31.220
but, but we don't. Why don't we? Because it
takes consciousness to do that.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:37.670
And really what I think I'm talking about,
at the profound level, is an evolutionary

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:44.220
leap in consciousness. I can get away with
saying that at Google. An evolutionary leap

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:52.880
in consciousness to move toward the kind of
intentionality that's now required to meet

00:12:52.880 --> 00:13:00.720
the demands that we face. So, fierce intentionality,
I use the word fierce, obviously, advisably

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.880
because there is so much about our lives that
happens habitually and automatically and outside

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:17.760
our conscious minds and conscious intention.
So, to really seize back control of your destiny,

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:24.810
you need to br-, apply a kind of intentionality
that's never been required of you before.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:32.570
And this is an intentionality, listen, we
have, we have invested enormous energy in

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:40.160
the world, and Google is a wonderful and positive
example what happens when you invest energy

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:47.589
in understanding and managing better and more
efficiently the external world.

00:13:47.589 --> 00:13:54.259
Wonderful, look at what you've produced. It's
extraordinary and there are, you have fellow

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:57.880
organizations and companies that have also
done great, great work about mastering the

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:05.180
external world. But we have vastly, vastly
undervalued and underinvested in understanding

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:12.040
and managing the inner world. And the inner
world -- let's put aside, you know, whatever

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:19.170
new age connotations or psychodynamic connotations
that has -- the inner world is where these

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:26.480
sources of energy are being produced. They're
coming from inside you.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.760
They're coming from inside you. So to know
about them is the, is the first necessity

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:36.670
to understand what's going on, effectively
inside you, is the first critical necessity

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:42.180
in being able to change the way you manage
it. We have to start to value something that

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:49.279
has been invisible to most of us forever.
And I like to say that the inner life is our

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.620
own personal China and India.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:58.560
Meaning, it's the place where we have the
biggest potential for growth, where we ought

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:06.149
to be making the biggest investment of our
time and energy because there's so much untapped

00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:13.420
there. It is terra incognita. It's a vast,
that inner landscape is a vast, untrafficked,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:19.509
unmet territory. Bob Keegan at Harvard, who's
a wonderful thinker about development says

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:25.389
that we are the most over informed and under
reflective people in the history of the world.

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:30.910
That's a scary thing. But the big, the, the
thing that's so profound to me, not only to

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:38.920
you, but for organizations, is that the future
competitive advantage all lies in your ability

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.720
to master this inner world. So that could
be seen as intimidating or it could be seen

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:49.540
as a wonderful challenge and opportunity.
I choose to see it as the latter.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:56.259
So, here's from a, from a, from, from a technological
perspective, the way I look at it is that

00:15:56.259 --> 00:16:01.270
our hardware, our hardwiring, has not changed
over the last several hundred years. There's

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:05.699
nothing's changed. Kids think that their brains
operate differently, and they can do more

00:16:05.699 --> 00:16:10.880
things than their parents can do. It's nonsense.
Their, their brains have not changed in that

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:19.680
way, or not so substantially, but the demands
on our hardware have increased so significantly.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:27.769
And there, it turns out that there is a science
and a technology to, that makes it possible.

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:33.740
In effect, what there is is, there's a, there's
the potential for an upgraded operating system

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:40.500
 -- the ability to use a whole different kind
of software to run your own operating system,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:46.110
your internal operating system than there
was even ten, twenty, thirty years ago. Here's

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:54.920
why we don't know much about it, among other
things. We don't know much about it because

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.300
[man coughs]

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:04.880
it's multidisciplinary, and we live in a world
of specialists. And the power if it is that

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.280
it, the physical dimension affects the emotional
dimension and then the mental dimension affects

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.180
the physical dimension. And all of these are
intermingled, but the folks who are expert

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.150
about any given one them don't talk to each
other.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:21.330
That's the work we've tried to do, is to try
to bring together a series of disciplines

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:27.630
and the research from those disciplines to
make it possible for you to have a life that

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:36.820
is not only productive, but is satisfying
and sustainable. Now, why is it? Why is it

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:42.080
that this isn't working? Well, this is what
we think the core understanding and what I'm

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:48.550
gonna spend the rest of my time with you talking
about is, is that we made an assumption that

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.800
we should operate in the same way computers
do. Meaning, at high speeds, continuously,

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.070
for long periods of time, running multiple
programs at the same time.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:18:05.130
But those of you been through any part of
this work know that that's not the way, and

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:11.570
some of you just know it instinctively. That's
not the way we're designed. We are designed

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:19.810
to be rhythmic beings. We're designed to pulse
between expending energy, between expending

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:26.700
energy and regularly renewing your energy,
and we don't do either of those very well.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:32.580
Now here's, that's interesting. It's no surprise
to you to think, "I don't do so well at renewing

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.810
my energy because renewal gets no respect
in the world we live in." Right?

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:45.600
Renewal, rest, recovery -- that's for slackers.
That's not for Googlers. Googlers spend energy,

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.520
slackers renew energy. So that's not so much
surprising, but it turns out that we don't

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.920
do very well at spending energy either. Meaning,
we spend tons of it, but we don't spend it

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:05.610
in efficient, productive, useful ways or at
least not relative to our potential. So I

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:12.600
wanna kind of dive in a little bit on both
sides of this equation and help you, see if

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:18.040
you can kind of take a different perspective
on the way you're doing each of these two

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.990
things -- renewing energy, spending energy.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:27.270
So, let's start with the most important component
of renewal. I see a gentleman in the back

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:32.220
of the room yawning. He's, that's my cousin.
He's doing that for me to lead me to this

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:38.680
point, which is, there is, I'm gonna, I wanna
sort of try and explode several myths about

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.130
renewal because there are so many myths about
the, the role of renewal. And the first one

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:50.940
has to do with sleep because sleep is the
single most important renewal activity and

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:57.570
the single most undervalued renewal activity;
something we find a hundred ways to rationalize

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:04.970
not doing enough of. So the, the myth is:
I don't need much sleep. And this wonderful

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.150
quote from Thomas Roth at the Henry Ford Sleep
Disorder Center,

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.150
[reads quote]

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.680
"The percentage of the population
who need less than five hours of sleep per

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.320
night,
rounded to a whole number,

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.540
is zero"

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:26.310
So, what we know in reality is that, actually,
97.5 percent of the population needs at least

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:31.000
seven to eight hours of sleep. Ninety-five
percent of us needs seven to eight hours.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.290
Two and a half percent of us need more than
eight hours and two and a half percent of

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:43.310
us lead, need less than eight hours, seven
to eight hours, ok? So, 97.5 percent of the

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:48.510
people sitting in this room today need to
sleep a minimum of seven to eight hours in

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:54.320
order to be fully rested. How many people
in this room do not consistently sleep seven

00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:01.050
to eight hours? Ok, so that's about 80 percent
of the room. That's pretty interesting. That's

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.050
pretty interesting.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:09.250
What's the reality, I'm sorry, what's the
rationalization that most of us use? Well,

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.750
the rationalization most of us use for not
sleeping that much is number one: I don't

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:19.100
have time, right? I don't have time; I've
got too much to do. And then the related one,

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:26.670
which is the myth, is this: is, oops, I guess
it's not quite yet. The related one, the related

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.980
one is: If I sleep an hour longer, and this
something you either say to yourself consciously

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:37.400
or maybe unconsciously, if I sleep an hour
longer, I'll get an extra hour of work done.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:43.550
Right? It gives me another hour in my day.
I'm sorry, if I sleep it, one less hour, I'll

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:44.590
have it.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:50.570
That was pretty off. If I sleep one less hour,
I'll have one more hour that I can do work

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:59.060
in, right? Well, that's nonsense. Why? Because
when you have insufficient sleep, the costs

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:04.360
to you cognitively are extraordinary. I'm
gonna get to that in just a moment, but here's

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:09.020
how important sleep is and again, some of
you have, some of you may remember this study.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.251
But it, to me, is the most powerful study
ever done about the importance of sleep, and

00:22:13.251 --> 00:22:14.630
it was done on rats.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:20.890
So, this guy, Allan Rechtschaffen at the University
of Chicago, probably one of the two or three

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.970
leading sleep researchers in the world, did
this research, this very famous research,

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:32.680
which he, which he deprived these rats of
sleep for as long as it took till he got the

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.690
conclusion he wanted. And what happened is
that after, and this is all, every one of

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.460
these really interesting, what happened is
after two or three days, they were expending

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.940
twice the energy that they would if they had
had enough sleep.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.950
Now, th-, let's just assume the parallels
exist for human beings. Because he took these

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:55.220
rats all the way to death, this experience
has not been re-, redone with human beings;

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:01.030
little bit of an ethical problem to do it
with human being, right? But, but, think about

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:06.490
this. In order to stay up, you have to seek
an alternative source of energy, so what you

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:11.920
do is you, the system naturally responds by
expending more energy. What it means is, whatever

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.430
energy you're expending when you are sleep
deprived, is energy not available to do the

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.120
things you might otherwise do, other than
trying to stay up.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.220
That's interesting. Then the next thing that
happens is they overeat; same reason. They're

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.220
trying to get some form of energy in the form
of glucose, so in order to get that, to overcome

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:35.250
the ab-, absence of sleep, they overeat. And
worse yet, the hormone, leptin, is produced

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:39.970
during sleep, primarily and leptin is the
thing that tells you that you are satiated

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:46.970
when you are eating and therefore, you lose
recognition of the fact that you are, you

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.170
aren't hungry when you are not sleeping enough.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:55.920
And that's why there's such a powerful correlation
between obesity and, and, and la-, lack of

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.460
sleep. And they lose control of their body
temperature. You know how powerful it would

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:05.170
be, how, how devastating it would be if you
had a temp-, a body temperature of 97 degrees

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.210
or a body temperature of 106.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:12.010
Those, that's not good and then they begin
to develop sores that won't heal and 17 to

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:22.410
21 days these rats are dead. Now, the reality
is, as a human being, you would be, that you

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:26.270
wouldn't be necessarily, d-, you wouldn't
necessarily be dead after sev-, we know that

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.500
people are not dead, human beings are not
dead after 17 to 21 days of sleep, but you

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.220
are, you would be completely incapable of
functioning after 17 to 21 days; in fact,

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.970
long, long before that.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.810
But the really interesting thing about this
study is he goes back and he does the same

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:46.790
study, except this time with a different set
of rats. Poor rats. With a different set of

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:53.140
rats, he deprives them of food for 17 days,
ok? How the rats doing at the end of 17 days?

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.400
What's the one word that best describes how
those rats are doing at the end of 17 days?

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.280
[audience gives mixed answers]

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:05.940
Alive. Hungry. I'll take either one. They're
fine, but they're hungry. What is the message

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:10.810
there? Because if there's one message I could
leave you with if I stopped right now, it

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:17.920
would be this one: Sleep is more important
than food. That's a big deal. Sleep is more

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.620
important than food and yet, we don't treat
it that way. So when you're depriving yourself

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.310
of sleep, we think this one hour of, of extra
sleep of le-, of

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.310
[pause]

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.980
Yeah, ok. Good.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.660
[tech member says something]

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:37.930
I'm really kin-, I just had a panic that that
slide was as, as wrong as I had been a moment

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:38.930
ago.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:39.930
[laughter]

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.950
We have this assumption that one hour more
of sleep will add one hour of productivity

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:50.440
to your day, but the reality is that even
very small amounts of sleep deprivation profoundly

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.970
influence not only your physical sense of
well-being and your emotional balance, but

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:00.710
your cognitive capacity. How many of you have
a job here in which you're required to use

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:01.710
your brain?

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.760
[laughter]

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.410
Only about two-thirds, which is kind of interesting.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:07.410
[laughter]

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:13.000
Yeah, that's a kind of important organ here
at Google, but here's some of the things that

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.630
happen if you sleep less than seven to eight
hours. So, Cheri Mah at Stanford, right down

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:24.460
the block, Cheri Mah's done all these studies
with athletes, and now she's found, just recently,

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:31.340
some of you may have seen this, that sprinters,
when they are asked for a six week period

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:39.800
to sleep ten hours or more, turn out to perform
dramatically better at their sprints.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:46.590
She's done this across six, seven, eight different
sports and showed that if you sleep more hours,

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.250
this sounds crazy to you, ten hours. When's
the last time you slept ten hours, but it

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.460
dramatically influences their performance.
So, you're saying to yourself, "Well, you

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.140
know, fine. A sprinter, I mean, they're physically
exhausted, yeah they need more sleep." Trust

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.000
me, I'm gonna get to another study at the
end of the, my talk today that's gonna show

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.490
you that it's no different that cognitive
capacity, the ability to, to think, is profoundly

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:15.520
influenced, equally influenced by how much
you've slept.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.520
This is, to me, quite extraordinary that subjects
who were sleeping less than six hours a night

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.880
for two weeks and I'll bet ya, how many of
you have gotten a, have had a time in your

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.740
life where you slept less than six hours a
night for a two week period? Right? Isn't

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.150
that incredible? So, look at, that's almost
everybody, look at the, the effect of it is

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:39.700
that it's equivalent to 48 consecutive hours
of sleep deprivation. How do you think you'd

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:45.690
be functioning at the end of those 48 hours?
Now, you say to yourself, "Well, that's nonsense.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:50.360
I mean, come on. I know how I am at the end
of these weeks of sleeping less than six hours

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.540
a night. I'm fine. I don't have any problem."

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:58.780
And you know what? When they take a guy out
of a car on a highway where he's been swerving

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.980
down the highway, and they put him up and
they said, "Have you had too much to drink?"

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:09.971
What does that guy usually say? No. "Are you
intoxicated, sir?" No. Does he believe he's

00:28:09.971 --> 00:28:18.780
intoxicated? No. We don't know the effect
that we have. We are in a state of denial

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:25.700
about the cumulative impact of insufficient
sleep. But these researchers go and actually

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.700
look at it.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.411
So, the final one of these statistics I think
is pretty interesting is you give the pilot,

00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:35.650
you got a pilot right here, you give the pilot
a 40 minute nap during a long haul flight

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:40.150
and his vigilance and, by the way, and I was
talking to this gentleman who's a pilot here

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.960
cause he's a colleague for me, of mine. I
was talking to him on the way out here and

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:49.100
I, actually the word he used to describe one
of the absolute, critical skills for a pilot

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:54.730
is vigilance. Would you agree with that? We
certainly want them to be vigilant when we're

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.730
in their planes.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:29:01.050
Their vigilance increases 16 percent if they
have a 40-minute nap during a long haul flight,

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:08.760
and it drops 34 percent if they don't. They
have multiple moments of micro sleep when

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.500
they take these long haul flights without
sleep, without a nap, and they have no instances,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.140
zero instances, of micro sleep when you give
them a 40-minute nap.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:23.650
And I should tell you that when you give somebody
a 40 minute nap, they only sleep an, an average

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:30.230
of 26 minutes. So, in other words, the value
of getting, the value you derive from just

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:38.490
25 minutes, 26 minutes, of a nap is absolutely
extraordinary from a performance perspective.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:44.560
And finally, this is really, you know, at
the heart of this, this is really the cen-,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:50.090
central point here is that we make an assumption
that the best way to get more work done is

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.150
to work more hours.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:56.420
That's the extrapolation of what I was saying
about sleep. If I have twice the amount of

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:02.710
work to do, I'll put in more hours. But, we're
actually much, much more productive when we

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:08.610
build in an intermittent renewal during the
day. This is really the heart of why I'm saying

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:14.140
to you that renewal is such a critical component
for your life. Not so that you can have, I

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.380
mean, it's a by-product that you get a happier
life as a result. It's a by-product that your

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:24.760
relationships are better, but from a pure
work perspective, it works better to build

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.980
in intermittent periods of renewal.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:35.080
So, recognize this: Every human being must
renew and recover. We must do it because our

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:43.200
bodies go into periods of fatigue. So, if
that's the case, what do most of us do to

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.640
renew? And some of you have seen this, but
I, this is the typical way. I try to keep

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:52.870
my coffee pof-, coffee buzz going till the
martini buzz kicks in, right? That's the typical

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.730
way that we use to renew ourselves in the
course of the day.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:04.490
Along with, by the way, activating unconsciously
our stress hormones because cortisol and adrenaline

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:14.920
and noradrenalin prompt a powerful surge of
energy that we use in order to stay the course

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:20.410
even when we would otherwise, or naturally,
go into periods of fatigue. Here's the most

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.690
profound cost of using cortisol, adrenaline,
and noradreneline--

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:25.830
[man coughs]

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:32.650
in the short term. The profound cost of using
those stress hormones to stay the course is

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:40.210
that they push us into a state that we know
as "fight or flight." That's what the nature

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:46.530
of pulling those hormones up is, and in fight
or flight the further or the more intensely

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:54.250
you get into that state, the more incapable
of thinking you are. So, we think less well

00:31:54.250 --> 00:32:01.390
when that happens. So what's the alternative
to this? So, the alternative is to respect

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:09.010
your oscillatory nature. You are meant to
move between spending and renewing energy.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:17.380
When you align with that rhythm, you become
so much more effective and sustainable.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:26.970
And it's a very specific rhythm. It's a rhythm
called the ultradian rhythm that dominates

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:32.921
our days. And that we cannot, you cannot outwit
the ultradian rhythm any more than you can

00:32:32.921 --> 00:32:37.490
outwit the circadian rhythm. The circadian
rhythm, you know, is day or night; sleep at

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:43.980
night, be awake during the day. Mess with
that and you, the consequences are significant.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:48.840
At night, we sleep in cycles. You know that.
There are five cycles of sleep. You go from

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.460
light sleep to deep sleep, and if you sleep
through that cycle, you get all the benefits

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:59.360
of sleep and if you do it four or five times,
you get a good night's sleep. During the day,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.810
the ultradian rhythm is the analog of that
cycle, which is called the basic rest activity

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.590
cycle. At night, it runs 90 minutes.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:13.590
During the day, it runs 90 minutes, but during
the day, it's a waking rhythm. So, you move

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:19.790
from high physiological arousal, awakeness,
awareness, ability to do your work, slowly

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:26.640
down into a state of fatigue. And as I've
said, we override that rhythm with the stress

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:35.440
hormones, coffee, sugar, but if we simply
took time to rest and recover at the end of

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:42.610
those 90 minute segments, we could naturally
refuel the system without cost to ourselves.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:48.830
This is a profound shift. I was talking to
Stephanie before about the "knowing-doing",

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:55.870
you know, paradox. I say this to you. It's
well documented by research. It's in my new

00:33:55.870 --> 00:34:00.890
book, the research. It's on our website. You
hear it and even though maybe you've never

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:06.270
heard of an ultradian rhythm before, it makes
sense to you. It certainly makes sense to

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:11.800
almost everybody, I suspect, that, that building
and renewal would refuel the system.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.919
But we are addicted to the pace that we're
living at and in fact, you can literally become

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:22.230
addicted to these stress hormones -- to adrenaline,
to cortisol and noradreneline. They are the

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.950
addiction of an immediate gratification and
it's like cocaine, you know? I mean, it's

00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:40.460
a, it's a buzz. So, the, the question then
is if, if 90 minutes is the frequency with

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:48.200
which you should take a renewal break, especially
if you're working hard, how long should the

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.200
break be?

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.200
[man coughs]

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.290
How long do you think the break should be?
How long?

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:55.929
[audience gives mixed answers]

00:34:55.929 --> 00:35:02.480
I wish I was talking into this. It's so much
better, but it keeps dropping. Ten minutes,

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:10.460
yeah, what else? As long as it takes. Now,
that's from one of the people who teaches

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.010
the work, so I'm gonna assume that's true.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.130
[laughter]

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:18.300
It's not about how long you renew. It's about
how well you renew. It's not about how many

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:23.220
hours you invest in work during the day; it's
about how well you can work during the hours

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:30.850
you work. So, here's what's interesting. Again,
back to the science that undergirds this.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:37.010
The myth is that fitness is a measure of how
long you can expend your energy, right?

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:41.450
So, you think of somebody who's in, you know,
training aerobically and that you assume that

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:46.490
the person can go two or three hours is the
person who is fitter than the person who can

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:53.150
go one hour. But actually, the definition
of fitness is the speed of your recovery.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:36:00.730
So the fitter you are, the faster you recover.
Meaning that instead of training ourselves

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:07.370
to be able to expend more energy, more continuously,
which is the way we live our lives, even if

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:12.600
we don't always do it in fitness, we do it
in general, you wanna train yourself to recover

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.150
more quickly. Right?

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:24.940
So, the only way you can do that is if you
value recovery; if you value renewal. Now,

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.830
so this is how we get, this is how we get
more fit, and it's not just at the physical

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:36.600
level. Any muscle that you train by pushing
it past the comfort zone and then renewing,

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:42.450
will get stronger. If you push past the comfort
zone for too long, and you don't renew, you'll

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.110
break down the muscle.

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:51.270
So, this is obviously true in weight training.
It's also true in cardiovascular training,

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:58.090
but it's also true emotionally. It's true
that they way that you get more emotionally

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:05.150
resilient is you put yourselves in per-, in
a position of demand on you emotionally, and

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:10.690
then you recover. And the more, the more quickly
you can recover, the more resilient you are.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:15.710
The more you put yourselves to the test and
then succeed at recovering without lashing

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:25.490
out, for example, the more resilient you've
become. So, what that requires is that you

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:34.940
be able to recover quickly. And what that
turns out to lead to is an amazing quickness

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.730
with which you can recover.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:43.560
So, in this, what I call the time between
points, my former partner who is a sports

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.540
psychologist named Jim Laher, did this work
with athletes, with tennis players, in which

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.960
he watched them from the side of the court
trying to understand what separated the great

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.590
players from the near great players. And he
could not see any difference between them

00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:03.180
in the way they hit the ball. It wasn't until
he started noticing how they spent the time

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:08.770
between points, that it, that he saw that
that is where the difference occurred. And

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:13.280
the reason he saw it is because one day he
had number one in the world and number two

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.290
in the world, this is going back 25 years,
on either side of the court and he noticed

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:23.930
that each of them was doing the same set of
sequenced activities between points, and when

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:27.510
he watched lesser players, they weren't doing
any of it.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:34.610
And that set of sequenced activities were
all designed to build quick recovery. I'll

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:40.620
give you just one example. One was when the
point ended; they turned away from the net.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.200
The reason they turned away from the net,
and by the way, nobody had taught them this,

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.100
this was natural selection, this is the difference
between the great and the near great -- the

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.350
great figure it out.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:57.860
The reason they did that is because they needed
to let go, they needed to stop spending energy

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:04.550
where it was no longer useful. How much of
the time, how much of your energy do you spend

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:13.060
today on things that you can no longer influence,
in regret or frustration? It's not just building

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:18.600
back energy that's important in your life,
it's not just refueling energy, it's not squandering

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:25.580
energy on things that don't have any impact,
that you can't have an impact on.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:34.540
So, that's the renewal side of the equation.
Now, I wanna switch to the energy expenditure

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:39.160
side of the equation for the rest of the time
we have together. So I've tried to make the

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:45.620
case here that renewal really matters, that's
is best done in 90 minute increments, that

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:50.950
the more you train it, the better you get
at it and the faster you recover, and that

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:56.430
this oscillatory nature is something given
to us.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:03.950
It's in our hardwiring and we can either fight
it to our detriment or we can align with it

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:09.260
and change our lives. And I say that because
it's profoundly changed my own life and because

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:14.010
I've watched it profoundly change other people's
lives. As a matter of fact, who in here has

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:19.650
used some of this technology from having gone
through the classes to build more renewal

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:24.280
into your lives? Is there anybody in the,
in the? So, tell me, tell us, just tell, say,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.650
say to the group what you've done and what
you think the impact has been?

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:32.470
&gt;&gt;male audience member 1: Well, part of it's
been letting go of work at night. So when

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.520
I leave work, work is done.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.640
&gt;&gt;Tony: Yeah, and what, what's the impact
on your work? Cause the assumption would be,

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:44.350
what he said is when he leaves here at night,
work is over, and he no longer stays the course.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:48.890
He's not checking his Blackberry and, you
know, plugging in and making phone calls,

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:52.790
so the assumption would be that you would
be less productive because you're probably

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:57.780
working on, less, fewer hours total since
you're not now checking. What's happened?

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.916
&gt;&gt;male audience member 1: I'm fresher, and
when I'm here I [remainder inaudible].

00:41:01.916 --> 00:41:05.250
&gt;&gt;Tony: And so, he said he's fresher when
he's here. Does that mean when you're actually

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.570
working, you're more productive?

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.791
&gt;&gt;male audience member 1: I think so.

00:41:07.791 --> 00:41:11.720
&gt;&gt;Tony: So, he, he said he's more productive.
So, again, this is my other cousin, and I

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:18.430
brought him here to do that testimonial. No.
So, anybody else who's had a renewal, used

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.280
this renewal understanding to their benefit?
Yeah.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:28.480
&gt;&gt;female audience member 2: So I've started
to take a lunch break, at least a one hour

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:35.250
lunch break, and I think it's really helped.
Because sometimes I come back I feel [inaudible]

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:42.880
lunch when I come back sometimes I think that,
you know, that problem I was working on, I

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.570
have fresh insight [inaudible].

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:50.530
&gt;&gt;Tony: Yeah. So did p-, everybody hear that?
Yes, pretty much, yeah? All the way back there,

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:51.530
did you hear it?

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:52.973
&gt;&gt;male audience member 2: Yeah, I couldn't
hear it.

00:41:52.973 --> 00:42:01.510
&gt;&gt;Tony: I will repeat it. So, this young woman
takes a regular lunch break now. She's ritualized

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:05.950
taking a regular lunch break, and what she
finds is that not only does it allow her to

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:12.430
come back to work more refreshed, but even
during the time that we, we might call it

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:18.860
"down time", she's finding that she has insights
and ideas that actually solve problems that

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.370
in her everyday work she wasn't able to solve.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:27.431
And that's because of the movement that actually
is occurring between the left hemisphere,

00:42:27.431 --> 00:42:32.661
which is where you are located, most of you,
in dominant, i-, i-, it's the left hemisphere

00:42:32.661 --> 00:42:39.560
is dominant when you're doing analytic, step-by-step,
rational, logical work in the course of your

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:45.930
ev-, day and then as you go off to lunch,
what happens is your right hemisphere begins

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:56.240
to come into play, the daydreamy, more visual
side, and naturally ideas and insights rise

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.240
up.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:06.100
I mean, how many of you would say that you
have your best ideas as your desks? Nobody.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.430
That's not where we have our best ideas and
that's ver-, so, she getting de-, double bang

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:15.200
for her buck. She's getting both the renewal
that allows her to come back and be more focused

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:23.580
in the afternoon, but also the insights. Ok,
so what we do, what we do to, in the face

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:28.640
of so many demands where energy is, where
expending energy is required of us, what we

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:37.340
do is we tend to juggle those demands, don't
we? So, how many of you, for example, have

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.500
checked your email while you've been here?
You don't even have to raise your hands.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.500
[laughter]

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.751
I don't wanna know because it's depressing.
But, answer for yourself, how many of you

00:43:45.751 --> 00:43:49.890
checked email? How many of you have Googled
something? How many of you have updated your

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:56.070
status on Facebook? How many, you know, there
are whole series of things that you're doing

00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:03.610
while listening to me that, not everybody
is, but some people are, because you're again,

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:08.210
saying to yourself, "Hey, I can get more things
done. I can, I can do more than just one thing.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:13.120
That's what I'm capable of." But you know
what? Here's what happens as a result. This

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.840
was something that Herbert Simon, who won
the Nobel Prize in Economics, figured out

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:24.260
back in 1978 and that is, "What information
consumes," and that's what we put ourselves

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:28.820
in the face of, "What information consumes
is rather obvious. It consumes the attention

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.420
of its recipients.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:36.440
Hence, a wealth of information creates a poverty
of attention." And the poverty of attention

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:41.890
is the energy expenditure problem right now.
It's not actually a poverty of attention,

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:48.580
precisely. It's a split attention that means
that you have a poverty of depth and understanding

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.600
about any given thing that you split your
attention between.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:59.280
So, if you put all of your attention on one
thing, than all of those resources are devoted

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.930
to that and you get the depth from that. If
you split your attention between 11 things,

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:10.540
then you get one-eleventh of your attention
applied to each of the 11 things. And that

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:18.100
has a cost and the cost is to depth, the cost
is to quality, there are all kinds of costs

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:22.940
and yet we have taken this for granted. We
have assumed that this is the way; this is

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.950
another change that's occurred that we haven't
yet mastered. We've assumed this is the way

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:31.680
to manage a very difficult world.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.750
You know an average person in Google and it
may be even higher, answers email 57 times

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:42.500
a day; checks email 57 times a day. That's
57 times that you're taking your attention

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:48.650
from this locus that it has to something else.
So, what's the cost? Well, we know that in

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:53.130
a car, when you split your attention between
talking on the phone and driving the car,

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:59.860
which, by the way, ought to be a reasonably
easy multitask by any normal, because it's

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.770
not two cognitive pieces.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:06.610
You can get home without ever thinking about
how to get home, can't you? You know that's

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.680
all built into your system so you don't even
need to use your prefrontal cortex to help

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.350
it happen and yet, you're four times as likely
to have an accident if you're talking on the

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:21.941
phone and you are driving at the same time.
Which doesn't stop you, does it? How many

00:46:21.941 --> 00:46:29.580
people here never talk on the phone while
driving? So, that number, which is about 12

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.610
out of, you know, 80 people is 12 more than
it probably was a year ago. And what we know

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:41.330
is that if you're texting while you're driving,
you are 23 times more likely to have an accident.

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:46.480
I mean, that's insane. Four times is the equivalent
of being legally intoxicated. Twenty three

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:53.360
times is the equivalent of being dead, while
driving. That's hard. So this is crazy. This

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.810
is a performance consequence. You don't think
it's an equivalent consequence in your everyday

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:05.850
work? Of course it is. Here are the key symptoms
of hyperactivity disorder -- ADHD. Often has

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:11.200
difficulty sustaining attention on tasks.
Doesn't listen when spoken to directly. Has

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.120
difficulty organizing tasks and activities.
Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:21.060
engage in tasks that require sustained mental
effort and is often easily distracted by extra-,

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.570
by external stimuli. Does that describe you?

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:30.340
Do you have three or four of those that describe
you? And if your answer is no, somebody has

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:34.470
five, if your answer is no, ask the person
who knows you best whether you're lying.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:36.290
[laughter]

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:40.490
Right? This is who we are. They don't, they
don't even have a diagnosis for it; this is

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:45.220
normal. This is how the world ex-, exists,
but you look at those and you say, "That's

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:50.490
crazy. That makes no sense." What's the longest,
the, ask yourself this question, "What's the

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:54.820
longest you've gone without checking email
during the past month? When was the last time

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:58.970
that you intentionally took an hour or two
out of your day to think creatively or long

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:01.600
term without interruption?

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:07.840
And how often do you sit back for a few moments,
take a deep breath, and quiet your mind?"

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:13.410
Here, let's do it. Put your feet on the floor.
Put your feet on the floor. This is a special

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:19.190
favor. It's an extra thing that you weren't
even expected to get. This is free.

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:20.190
[laughter]

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:23.320
This is free. And by the way, you will never
have a moment where your supervisor comes

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.660
up to you and says to you, "What are you doing?
I'm noticing your breathing? You're not allowed

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:32.020
to do that. Why aren't you working?" No. This
is, this is one you can get away with anytime.

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:37.440
This is a, this is an example of the power
of recovery to occur in an incredibly short

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.670
time. I want you to breathe in through your
nose to a count of three and out through your

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:47.680
mouth to a count of six. I want you to do
it with your eyes closed for a little while,

00:48:47.680 --> 00:49:02.930
and I'll bring you back to the room. In through
your nose to a count of three, out through

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:21.619
your mouth to a count of six. Let's do it.

00:49:21.619 --> 00:49:22.619
[deep breathing]

00:49:22.619 --> 00:49:25.810
Ok, you can come back to the room. Thirty
seconds. Anybody feel any difference doing

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:35.150
that? Is that how you normally breathe? Thirty
seconds is enough to shift your physiology

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:41.230
quite dramatically. If we hooked you up to
monitors, those of you who did that effectively,

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:44.280
and I say what I mean by that in just a sec,
those of you who did it effectively would

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:51.430
have had a visible movement from sympathetic
arousal, that's the "fight or flight" system,

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.380
to parasympathetic arousal.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:59.170
Just 30 seconds and by the way, the better
you get at it, the more you train that recovery,

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:07.590
the more effectively you do recover in that
period of time. So, the lesson to this, I'm

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:13.150
gonna say, is, how many of you had a thought
or two or ten or thirty, during those thirty

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:17.090
seconds? How many had that?

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.250
You may not even have noticed, but a good
number of you. The point is that your mind

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:26.910
does have a mind of its own and that we need
to find a way, having looked at those ADHD

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:32.360
symptoms, we need to find a way if we want
to spend energy more skillfully, to recollect

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:38.480
our attention. We've lost control of our attention.
That's the critical problem from an energy

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.350
expenditure point of view. If your attention
is going to whatever is around you, you don't

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:47.369
own your attention. I'm gonna skip that one.

00:50:47.369 --> 00:50:52.990
This is the, the conclusion that David Meyer,
the leading, the leading researcher on, on

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:58.390
multitasking came to about the way we currently
operate -- doing multiple things at a time.

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:03.840
That you can get some strategies that inclu-,
that improve your c-, your ability to handle

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.020
multiple tasks at the same time, but you can
train till you're blue in the face, and you'll

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:14.030
never be as good as if you just focused on
one thing at a time. Period. Full stop. How

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:19.360
often do you focus on one thing at a time?

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:25.970
This is what we've lost. We've lost flow,
which is the dzogchen maha ati term for what

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:30.970
happens when you truly, truly collect your
attention. It's the state in which you're

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:37.510
so involved in an activity that nothing else
seems to matter. You lose track of time, and

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:46.410
you're retention, your depth, your absorption
are at the highest possible level. This is

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:49.870
what Winifred Gallagher had to say that the
skillful management of attention is the sine

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:53.410
qua non of the good life, and it's the key
to improving virtually everything.

00:51:53.410 --> 00:52:00.780
I wanna give you, I wanna give you one last
piece before I, before I finish here about

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:10.630
the defining difference that I think we need
to take hold of if we're gonna really shift

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:19.420
the paradigm from reactive mode, in the face
of intense demand, from continuous work to

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:27.290
a intentional rhythm that you build back into
your life. When it all comes down to it, the

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:33.960
bottom line has to do with your ability to
delay gratification. So, what do I mean by

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.960
that?

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:39.030
Well, I wanna revisit just for a second this
famous study, this famous marshmallow study

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:44.850
and for some reason, some of you probably
already know it, it's whose study? Does anybody

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:49.010
know? It'll come back into my mind, but this
is a very famous study done back, originally

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:54.590
in the 1960s, and this is what he did. He
took four year olds, he brought them into

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:59.260
a room, he said to them, "If you wanna eat
this marshmallow, there's a marshmallow right

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:05.210
here, if you'd like to eat it, I'm gonna leave
the room. Ring the bell and I'll come back

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:09.790
and you can eat it. However, if you can wait
until I come back without ringing the bell,

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:13.880
you can have two marshmallows," having decided
that marshmallows were particularly appealing

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:21.720
to four year old kids. Goes out of the room,
30 percent, 70 percent of them ring the bell

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.400
within un-, under three minutes. They come
back, they have their marshmallow.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:30.410
Thirty percent of them are able to delay for
the full fifteen minutes it takes him to come

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:37.730
back into the room. So, this is interesting,
but what's really interesting is what happens

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:43.830
years later when he goes back and looks at
these kids and compares, 15, 20 years later

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.310
cause this was done in the 1960s, 15 to 20,
what did the difference in the outcomes in

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:49.310
their lives?

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:55.910
And the one, the long delayers, the ones who
could stay the course, end up being more confident,

00:53:55.910 --> 00:54:02.650
resilient, self-reliant, trusting, dependable
and persevering, and they score 120 points

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:07.670
higher on their SATs on average than the low
delayers. They have way more lasting friendships,

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:12.690
and they're far more resilient in the face
of stress. What does this tell us? It's about

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:13.760
attention.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:19.680
It's about attention. What is it that the
great delayers do that the non-delayers don't?

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:25.500
They control their attention instinctively.
The great delayers -- what they're able to

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:32.980
do is -- they move their attention from the
object of desire to something else to purposely

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:38.920
distract themselves. They instinctively figure
out that if they put themselves in harm's

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:43.820
way, if they put themselves in sight of that
marshmallow, they will eat that marshmallow

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:46.119
as sure as anything will happen.

00:54:46.119 --> 00:54:51.650
The same is true for that ping of your email.
The same is true for that text that comes

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:57.170
in. The same is true for when you take an
activity that feels urgent and you do that

00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:02.660
instead of doing something that is more challenging
to do because it's more challenging to do.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:10.540
Because you don't want to delay gratification.
Email is candy. Email is alcohol. Email is

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:16.290
cocaine. All of these are, all of these are
playing that role. And we are giving into

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:19.580
them because we're being run by our reptilian
brain.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:24.670
We are not bringing intentionality to it;
we're not building behaviors that allow us

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:30.510
to do what those kids did. Now, he goes back,
Walter Mitchell is his name, Walter Mitchell

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:34.900
goes back and tries to understand what was
the reason that the low delayers, the high

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:41.020
delayers were able to do it, and he finds
an incredibly cos-, close correlation between

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:49.730
how co-, secure they felt with their mothers
versus the other kids who felt more insecure.

00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:56.400
It has all to do with the early attachment
to their mothers and how well that was worked

00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:01.130
through. Well, guess what? That's no longer
available to us. Whatever happened happened,

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:02.130
right?

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:03.130
[laughter]

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:06.700
So, we can't play that game. If we had bad
mothers we're gonna have to deal with it,

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:07.700
right?

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.700
[chuckles from audience]

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:14.260
So, what did he do? He did something ingenious.
What he did was, he watched what the successful

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:19.370
ones did, and he taught the unsuccessful ones
to do the same thing. So, he took the kids

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:24.130
who couldn't delay and, this is more recent,
and he taught them to move their attention

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:30.330
to something else. In minutes, he got them
to the point where they could wait 15 minutes

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:37.330
for that marshmallow. Why? Because he took
on intentional training of attention.

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:42.590
That's what we need to do. We need to train
our own attention just like it's a muscle.

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:49.980
Push past your comfort zone and recover. Try
working for 60 minutes without reading email

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:55.210
and the recover. And recovery, by the way,
isn't reading email.

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.109
[laughter]

00:56:57.109 --> 00:57:03.740
Recovery is shifting out of cognitive mode,
even for a short time. So, what are the keys

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.771
to great performance? How do we understand
everything I've said to you today? This is

00:57:07.771 --> 00:57:13.950
what it is. This is the best study ever done.
Anybody out here read Outliers? So, Malcolm

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:18.730
Gladwell talks about this Andrews Erickson
study in his book and he gets it half right.

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:24.840
The only half he misses is the important part.
The half he gets right, oh gosh, and this

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.840
is gonna be on YouTube.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840
[laughter]

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:30.980
He gets what he gets right. How about that?

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:31.980
[laughter]

00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:37.190
What he gets is that the great performers
work harder than everybody else. That's true.

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:41.520
And the ten thousand hour rule, it takes ten
thousand hours to be expert and all of that,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:45.630
but there's so much more interesting stuff
from this study, so here's what it is. Three

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:50.600
groups of violinists, ten in each group. They
ask the teachers who, to divide them from

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.950
the ones who are gonna become soloists, the
one who are really become members of orchestras;

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:58.090
the ones who are gonna become teachers. Those
are the least skilled.

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:04.020
Then he asks them to fill out a sheet every
hour for 168 hours, how important was this

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:07.860
activity you did during the last hour to improving
as a violinist, how difficult was it, how

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:13.110
enjoyable was it? And they do it for 168 hours,
this is what they foun-, this is what they

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:17.530
find out. Practice is, indeed, the most important
thing you can do to improve as a violinist

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:23.280
and to improve in anything. The top violinists
practice 24 hours a week, the less good violinists

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:28.619
practice 9 hours a week. Huge difference.
Big deal. Is that a surprise? That doesn't

00:58:28.619 --> 00:58:33.430
tell you anything. Here's what's interesting
about it.

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:37.640
Practice, first of all, is what they say is
not only the most important, but it's the

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:42.850
most difficult thing they do and the least
enjoyable thing they do. That's interesting.

00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:49.150
To be good at something you need to suffer.
You need to go to your discomfort. But this

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:53.550
is what's really interesting. The top groups
practice in a particular way -- three sessions

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:59.440
a day, an hour and a half or less, 90 minutes
or less, ultradian rhythm or less, and then

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:05.000
a renewal break. The bottom group practices
in the afternoon, having procrastinated, the

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.310
top group practices in the morning. Now, the
most interesting thing of all in this study

00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:15.820
is what's the second most important thing
to improving as a violinist?

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:24.650
Beside practice. It's sleep. The top group
sleep an average of 8.5 hours a night, and

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:32.330
the second group. The, the bottom group sleeps
7.5 hours a night, the bottom group is, that's

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:37.960
a mess, that's wrong on that slide and the,
so it should be 8.5, 7.5, and most of us sleep

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:45.510
6.5 hours. So, that means we sleep 14 hours
a night less than great performers do. Is

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:53.359
that crazy? They sleep 14 hours more than
we do. Now, this is what I think is the conclusion

00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:59.740
of everything I've said. It is not about staying
the course. It is not about pushing yourself

00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.240
for long periods of time.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:07.960
I wrote the new book, my new book, in three
90-minute sprints with a break in-between

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:13.790
each one. The key to your great performance
is intense effort balanced by deep recovery.

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:19.920
It's becoming a sprinter inside a marathon.
You live in a marathon, but the way to thrive

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:25.260
in that marathon is to push yourself to the
limit and then recover. Push yourself to the

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:30.630
limit and then recover. When you're working,
really work. When you're renewing, really

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:37.420
renewing. Stop living in the gray zone in-between.
Stop living there. Build back boundaries and

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.580
finish lines into your life cause that's what
will make your lives great. Thank you very

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.580
much.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:42.581
[applause]
