[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:06.000
JOHNATHAN CHUNG: Hello.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.290
Welcome to our talk.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.030
My name is Jonathan Chung.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.857
And I'm a UX lead on the
Material Design team.

00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:12.690
NICK BUTCHER: Hello.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.690
My name is Nick Butcher.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.750
And I'm a designer and engineer
on the Design Relations team.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.880
WILL LARCHE: And I'm Will.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.971
I'm an engineer on
Material Design.

00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:21.470
JOHNATHAN CHUNG:
Please have a seat.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.770
All right, today.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.190
We're really excited
to talk about how

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.760
to build great Material Design
products across platforms.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.480
So to begin, what is
Material Design, given

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.730
all the new announcements
that we just made?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.170
How has it evolved from
what we know before?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.950
Material Design is now an
adaptable design system,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.870
backed by open source
code, that helps

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.830
teams create high quality
digital experiences.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.300
In other words,
Material helps you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.065
to build beautiful and
usable products really fast.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.780
In 2014, when we first
launched, we had zero customers.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.600
Now we have over 1.5 million
apps using Material Design.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.160
That is incredible.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.770
And based on this huge
number of customers,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.660
we've really listened
and continued

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.725
to improve our system.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.270
So today, we launched Material
Theming, our end-to-end product

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.630
capability that makes it easy
to make Material Design yours.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.212
Now, I'm sure some of you
are very eager to learn more.

00:01:35.212 --> 00:01:36.920
But maybe some of you
are still wondering

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.320
if Material Design is
appropriate for you

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.200
and for your company.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.990
So I'm going to start off
by walking through the newly

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.740
designed Material.io site.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.650
Then, Nick will demo our
suite of Material Tools

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.310
that we built to make
collaboration and customization

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.300
really easy and effortless.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.180
Then, Will is going to talk
about the Material Components,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.430
a library of open
source code, that can

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.290
be used across all platforms.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.250
So let me give you three
reasons on why you should really

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.940
consider using Material Design.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.600
First, Materials Design
is also for developers.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.490
You've given us
a lot of feedback

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.670
that it hasn't been easy for
you to apply and build apps

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.370
using Material Design.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.070
Now, with Material Theming,
and all of the tools

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.130
that we've built to support
this new capability,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.960
we're now empowering
desires to create

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.160
with an eye towards a code
that you will be developing.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.190
Material Design is a truly
cross-platform framework.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.220
We understand how critical it
is to create a consistent user

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.310
experience that works
across platforms.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.390
So using Material Design
will benefit your users

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.485
using multiple devices.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.350
We also understand that
building high quality products

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.730
takes a long time.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.320
So not only we're encouraging
cross-platform consistency,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.820
but also we're
providing the code

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.710
to start developing on
Android, iOS, web, and Flutter.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.710
Now, we're going to
put that to the test.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.860
So imagine building
a screen like this.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.930
And probably, all of you
are experts and pros,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.780
but in my experience,
building a screen

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.270
like this, and to do it right,
will likely take some time.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.640
With the power of
material design,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.890
we're now making
it easier than ever

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.710
to design and build screens
like this across platforms.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.480
And all that magic starts right
here with this redesigned site.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.310
The new site is now broken into
Design, Develop, and Tools.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.795
And in each of
those sections, you

00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:57.550
will find all of
the great resources

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.310
that our team has
created for you.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.180
Design guidelines,
tools, research insights,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.629
open source code, you
name it, it's all there.

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.420
We're going to spend
some time checking out

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.257
the site in greater detail now.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.220
The Design section still
has everything that you

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.930
loved about Material Design.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.790
It's all there.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.810
Nothing is gone.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.650
In addition, we're now featuring
some of the most read articles

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.245
on the top of the page to
help you find content faster.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.660
We're still very much
focused on helping you

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.000
design products
that are beautiful,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.170
without background in design.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.660
So here, you can
see the articles

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.500
that we provided for you,
and learn about system icons,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.850
generate your own
custom color palette,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.670
pick a typeface that
works for your brand,

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.520
and really harness the
power of shapes in your UI.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.400
The last section talks about
materials studies, which

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.090
we showcase all of the
flexibility of Material Design,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.460
regardless if you're
building for retail,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.740
for communication,
or even something

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.940
as complex as a travel app.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.690
It's all there.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.234
And we've tested it.

00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:16.900
And it's all there
for you to check out.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.150
The Material Design guidance has
also been expanded and enhanced

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.540
into Material System, Material
Foundation, and Material

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.320
Guidelines.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.850
Starting with the
Material System section,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.810
we're giving you the general
overview of Material Metaphors.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.370
Then, the Foundation
section dives

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.860
into the foundational practices.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.900
So it'll mention
structural things,

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.340
like color, typography,
iconography, shape,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.310
layout, and more.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.350
Now, the Guidelines section
gives tactical guidance

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.290
on how to create a
material product.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.920
And the best thing about this is
that all of these great design

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.345
guidelines are closely
linked with engineering.

00:06:05.954 --> 00:06:08.120
Now, let's take a look at
some of the other features

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.970
on the site that's going
to be helpful for you

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.680
when you're building
your product.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.680
We know how having
a detailed spec

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.512
makes the engineering
process 10 times faster.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.470
And that's why we're
providing this view called

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.470
Spec Viewer in the articles.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.900
In this spec viewer,
we're now exposing

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.015
all of the useful
information about this image.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.640
Clicking through the
menu on the right,

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.940
you'll have access to all of
the different types of layers

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.300
about this image, such as you
can just view the image only,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.680
see the measurements, text,
color, shape, and elevation,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.530
see the different components
that are used in this UI,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.270
or even additional notes
that we might have added.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.604
Let's take a look at
this text annotation.

00:06:56.604 --> 00:06:58.270
So in this annotation,
you will not only

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.120
see the font name,
size, and color,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.860
but also link to a Google font
site that our team has built.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.300
We really wanted to surface
these kind of useful resources

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.330
to you in the context
of your workflow,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.360
so that everything that
you need is right there.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.320
Now, when you navigate
to the Google fonts site,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.940
you will be able
to download and use

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.845
any of the fonts that
are used in our mocks.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.740
We also conducted research
on the most effective ways

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.690
to deliver the guidelines.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.130
And we found out that
interactive content

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.630
increased the level of
understanding for our readers.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.670
So we're starting to
introduce content that

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.400
is interactive in our articles.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.280
Here's an example of
material palette generator

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.700
that is placed in line
in the color article.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.540
Through interacting
with this tool,

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.905
you'll be able to learn about
the improved color system.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.810
So those are some of the
new features that we're

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.850
adding to the design section.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.560
But how do you build all this?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.220
That's what you're
here for, right?

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.130
The Develop section now
features and has access

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.750
to all of the open source for
Android, iOS, web, and Flutter.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.170
So while respecting the
platform conventions,

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.170
we wanted to make sure
that our components works

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.490
across platforms and
not just on Android.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.514
And you'll be able to
play with these components

00:08:29.514 --> 00:08:30.180
in our catalogs.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.000
If you scroll down,
you'll see the section

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.159
called Developer Resources.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.699
So similar to the
Design section,

00:08:39.699 --> 00:08:41.490
we wanted to provide
the resources that you

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.380
can use to build your product.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.550
And let's say you're not as
familiar with any of this,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.590
scroll to the bottom
even more and you'll

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.490
find tutorials to
get started on this.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.030
Switching gears to
the Tools section.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.760
So the Tools section has links
to all of the great resources

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.510
that we built for you,
starting with Gallery, which

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.660
is a part that I love and have
been using to share designs

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.850
with my team.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.410
I love this product--

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.760
Gallery.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.220
Gallery makes collaboration
so easy and so seamless.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.210
Nick will give you more details
about gallery in a minute.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.970
On the right, you
will have access

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.890
to the five full sets
of stylized icons

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.470
available in range of
format, sizes, and densities.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.510
In the bottom, you will
see the Material Theme

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.690
Editor for Sketch.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.890
What is a Theme Editor?

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.680
If you haven't heard
from other talks already,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.150
the Theme Editor
is a plug-in that

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.060
lets you express your
brand systematically

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.542
through elements like
color, iconography,

00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:50.680
typography, and shape.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.280
And through the
Theme Editor, you

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.550
will be able to take the
themes that we provided for you

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.850
and customize it
to make it yours.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.490
These sets of components
can be used in your designs

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.110
right away.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.440
Also what's great
about the Theme Editor

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.760
is that all of guidances that
are mentioned in our guidelines

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.700
is directly integrated
into the tool.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.570
Now, what if you want to
change something later on?

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.940
No problem.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.150
Here's an example of choosing
a color from the Interior Color

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.980
Palette and applying it to the
entire library of components.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.140
I find this to be so useful.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.014
And this makes my job so easy.

00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:38.180
Now, I'm going to hand it
off to my colleague, Nick,

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.910
to talk more in-depth about
using the Theme Editor.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.616
Thank you.

00:10:41.616 --> 00:10:42.824
NICK BUTCHER: Thanks, Johnny.

00:10:48.221 --> 00:10:48.970
Thank you, Johnny.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.510
So we've seen how the
Material System, Foundation,

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.600
and Guidelines makes it easier
to bring your unique brands

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.182
into your apps.

00:10:56.182 --> 00:10:58.140
I'm going to walk you
through an example of how

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.510
you do this to really
demonstrate how easy it

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.300
is to do, and especially
show you how the new material

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.730
tooling makes this
process from design

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.980
through to development
much faster.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.120
So I was part of an
awesome team this year

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.100
who designed and built
the Google I/O app.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.830
Maybe some of you have used it.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.380
You may have noticed that
we've put some new componentry

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.520
in there, like we're using
the bottom app bar here

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.035
with the inset fab.

00:11:23.035 --> 00:11:25.410
But we didn't want to use all
of the new Material Theming

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.910
capabilities, because
we didn't want

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.529
to spoil the show for
the big launch today.

00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:31.320
So what we're going to
do today is walk you

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.653
through some possibilities
of how Material Theming could

00:11:33.653 --> 00:11:37.290
be applied to bring the brand
of Google I/O much deeper

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.970
into this application.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.450
So Google I/O, it's a
developer conference.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.065
We like to think of it as a
developer festival almost.

00:11:45.065 --> 00:11:47.190
There's a lot of kind of
playfulness in this brand.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.564
I especially love
the playfulness

00:11:48.564 --> 00:11:50.044
in the kind of the motion style.

00:11:50.044 --> 00:11:51.960
It's also expressed
through the color palette,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.230
which you, hopefully, see
everywhere around you.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.170
And it also picks up on
metaphors from the software

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.720
engineering world, things
like layering and stacks.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.470
And we use that to inspire
the illustration style,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.800
as a kind of mark of the brand.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.750
So how can we apply these
elements into the app design?

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.340
So here I am in Sketch.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.320
This is my design file,
generated by the Theme Editor

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.802
that Johnny just showed you.

00:12:19.802 --> 00:12:22.260
We can see that Theme Editor
has generated a bunch of stuff

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.220
for us.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.730
It's created a bunch of
components, a typography,

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.100
scale, color palettes,
elevation settings, and icons,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.080
and so on and so forth.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.000
If I switch over into
the Components View here,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.504
you can see that
there's basically

00:12:37.504 --> 00:12:39.670
a one-to-one from all the
components in the material

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.790
guidelines, generated for
me in this sticker sheet

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.750
here, ready to
use in my designs.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.800
There's everything in
here from the app bars

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.950
to backdrops to fabs to cards.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.470
You name it, it's in here.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.630
The better thing
about these components

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.080
is that they're aware of
the Material Theming system.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.430
Let me show you
what I mean by that.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.630
If I switch back to
the theme and open up

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.835
the Theme Editor from
the Sketch Plug-ins menu,

00:13:06.835 --> 00:13:08.460
we can see that this
theme is currently

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.380
set up using the I/O,
kind of indigo primary,

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.820
and kind of teal accent color.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.504
If I go into the Color
Settings and just

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.420
by clicking on the Primary
Color section here,

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.550
and I were to change this
primary color, either

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.810
by dragging it around or
inputting a hex code directly,

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.490
it's going to have
a number of effects.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.630
Let me walk you through them.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.290
The first thing is you notice
this kind of tonal palette.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.170
It's generated these 10
different tones of color just

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.980
from that one color I chose.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.132
This is pretty cool.

00:13:37.132 --> 00:13:38.840
I'm going to geek out
on this little bit.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.800
It's not just being naive here.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.207
It's not just taking
the hue I selected

00:13:43.207 --> 00:13:44.790
and altering the
brightness and giving

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.530
kind of a palette that way,
the algorithm behind this

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.960
is trying to imitate how
designers pick colors,

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.270
and it's using that to pick
a nice color palette, which

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.756
hopefully will work great
throughout your applications.

00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:00.130
So by selecting
that, you can see

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.440
that the entire color
palette here in the theme

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.190
is being updated.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.837
And if I switch back to the
components, this sticker sheet,

00:14:05.837 --> 00:14:07.420
you can see that all
of these elements

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.502
are aware of that
change in theme color.

00:14:09.502 --> 00:14:11.710
And that change is rippled
out into all the elements.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.920
So you can see app bars pick up
the primary color and a darker

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.780
tone for the status
bar and so forth,

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.350
which is pretty powerful.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.260
So how do we use this
library we generated?

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.377
So switching over into
my app design file,

00:14:26.377 --> 00:14:28.210
this is some screens
from the I/O app, which

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.850
I designed using those
components in the library

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.510
that Theme Editor
generated for me.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.320
If you haven't used
Sketch's Library feature,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.230
it's pretty cool.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.410
It's basically a way
to share components

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.450
between different design
files or amongst your team.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.994
It's very powerful.

00:14:45.994 --> 00:14:48.410
So you access the Library using
the standard Sketch Insert

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.909
menu.

00:14:48.909 --> 00:14:51.160
And I scroll down to this
Library, which I generated.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.380
And you can see right here,
all of those components

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.240
that we just saw in the
sticker sheet nicely kind of

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.460
arranged into this
kind of tree structure.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.310
So we can choose the
component that we

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.320
want, the different
variants of the component,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.840
even down to different states
that the component can be in.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.730
So if I want to add
a fab to my design,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.260
I can just grab
one from the menu

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.229
and drop it into my design.

00:15:10.229 --> 00:15:11.770
And over on the
right Inspector pane,

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.478
you can see it offers
overrides, allowing

00:15:13.478 --> 00:15:16.999
you to change things, like the
icon, and so on and so forth.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.790
So just by generating
through Theme Editor,

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:23.060
we've got a huge array of
components available to use.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.050
So we understand the
Library it's generated

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.440
and how to use it
in your design.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.190
Let's start customizing
some of these parameters.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.886
So I go back into my library,
open up Theme Editor.

00:15:32.886 --> 00:15:34.510
And one of the first
parameters I think

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.290
might be interesting for
the I/O brand is shape.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.630
I want to take some
inspiration from the I/O logo.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.069
You've got I-- this kind of
prominent slash in between.

00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:45.610
I think we could do something
interesting kind of the surface

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.170
shape treatment.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.760
So by default, in
the baseline, we

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.080
have this kind of rounded
corner surface shape.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.955
I'm going to switch over
to the Angle setting

00:15:52.955 --> 00:15:54.940
instead, deselect
three of these corners,

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.949
and then crank up the corner
radius on the top left.

00:15:57.949 --> 00:16:00.365
So here, I'm trying to take
inspiration from that I/O logo

00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:04.720
and embed that deeply into
the components in my product.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.120
So if I hit Save in the
library and switch over

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.407
to my design file, Sketch
pops this little purple bar

00:16:11.407 --> 00:16:13.990
in the corner, letting me know
that the underlying Library has

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.580
been updated.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.915
If I click on this, it's going
to give me a diff almost.

00:16:18.915 --> 00:16:20.290
These are all the
components that

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.040
are going to be affected
by these changes.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.250
So I can choose whether
to select them or not.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.770
I'm just going to take
all these changes.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.670
So now, any component which
is aware of the shape system

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:31.899
is going to be updated.

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:34.190
So if I zoom in on this bottom
sheet here, for example,

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.000
you can see it picked
up on that cut corner.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.100
And likewise, on this
raised button down here,

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.764
it's shape aware.

00:16:41.764 --> 00:16:43.930
Some of the components in
the system offer different

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.620
variants, which can or cannot
pick up on the parameter

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.650
system.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.457
So for example,
here's a fab which

00:16:50.457 --> 00:16:52.290
is using the standard
circular presentation.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.410
But if I go into
the Symbol settings,

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.482
I can go down to
where I selected

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:57.940
and select a
different alternative,

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.981
if I want it to be aware
of the parameter or not.

00:16:59.981 --> 00:17:02.320
For example, I can pick up
on a diamond or squircle type

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.990
shapes, which will pick up on
the different shape parameters.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.420
Or I can choose just to keep
it the circular if I want,

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.720
so it won't pick up
on their parameters.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.569
Speaking about variations,
we've introduced a new variance

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:15.440
of text fields,
which have been seen

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.160
to be performing really well,
which we'll come back to soon.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.589
So right from my design,
I can go in and select

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:22.994
what was the standard kind
of underlying text field,

00:17:22.994 --> 00:17:24.910
and I can switch it out
to a different variant

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.875
from those available
in my sticker sheet.

00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:27.500
So there we go.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.458
We've got a different
variant of the text field

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:32.040
right there, using this outline,
which is much more obvious.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.530
The next parameter I want
to look at is typography.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.190
So currently, the I/O
app is using Google Sans,

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.800
which is Google's
brand's typeface, paired

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.330
with Roboto for body copy.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.820
I think we might be able to
take some inspiration from--

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.950
it's a developer event.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.200
So I'm going to take some
inspiration from development

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.210
environments and try
using a monospaced font

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.880
and see how that works
with the Google brand.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.600
If I go into the Typography
settings in the Theme Editor,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.330
you can see it's got this scale
in here, which Theme Editor has

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.030
generated for me, giving me
these kind of semantic styles

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.310
I can apply
throughout my design.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.511
If I select the Google
Sans I had here and search

00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:11.760
for a monospace, I'm going
to use Roboto Mono on here,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.680
one of my favorites, it's
going to swap out everywhere

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.174
that that other font was used.

00:18:17.174 --> 00:18:18.590
All the different
places where I'm

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.570
using a different variant of
Google Sans here, I can go in

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.680
and I can manually change it.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.770
And it's going to do
something interesting.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.370
So watch here, you can see
while it's set to Google Sans,

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.620
it had a particular font
size and tracking and weight.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.382
And when I switched it out to a
different font, to Roboto Mono,

00:18:30.382 --> 00:18:32.840
the font size, tracking, and
weight changed for that style.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.530
So what's going on here
is that Theme Editor

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.670
is pretty smart about fonts.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.970
It looks at the
font's characteristics

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.860
and optically correct
for them in order

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.060
to create a harmonious scale.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.420
So what that means is if
your font you're choosing

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.280
has a different x
height or stroke weight

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.230
or something like this,
it'll look at that,

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.090
and it'll adjust
the sizes it uses

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.150
for the different
types in the scale

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.750
in order to produce this
harmonious typescale for you.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.390
All just by selecting a font,
it generates a scale for me,

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.140
which is pretty amazing.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.741
So I save that out and switch
back to my app designs.

00:19:06.741 --> 00:19:08.990
Again, it notifies me that
the Library's been updated.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.862
I can take all those changes.

00:19:10.862 --> 00:19:12.320
And everywhere
throughout my design

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.680
that I was using the
other font finally before,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.902
you can see has been updated to
my new typeface just like that.

00:19:19.902 --> 00:19:21.375
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.650
Go, Theme Editor.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.590
So these changes are
looking pretty good to me.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.570
I want to share them with
the rest of the team.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.600
Using the Material
Plug-in, you can not only

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.560
get really tight integration
with Theme Editor,

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.690
but you also get really great
integration with Gallery,

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.600
our tool for collaborating.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.220
So right from the plug-in, I
can choose to upload to Gallery.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.250
I can set the project
or the subcollection

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:57.340
in which to put it and
upload it straightaway.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.205
So once that's upload
it, it's ready to be

00:19:59.205 --> 00:20:00.080
shared with the team.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.880
So I get a unique URL, which
I can share with our team.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.560
So in Gallery, I can get
overview of my design work.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.300
I can update new
iterations, so I can see

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.180
how my design work has evolved.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:15.850
I can comment.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.225
So you can share
this with people

00:20:17.225 --> 00:20:19.510
and have a discussion about
different design features.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.134
But I'm going to show you one of
my absolute favorite features,

00:20:22.134 --> 00:20:23.500
which is the Inspect Mode.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.020
Now, Inspect Mode makes it
really easy for designers

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.090
to hand-off off to
developers and for developers

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.915
to get all the information
that we need out of a design.

00:20:30.915 --> 00:20:33.040
So when I enable Inspect
Mode, I get this Inspector

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.910
on the right.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.980
And then, when I hover or
select any item in the design,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.494
it'll give me spec work.

00:20:38.494 --> 00:20:40.660
It'll red line it for me
automatically, essentially.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.700
So it gives me size,
position information.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.700
It gives me the body and the
copy in the selection and all

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.195
the typeface information.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.420
It'll also pick up on any
icons you use from them

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.380
the Material Themes.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.270
So any Material Icons
will link you out

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.540
to the Material Icon site.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.270
So you can grab the
assets that you need

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.200
and straight away from there.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.590
Best of all, Gallery
understands the components

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.210
that the Theme Editor creates.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.800
So if I select this fab here,
it's not just going to say,

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.610
hey, this is a blue circle.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.100
It's going to say, hey, I
recognize that that is a fab.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.920
So you can see it picks
up that it's a fab.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.010
And best of all, it'll
offer per platform links

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.340
to reference documentation,
so developers

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.090
can go directly to the component
that they need to implement.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.530
And they'll be
given any parameter

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.180
changes that you've changed
on the component as well.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.740
I can't emphasize this enough.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.080
No longer is design handing
over a picture and saying,

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.082
hey, I really hope you
can implement this.

00:21:38.082 --> 00:21:39.790
The tight coupling
between the components

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:43.240
offered between Theme Editor
and Material Design components

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.340
mean they're the same
components, which

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.290
means that you're saying
use this component

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.519
with these parameter
changes to it.

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:51.310
So no longer is it kind
of a guessing game.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.060
So these changes
look good to me.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.580
I'm going to open up the
Comment feature for @Will.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.350
Let him know that
these changes have

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.030
been uploaded into
gallery, and they're

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.040
ready for implementation.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.882
So over to you, Will.

00:22:08.882 --> 00:22:10.520
WILL LARCHE: Thanks, Nick.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.616
Isn't he great?

00:22:11.616 --> 00:22:13.014
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.320
So I'm an engineer.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.480
And Nick has just shared
with me this Gallery project.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.370
I've gotten the link.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.900
And I click on it.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.010
And I get to come in here.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:31.430
And it'll send me to
the Material Components

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.650
documentation.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:37.280
Now, what is Material
Components or MDC?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.610
Material Components are
an open source framework

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.970
for implementing
Material Design.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.300
There is an MDC for Android,
for iOS, web, and Flutter.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.320
It's the same code
Google uses in its apps.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.620
Each has dozens of
components, and they can all

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.470
do the cool things that Nick
was talking about earlier.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.950
And since they're open
source, there's no mystery.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.720
They're not magic boxes.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.190
Everything is available to
you to look at or customize.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.500
And we invite you to
please contribute code.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.900
So let's look at these new text
fields in Material Components.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.250
How do I get them?

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:21.240
Well, adding MDC to your
code base is pretty easy.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.910
If you are an Android, you'll
access the Design Support

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:29.580
Library through Maven, using the
standard support Library setup.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.730
On web, you'll just
install a node module.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.640
On Flutter, you're done.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.550
Material Components come
built-in to Flutter.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.190
And on iOS, you
can use CocoaPods.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.630
You add it to your pod file.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.360
Let's look a little
bit closer at iOS

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.540
and how we implement
the new text fields.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.980
So every text field in MDC
iOS has two parts, an input

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.420
and a controller.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.930
We're going to add MDC text
field and an outline controller

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.310
to our app.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:05.250
We can lay it out using
its intrinsic content size

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.760
and maybe set the UI
text field delegate.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.470
And the placeholder will
float across the border.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.100
If you're already using MDC,
upgrading is pretty easy

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.050
to get these new designs.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.550
If you're using
CocoaPods, you just

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.580
run pod update
MaterialComponents.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.620
Then, you go in and change
the controller class

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:33.030
from the old class to one of the
new fancy ones, like outlined.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.590
And you're done.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:40.100
By the way, these text fields
are much better and much more

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.130
performant than the
previous designs.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.130
We did a huge amount
of research in order

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:52.230
to come up with these optimized
designs, a lot of research.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.800
And it turns out
that in long forms,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.010
your users are much more
likely to see and interact

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:02.670
with these text fields
than the previous design.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.490
If you want to learn more about
the new text fields or material

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.540
research, you can watch the talk
"Measuring Material," Thursday

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.660
at 12:30.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.170
So doing this on
iOS is a breeze.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.820
But what about Android?

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.970
Well, you set the outline box
style on the text input layout

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:23.330
element in your layout.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.850
On web, you just
replace an element

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.840
with class MDC line ripple,
with an element with class MDC

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.330
notched outline, with an
SVG with a path of class

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.430
MDC notched outline path,
and an element of MDC

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.900
notched outline idle.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.050
And don't forget the modifier
class MDC text field outline.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.140
It couldn't be simpler.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:50.940
And on Flutter, you change
the border to outline.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.020
Now, I'm a little biased
because I work on MDC Flutter.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.570
But I think Flutter
is the perfect way

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.480
to implement material
design across platforms.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.760
You do it once, and then you
get both iOS and Android.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.950
And MDC is baked right in.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.740
It is the default UI
framework for Flutter.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.985
And whenever you create a new
project, it's already linked.

00:26:12.985 --> 00:26:15.380
I love it.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.940
So now you know that
the material text fields

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.140
can be added to your code.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.820
But there's a lot more.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.090
You can find almost all of the
Material Guidelines components

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.690
in Material Components.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.790
So that's app bars, buttons,
cards, chips, dialogs,

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.980
navigation, tabs, ink ripples.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.840
There are dozens of them now.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:43.340
And they're all available to you
today at Material.io/develop.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:49.570
And since design is never done,
more are added all the time.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.870
So today, we've shown
you the design resources

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.680
available to you
today on Material.io,

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.250
how Theme Editor, Gallery,
and the Material Tools Suite

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:04.180
help you customize your
designs for your brand,

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.310
and how Material
Components make it

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:10.420
easy to implement those
designs across four platforms

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.990
with precision and ease.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.910
So if you are here at
I/O, what else can you do?

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.790
You can go to our
design dome, where

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.100
you can get design
reviews and demos

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.880
and listen to some Box Talks.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.860
And you can also go see the talk
"Code Beautiful UI with Flutter

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.940
We have 30 code labs

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.170
in the Code Lab.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.850
And on Wednesday
at 2:30, there's

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.635
a session, "Ask
Flutter and Material,"

00:27:42.635 --> 00:27:45.110
where you can come to
us to ask questions

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.780
about how to implement material
design in your Flutter apps.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:48.390
Thank you.
