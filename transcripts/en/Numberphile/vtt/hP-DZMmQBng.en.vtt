00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.634
- I've been fascinated with savants, mathematical savants.

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:06.780
There was a guy I was looking at,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.750
young guy, 12-year-old from the United States

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.710
called Jacob "Jake" Barnett.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.950
Actually, he did this thing on 60 Minutes

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.790
where he visualized numbers.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.170
- What does six look like?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.860
- Six, that's like

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.140
the edge points of that.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.680
- So in this report, Jacob "Jake" Barnett

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.970
was showing how much of a genius he is.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.150
And he actually showed a way that he visualizes numbers that's different.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.450
I've never seen it before.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.190
And the reporter didn't go into any detail.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.796
He just said, "And this is how he sees 54."

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:39.560
But that wasn't enough for me

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.820
'cause I downloaded to the HD, download 1080p,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.060
and I wanted to see it, so I blew it up

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.560
and just with that information,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.180
just that picture and the number,
I worked out what he'd done.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.490
- This is when I do basic stuff.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.160
This is 2 times 27, also known as 54.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.840
- [Simon] Let's start with the number three.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.420
How does he visualize three?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.800
Here it is.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.970
So why is it a triangle, Brady?

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.740
- [Brady] (laughs) Because it has three sides?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.450
- [Simon] (laughs) It does have three sides.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.010
But he's not interested in the sides Brady,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.540
he's interested in the points.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.680
So, one, two, three. Now, that's really important.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.550
What about three times two?

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.920
So three times two is six.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.120
So you might think three times two, six, hexagon.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.040
Okay? But no.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.510
And there's a reason why.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.502
It's because a hexagon, six,
six is not a prime number.

00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:40.670
Primes are important to mathematicians,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.380
so he wants to keep the primes.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.420
Now, he wants to keep it, so what he does,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.970
he actually puts a triangle
on top of another triangle.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.080
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.300
So, let's keep going.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.200
What about three times three?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.210
All right.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.850
So again, he starts with a triangle.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.820
It happens to be red.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.570
I don't know whether that was important or not.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.140
Three times three, he doesn't put three triangles

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.250
on top of one another.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.250
No, no, no.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.770
Three times three, he puts triangles on the ends.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.570
So that's why the ends, the vertices, are important.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.650
So we've got one, two, three, four, five,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.270
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.080
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.000
That's nine.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Okay, next time what we're gonna do
is we're gonna try times three again.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.960
So, now we've got three times three times three,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.190
nine, three is twenty-seven.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.380
You should cotton on to how he does this now.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.169
He puts triangles on the edges.

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:41.400
Check that out.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400
Triangle, triangle,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.160
triangle, triangle.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.640
So now there's one, two, three, four
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.350
Nine, eighteen, twenty-seven.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.100
But the reason why I understood this
is because this is called...

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.160
What he's doing is prime decomposition.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.280
So the fact is, the integers, the whole numbers,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.150
you can write any whole number
in its atomic form, which is primes.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.700
- [Brady] This is like factorization.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.500
- Exactly.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.210
- This is 2 times 27, also known as 54.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.400
- [Simon] So this is for the 60 Minutes report.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.090
Two times three times three times three.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.110
Okay?

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.260
So this is what he did.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.660
If it's this times two,

00:03:19.854 --> 00:03:22.340
well, it's pretty obviously what needs to happen.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.860
We need to go uh, uh, uh.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.220
And then you need to go uh, uh, uh.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.150
Uh, uh, uh.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.840
Uh, uh, uh.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.020
Mm, mm, mm.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.800
Mm, mm, mm.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.240
And then you need to go mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.260
So that's it.

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:47.020
- [Brady] That's 54.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.500
- [Simon] That's 54; there's 54 points.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.070
So what's really good about this,
better than just having 54,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.120
is the fact that you can look into the number,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.140
which is pretty cool 'cause you can look at it

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.310
and if you were shown a number, you can go,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.580
"Oh, I know what this number contains."

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.726
It contains three, it's divisible by three,

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:07.240
not once 'cause there's another smaller triangle,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.760
so it's divisible by three by three.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.120
And there's another smaller triangle again,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.550
so it's divisible by three by three by three.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.520
So it's like an X-ray.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.113
The only problem is

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:21.719
you don't know what the number is
just by looking at it readily.

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.090
Like, I could put my pin number down

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.677
and I think it'd be quite safe

00:04:26.677 --> 00:04:28.870
unless you paused it and worked it out.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.340
But if I just flashed it,
you wouldn't know what it is.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.750
I don't know how it helps him.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.570
I think, the thing I got out of it
was the fact that, here's someone

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.550
who's not afraid to reimagine mathematics.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.590
'Cause we get taught maths a certain way.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.970
We get taught maths a specific way, base 10,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.490
based on the fact that we've got these, okay?

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.160
And that's not math,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.120
that's just one way of seeing maths.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.100
And so, this is great because it's like,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.700
it's intuitive, it's imaginative.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.500
He's come up with it his own way.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.040
Sure, this is like...

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.520
I saw the link to what we say is,
you know, accepted mathematics.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.730
Prime factorization of integers, accepted way.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.350
But I mean, this is wonderful.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.420
And for me, I got to kind of try and understand

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.450
this kid, this savant, who's gonna go on

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.000
and do amazing things.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.880
He's gonna do amazing things.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.750
And look, here he is

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.000
taking what we get taught at school

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.200
and having fun with it.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.470

called the joy of primes,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.500
