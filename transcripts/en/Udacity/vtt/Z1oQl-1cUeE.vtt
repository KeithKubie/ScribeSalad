[Narrator] So, I'm going to ask you a tricky question and maybe you can calculate this.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, what is the probability of never sampling P3?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To answer this question assume we make a new particle set

00:00:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
with N=5 new particles where particles are drawn independently and with replacement.
