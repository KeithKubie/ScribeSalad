WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.120
All right guys.
Uh,
first off,
sorry about the delay there.

2
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:10.830
I'm just gonna start slowly here today because we had another link that we

3
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:15.090
normally set up through the tri caster through our studio cameras and the whole

4
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.280
freaking thing.
And then the tri caster.

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.770
Some of you know about the tribe cast here.

6
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.420
We try guesser is like one of the few ways that you can sort of build out a

7
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.490
studio and control all the cameras and all that.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.700
It is a notoriously herky jerky thing that often has crazy bugs and a mirror

9
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:33.331
here.

10
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:36.210
Our director who was an absolute pro and all this and has been doing this for

11
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.990
years,
she did every possible thing imaginable,
uh,

12
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:43.260
so that we could be doing this normally as we normally do it through our regular

13
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.610
cameras and all that good stuff.

14
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.400
And I'm miked up and it's lit well and everything.

15
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.160
But for some reason the tri caster just didn't want to play along.

16
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.100
I don't know what the hell is going on.
So we're doing this old school people.

17
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.450
I've got my laptop right in front of me and,
uh,
we're just,

18
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.440
we're going to do it this way.
Uh,

19
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:01.710
there's a whole bunch of stuff that I want to catch up with you guys on.

20
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:05.670
You know,
I've been on this tour with JP Jordan Peterson and because of that,

21
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:09.030
for the last whatever it is,
almost six,
eight weeks,

22
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.880
I haven't been doing direct messages at the front end of the shows.

23
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:14.970
And that's usually when I'm able to tell you guys what I've been thinking about,

24
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:18.060
what's on my mind,
what I think is relevant and important and all that stuff.

25
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.450
But we just haven't been able to do that because although we've taped some shows

26
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:25.440
in advance,
um,
usually when I'm doing something that's on my mind at the moment,

27
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.180
there's a bit of a topical nature to it.

28
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.500
So I don't want to tape a DM even a week in advance and then lay it out when it

29
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.880
feels stale or old.
So I haven't had a moment,
uh,

30
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.060
in the last couple of weeks to just go directly to you guys.

31
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:38.700
What I have had is a couple of chances to do that with,
uh,

32
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.090
with those of you who are on Patrion because I do the one on ones and the group

33
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:44.070
hangouts and all that kind of stuff.
Um,

34
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:47.070
so I've been able to share some thoughts about this tour and just all the kinds

35
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.810
of stuff that's going on.
Um,
and then I want to share some,
some personal stuff,

36
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:54.360
some business stuff.
We're going to do a,
an Ama,
you guys can ask me anything.

37
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.520
You can do that on super chat right here.

38
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.740
So for those of you that don't have super chat works,
uh,

39
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.700
if you throw in a couple of bucks in the youtube comment section that pumps your

40
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.720
comments up,
I'm pretty sure that the more you put,
the longer it stays up there,

41
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:09.570
then my guys can see it and they send it to me.

42
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.750
We've got a trusty iPad here with,
uh,
with Patrion questions rolling in and with,

43
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:18.450
uh,
with super chat comments rolling in and all that good stuff.
Um,

44
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.520
we are streaming right now,
we're only streaming on youtube.

45
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.920
Sometimes we stream this on,
uh,
on Facebook as well.

46
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:25.870
But because of this whacked out of tricaster situation,
uh,

47
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.870
we're just doing it this way.
Uh,
yes,

48
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.860
I am wearing the classical liberal tee shirt.
Uh,

49
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.380
many of you guys saw no,
this is a good place to start actually.

50
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.480
So last week we posted a,
I believe it was,
uh,

51
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.550
was it last Tuesday,
if I'm not mistaken,

52
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.940
a week ago today we posted our first ever Ruben report animated video.
Uh,

53
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.010
it was a two minute 37 second videos or short that I wrote and did the voiceover

54
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:52.530
for,

55
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.330
we've got a great animator who came in and we did what is classical liberalism.

56
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.750
It got something like last I saw,
I think it around 650,000 views on Twitter.

57
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.760
I think it's got about a hundred thousand on youtube,

58
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.570
which is kind of an interesting little thing about the algorithms and whatever

59
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.010
else is going on here with the feeds or however you guys ingest this content.

60
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.630
There's something interesting happening.
So think about this.
I have about,
uh,

61
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.720
last I saw,
I think it's around 400,
some odd thousand Twitter followers.

62
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.130
The video on Twitter got about 700,000 views.

63
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.730
We have almost 800,000 subscribers on youtube.

64
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.320
So basically double the subscribers that I have on Twitter.
The video got,

65
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.120
at last I saw it was a little bit under a hundred thousand views.

66
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.270
Now you got to keep bumping into you guys on the street or when I go to the

67
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.090
Petersen events are you guys email me and you keep telling me I'm subscribed,

68
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.460
but I don't see the videos.
I don't know what's going on with the feed.

69
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.260
I get the usual nonsense from youtube who'd,

70
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.230
I don't know what the answer to any of it is anymore.

71
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.780
I'm just going to keep putting out stuff and hopefully for those of you that

72
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.390
don't see the videos in your feeds or whatever they are,

73
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.440
hopefully you do a little extra legwork to find the stuff.
Um,
but we're doing,

74
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:57.430
we're doing the best we can.

75
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.700
We're also working on a couple of things that I can't quite get into yet on that

76
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.470
front.
How was that for your teas?
We're just working on some stuff on that front.

77
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.701
Um,
anyway,

78
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:11.440
we put this video out and what I wanted to do with this was because obviously in

79
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:12.280
the last two years,

80
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:15.310
and I think it has a little something to do with what we've been doing around

81
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.780
here,
the ideas of classical liberalism have been catching on.

82
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.100
And something sort of beautiful happened today that I'm sure many of you saw

83
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:28.030
Barack Obama,
former president Barack Obama,
was given a speech today.

84
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.330
And he talked about how you cannot automatically dismiss people's opinions just

85
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:36.790
because they're male or just because they're white.
I mean,

86
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:40.450
I suspect that the conversations that we've all been having here between

87
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.670
Peterson and Rogan and the line steins and Sam Harrison,

88
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.750
Shapiro and everybody else,
but these conversations we know,

89
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:49.690
I mean I can't get into every little detail of how we know everything we know,

90
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.840
but we know that these conversations have moved up the ladder and then a lot of

91
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.240
people all over the world,
uh,
important,

92
00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:02.260
powerful people are taking note of this and taking note of the massive amounts

93
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:06.190
of numbers of people that are listening to these podcasts and being influenced

94
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:09.910
by this stuff.
And the fact that Peterson has sold about 2 million books,

95
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:13.420
it may be more than 2 million already about a month ago it was one and a half

96
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.300
million.
I mean this thing is,
it's actually incredible.

97
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.690
When I was in DC a couple of weeks ago for the Peterson event and then I did a,

98
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.710
I did a sold out show and back doing stand up and I did a sold out show at the

99
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:25.120
DC and profit.
It was awesome.

100
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.870
Thank you for all of you guys that came there and we did a meet and greet after,

101
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.130
which was totally fun.
It was great.

102
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.250
I brought up Christina Hoff summers for the second half of the show is great.

103
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.140
But anyway,
I was in DC and I went to this little party and I don't,

104
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.800
I can't say who was there because I don't know if he wants to be known as

105
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:46.270
somebody,
but there was a senator there who was a very influential senator,

106
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:48.460
one of the most influential senators and all of the Senate,

107
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.190
and he was there and I walked in and he's like,
Hey Dave Rubin,

108
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.800
I know you're on tour where Peterson,
I'm reading this book right now.

109
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.080
So cool things are happening.

110
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:59.750
This stuff is starting percolate and I don't think it's a coincidence that

111
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:02.510
Barack Obama came out and did a real,

112
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:06.620
that was a real swipe of identity politics.

113
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:07.521
And you know,

114
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.400
it's interesting because there's so many things happening here at once and we

115
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.640
were watching the massive realignment of politics and media.

116
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:16.190
It's all happening together.

117
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:19.430
This is the fertile ground we've been talking about for the last couple of years

118
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:19.581
here.

119
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.060
We're watching it sort of all shake out right now and we don't know what it'll

120
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:27.650
be on the other side,
but it's exciting.
I think if you're aware,
uh,
and you're,

121
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.200
you've got a couple of neurons still firing and you're paying attention to

122
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:33.140
what's going on.
So when Barack Obama does that,

123
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:37.490
that's a signal I think to some of the same lefties.
And by the way,

124
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:41.300
there are sane lefties,
right?
I used to know a lot of them.
Um,

125
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.710
and we need,
I think a same left and a sane.
Right.

126
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.630
And I would love to see for all of my frustrations with the left that you guys

127
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:54.860
know,
I talk about all the times and I hate identity politics and I hate with the

128
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.070
Democratic Party has become and they oppression Olympics and all of this

129
00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:58.760
nonsense.

130
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.270
And I think there are way to big government and all of that for all of that.

131
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.240
If the same part of the left came back,

132
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:09.170
the part of the left that for those of you that are libertarian or conservative

133
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.310
or whatever that you may disagree with,

134
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:13.860
but I think you believe our principal or should at least believe their
principal.

135
00:07:13.861 --> 00:07:16.010
So if the part of the left that say Bret Weinstein,

136
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:20.360
who considered until deeply progressive for his whole life believed in or his

137
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:22.610
wife had their hiring,
uh,
believed in,

138
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.540
if that same part of the left or the part of the left that I once was part of

139
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.400
when I considered myself a Democrat and when Democrats were actually liberal,

140
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:36.350
not leftist,
were when they were open minded,
not totalitarian,
if that came back,

141
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:37.940
that would be good for everything.

142
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.160
So there's something interesting going on right now because I see right now I

143
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:47.450
see three sort of distinct pieces or a,

144
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.020
we can say I see three distinct,
um,

145
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.130
units on the right.
So right now you've got the Trump people,

146
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.970
the mag of people.
Okay.
Big Column right there.
That's a,

147
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:02.090
that's an ideological column.
Then you have been never Trumpers,

148
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:04.460
the sort of more old school conservative Bam.
Okay.

149
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:05.720
These are very separate people,

150
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:08.570
but they're throwing them on the right or they're thought of as Republican or

151
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.070
Conservative,
whatever you want to call that.

152
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.400
Then there's also what I what the part that I liked the most,

153
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:18.401
which is I think there is a very strong growing libertarian wing of the

154
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.740
Conservative Party.
When I go to these Peters that events,

155
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:23.720
when I speak at colleges,
when I do stand up,

156
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.040
I talk about libertarian ideas and that's when people get most excited.

157
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.930
So there's three distinct ideologies right now within the right,

158
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:35.960
so to speak,
right?
So we've got the Trump people,
the never Trump people,

159
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:38.030
old school conservative,
and we've got libertarians.

160
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.780
They're all fighting for control of their thing,
of their party,

161
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:45.110
of their ideology,
all that.
That's great.
That's a beautiful thing.
You know,

162
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:48.380
it's unfortunate when when you just see them fighting at each other to the point

163
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:50.870
where they hate each other and these people are evil and those people we will,

164
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:52.910
that gets nobody anywhere.
What a beautiful thing.

165
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.180
If you have an ideological war or the right way,
like really fighting out ideas.

166
00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:58.290
That's a beautiful thing.

167
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:01.200
And I think that's what we tried to do around here right now on the left.

168
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.330
Unfortunately,
um,

169
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.980
we don't see as much of that because there has been a purging of the liberals

170
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.810
and the progressives and the democratic socialists and that crew that wants

171
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:17.130
really big government and that does judge on your skin color and your immutable

172
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:19.830
characteristics and thinks that government can solve all the problems.

173
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.450
They have basically purged out all of the scene.
San Jose saying all the,

174
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.460
um,
more,
uh,
pleasant,
thoughtful liberals,

175
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:31.260
let's say.
And I do see,

176
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.050
and that's why I said this would be the year of unusual alliances.

177
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.790
I see a lot of old school liberals finding a lot more in common,

178
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.310
in common with old school.
Conservatives are certainly the libertarian people.

179
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:42.990
And I guess some of them are magnet people too,

180
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.850
but there isn't an ideological fight there really because it's basically just

181
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:50.490
been a slaughter where there's almost nobody left.

182
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.480
So that's why today I thought it was so interesting because by Obama saying in

183
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:58.140
effect he said identity politics are are bullshit.

184
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.350
And you have to be able to listen to people,

185
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.440
even scary white men.
Yeah.

186
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:07.910
You have to be able to listen to them because they might have good ideas.
Uh,

187
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.290
that's pretty powerful.

188
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:14.291
And if that signals some sort of comeback on the left of that theory,

189
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.110
um,
and that takes root a little bit.
I think that would be great.
And you know,

190
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:21.240
Peterson in a lot of the events that we talk about,

191
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.840
because one of the things that happens is we do a Q and a at the end.

192
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:28.050
And what happens is we use an APP called Slido.
So when,
when we first started,

193
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.840
we were just letting people come up to the mic to do the Q and a.

194
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:32.490
But what happens is people are so excited,

195
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.050
they ended up telling their life story and they very long winded things and

196
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:39.330
sometimes they're very nervous and they lose their train of thought and a whole

197
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:41.880
bunch of stuff.
And we want to get to as many questions as possible.

198
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:44.130
So what we do now is there's an app called Slido,

199
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:48.480
Sli Dot Deo and people that are in the audience and they're usually three to

200
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.270
four to 5,000 people at the audience and these shows.

201
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.000
And it's just been incredible.
I'll tell you a little bit more about that later.

202
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:54.750
Uh,

203
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.830
people submit questions on the APP and then while Peterson is doing his thing,

204
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.130
so basically the way the show works is I go up there for about 10 or 15 minutes.

205
00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:04.650
I do warm up,
I welcome everybody.
We do some silly stuff.

206
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:07.770
I talked about lobsters and cleaning your room and I just get everybody going

207
00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:10.140
and everybody's in a great mood and people are screaming and it's,

208
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:14.370
and it's just wonderful.
It's none of the things that these awful,
uh,

209
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.330
articles and slime ball,
you know,

210
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.670
hack pieces are saying about him or about what's going on there.
So,
anyway,

211
00:11:21.671 --> 00:11:25.500
so I do my thing that I bring out.
Peter's in Jordan talks about everything,

212
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.270
everything under the sun for an hour and a half.

213
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:30.060
Sometimes he talks about 12 rules.
Sometimes he talks about the media,

214
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:32.160
sometimes he talks about the intellectual dark web.

215
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.980
So 19 talks about what's whatever else is on his mind.

216
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.500
Every single one of these shows has been different.
It's been,

217
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:40.920
it's been truly incredible being on this tour.
I mean the guy is a,

218
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:44.070
is a true tour de force and whether you love him or hate him or you're

219
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:47.950
indifferent or whatever,
it's like,
it's just so cool being around it.
I,

220
00:11:47.951 --> 00:11:49.560
I've just thoroughly enjoyed every,

221
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.860
every second of it and I've enjoyed also just bouncing around from city to city

222
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:57.010
and figuring out which cities I like Warren and just the differences of the

223
00:11:57.011 --> 00:12:00.100
people.
I got to say,
if any of you guys were at the Nashville show,

224
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.250
you are the happiest freaking bunch of people I've ever seen in my entire life.

225
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.460
I don't know what is in the water in Nashville,
but uh,
that,

226
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:08.980
that's the one that really stuck out to me.
And we were in the Ryman theater,

227
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:11.770
which is from the grand old Opry and just the history there.

228
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:15.040
But we've been in amazing theaters and it's so cool because we go to these

229
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:18.360
really old school theaters that are kind of like phantom of the opera.

230
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.750
Then we've been to some,
some newer,
more and more,
uh,
modern theaters and just,

231
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:25.240
and the people are great.
And anyway,
in any event,
uh,

232
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.740
people submit questions during the show and then while Jordan's doing his thing,

233
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.430
I basically look through them and Jordan made it very clear to me from the

234
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:37.590
beginning.
He said,
nothing is off limits.
I want you to challenge me,
etcetera,

235
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.720
etcetera.
So I go through,
I find some silly ones.
I find some funny ones.

236
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:44.940
I find some,
some,
some painful ones.
I find some hard ones,
some political ones.

237
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.430
I'm not political.
One's a personal ones,
psychological questions,

238
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:52.780
I mean all sorts of stuff.
And we do that at the end for about 30 to 45 minutes.

239
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:57.070
And it's just,
it's just been absolutely great.
And uh,
you know,

240
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:59.500
it's so funny because being on this tour with the guy,

241
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.590
it's like as we're on the tour,
hit pieces come out.

242
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.000
So like that ridiculous enforced monogamy article came out in the New York Times

243
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:10.450
and I had met the author of it the two or three days before she was sitting in

244
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:13.360
the green room with us at our first show in Toronto.
And it's like,

245
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:17.080
she seemed like a great gal.
I talked about this a little bit when I had uh,

246
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.080
Jordan in here with Eric clients then a couple of weeks ago and it's like,

247
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:24.280
and then just writes this piece that as if Jordan is trying to force anyone to

248
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:28.740
be married or force women into monogamy or anything enforcement ivy,

249
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.150
he meant marriage.
That's all he meant.

250
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.110
And it's like you watch these people in these slime bags and often I've invited

251
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:38.650
people to come to the show after they've written bad pieces.
Uh,

252
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.270
there has been a writer,
um,
uh,

253
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.670
a guy from the blaze who spent a couple of days with us who's writing a piece

254
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:46.151
right now,

255
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:48.850
who wrote a profile piece on me a couple months ago that I think is going to be

256
00:13:48.851 --> 00:13:53.350
an excellent piece coming out about the tour because I took the time to learn,

257
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:56.740
to trust the guy who's worth as much as I can trust a reporter.

258
00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.550
And we spent some time with him and all that.
Um,
but unfortunately,

259
00:14:00.551 --> 00:14:03.580
you know what's happened these days because of the clickbait machine that you

260
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:07.990
guys know about,
that these guys real,
all of these reporters,

261
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:10.960
but they're activists,
they're not journalists.
And what they do is they go,

262
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:14.710
holy cow,
Peterson's got the number one book.
He's selling out these theaters now.

263
00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:17.350
He's doing these things with Sam Harris where they're getting,
you know,
8,000,

264
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:19.870
9,000 people overseas.
And it's like,
well,

265
00:14:19.871 --> 00:14:22.180
instead of learning what's actually going there.

266
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:25.810
So instead of actually showing up to the show and reporting on the truth that

267
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:28.650
has nothing to do with racism or massage,
he,

268
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.710
he's actually giving you the tools by,
by,
uh,

269
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.410
empowering your own life,
by cleaning your own room.

270
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.930
He's giving you the tools to not be racist,

271
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:42.790
to not be big enough to not to hate cultural Marxism and the progressive

272
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:46.390
politics of,
of,
uh,
the oppression Olympics of,

273
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.070
of all of that stuff he's telling you hate that,
but also,

274
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.930
well,
not hate it.
That's not even the right word.
No.

275
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.700
What it is and know why it's wrong.

276
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.630
And then he's also saying the identity politics of the right are just as bad.

277
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.740
He focuses more on the left as I focus more or less because that seems to be the

278
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:07.160
thing that's the cultural norm that is jammed down our throat every day.

279
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.361
But these reporters,

280
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:10.850
they don't even been show up to these things because they just want to write

281
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:13.670
something so that they can get more clicks.
They're just in the click business.

282
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.780
And,
uh,
and I don't think any of us,
you know,
this whole crew of people,
IDW,

283
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.090
whatever you want to call it,
I don't think we're in the club business.

284
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.140
There'd be a lot of ways for us to get more clicks.
I mean,

285
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.360
you can look at the way we tag and title all of our videos.

286
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.270
We know if we use certain buzz words are capitalized,

287
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:33.980
certain things differently or Gotcha destroys blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

288
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.220
It's like we know we can get more clicks,
but it's really not about that we're,

289
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:39.890
we're doing good and I try to treat the channel at the same way I treat the

290
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:41.630
conversations that I'm having with you guys.

291
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.990
And I think one of the things that's really happening here is that out of this

292
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:47.810
whole crew of people,
it's like we genuinely respect you.

293
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.710
I want to hear from you the fact that we go out there now and it's so awesome.

294
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:53.880
There's been a couple of nights where Jordan,

295
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.250
I have just walked out into the audience there.

296
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.070
They'll sometimes there's a line around the block.

297
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.340
I mean literally around four square blocks in Seattle's wrapped around.

298
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:04.040
It was awesome.
And we just go out there and say hi to people.

299
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.790
When I've been wandering around the cities during the day,

300
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:10.760
people come up to me and they want to take me out to dinner and drink and I

301
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:15.590
joined some people sometime one night.
Uh,
where the hell was it?
Uh,
Portland.

302
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:16.221
I was,

303
00:16:16.221 --> 00:16:20.480
I was pretty beat after the show because it had been a long run and I went back

304
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:23.690
to my hotel and I was just going to have a glass of wine at the bar and it

305
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:27.050
turned out that like 40 people from the show were there.
We hung out and did,

306
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.800
did our thing there.
So it's just,
it's just been wonderful and inspiring.

307
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.270
And for me,
look,

308
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:34.910
you guys know I rail against the mainstream media all the time and it's like,

309
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:38.690
wow,
this thing being part of this thing has just,

310
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.930
it's been the proof in the pudding,
you know what I mean?

311
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:43.700
Like they say the proof is in the pudding.
Well,

312
00:16:43.701 --> 00:16:45.050
all the things that I'm always talking about,

313
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:49.190
how these people are lying and not telling you what's really going on and really

314
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.150
going to these places and telling you the truth about what's happening.

315
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.640
And it's like,
I'm there,
I know what's happening.

316
00:16:55.641 --> 00:16:58.490
And then I read these articles and I'm like,
you guys are all crap.

317
00:16:58.491 --> 00:17:02.660
You're all crappola on a stick.
So anyway,
um,

318
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.200
well I'm all over the place here so we'll back up for a moment.

319
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:10.100
So we threw up that,
uh,
that classical liberal video,
two and a half minutes.

320
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:14.000
I think it got a great reaction.
Um,
tons of views,
people,

321
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:16.520
people were really happy with it.
Um,

322
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.820
and I think we're in try to do one of those a month.
Um,
which by the way,

323
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:23.520
those of you who support us either on Patrion on her pay power or super chatter,

324
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.630
whenever you're doing a,
those will,
uh,

325
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.240
what you're supporting us with will help us fund those cause they're not cheap

326
00:17:29.241 --> 00:17:32.210
to make.
Um,
but I'm,
I'm super psyched to do more of those,

327
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:35.390
I think is a good way to get quick bites of information to people.

328
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.750
And it's like you can't give everybody everything in two and a half minutes,

329
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:41.030
but what you can do is open the door.

330
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.410
So my hope with that video was somebody would watch that.

331
00:17:44.411 --> 00:17:48.650
That maybe was kind of like seeing what's happening on the left and not really

332
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:49.080
sure.

333
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.460
It doesn't have to put it into language to really get out what they're thinking.

334
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.130
My hope is that you'll watch that and go,
all right,
there's something there.

335
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:58.650
And then guess what?
You could do a little research on,
on your own.

336
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:02.010
You could go buy on liberty by John Stuart Mill.

337
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:06.000
You can get it for like five bucks on Amazon and start learning about some of

338
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:10.140
these ideas and uh,
you know,
so we're going to keep doing more of them.

339
00:18:10.141 --> 00:18:12.660
I think it's really cool and that's why I'm wearing the classical liberal shirt

340
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:16.530
today.
And I sent that these ideas are coming back and for,
you know,

341
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:19.920
all the people right now,
there's so many people,
you go on Twitter,

342
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:23.160
you go on all of these things and everybody,
the sky is falling.

343
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:26.680
Everything's horrible.
World War three is going to begin it.
See all these people,

344
00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.390
the new civil war has forgotten them guys.

345
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.280
Things had been bad in the past.
Things may feel bad now.

346
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.020
There's so many good signs also.

347
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:38.880
And that's one of the things Jordan's been talking about too.

348
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:41.540
And then a book that I have right over there,
it's Steven pinker enlightenment.

349
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.870
Now there are so many trends about how violence is actually on the decrease.

350
00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:50.510
Now how far station I think in North America is actually expanding out.

351
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.730
Clean water is now accessible to more people than ever before.

352
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:56.610
I mean all sorts of things.
But we always focus on the negative.

353
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.580
And that doesn't mean there aren't things to fix.
And boy do.

354
00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:03.960
We have a political whacked out political situation right now and people that

355
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:07.050
are just really angry at each other often for no good reason.

356
00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:11.520
And we have also a set now of media people who just want to keep you enraged all

357
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:14.550
the time.
And I just don't want to have anything to do with that stuff.

358
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:16.620
So I'm just going to keep doing what I think is right.
So anyways,

359
00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:18.090
so here's what I want to do.
Uh,

360
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:20.910
there are a few other things that I want to tell you about.
Uh,

361
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:22.380
but I do want to do a Q and a also.

362
00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:24.690
So I know there were a zillion questions and Patriana already.

363
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.370
We'll jump in on super chat.

364
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:28.650
So if you're watching this live on youtube right now,

365
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.560
you throw in a couple of bucks,
your question gets bumped up and more,

366
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:34.560
I think you put in the higher,
longer,
it'll stay there so that we can see it.

367
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.270
And I've got an IPAD,
so they're sending me stuff.
Okay.
Oh,

368
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:43.860
bunty king sends that says on the sexy boy,
spelled boy,
I guess.

369
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:47.910
Thank you buddy king.
Um,
do you,
uh,
super chat?

370
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.980
Do you feel like the ringmaster of the IDW?

371
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.080
So I kind of feel a little bit like the connective tissue of some of this stuff.

372
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.030
You know what I mean?
Like I'm not an academic,

373
00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:02.010
I'm not like Jordan is an academic,
right?
Uh,
Brett is an academic,

374
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.340
Eric is an academic,
um,
etc. Is Heather is an academic,
etc. Etc.

375
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.180
I don't have a phd in neuroscience like Sam Harris,

376
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:14.280
but what I think I am is someone who can communicate these ideas really well,

377
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.590
who is curious about this stuff,

378
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:20.940
who really probably is a little more like you and a lot of ways than I am like

379
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:23.790
these guys and I happened to be part of these conversations.

380
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:27.330
It's the stuff that I think about that I'm deeply passionate about that I care

381
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:29.730
about,
that I love being part of this thing.

382
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.360
Some of you guys may have seen the picture from about a week and a half ago

383
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.400
where a me and Rogan and,

384
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:40.350
and Eric Weinstein and Peterson and Sam Harris and Shapiro went out to dinner

385
00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:43.380
and it's like someone took a picture and they posted it and it was like,
wow,

386
00:20:43.381 --> 00:20:47.130
the amount of retweets,
the thousands,
tens of thousands of retweets and comments.

387
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.290
Then of course all the haters saying all sorts of ridiculous things,

388
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.350
but it's like you guys are invested in this thing.
I know it.

389
00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:57.010
I can feel it when you come up to me at the airport,
like something is shifting.

390
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.910
And I think at some level,
and I've been saying this at some of the shows,

391
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.980
I think at some level we're winning right now,

392
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:06.820
which is why some of this stuff I do think is even bubbling up to where perhaps

393
00:21:06.821 --> 00:21:11.320
there was some connection where Barack Obama starts talking anti identity

394
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:14.890
politics pretty great.
And I think it's directly connected to us,

395
00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:18.310
but ideas kind of move up and around and people start talking about things.
Oh,

396
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:20.520
did you read the Peters in book today?
Did you hear,
uh,

397
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.590
Shapiro and Peterson Winestein talking on Reuben show?
Like,

398
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.930
you guys know how this all works,
right?
So I'm,
I'm,

399
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.890
I'm super excited about all that.
So,
uh,

400
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.360
I love being part of this thing and I feel like we're,

401
00:21:32.361 --> 00:21:37.330
we're doing actually matters.
And that does of course bring out the haters,
right?

402
00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:41.650
Like I've got more haters now than ever and these trolls that endlessly,

403
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:44.890
all day long.
Like I,
like I've said this before,
I like the good troubles.

404
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:47.020
Like you're going meet me do silly stuff.

405
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:50.860
There's a guy who keeps taking Peterson to me and like making it sound like

406
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:53.410
we're saying things that were not,
but doing it in like a funny way.
Of course,

407
00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:56.290
I love that stuff.
You do the cartoons about me that are silly and all that.

408
00:21:56.291 --> 00:22:01.060
It's all good.
It's just these endless angry people that,
and people,
you know,

409
00:22:01.061 --> 00:22:04.300
people want to attack you so that you'll respond to them so that they can get

410
00:22:04.301 --> 00:22:04.960
more views.

411
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.530
And that's a often you views or clicks and that's often what's happening with

412
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:12.000
Jordan.
And to me it's like just I don't want anything to do with you people.
I'm,

413
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.600
I'm doing the best I can.

414
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.050
I'm open to engage in anyone that will engage honestly and d and just be a

415
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:19.390
decent human being.
And I'm here for you and I'll,

416
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:23.000
I'll continue that conversation.
So,
uh,
so anyway,
that your question,
am I the,

417
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.150
I don't know that I'm the ringleader of it,
but I guess that,

418
00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:28.840
I guess at some level,
um,
but I love being part of it and I,

419
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:32.350
and I think it's so cool what we're doing and I think it's so cool that you guys

420
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:34.960
are so ahead of the curve on it.
It's just awesome.
All right.

421
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:38.920
Let me jump over to Patrion.
Let's see,
uh,

422
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.770
how much longer till we can get you on a Jiu Jujitsu map.

423
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.550
It'll enhance your life,
sir.
Uh,
I,
you know what,
between,
uh,

424
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:46.840
all these guys that I'm around now,

425
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:49.090
Rogan and Sam and the rest of are all into the MMA stuff.

426
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:52.510
I shouldn't start doing something.
Um,
you know,
because I've been on the road,

427
00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:54.210
I've actually been able to get to the gym a lot.
I'm,

428
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.010
I think I'm at my lowest weight and probably like 20 years right now,

429
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.600
and I'm feeling pretty fit.
I'm eating right.

430
00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:02.980
I'm still doing this basically Paleo,
uh,
situation.
And it's not,
you know,

431
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:04.240
people say,
well,
it's on the road.

432
00:23:04.241 --> 00:23:06.970
It's like tough to eat right and sleep right and all that.
I've,

433
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:11.060
I've actually found it to be the opposite because when I'm here it's like there

434
00:23:11.061 --> 00:23:15.340
is so much going on with the show and the company that we've built behind it and

435
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:18.280
everything.
I was like,
there is not a second there,
there is not a second.

436
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:20.890
And when I take a second I'm losing something else.
Right?

437
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.420
But when I'm on the road,
it's like,
yeah,

438
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:25.510
my phone's blowing up and I know there's always something to attend to or

439
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:30.480
whatever,
but like,
I have more time to actually get to the gym or a spine,

440
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:31.443
something to eat,

441
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.630
that's the right thing to eat instead of just scarfing something down for the

442
00:23:34.631 --> 00:23:38.380
wrong reasons.
So I'd love to get on a Jujitsu match.
I did,
um,

443
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.340
acupuncture last night for the first time in my life and I saw,
I tweeted out,

444
00:23:42.341 --> 00:23:45.830
signed that acupuncture.
I thought this is pretty calm,
right?

445
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:46.880
Nobody's gonna get upset by this.

446
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.520
Then a zillion people always say it's fake science and blah,
blah,
blah.

447
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.530
I don't know.
I went to acupuncture and I can tell you this guy,
puck,
you know,

448
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.340
pins me,
blah blah blah blah,
blah.

449
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.510
That a half hour I lay there and I was kind of tripping.

450
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.360
It felt like I was like low grade tripping.
Like I had my eyes closed,

451
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:07.220
listening to some music and I was kinda seeing stars and flowers opening up and

452
00:24:07.221 --> 00:24:12.080
all kinds of weird things and like a sort of tunnel situation and I did feel

453
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:16.630
great.
And I did it at about six o'clock,
6:00 PM last night,
came home,

454
00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.770
had a late dinner,
went to bed pretty early,

455
00:24:18.771 --> 00:24:23.060
maybe 11 o'clock or so and I slept til 9:00 AM.
I haven't slept.

456
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:26.990
I usually get up now at like six 30 or something.
Naturally I slept til 9:00 AM.

457
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:30.410
So I don't know what the science behind all of it is and I'd love to discuss

458
00:24:30.411 --> 00:24:34.190
that with so many,
but I did.
I did kind of,
uh,
kind of enjoy it.
All right.

459
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.490
Let's see.
Um,

460
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.450
Dennis Prager in a recent Ben Shapiro interview said that belief in an afterlife

461
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:45.860
is what keeps him seeing.

462
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.580
Do you think everyone pragmatically lives as if there were an afterlife?

463
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.520
Even if they say they may not actually believe in it?
Well,

464
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:54.650
I definitely wouldn't say everyone.
I mean I,
there are,

465
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.360
there are absolutely people who say they don't believe in an afterlife who don't

466
00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:01.820
believe in an afterlife.
So I definitely wouldn't say everyone.

467
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:07.210
I think that the idea of an afterlife that is that if you're good here that

468
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:13.190
somehow it's going to get you to some Shangrila magical cloudy place after

469
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.790
probably does keep people in check a little bit.
Right.

470
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:20.910
The idea that if God is watching you,
uh,
that,

471
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.040
that then,

472
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.950
because you might get somewhere after you go that you might be on your best

473
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:27.110
behavior.
I think some people believe in that.

474
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.820
I don't particularly believe in that.
You don't want,
I had John Casick in here,

475
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:34.640
the governor of Ohio who ran for president.

476
00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.790
We talked to just a bit about that at the beginning where he,

477
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.820
cause he was talking about how his faith and his faith is one of the things that

478
00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:41.780
keeps him on the path.

479
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.230
And he said something that I thought it was interesting because he said,
um,

480
00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:45.681
that you know,

481
00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:48.500
that there's a humanist philosophy of it that you can just kind of do it

482
00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:51.080
yourself.
And he said that wasn't enough for him.

483
00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:55.340
I thought that was actually a pretty honest statement for a politician.

484
00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:56.390
He wasn't saying,

485
00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.290
I don't think that those are good people who either don't believe in God or,

486
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.810
or don't pray or don't go to church or whatever it is.

487
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.410
He was saying that for him personally,
his faith,

488
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.250
I assume you meant his faith in God or Christ or whatever it is,

489
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.060
that that gives him personally the,
uh,

490
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.680
the strength to do what he sees us.
Right.
Personally,

491
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.160
I do the best I can to be the best person I can be.

492
00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:25.280
I fail at it often and I think you probably do too.

493
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.430
And whether you get the strength to do that because you believe there's an

494
00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:32.630
afterlife or because you believe someone's watching you or because you just,

495
00:26:32.631 --> 00:26:36.330
it's within you.
Your constitution is strong enough to,

496
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.750
to always do the right thing or whatever.

497
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.680
I don't know that it matters that much.
Um,

498
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.850
it's one of the cool things actually right now.
I mean these conversations that,

499
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.440
uh,
that Jordan and Sam are happy where they're really,

500
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:52.800
they're talking about the essence of truth and religion,

501
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.590
God and free will and all of this.

502
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.370
It's interesting to me cause I think there's a secondary conversation to happen

503
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:02.730
and maybe after they've done a couple of these,
they've done four of them.
Now.
Uh,

504
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.540
maybe I can host a conversation where I think we get to the next step of this,

505
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:08.790
which is all right.
I know both these guys,

506
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:12.540
I think they're both very good human beings.
Uh,
I like them both a lot.

507
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.530
They have a very divergent view when it comes to these big existential questions

508
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.030
on a micro level.

509
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:22.080
I don't think it matters at all that one of them that Jordan say is a believer

510
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:25.650
or beliefs in the importance of the archetypes of religious stories and believes

511
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:26.910
that they have some other meaning,

512
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.880
some deep profound truth comes out of those things.

513
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.050
And Sam does not believe in that on a personal level.

514
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.700
I don't think at a micro level,

515
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:39.000
I don't think it matters because we can all exist together and enjoy each

516
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:43.230
other's company and collaborate on things and whatever.
On the question.

517
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:46.980
And Prager brought this up when I did the God in morality debate with him and

518
00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:49.440
Michael Shermer on a macro level,

519
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:54.980
do you need some unifier in his,
in his case he would argue being religion,

520
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.930
um,
or something from the Judeo Christian tradition.

521
00:27:57.931 --> 00:28:00.450
Do you need that to keep a society moving?

522
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:04.290
Do you need this belief in an unmoved mover sorta thing?
Um,

523
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.120
I don't know what the answer to that is.

524
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:09.510
I nobody really knows what the answer to that is.
Um,

525
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.750
but I think it's an interesting question and I think what's cool is the fact

526
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:15.180
that so many people are showing up to talk about this.

527
00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:18.930
So I think the secondary question of all of this is,

528
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:20.730
does it matter?
Once,

529
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.530
once we make the arguments that we make and all of the people who are really

530
00:28:25.531 --> 00:28:26.610
thinking about this stuff.

531
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:28.830
And a lot of people don't have time to think about this stuff.
A lot of people,

532
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:30.780
it's not within their nature to think about this stuff,

533
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.900
but all of the people who really care about what,

534
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:38.670
what truth is and why do you either need or not need the stories and the

535
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:42.240
archetypes and religion,
all those things.
Once you get past that,

536
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.130
does it matter if you can coexist with the guy who lives next door,

537
00:28:47.131 --> 00:28:49.860
who happens to be an atheist and you happen to be a religious person?

538
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.210
I think that's an interesting place to start taking this next.
Um,
but you know,

539
00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:55.860
we're,
we're kind of,
that's what's cool about this.

540
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:59.580
The more conversations that we have and the more open inquiry we allow,

541
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.640
we allow for more room for a lot of other conversations.

542
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:07.530
So I think it's actually very cool.
Okay,
here we go.
Um,

543
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.830
hi Dave.
I belonged to a local,
uh,
Jordan Peterson meetup,

544
00:29:10.831 --> 00:29:12.980
and we discuss thinkers like you and the Weinstein's live.

545
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.530
Do you have some good tips for quality conversations with the other side?

546
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.120
The quote other side is what you had there.
Um,
look,

547
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:25.160
the best you can do is welcome these people in here,

548
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:29.520
them out and then try.
They're going to be on the defensive.

549
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:33.000
I'm often because they're not armed with facts and they do feel very

550
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:37.610
passionately about these things and the more that you give them facts,

551
00:29:37.611 --> 00:29:41.190
if it affects what they're feeling,
they're,
they're going to keep backing,

552
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.910
keep backing up.
Um,
just try to show people your decent,

553
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:50.140
try to show them that you're,
you're extending the olive branch,
et Cetera,

554
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:53.170
et cetera.
You reaching out to them,
all of that.
If you try to do that,

555
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.770
I think eventually we can get some of these people,
you know,

556
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.070
this mob that we're always talking about,
the mob eventually will come from them.

557
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.940
If you are one of the people in the mob right now and you're angry at me and

558
00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:06.010
you're probably right and mean things in the comment section,

559
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.580
you right now person I'm talking to you who hates me,
who's watching.

560
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:12.460
I always love that there's so many people who ate that spend their time watching

561
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:16.320
this.
Um,
like if you're doing that,
no,

562
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.380
that generally the people that I'm sort of around and the conversations I'm

563
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:23.530
having and we don't hate you.
I don't hate you.

564
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.880
I W I think that we're discussing the ideas that I think are,

565
00:30:26.881 --> 00:30:29.590
are a good set of ideas to help society move forward.

566
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.790
I think there's great discussions about should there be less government or more

567
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:35.800
government.
The the questions that I just talked about,

568
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:40.540
about God and existence and truth,
we have to show these people.

569
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:42.940
I think that we're not the bad guys.

570
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.990
We're not the things that people are saying about us and that the reasons people

571
00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:50.740
are so angry often with us and why so many people seem to hate us and these

572
00:30:50.741 --> 00:30:53.710
articles come out is because they know there's an essence of truth.

573
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:56.530
There's a kernel of truth in what we're doing and they don't know how to deal

574
00:30:56.531 --> 00:30:59.020
with that.
So I suspect that's what you'd be dealing with a lot.

575
00:30:59.021 --> 00:31:02.380
And I think if you keep welcoming people in and keep going,

576
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.350
keep look around this room.
You think there's any racists here?

577
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.700
Look around this room.
You think there's any massage Dennis here.
Homophobes here.

578
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:14.090
It's like,
come on man.
They're there aren't.
So I know it ain't easy.
Uh,

579
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.850
got to see the show in Austin and it was great.

580
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:20.470
Love what you're doing Mr Ruben and I thank you.
Thank you sir.
Um,
I did.

581
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.500
What's been the most surprising thing you've learned while spending so much time

582
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:28.360
with Peterson?
Love the show.
Um,
I don't,

583
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:30.670
well I don't know that this is particularly surprising,

584
00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:34.090
but I can tell you this is absolutely true.

585
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.710
He is the same exact person when those cameras are off,

586
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.070
then when he is,
when the cameras are on.

587
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.920
So usually what goes on during the shows is,
you know,

588
00:31:44.921 --> 00:31:45.970
where we get to these towns,

589
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:47.770
I usually get there pretty early in the morning symbol.

590
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:52.120
Sometimes we've traveled together,
sometimes we haven't check into my hotel dude,

591
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:56.080
my thing kind of wandered around a little bit and maybe hit the gym and then uh,

592
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.170
usually get to the,
to the show about,
uh,

593
00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:02.260
to the theater about an hour before Jordan gets there.
About the same time,
uh,

594
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:04.450
we have two separate dressing rooms.
He gets the,
you know,

595
00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:07.570
the stars dressing room.
I got the uh,
the smaller one,
but it's all good.

596
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.970
I usually go into his dressing room for a little bit.

597
00:32:09.971 --> 00:32:13.120
We chat for about 20 minutes and it's like,
we talk about the same stuff.

598
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.450
Like it's not like we're suddenly talking about some other weird thing or,

599
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:19.360
or behaving differently or anything.
It's like immediately it's like,
and then,

600
00:32:19.361 --> 00:32:21.920
then you know,
we have to talk about Cultural Marxism and Regina,
Dah,
Dah,

601
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.210
Dah and his hands are moving every which way and the whole thing.
And it's like,

602
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.150
it's real.
He's living it and it's real.

603
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:32.290
And I think you guys are living it too.
And I really mean this,

604
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:35.500
what I said before,
if you're watching these videos and you're part of this,

605
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:37.540
know that you really are part of this.

606
00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:39.680
And that's why I'm so excited about what the question was before.

607
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.980
People are having meetups,
you know,
when we walk out of the shows.

608
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:46.070
So usually what happens at the end of the show is if you pay a higher amount of

609
00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:49.580
money,
Jordan does a meet and greet with people,
any,
any stays and takes pictures.

610
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:51.170
So I usually hang around for a little bit,

611
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:53.830
I'll go out into the lobby and people would say hi and I take a lot of selfies

612
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.120
and all that.
But sometimes when I walk out of the theater,

613
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:59.000
sometimes they just walk out the back and just,
cause you know,

614
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.340
it's been a long night and I've said my Hellos,
whatever.

615
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:04.040
But every now and again I'll walk out the front and there literally will be

616
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.860
hundreds of people outside just talking.

617
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.800
They're just talking to each other cause they're looking around and going,
wow,

618
00:33:10.801 --> 00:33:14.190
this isn't a white supremacist rally,
this isn't a,
you know,

619
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:17.610
in cell hang out or whatever.
And it's like,

620
00:33:17.611 --> 00:33:20.910
these are just good people who are here for ideas to talk about some stuff.

621
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:24.510
So that's why it's so cool because this thing,
it's spreading.

622
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.620
It's spreading in the right way.
Not because we tricked you or confused you or,

623
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.950
or,
or tried to get something from you.
He doesn't sell anything.

624
00:33:31.951 --> 00:33:34.380
We don't sell anything at these shows.
He doesn't even sell the books,

625
00:33:34.381 --> 00:33:36.480
I don't think.
I think maybe one show they sold some books.

626
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.920
They're not even sell them books at the shows.
You know what I mean?
Like it's,

627
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.940
it's good.
It's,
I'm telling you it's good.
What's going on.
Um,
okay.
Let's see.

628
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.470
Um,

629
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.930
you rock and it's time for the IDW to come up with solutions or proposals.

630
00:33:51.931 --> 00:33:55.350
At least the brainpower that you gather is amazing.
I agree.

631
00:33:55.351 --> 00:33:58.860
I think the next step of this is starting to move to some more solutions stuff.

632
00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:02.910
We can talk about this stuff.
We can identify problems,
we can,

633
00:34:02.911 --> 00:34:07.380
we can complain about our side.
We can talk about the messed up political system,

634
00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:08.041
all of those things.

635
00:34:08.041 --> 00:34:11.730
But at some point you move into a position where you got to talk about,
uh,

636
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.850
you got to talk about answers,
right.
And Solutions.

637
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.390
And I think we're shifting there.

638
00:34:15.391 --> 00:34:18.120
There had been some discussions about this with the whole crew and I think,

639
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.390
I think we will get there.
Um,
let's see.

640
00:34:22.391 --> 00:34:25.480
This is my request to get Joe Rogan on your show.
Uh,

641
00:34:25.481 --> 00:34:27.340
I've seen you on his show and I love the back and forth.

642
00:34:27.341 --> 00:34:31.240
Love your show from Andre in Aberdeen,
Scotland.
Thank you.
My friend.
Uh,

643
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.730
we're working on getting Rogan.
It's just,
he's told me he'll do it,

644
00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.250
you know what I mean?
He didn't Shapiro's show before me,

645
00:34:36.251 --> 00:34:40.110
which is really fucked up.
Uh,
but yes,
he said he'll do it.
Uh,

646
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.030
I put in a request,
I emailed him about September,

647
00:34:43.031 --> 00:34:46.020
I believe it's September 11 to do my second show back.
Oh,

648
00:34:46.021 --> 00:34:48.880
and I want to talk about going off the grid because I am going off the grid for

649
00:34:48.881 --> 00:34:53.830
August,
but I'll get back to that in a little bit.
Um,
let's see,
um,

650
00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.390
from,
wow,
you guys wrote a lot of,
a lot of long winded stuff here.
Let's see.

651
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:04.200
MMM.
Ah,
this is interesting.

652
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.910
Members of the Ibw seem divided between having a spirit of optimism or pessimism

653
00:35:08.911 --> 00:35:12.030
regarding the future.
Since it may be tough to narrow it down to one,

654
00:35:12.031 --> 00:35:15.750
what are the three indicators that would help sway someone towards an optimistic

655
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.960
outlook of the future of American politics and culture?

656
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.690
When IDW members say they are pessimistic about the future,

657
00:35:21.691 --> 00:35:23.610
what does that mean and what does it,

658
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:27.920
what is the educated forecast about what lies in the future?
Uh,

659
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.540
and any chance of you and Peters and doing some shows in Australia.

660
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.630
We've talked about that.
So we are extending the tour.

661
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.230
The tour was originally supposed to be just two months,
May and June.

662
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:40.180
Then they extended July.
I'm doing about six shows with Jordan next week.
And uh,

663
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:44.820
all in Canada.
Uh,
then Jordan's continuing for a few dates in August.

664
00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:46.620
I'm going off the grid and August,
which as I said,

665
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:48.540
I'll tell you a little bit more about momentarily,

666
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.980
but then we did extend it into September and October and a and no worry,

667
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.140
you're going to get shows from the Ruben report the whole time.

668
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.840
Even sometimes I'm coming home and taping three shows and then leaving on a

669
00:35:57.841 --> 00:36:01.530
plane that night.
Uh,
but we're going to keep pumping out content here and,

670
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:04.200
and being as attentive to everything we're doing here is before.

671
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.860
I just think being part of something that is so powerful and culturally

672
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:12.510
important and relevant is,
is something that I want to continue being part of.
Um,

673
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.790
so to your question about this divide between the optimists and the pessimists,

674
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.330
so without,
without naming names specifically,
so I would say,

675
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:25.290
and I've said this before,
I would say I'm a world weary optimist.

676
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:30.180
I'm an optimist in that I truly believe that most people are basically good.

677
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.640
I think you want to do good.

678
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:34.860
I think people want to be good to the people around them.

679
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:36.750
I think they want to be good in their community.

680
00:36:36.751 --> 00:36:41.751
I think people want to take care of themselves and their property and not kill

681
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:43.560
and murder and maim and steal and cheat.

682
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.290
Now have we all done some of those things?

683
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:51.291
Do we all get off the path and we all get confused and angry and act out in ways

684
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:54.740
that are not good?
Yes,
absolutely.
But I,

685
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.590
I truly believe that the human spirit,
whatever you want to call that,

686
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.740
does want to be good.
I think you want to do something,

687
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:02.910
you person watching this right now,

688
00:37:02.911 --> 00:37:06.240
you want to do something fulfilling in your life that you feel good about,

689
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:07.770
that doesn't feel meaningless to you,

690
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.060
that you feel has some worth for you and hopefully your,

691
00:37:11.061 --> 00:37:14.070
your friends and your family and your boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever it is.

692
00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.780
So to that end,
I'm an optimist because I believe in that.

693
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:23.190
I believe that is within all of us right now.

694
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.570
I would say the world weary part of that is because it gets,

695
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.970
it gets kind of fucked up along the way,
right?

696
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:32.070
There's a lot of bad actors out there.
You could have,

697
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.220
you could have 80% good people.
Basically people trying to do good,

698
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:38.400
but you've got 20% of loud influential bad actors.

699
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:41.610
They can affect a lot of good people and confused a lot of people and I think

700
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:43.260
that that's what's partly happened here,

701
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.940
the media and this game of identity politics has tried to turn us against each

702
00:37:47.941 --> 00:37:52.140
other in the worst ways.
It really has.
I mean,
think about it.

703
00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.150
Let me just,
if you really want it to,

704
00:37:54.151 --> 00:37:57.420
I dissect identity politics at the worst level where we were.

705
00:37:57.421 --> 00:38:00.990
Some people should have something based on the color of their skin and get a job

706
00:38:00.991 --> 00:38:03.900
for this,
and if you say,
okay,
look,

707
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.140
if you say someone based on the color of their skin,

708
00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.840
should have more access to this education or this job or whatever it is,

709
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:12.270
or their sexuality or whatever their oppression might be,

710
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:15.600
or perceived depression,
it's not,
that all sounds good,
right?

711
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.970
I want to help somebody who's been marginalized.
Okay,

712
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:20.700
that sounds good on its head.
I want to help somebody else.

713
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.480
But what you're also saying is,
I'm going to help this resentment.

714
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:28.490
You have to take something away from somebody else who often doesn't deserve to

715
00:38:29.221 --> 00:38:30.450
have something taken away from.

716
00:38:30.451 --> 00:38:34.230
I think this is why for the last year or so I've been saying the next move by

717
00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:38.350
the left was to come after the Asian because Asians by and large,

718
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.250
Chinese,
Japanese,
Korean,
whatever it is,
uh,

719
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:46.360
have put an incredible focus on education and work and family.

720
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:51.190
And because of that have moved up and up and up.
And I think,

721
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.180
um,

722
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.680
I think are pretty much at the highest echelon of socioeconomic status and all

723
00:38:56.681 --> 00:38:59.230
the ways that we judge it now what's going to happen,

724
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:00.190
and we know that this is happening.

725
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:02.710
We know this is happening at Harvard and Google had this thing where they

726
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:06.460
weren't going to hire a male Asian engineers is you're going to start punishing

727
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.150
those people.
Most Asian people,
their grandparents or whatever it was,

728
00:39:10.151 --> 00:39:12.160
came here with nothing.
Just like my grandparents,

729
00:39:12.161 --> 00:39:14.980
great grandparents came over with nothing must like most likely your great

730
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:17.890
grandparents or whatever it is.
He came here with nothing.
Should we know,

731
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:22.270
start punishing people who did the right thing along the way.

732
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:23.140
Of course not.

733
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.410
But now what do you do if there are some groups that have been harmed more than

734
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:27.790
others by certain things?
Well,

735
00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:30.700
I would say maybe you can invest more in education,
right?

736
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:34.800
Maybe we can look at what are we doing with,
uh,
with uh,

737
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:39.220
prison laws and things like that in prison reform.
Um,
but the idea,

738
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.510
this identity politics,

739
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:45.990
why it is so dangerous is that we'll start pitting us against each other for all

740
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:51.010
of the wrong reasons.
You can be against somebody because of their ideas and not,

741
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.380
and you know,
gap.
Okay.
So that person's pride,
this person's roadways.
Well,

742
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:55.540
as long as you're not killing each other,

743
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:58.810
you can be against each other for ideas.
But if we keep,

744
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.800
if we start putting laws in place that are going to codify the,

745
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.890
the dangers of identity politics,

746
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.940
you're going to actually have Asian people angry at black people.

747
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.360
You're going to have white people angry at this person.

748
00:40:13.361 --> 00:40:14.680
You're going to this person angry,
this person,

749
00:40:14.681 --> 00:40:18.160
not because of their ideas and their,
their truth and who they are.

750
00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:22.630
But because of their immutable characteristics,
you will put prejudice into laws.

751
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.810
That's where this all heads.
So that's what we have to fight.

752
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.310
And I'm an optimist because of all the reasons that I've said for the last 45

753
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:33.490
minutes.
I think something cool is happening.
Um Oh,

754
00:40:33.491 --> 00:40:37.780
but I was going to say this earlier,
you know,
when I've said we're winning,
um,

755
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.270
Jordan's brought up an interesting point at some of the shoulders cause I'll,

756
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.580
I'll say to the crowd,
you know,
something like,
I feel like we're winning.

757
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.121
It's so cool.

758
00:40:43.121 --> 00:40:45.580
And everybody starts applauding and going crazy and they look around,

759
00:40:45.581 --> 00:40:47.980
they see other people and yeah,
it's awesome.

760
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.640
But what Jordan's point has been is that it's not you,

761
00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:54.850
it's not that you want to with,
because if you win,

762
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.850
that means the person who you're with is the loser.

763
00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:01.570
And we don't want half the country to feel like losers because they will get

764
00:41:01.571 --> 00:41:03.610
really angry and upset and everything else.

765
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:07.510
So what you want to do is you want to wake up as many people as possible to good

766
00:41:07.511 --> 00:41:10.870
ideas.
And I think that that's where the focus has to be as for those that are,

767
00:41:10.871 --> 00:41:12.850
those are the crew that maybe your pessimists,

768
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.410
there's are a lot of reasons to be pessimists and maybe that is just something

769
00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:22.090
fundamentally built in to who we are.
Um,

770
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.440
but for now and you know,
only 42,
I still got a little optimism in me.

771
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:30.790
Um,
okay.
Um,
super chat.

772
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:36.200
Um,
I'm an atheist conservative and just you as a person made me feel super

773
00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:38.810
accepted.
Oh,
that's awesome.
That's great to hear.
Yes,

774
00:41:38.811 --> 00:41:41.270
there are atheist conservatives.
It's incredible.

775
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:45.140
There's all sorts of people out there and it's not just what the media tells
you.

776
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.220
Let's see.
I've been bugging Heather on Twitter to make Brett make more content.

777
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:51.590
They're both great in their ideas,
always make me question in mind.

778
00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:54.890
They're both spectacular.
You have not seen my interview with other hiring,

779
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.500
which we posted I think two weeks ago.
It's phenomenal.
What a,

780
00:41:58.501 --> 00:42:02.270
what a tour de force of intellectual will have.
She is,

781
00:42:02.271 --> 00:42:05.750
I just loved every moment of it.
We'll definitely do more with her.
Um,

782
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:09.430
I should tell you by the way,
that,
uh,
you know,
as these tours are going on and,

783
00:42:09.431 --> 00:42:12.200
and Sam's doing the stuff with Peterson and Peterson and I are continuing this

784
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:16.560
thing.
We are working on all sorts of things in the future,
uh,

785
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.970
that I can't quite get into now that we'll have a technological component that

786
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:24.260
could happen,
um,
uh,
touring component and all sorts of stuff.
So,

787
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.440
so stay tuned.
I think there's so many cool things happening and a,

788
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:31.280
and you guys are all part of it.
My friends.
Okay.
Let's see.

789
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:36.080
I'll jump back into a patriarch for a moment.
Um,

790
00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.370
did keep up the good work on the Diet and exercise plan.

791
00:42:38.371 --> 00:42:41.690
Do you look 10 years younger than you did six months ago?
You know,

792
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.620
I feel like I look younger.
Um,
and I definitely feel better.

793
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.870
I'll mention something that I mentioned on the Rogan podcasts.
So,
um,

794
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:56.030
about three,
about three years ago,
right when the,

795
00:42:56.031 --> 00:43:00.350
uh,
the Rubin report was first taking off.
So this is when we were on aura TV.

796
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.500
This is the,
I believe this started,

797
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.960
it was around February or March of 2016 so we relaunched the show in September

798
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:12.950
of 2015 at aura TV,
Larry King's digital network.

799
00:43:12.951 --> 00:43:16.370
And that was my first real interview was the first time I met Sam Harris and had

800
00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:18.590
him on,
I think that was September 9th,

801
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:21.530
2015 and then the show really started blowing up.
I had,

802
00:43:21.531 --> 00:43:25.580
I had my jacket on and I had Douglas Murray and I under see Ali and a whole

803
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:26.270
bunch of people.

804
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.790
I started really talking about what I thought was wrong with the left.

805
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:30.560
I started really focusing on free speech.

806
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:32.810
The show was growing and growing and growing and growing.

807
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.200
I started getting a lot of hate at the same time and I had never really gotten

808
00:43:36.201 --> 00:43:37.034
hate before.

809
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.610
And I guess I was more stressed than I thought I was because around February or

810
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:42.480
March,
um,

811
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.240
I started losing just chunks and chunks of hair,
mostly from the back of my head.

812
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.770
But I lost a lot up here.
I mean,

813
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:52.250
I'm talking like I would take a shower just like it was awful,

814
00:43:52.251 --> 00:43:55.940
like handfuls of hair falling out.
Uh,
I went to a,

815
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.780
to a dermatologist and went to do a specialist,
uh,
turn it.

816
00:43:59.781 --> 00:44:02.750
Turns out I developed something called Alopecia Areata,

817
00:44:02.751 --> 00:44:07.160
which is an auto immune disease.
They don't know exactly what causes it.

818
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:09.800
I didn't have any blood problems or anything like that.
Uh,

819
00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.060
but basically your white blood cells start attacking your hair follicles.
Uh,

820
00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.640
and they don't know why.
So I ended up going on this.

821
00:44:16.641 --> 00:44:19.940
I told this story to Rogan a couple of weeks ago.
Um,

822
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.730
I ended up going on a pretty experimental,
uh,
drug,

823
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:24.200
which I can't even remember what it's called right now.

824
00:44:24.201 --> 00:44:26.390
It's got a crazy long name.
Um,

825
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.080
that basically was like putting like this cream that was like,
um,

826
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.890
it was like putting a poison ivy on my head and I had to put it on at night,

827
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.320
David and put it on my head.
And in effect,

828
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:40.500
what that would do is it would cause an allergic reaction so that the white

829
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:44.370
blood cells would attack the reactions that have the hair follicles.
Well anyway,

830
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:46.020
this is a pretty experimental thing.

831
00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:48.340
And as I did it and I had to do it for a couple of months,

832
00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.840
I was breaking out like you wouldn't believe.

833
00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:56.040
Like my entire body was itching,
like almost everything except my face,

834
00:44:56.041 --> 00:45:00.930
which was a freaking miracle,
was itchy and red and kind of flaky.

835
00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:03.990
I couldn't really be out in the sun.
I'm talking about for almost a year.

836
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.590
And it was,
it was miserable.
I mean my,
my head,

837
00:45:07.591 --> 00:45:09.980
like I was having an imagine putting,
reimagining,

838
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.830
rubbing poison ivy on your head,
like itching and oozing.

839
00:45:13.831 --> 00:45:17.940
I mean it's really gross,
Steven.
Talk about it was,
it was pretty miserable and a,

840
00:45:17.941 --> 00:45:20.480
and I didn't tell anybody about it.
I mean,
David knew and my,

841
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:24.630
my mom or my folks knew maybe my brother and sister,
like a couple of people,

842
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:27.240
but I didn't,
I didn't want to,
you guys know.
But anyway,
this,
this medication,

843
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.190
it also caused,
um,

844
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.910
I was kinda like inflamed a little bit and I definitely was like a little more

845
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:37.590
bloated and I,
I definitely,
I did not look great.
I wasn't sleeping that well.

846
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:41.100
Um,
and if anything it added more.
Uh,

847
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.080
if I was trying to get rid of stress,

848
00:45:43.081 --> 00:45:46.410
it added more stress and it really sucked because it was happening at the same

849
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:49.170
exact point as I was becoming really successful.

850
00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:52.320
Which is some sort of an interesting thing that life deals you with things.

851
00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.990
And it's interesting because I've talked about this privately with Jordan and I

852
00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:57.840
hope he doesn't mind me if I,
if I quickly mentioned this year,
but you know,

853
00:45:57.841 --> 00:46:01.250
in the last two years as Jordan and succeeded,
he started having some,
uh,

854
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.670
some real digestive issues.
You know,
he's doing it.
He's doing a very strict,
um,

855
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.730
carnivore diet right now,
which,
um,
you know,

856
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:11.250
he doesn't really like talking about because he's not a Dietitian.

857
00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:12.990
He's not telling anyone to do what he's doing.

858
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.850
But we both dealt with sort of health issues as,
as we were succeeding,

859
00:46:17.851 --> 00:46:19.440
which is a really weird thing,

860
00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:23.490
like as all the things that you care about that are good or are working that you

861
00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:26.370
suddenly have something that's completely out of your control happening to you.

862
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:30.120
So anyway,
it really,
really sucked and uh,
yeah,

863
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.790
I I I definitely did not look great and uh,

864
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.520
it's not fun having like a thing that you don't want to talk about with people

865
00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:37.350
and all that stuff.
Um,
it's,

866
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.130
it's mostly gone but actually today I just went to the,
to the dermatologist.

867
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:44.610
I still do,
this is all my hair,
so my hair it here.
Um,

868
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.220
but I still do have a couple spots in the back,
which is my,

869
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:51.450
my hair is a little bit longer in the back and a once a month I get cortisone

870
00:46:51.451 --> 00:46:54.510
shots,
which I think we're going to actually stop doing.

871
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.490
I discuss with my dermatologist today cause they,

872
00:46:56.491 --> 00:46:58.170
it's hard to tell if it's actually working,

873
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.740
but some are growing back and sometimes randomly there'll be like a little spot

874
00:47:01.741 --> 00:47:02.574
that just appears.

875
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.540
They describe it as like an ember in a fire just magically appears.
But anyway,

876
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:09.390
it's just a,
it's just one of those things.
And uh,

877
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.390
you never know what somebody actually dealing with.
And uh,

878
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:14.940
I guess just try to be decent to people.
Uh,

879
00:47:14.941 --> 00:47:16.980
I have VIP tickets for a show in Cincinnati.

880
00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:20.070
How can I interact with you and JP without making a fool of myself?

881
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:25.620
I'd have to know more about you specifically to know.
Um,
but,
uh,
Cincinnati,

882
00:47:25.621 --> 00:47:29.200
I'll make sure that I come out in the audience for a little bit and then try to

883
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:33.670
grab me and say hi.
I'd love to say I,
um,
let's see.
Um,

884
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:39.520
when the right is the only side that is tolerant for differing opinions,

885
00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:42.220
lifestyles and perspectives,
how do I employ to bracing them,

886
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:44.620
not out of alignment with all of their principals,

887
00:47:44.621 --> 00:47:48.430
but out of disgust and rejection from the new extreme left?
I love this question.

888
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.690
I'm a classical liberal,

889
00:47:49.691 --> 00:47:52.720
but it's hard when I feel like I'm so alone in the mainstream narrative when

890
00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:57.070
talking to people who don't follow things like the IDW or a Peterson or who are

891
00:47:57.071 --> 00:47:58.930
so brainwashed by progressivism.
Okay,

892
00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.750
I know a lot about this cause I'm kind of in the boat with you,
right?

893
00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:04.720
Like the people that five years ago I thought were the bad guys,

894
00:48:04.721 --> 00:48:09.670
the evil conservatives and Shapiro and tighter and by these scary people,

895
00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.640
once you get to know them,
you realize they're not that bad.

896
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:15.610
And just because somebody believes in limited government and low taxes doesn't

897
00:48:15.611 --> 00:48:20.330
mean they ate a poor people.
And just because somebody is is,
uh,
prolife,

898
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:21.280
which I am not,

899
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.410
doesn't mean that they hate women or all of the memes that unfortunately the

900
00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:29.530
left has put out there to make it seem like anyone who doesn't believe in their

901
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:33.340
orthodoxy is an evil person or a Nazi or a white supremacist or anything.

902
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.270
And I know that literally millions,
if you are waking up to this,

903
00:48:37.271 --> 00:48:41.440
I have absolutely no doubt about it.
So how do you deal with it?
Well,
look,

904
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.940
I can tell you this,
I,
I now am friends with all sorts of,

905
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:48.760
of conservatives and people on the right and I go to these turning point USA

906
00:48:48.761 --> 00:48:50.290
things.
I'll be in DC next week.

907
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.480
I'm doing the turning point USA highschool summit.

908
00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:55.700
It's the largest gathering of high school conservatives,
I think in the,

909
00:48:55.701 --> 00:48:57.850
in the country.
Um,
I'll be speaking,

910
00:48:57.851 --> 00:49:00.940
I think Trump junior is going to be there and Seb Gorka is going to be there at

911
00:49:00.941 --> 00:49:02.560
candidates.
Owens will be there and blah,
blah,
blah.

912
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.110
I have big political differences with these people.

913
00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:08.620
And I go to these turning points things.
And Charlie Kirk said to me,

914
00:49:08.621 --> 00:49:11.860
I sent it to him and he sat in this thing right here.
He said to me privately,

915
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:14.110
the first day I met him within two minutes,
he said,
Dave,

916
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:15.940
I have a lot of big disagreements with you,

917
00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:18.820
but I'd love for you to start coming to some turning point events.

918
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:22.570
And I can tell you this,
I go to these events.
I talk about being gay,
married,

919
00:49:22.571 --> 00:49:26.620
approached choice and against the death penalty and for reforming prison systems

920
00:49:26.621 --> 00:49:29.590
and being against the war on drugs and a whole slew of other things that these

921
00:49:29.591 --> 00:49:30.700
guys aren't really for.

922
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:35.410
And I find them to be incredibly engaging and open and nice and decent and fun.

923
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.630
So yes.
Are there some things that I don't like about them?
Sure.

924
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.920
Are they a little too conservative for my style?
Yes.
Um,

925
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.890
but is there room to build some alliances over there?

926
00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.710
They're damn well is and I'm going to keep doing it.

927
00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:52.600
And it sounds like you're going to keep doing it too.

928
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.310
And I think the more that you do that and the more that we show people that we

929
00:49:57.311 --> 00:49:57.850
can,

930
00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.930
we can be friends with people we disagree with and we can show people that we

931
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:05.080
don't have to be endlessly hysterical or outrage or angry.

932
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.670
They're going to run out of steam.

933
00:50:06.671 --> 00:50:08.800
And I think we're starting to see some of that right now.

934
00:50:08.801 --> 00:50:13.360
They really are going to run out of steam and let's just build a home where

935
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:17.800
enough people can come into town to find some answers.
Um,
super chat.

936
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.860
Do you get concerned about overexposure with folks like you,

937
00:50:20.861 --> 00:50:24.250
Shapiro Peterson and others all over youtube and click click bait videos out

938
00:50:24.251 --> 00:50:27.220
there causing discord?
Are you concerned?
And if yes,

939
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:29.060
do you have any strategies for addressing it?

940
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.510
So I think there is some element of that,
right?

941
00:50:32.511 --> 00:50:34.640
Like a lot of us are out there doing a lot of different things.

942
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.040
We're doing each other's shows,
we're doing many other people's shows,

943
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:40.490
we're doing live events,
we do a podcast and all that.
Um,

944
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:44.630
I'm somewhat aware of it and I've actually in the last two months or so,

945
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:47.000
and it partly is because of the tour and I just had a time,

946
00:50:47.001 --> 00:50:49.690
I've turned down a lot of media requests.
Um,

947
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:53.190
I will be on Tucker Carlson tomorrow night actually.
Um,
and people said,

948
00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.120
why do you only go on and talk where you're and Gutfeld you only go on Fox News,

949
00:50:56.450 --> 00:51:00.050
CNN and MSNBC.
I've never invited me.
I can't just stand up there and go guys,

950
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:02.630
but you'll let me.
Um,
so I'll go where I'm,

951
00:51:02.631 --> 00:51:05.460
I'll go where I can go and be on live and unedited.

952
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:08.300
Greg's show is live to tape so they air the next day.

953
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:11.900
But I know Greg well and he's friend and they've never edited a word and he's

954
00:51:11.901 --> 00:51:13.280
promised me that they never would.

955
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.250
And Tucker is aired lot so I have no problem doing that.

956
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:20.600
I much prefer to do it in studio and when I'm in DC then I been doing the camera

957
00:51:20.601 --> 00:51:21.470
thing cause it's a little weird.

958
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:25.430
You sit in the little room and you stare at a little box and uh,
that's it.

959
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:28.070
You can't see him.
You're just looking at that thing and talk to that.

960
00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:28.904
So it's a little weird.

961
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.090
But that's what I'll be doing tomorrow cause I'm here in la and he said he'd
see.

962
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.750
Um,
but as far as over exposure,

963
00:51:35.751 --> 00:51:38.360
I would say we all have to be somewhat aware of it,
but you know,

964
00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:40.070
it's a little bit,
you know,
it's kind of like,

965
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:43.100
like I don't see the term regressive left anymore.
Like really a,

966
00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:45.200
when's the last time you've heard me say I very,

967
00:51:45.201 --> 00:51:46.910
very rarely say it and if I do it,

968
00:51:46.911 --> 00:51:50.390
I usually say it in a joking matter for all that year that I had to say it all

969
00:51:50.391 --> 00:51:50.660
the time.

970
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.540
It was because we were trying to identify a problem and sometimes you need a

971
00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:58.310
word to identify it and the idea that they were not progressive for real

972
00:51:58.311 --> 00:52:01.280
progress,
which would be for quality,
but they were regressive.

973
00:52:01.281 --> 00:52:02.900
They wanted us to look backwards.

974
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:07.040
They wanted us to not do the things that Martin Luther King Jr wanted us to do

975
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.880
it.
It was a word that really stuck,
which by the way,
just for the record,

976
00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:12.920
one more time I'd utilize came up with the word.

977
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:16.820
I just was one of the people that helped amplify it.
Okay.
Now

978
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:22.040
I don't use it anymore because I think sometimes once you've identified

979
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:24.500
something enough,
you don't have to keep going back to it.

980
00:52:24.501 --> 00:52:25.850
Other people can use it,
whatever.

981
00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:27.530
You can figure out other ways to talk about things.

982
00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:29.960
I think there there is some risk of,

983
00:52:29.961 --> 00:52:33.340
because there's a bunch of us now and we're all kind of um,

984
00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.760
picking up steam in different ways,

985
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.840
there's some risk of some level of overexposure.
I don't think we've hit it yet.

986
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.060
What I would say is if you're asking me this question,

987
00:52:41.061 --> 00:52:43.610
and I guess for those of you that are watching this right now,
most of you,

988
00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:47.180
obviously new people are coming on board all the time,
but a lot of you,

989
00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:50.660
the core group of you that watch all of these videos and they care about this

990
00:52:50.661 --> 00:52:52.640
stuff and then come up to us on the streets and all that.

991
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.160
You've been around for awhile.

992
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.620
So some of this may seem occasionally repetitive to you or oh,

993
00:52:57.621 --> 00:53:00.260
I've heard that before,
whatever.
But really what you have to think about,

994
00:53:00.261 --> 00:53:03.680
and I'm keenly aware of this because sometimes I will have to repeat myself when

995
00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:05.000
I say something or if I give a speech,

996
00:53:05.001 --> 00:53:06.830
I usually try to have no notes in front of me.

997
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.410
But every now and again there's a couple of lines that I know I've said before

998
00:53:09.411 --> 00:53:10.460
that I really want to hit home.

999
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:14.750
You got to remember that there's so many new people coming to these ideas and

1000
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:18.980
these ideas still are ignored by mainstream and the more they ignore them,

1001
00:53:18.981 --> 00:53:21.000
the more people tune them out and they tune us in.

1002
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:24.550
So because of the amount of new people that are coming in,

1003
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.460
we do have to be somewhat aware of not becoming characatures of ourselves by

1004
00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:30.690
overly repeating things.

1005
00:53:30.691 --> 00:53:32.670
I have discussed this privately repeaters and a little bit.

1006
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.020
I think we all have to be aware of it.
Um,
and you guys,
those of you that are,

1007
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:41.640
that are good,
decent people.
I mean if you see it,
if it seems like,
you know,

1008
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:42.520
we were just,
oh,

1009
00:53:42.521 --> 00:53:46.110
that he's going to his old hits instead of thinking of new stuff and figuring

1010
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:48.990
out what's next,
please call us out.
And by the way,

1011
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.450
that's why the question earlier was so good about,
well,
all right,

1012
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:53.130
well how do we start talking about solutions?

1013
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.010
Because I don't always want to just talk about the ideas.

1014
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:59.760
I also want to figure out what's next,
which also is why when I had,
uh,

1015
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:04.230
Ben and Jordan and Eric in here a two,
two or three weeks ago,

1016
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.460
uh,
I said,
do you guys think this is the beginnings of a political movement?

1017
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.340
That they all had sort of different answers on that,
but look,

1018
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:13.170
if it starts becoming a political move,

1019
00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:16.470
are some of us suddenly political consultants or political candidates or

1020
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:19.890
spokespeople?
Who the hell knows?
But let's,
let's keep going.

1021
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.410
Let's keep going and see what happens.
All right.
Uh,

1022
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.800
uh,
man,
there's a lot of good stuff here.
Um,

1023
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.880
so a couple of you have asked me about can you look into comic skate and

1024
00:54:32.881 --> 00:54:34.680
interview Ethan Van Scriber?

1025
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.350
What's going on in the comic book community is crazy.

1026
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:40.200
So I've gotten a couple emails about this.
I've heard about this a little bit.

1027
00:54:40.201 --> 00:54:42.090
Let me do a little bit more research.
I'll see what I can do.

1028
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:46.410
I see there's a bunch of super chat questions about that.
Um,
oh,

1029
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:49.650
and he's the illustrator from,
from 12 rules for life.
Right?
All right.
Okay.

1030
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.740
Give me a little time on this one to pull this one altogether.
Okay.

1031
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.710
Let me jump back into Patriot.
Um,

1032
00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.920
couple of people asking about Obama and the comments.
I addressed that earlier.

1033
00:54:58.921 --> 00:55:03.900
Yes,
I do think it could possibly bring some sanity left,
but I don't know.

1034
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:07.200
Um,
hey,
day personal question.
Are you a novel reader and if so,

1035
00:55:07.201 --> 00:55:08.580
what are some of your favorite novels?

1036
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:13.530
So I haven't really been reading novels lately because I've been reading more

1037
00:55:13.531 --> 00:55:15.820
books of the,
of the people that come in here.
Um,

1038
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:20.960
I am reading a CS Elliot short story right now or it's not a short story,

1039
00:55:21.091 --> 00:55:23.610
it's it,
but it's a thin book.
Oh Man.
I can't remember what it's called.

1040
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.100
I've heard about half of it already.
Uh,

1041
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:28.860
it's in my travel bag if someone wants to see if they can find it,

1042
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:31.980
but I'm really enjoying that.
Um,
it's about these,

1043
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.530
these two guys that basically kidnap another guy and bring him to,
to uh,

1044
00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:40.050
another planet.
Somebody helped me with this.
What the hell is it called?
Um,
okay.

1045
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:44.880
Um,
you should get this person in a lot of,
um,
Dave,

1046
00:55:44.881 --> 00:55:47.520
you need to get Joel Kotkin on the show.
I've seen a couple of out him,

1047
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:51.930
I think his criticism about texts embracive progressiveness of progressive

1048
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:55.050
causes are right in line with the intellectual dark web.
I'll look into that.

1049
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:56.740
I'll look into that.
But look,
even the,

1050
00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.910
even the tech companies are starting to get it.
I'm hearing I,
again,

1051
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:01.680
I can't tell you every conversation I have,

1052
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:05.550
but I'm hearing from big tech CEOs these days.
I mean not every,
everyone,

1053
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:10.050
not everyone isn't progressive and a lot of them feel hostages at their own

1054
00:56:10.051 --> 00:56:13.440
companies because of the way this craziness has spread.

1055
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:17.730
And I think they are starting to wake up.
I don't think it's a coincidence.

1056
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:18.301
In fact,

1057
00:56:18.301 --> 00:56:22.230
I know it's not a coincidence that Peter Teal is moving down to la and getting

1058
00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:23.064
out of silicon.

1059
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:27.280
The what progressivism does in its current incarnation,

1060
00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:29.980
it stifles thought.

1061
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.970
It stifles thought and it demands obedience.

1062
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:37.270
And I know if you're like me,

1063
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:40.990
you don't want to bow and you,
and you certainly don't want to bow forever.

1064
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.390
And that's what they demand at.
If you,
and it's,

1065
00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:48.160
and it's sucky and it's shitty and don't do it.
Okay.
Let's see.
Um,

1066
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:53.230
I heard you on Joe Rogan talking about Nexgen after millennials.

1067
00:56:53.231 --> 00:56:55.990
He said that the next generation will be different because of the shit they see

1068
00:56:55.991 --> 00:56:59.710
now.
Do you agree?
So there's a couple of interesting things happening here,
right?

1069
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:02.590
So I'm,
I'm generation x,
right?

1070
00:57:02.591 --> 00:57:06.610
So I'm after the baby boomers then there was generation x generation y,

1071
00:57:06.611 --> 00:57:11.611
so I'm 42 generation y is people I think that are basically sort of in their

1072
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:16.450
late twenties to mid thirties,
I think.
I think 35 is the cutoff to generation x,

1073
00:57:16.451 --> 00:57:19.690
but you know,
these things are little amorphous.
Um,

1074
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:22.450
and then there was the millennial generation and the millennial generation is

1075
00:57:22.451 --> 00:57:27.360
sort of the generation that ushered in the outrage and upset,
you know,

1076
00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:28.840
it was obsession with technology and all the stuff.

1077
00:57:28.841 --> 00:57:31.360
I don't blame them for any of it because they were brought up on all of this

1078
00:57:31.361 --> 00:57:34.630
stuff and you know,
feelings over facts and the rest of it.

1079
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:37.670
Then there's been a bunch of studies that the generation beneath them,

1080
00:57:37.671 --> 00:57:41.290
the generation that's like in junior high and I think,

1081
00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:44.140
I think probably at the high school now,
but they're actually growing up,

1082
00:57:44.141 --> 00:57:48.760
much more conservative that they realize that this endless screaming and hating

1083
00:57:48.761 --> 00:57:50.770
each other and identity politics,

1084
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:54.190
that they're against all of these things and there's been a comeback to some

1085
00:57:54.191 --> 00:57:58.270
sort of a conservative values.

1086
00:57:58.270 --> 00:57:59.560
However you want to define that.

1087
00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.400
I think that's really interesting and I think we're going to keep seeing the

1088
00:58:03.401 --> 00:58:05.290
fruits of that,
but more than anything else,

1089
00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:09.220
I mean I think the through line of this conversation that we're having today is

1090
00:58:09.221 --> 00:58:14.221
that let's give people a better option for the future.

1091
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.190
Like right.
Even right now,
let's say you're a huge mega person.

1092
00:58:18.191 --> 00:58:20.440
You're a huge Trump person right now.
Well,

1093
00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:23.140
I think everyone realizes whatever side you're on right now,

1094
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:28.150
I think everyone realizes this,
this level of tension and us against them,

1095
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:31.240
whatever side you're on,
it can't last forever.

1096
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:34.510
What could happen is it could snap and something really awful could happen,

1097
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:35.344
right?

1098
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:39.610
But I think what actually could happen is out of the chaos that seemingly is

1099
00:58:39.611 --> 00:58:44.050
happening now is that eventually the chaos won't be needed anymore.

1100
00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:48.970
The disruption that Trump was to the system eventually won't be needed.

1101
00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:53.290
And then perhaps some principled conservatives,
so principled libertarians,

1102
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.370
some principals,
liberals,
and perhaps even,
I'll put it out there.

1103
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:01.750
So some principled,
progressive who I may disagree with,
but our principled

1104
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:06.880
can actually start coming out of the woodwork again.

1105
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:09.610
I've talked about in several times here.
I think it's starting to happen.

1106
00:59:09.611 --> 00:59:12.120
I think there's some signs of it.
It's pretty cool.
All right.
Here's where,
no,

1107
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:14.440
we're going to go for about 10 more minutes.
So if you got any,
uh,

1108
00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:17.560
any other super chats or questions on,
uh,

1109
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:21.470
on Patriot and let me know what else did I want to just tell you real quick.
Oh,

1110
00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.740
um,
let's see.
Um,

1111
00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:27.980
so one of the thing that I wanted to hit on before,
uh,

1112
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.080
before I wrap up and then I'll,
I'll hit a couple other questions is,

1113
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:34.730
so I am going off the grid in August.
So I did this last year.

1114
00:59:34.731 --> 00:59:39.731
I literally locked my phone and a say from August 1st until the last day of

1115
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:44.660
August.
Um,
and then my first show back last year,
which was with,

1116
00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:46.850
uh,
was we build a Franco.

1117
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:50.420
My intention actually for my first show back in September,

1118
00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:53.510
right after Labor Day was to not know anything.
I was just going to come back,

1119
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:56.780
sit with Phil.
And Phil obviously talks about the news often and I think he's,

1120
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:59.060
I think he's a great guy and I think he's doing great stuff.

1121
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.310
My intention was to not know anything the night before I came back at the last

1122
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:07.040
minute,
I was invited to a pretty power player dinner.

1123
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.890
We're all sorts of current events I knew were going to be discussed.

1124
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.160
So I met Eric Weinstein first for a glass of wine and he just unloaded on me on

1125
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:16.880
what had happened over the course of a month.

1126
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:19.700
And there was all this North Korea stuff and the Charlottesville thing and a

1127
01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:21.620
zillion other things that I had no idea about.

1128
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.730
He just like downloaded them all into my brain and then we'd go off to this
side,

1129
01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:30.830
big influential dinner.
It was,
it was pretty nutty.
But,
um,
this,

1130
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.340
this year I am,
I'm going to go off the entire time,
uh,
at the end of July.

1131
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:36.200
These last couple of days,
we're taping a ton of stuff,

1132
01:00:36.201 --> 01:00:40.370
so you will have shows every week.
We are not taking a week off.
Um,
by the way,

1133
01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:42.620
we have,
uh,
Josephine Matthias on tomorrow.

1134
01:00:42.621 --> 01:00:45.680
Who many of you guys know from Youtube?
Uh,
my name is Josephine.

1135
01:00:45.681 --> 01:00:48.530
She's just just absolutely wonderful and I've got to know her in person,

1136
01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:52.100
a little bit Sar in Toronto and she's just lovely and really smart,
cool,

1137
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:56.750
fun thinker.
Um,
but anyway,
we'll put up shows in all this.

1138
01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.400
And I'm going to challenge some of you,

1139
01:00:58.401 --> 01:00:59.750
I don't know exactly how we're going to do this.

1140
01:00:59.751 --> 01:01:03.410
So when I do the off the grid thing,
I literally phone in a safe.

1141
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:06.080
I'm not going to watch TV.
I'm not going to do anything electronic.

1142
01:01:06.081 --> 01:01:07.930
I'm going to work on my book again.
I'm going to skip.

1143
01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:11.990
I'm going away for a little bit of an escape and try to relax and just enjoy

1144
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.990
myself and whatever else and sees family and friends.
Um,

1145
01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.540
I know that a lot of people can't,
can't do that,

1146
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:20.230
like that level of off the greenness or disappear.
Uh,

1147
01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.250
but I am going to figure out a way,

1148
01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:25.550
maybe we'll do a video about it the day before I go to challenge.

1149
01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:28.430
Some of you guys,
you know,
I've been trying to do it on the weekends.
I don't try.

1150
01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:28.911
I really,

1151
01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:31.880
really try not to look at my phone or at least use social media on the weekends.

1152
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:35.390
I think people do need an escape.
I think if there's ever a month to do it,

1153
01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.340
I think August is the month to do it.

1154
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.700
I would love to challenge some of you to really do it with me.

1155
01:01:40.701 --> 01:01:44.600
If you could really,
what if you really didn't even just social media.

1156
01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:47.210
I know it would be hard for some of you that through because of work you

1157
01:01:47.211 --> 01:01:50.280
wouldn't not be able to email let's say.
Um,

1158
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.450
but even if you just got off social media for a month,

1159
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:54.950
like what would it be like,

1160
01:01:54.951 --> 01:01:57.020
and I can tell you that there's a level of withdrawal.

1161
01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:59.240
Like the first couple of days my hand kept going into my pocket,

1162
01:01:59.241 --> 01:02:00.074
where's my phone?

1163
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:04.400
And then by day four or five it starts kind of feeling good and then that by by

1164
01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:07.820
day eight,
it's kind of empowering.
You're like,
holy cow,
I don't need any of that.

1165
01:02:07.821 --> 01:02:12.570
And then you,
you,
you,
your,
your attention span your turns and you start,
uh,

1166
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:15.020
interacting with strangers more.
One of the things I noticed,

1167
01:02:15.021 --> 01:02:18.140
I know this is sounding,
this sounds like such a little nonsensical thing,

1168
01:02:18.141 --> 01:02:21.000
but I've really noticed,
um,

1169
01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:25.410
I was at the supermarket after about 20 days of being off the grid and I

1170
01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:29.370
remember putting my stuff on the belt and the girl,

1171
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:33.420
the cashier is there and I just started being friendlier to how you doing?

1172
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:36.810
What's going on?
Oh,
I saw you here last week about,
oh,
this thing that I bought,

1173
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:40.440
like this was,
this was pretty good.
So I bought it again,
whatever.

1174
01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.450
And it was like you can make room in your brain again to be the way we were 20

1175
01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:47.520
years ago.
Like of course technology is great.

1176
01:02:47.521 --> 01:02:49.230
You're watching this on youtube right now.

1177
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:51.420
We can connect in all these different ways,
right?

1178
01:02:51.421 --> 01:02:54.090
I meet some of you guys in real life because of this.
Um,

1179
01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.480
but just remember 20 years ago we had none of this stuff and we had none of this

1180
01:02:57.481 --> 01:03:00.960
stuff in the thousands of years of humanity before that.
Um,

1181
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:02.280
so I'm looking forward to the escape.

1182
01:03:02.281 --> 01:03:05.370
I will challenge some of you to join me for the month and just see what happens.

1183
01:03:05.371 --> 01:03:08.950
But even if you can only get off,
uh,
get off so to speak,
uh,

1184
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.550
for the weekend or whatever it is,
I think it would be pretty cool.

1185
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:16.230
So hopefully some of you guys will join me for that.
Oh,

1186
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:20.850
and then,
uh,
I will tell you this,
our first show back is on September 4th.

1187
01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:22.110
It's the day after Labor Day.

1188
01:03:22.111 --> 01:03:27.111
I am not going to know anything and I will be a guest on the Rubin report.

1189
01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:31.760
We have a guest host on the Ruben report who is going to,
uh,

1190
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.400
give.
He's going to interview her.
I just said it's a he.
Okay.

1191
01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:38.340
So he's going to interview me and fill me in on all the things that I missed and

1192
01:03:38.341 --> 01:03:43.050
you guys,
we'll,
uh,
we'll watch that live as I get the full download live.
Uh,

1193
01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:47.700
we're going to do that on September 4th,
but I'm not saying who it is.
Um,

1194
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:48.950
you know,

1195
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.050
I think maybe a moment ago that I said that Josephine is a conservative.

1196
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.020
I don't know that actually she's,
I don't think she fully,

1197
01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:58.350
I think she's a classical liberal.
Um,
I think she's got some conservative views.

1198
01:03:58.351 --> 01:04:00.900
And the reason I said that was because she did a video that I think it was

1199
01:04:00.901 --> 01:04:03.660
titled Black People can be conservative.
Um,

1200
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:06.030
I don't think she herself identifies as a conservative.

1201
01:04:06.031 --> 01:04:10.650
So just mean if you're watching,
I apologize for miss labeling.
You,

1202
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.660
there's nothing worse.
Oh,
the book that I love.
Silent Planet,
a CS Lewis.

1203
01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:17.730
So it's a trilogy I'm in.
I'm still on the first one,

1204
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:21.090
but I'm going to knock it out and hopefully on my next travel.
And,
uh,
all right,

1205
01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:22.560
let's see.
Super Chat.

1206
01:04:22.561 --> 01:04:25.590
The interesting thing about watching so many of you for so long is that it helps

1207
01:04:25.591 --> 01:04:26.850
cement the ideas,

1208
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.420
but we also get to see the evolution of the ideas and arguments.
Love your work,

1209
01:04:30.421 --> 01:04:33.240
especially with Jordan.
Thank you very much.
Um,

1210
01:04:33.241 --> 01:04:35.790
there's a bunch of you that wrote a lot of Nice things about me.
Thank you.

1211
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.890
I love what you do,
man.
Took me,
uh,

1212
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.860
from ignoring all the noise to finding some hope for honest discussion,

1213
01:04:40.861 --> 01:04:42.950
important port conversations.
Thank you.
Uh,

1214
01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.890
I DWI dia have been specific shows.
For example,

1215
01:04:46.891 --> 01:04:50.520
having bread and Dawkins on would be great to have multiples perspective from

1216
01:04:50.521 --> 01:04:51.331
specialists.
Yeah.

1217
01:04:51.331 --> 01:04:55.620
So we're thinking about all of this stuff and I think partly once we figure out

1218
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.880
how we can talk more,
you know,

1219
01:04:56.881 --> 01:04:59.220
it's not easy to put these things together and manage.

1220
01:04:59.221 --> 01:05:02.520
We got people that live in all sorts of parts of the parts of the country.

1221
01:05:02.521 --> 01:05:07.440
And you know,
Douglas Murray for example,
in Majid both,
uh,
live in the UK.
So,

1222
01:05:07.441 --> 01:05:10.700
uh,
we're,
we're figuring it all out.
We're,
we got a lot of cool stuff planned.

1223
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:13.620
I'm super psyched about everything that's going on.
Oh.
And by the way,

1224
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.040
the show is expanding.
We are,
we are building out our team.
Uh,

1225
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:23.200
just yesterday actually we hired a new team member who I will introduce to you

1226
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:26.740
at some point along the road.
Um,
but yeah,
we you guys that,

1227
01:05:26.741 --> 01:05:29.530
that support us whether it's on Patriot or paypal or super chat,

1228
01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:32.920
you're helping us build out this thing and uh,

1229
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:36.460
and I hope you're proud of it and I hope you're excited and as excited at least

1230
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:40.480
as I am.
And uh,
all right,
so I think we're going to wrap this thing for now.

1231
01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:42.820
I just wanted to catch up on a whole bunch of stuff for Ya.

1232
01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:47.650
I think we'll probably do a livestream if possible on July 31st so that it can

1233
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:52.150
be my official goodbye and my official challenge for you guys to join me off the

1234
01:05:52.151 --> 01:05:53.830
grid if you can.
And then as I said,
we got,

1235
01:05:53.831 --> 01:05:55.900
we got new content coming out all of August.

1236
01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:59.440
We've got some really cool stuff planned for,
uh,
for September they were,

1237
01:05:59.441 --> 01:06:03.160
there was a huge guest that I thought we were going to have in May that it got

1238
01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:06.350
delayed a little bit.
I think that's happening in September.
And uh,

1239
01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.940
just keep fighting the fight guys.
Like just keep,
keep fighting,

1240
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:14.240
keep giving people a chance to,
to,
to,

1241
01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:19.150
to learn with you,
uh,
to not judge them as quickly as they would judge you.

1242
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:22.960
And let's see what we can keep building here because uh,
it,
it's happening.

1243
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:25.390
It's happening whether we like it or not,
I happen to like it,

1244
01:06:25.391 --> 01:06:28.030
but it's happening whether we like it or not.
So thank you guys.
Oh,

1245
01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:32.170
and by the way,
if you want to get your classical liberal t shirt,

1246
01:06:32.171 --> 01:06:36.550
I believe the link is right down below.
You can go to the Rubin report.com/store.

1247
01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:39.100
There's some other Rubin report stuff on there and all that good stuff.

1248
01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:44.110
All right,
I am going to dinner.
Thanks guys.
See Ya.
Oh,

1249
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:46.240
and we'll get the fricking tri caster work in next time,

1250
01:06:46.241 --> 01:06:48.790
so you don't have to stare at me looking at my computer.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
