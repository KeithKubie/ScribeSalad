00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.450
A tiny but horrible
alien is standing

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.355
at the top of the
Eiffel Tower-- so this

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.840
is where the tiny but
horrible alien is-- which

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.670
is 324 meters tall--
and they label that,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.830
the height of the Eiffel
Tower-- and threatening

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.210
to destroy the city of Paris.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.442
A Men In Black-- or
a Men In Black agent.

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:20.650
I was about to say maybe it
should be a man in black.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.640
A Men In Black agent is
standing at ground level,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.840
54 meters across
the Eiffel square.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.340
So 54 meters from,
I guess you could

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.800
say the center of the
base of the Eiffel Tower,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.630
aiming his laser
gun at the alien.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.140
So this is him
aiming the laser gun.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.420
At what angle should the
agent shoot his laser gun?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.580
Round your answer, if necessary,
to two decimal places.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.380
So if we construct a right
triangle here, and we can.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.990
So the height of this right
triangle is 324 meters.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.605
This width right over
here is 54 meters.

00:00:56.605 --> 00:00:59.230
It is a right triangle.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.210
What they're really
asking us is what

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.620
is this angle right over here.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.060
And they've given us two
pieces of information.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.500
They gave us the side that
is opposite the angle.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.880
And they've given us the side
that is adjacent to the angle.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.620
So what trig function deals
with opposite and adjacent?

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.780
And to remind
ourselves, we can write,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.080
like I always like
to do, soh, cah, toa.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.910
And these are really
by definition.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.180
So you just have to know this,
and soh cah toa helps us.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.390
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.900
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.475
Tangent is opposite
over adjacent.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.760
We can write that
the tangent of theta

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.340
is equal to the length
of the opposite side--

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:00.600
324 meters-- over the length
of the adjacent side-- over 54

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.760
meters.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.520
Now you might say,
well, OK, that's fine.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.830
What angle, when I take its
tangent, gives me 324/54?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.217
Well, for this, it will probably
be useful to use a calculator.

00:02:12.217 --> 00:02:13.800
And the way that
we'd use a calculator

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.810
is we would use the
Inverse Tan Function.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.460
So we could rewrite
this as we're

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.320
going to take the
inverse tangent--

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.970
and sometimes it's written as
tangent with this negative 1

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.760
superscript.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.980
So the inverse tangent
of tan of theta

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.503
is going to be equal to the
inverse tangent of 324/54.

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:42.190
And just to be clear, what
is this inverse tangent?

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.410
This just literally
says, this will

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.530
return what is the angle that,
when I take the tangent of it,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.990
gives me 324/54.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.450
This says, what is
the angle that, when

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.560
I take the tangent of it,
gives me tangent of theta?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.780
So this right over here, this
just simplifies to theta.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.840
Theta is the angle that when
you get the tangent of it

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.590
gets you tangent of theta.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.220
And so we get theta is equal
to inverse tangent of 324/54.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.060
Once again, this inverse tangent
thing you might find confusing.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.020
But all this is saying
is, over here, we're

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.350
saying tangent of
some angle is 324/54.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.695
This is just saying
my angle is whatever

00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:34.300
angle I need so that when
I take the tangent of it,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.540
I get 324/54.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.770
It's how we will
solve for theta.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.310
So let's get our calculator out.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.950
And let's say that we want
our answer in degrees.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.020
Well, I'm just going
to assume that they

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.310
want our answers in degrees.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.710
So let me make sure my
calculator is actually

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.370
in degree mode.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.344
So I'll go to the 2nd
mode right over here.

00:03:56.344 --> 00:03:58.135
And actually it's in
radian mode right now.

00:03:58.135 --> 00:03:59.850
So let me make sure
I'm in degree mode

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.635
to get my answer in degrees.

00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:03.310
Now let me exit out of here.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.942
And let me just type in
the inverse tangent--

00:04:05.942 --> 00:04:07.650
so it's in this yellow
color right here--

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.360
inverse tangent of
324 divided by 54

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.160
is going to be-- and
they told us to round

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.680
to two decimal
places-- 80.54 degrees.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.640
So theta is equal
to 80.54 degrees.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.680
That's the angle at which
you should shoot the gun

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.145
to help defeat this
horrible alien.
