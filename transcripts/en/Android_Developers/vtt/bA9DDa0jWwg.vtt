ROMAN NURIK: Hello again,
and welcome to

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.070
Android Design in Action.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.960
I'm Roman Nurik.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.306
ADAM KOCH: Adam Koch.

00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:10.130
NICK BUTCHER: And
Nick Butcher.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.010
ROMAN NURIK: And today we're
going to talk about a sleep

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.650
monitor app and backward
compatibility.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.230
We have a lot of content to get
through today, so we're

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.090
just going to get started
with sleep monitors.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.660
So the app that we decided
to look at today

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.020
was Sleep as Android.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.050
It's called Sleep as Android.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.350
This is one of the apps that was
reviewed on the App Clinic

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.390
last Friday by Reto Meier.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.800
And Nick took a look at this
app in much detail.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.240
And Nick, do you want
to jump into your

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.560
thoughts on Sleep as Android?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.565
NICK BUTCHER: Sure.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:47.760
So Sleep as Android is an
application that monitors your

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.490
sleep and lets you set an alarm,
so it will wake you up

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.690
at an opportune time when you're
in a very kind of light

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.400
sleep cycle.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.890
It's a very detailed app.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.520
If you take a look at it,
it offers a whole ton of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.850
functionality and configuration
options.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.090
And you can see that the author
is very responsive to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.680
the community.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.920
He's put out something like 15
updates in the last couple of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.340
months alone, which is very,
very responsive.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.090
From a visual point of view,
they have made some effort to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.990
get towards the Holo
design guidelines.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.660
But my overall feeling of the
application was that while

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.810
it's very, very functional and
powerful, I found it kind of

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.975
hard to get into and understand
how to operate and

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:33.680
to prioritize what tasks I
should be doing first and what

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.840
information was important.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.940
So if we take a look at
the application here--

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.100
this is the first screen you
see when you start the app.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.410
This is where you can create
different alarms, as well as

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.280
there's a prompt to unlock.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.670
And some of the key
functionality on this screen

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.487
is down there on the bottom
left, kind of like a

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.000
split-action bar, but kind
of not a split-action

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.930
bar at the same time.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.590
And you can see some of the
functionality there is to add

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.370
a new alarm, start the actual
sleep-tracking mode, to see

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.210
some statistics of your previous
night's sleep.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.550
So, since we're short for time,
should we go straight

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.790
into the redesign and see
what we cooked up?

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.860
So here, you can see
we've done--

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.720
it's not a huge departure, but
we tried to apply some of the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.280
Holo look and feel to
the application.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.360
So straight off there's a
standard action bar giving

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.430
that that sense of where you
are, and a common place to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.680
look for some of the actions.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.420
I felt like we had to reorganize
some of the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.640
functionality a little bit,
because this main screen,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.030
while it offered the alarms,
there's a lot of functionality

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.510
kind of hanging off sub-screens,
as well.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.440
And I felt like this app has
two main purposes, which is

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.280
setting alarms for waking up
at the right time, and for

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.800
monitoring your sleep
and seeing how that

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.890
sleep pattern is going.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.250
So I wanted to float those
right up as your primary

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.620
options into these two main
tabs, here, these Alarms and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.550
Stats tabs.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.640
As you can see, we've also
really, really emphasized the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.810
Track Sleep button.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.120
So instead of just a little
button at the bottom with

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.100
equal, fair weighting toward
the other options, it's now

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.940
this gigantic purple button.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.250
And finally, a little note on
the coloring and the palette.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.570
I found some of the green
highlights to be grabbing your

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.080
focus, saying, look at me,
I'm a divider, which felt

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.530
slightly off to me.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.370
So we readdressed the palette
a little bit here.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.515
It's taking quite a lot of
cues from the stock alarm

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:35.590
clock in the latest version of
Android for two reasons.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.030
Firstly, I like it.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.700
I think it's a that beautiful
app-- might be controversial,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.130
not everyone thinks so.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.050
But also, it is offering
slightly similarly

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.650
functionality, so it's
helping to bootstrap

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.710
these as mental model.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.415
A lot of the user interface
elements we've used look the

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:52.172
same as from the stock
alarm clock app.

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:53.990
So hopefully it can get started
with this application

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.040
a bit quicker.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.420
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.460
One thing I wanted to mention
about the color scheme, the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.230
switch from these neon green
to a neon violet.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.570
I guess it's the violet that's
in the Android Design official

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.230
color palette.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.600
I think that it's just a little
less in your face.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.740
It's still very much
an accent color.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.275
It's not like a dull gray
or a dull blue,

00:04:18.275 --> 00:04:19.730
where it's more muted.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.720
But it's a little easier
on the eyes.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.440
And I think you can even
probably go even one shade

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.670
darker, if you want.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.970
On some devices, it
may be too bright.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.560
But I think it's just much
easier to look at the screen

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.780
and not be overwhelmed
immediately.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.900
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.980
One of the thing that I wanted
to say is that this is one of

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.070
the last things you'll look
at before you go to sleep.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.330
If you're about to go to bed,
you're going to hit Sleep.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.232
So normally, for this kind of
app, I would immediately want

00:04:45.232 --> 00:04:48.100
to change it to a
light palette.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.140
For most apps I think a light
palette is generally a good

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.920
starting point.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.985
But, for this app, because you
didn't want to have that

00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:54.780
feeling of you're [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.460
and you turn your phone, and
suddenly, you're kind of

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.370
blinded by intensity.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.235
So I tried to keep the tones
quite mute to try and ease

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:05.510
that kind of transition,
really.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.160
ADAM KOCH: In terms of
navigation, I like how you've

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.890
split Stats and Alarms into the
top-level tabs there, and

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.990
removing it from the faux
split-action bar that was in

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.070
the previous version, leaving
the two main actions that are

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.260
visible there-- the Track
Sleep and the Add.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.790
NICK BUTCHER: I found a point
on the before shot.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.290
You can see there's a little
bug droid figure

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.180
in the bottom corner.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.570
And his state changes depending
on how close it is

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.350
to you having to go to bed.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.110
So right now, it's the daytime,
and he's got a

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.700
[INAUDIBLE] in front
of him or whatever.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.450
But as he gets close to night,
he starts brushing his

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.840
teeth and so on.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.360
And while I think that's
useful and fun--

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.150
I do really like that--

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.340
I do find sometimes including
a bug droid in your

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.840
application or even Android or
Droid in the name of the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.080
application is kind of
lazy and amateurish.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.660
It doesn't really shout, this
is a fully professional

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.110
application.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.470
I've thought through
the interaction.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.820
So I tried to incorporate the
same elements using Same

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.620
Difference.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.170
So if you can see on the
aftershot, very subtly,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.120
there's a number of sleepy Z's
in the background to the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.380
application.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.000
The idea here being as you get
closer to bedtime, more of

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.642
them start coming out from the
Track Sleep button or you

00:06:17.642 --> 00:06:19.260
could have them subtly
animate in some ways.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.020
It's very, very subtle here, but
it's trying to convey the

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.220
same kind of information, but in
a slightly more subtle way.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.610
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.020
And we also did a job on
changing the icons.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.050
So we shifted the icon from
being a sleeping, cute bug

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.330
droid to something
very generic.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.900
This is just a very generic
icon, but, again, something

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.330
that is a little more
recognizable and something

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.570
that is a little more
unique to the app.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.950
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.300
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.666
ROMAN NURIK: Should we move
on to the next screen?

00:06:51.666 --> 00:06:54.000
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.950
All righty.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.575
So next up.

00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:00.385
The next one of the major
functions I thought this app

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:03.660
does is give you lots of
information about how you have

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.780
been sleeping, almost too
much information.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.380
So if we touch the graph, like
on the bottom left, you get to

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.910
the subsequent screen here with
a number of options here.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.020
So we've picked out the Stat
screen here, which can have a

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.580
very, very long table.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.780
And this is just and a small
sampling of information,

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.380
because I hadn't been running
the app for very long.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.970
If you look at the developer's
screenshots on the place

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.740
though, you can see this
can be a massive table.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.300
And while it gives you some
average stats, it's summed up

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.180
over all time.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.210
Now, I tried to readdress this
and think, what do I really

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.615
care about?

00:07:34.615 --> 00:07:38.220
I probably only care about the
last week's stats, like

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.220
anything that's older than that
probably doesn't really

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.985
have much bearing on how I feel
my sleep has been going.

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:46.530
What happened two months
ago isn't really

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.090
relevant any longer.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.080
So what I've done with this
screen is I've tried to

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.830
provide these summary stats.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.870
So the most important thing to
me is a summary of this week,

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.170
how have I been doing for the
last, say, seven days or

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.120
whenever the start of the week
in your calendar starts from.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.090
And so we've pulled out some
summary statistics, and those

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.240
are big and bold.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.450
And it uses color to signify
whether you are close to your

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.410
target average length of sleep
per night or whether you're

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.060
building up a sleep debt.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.830
So here, we can see we're using
orange for OK-ish, blue

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.030
for yeah, you're doing well, or
red for warning, you're not

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:21.860
getting enough sleep.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.660
So instantly, when I look at
this, I get this quick,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.350
scannable screen which tells
me what's going on.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.600
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.890
You can see that on Tuesday,
you, for some reason, didn't

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:30.440
sleep very well.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.328
Maybe you were out on the town
the night before, or

00:08:34.328 --> 00:08:35.568
something like that.

00:08:35.568 --> 00:08:36.560
NICK BUTCHER: Too
many Christmas

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.549
parties at the moment.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:42.110
So, we've consciously demoted
a lot of information.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.140
So if you look at the before,
there's other tabs for noise

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.320
and graphs, as well as some kind
of store, as well, which

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.730
didn't seem to be worthy
of being a

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.230
top-level information item.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.680
It was kind of like adding
noise, and making it harder

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.750
for me to realize what
was really important.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.590
So we've really simplified it
down to these few items, and

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.160
we let you roll the whole week
up and down, if you want to

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.210
turn it into a summary or drill
down into each one.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.490
We still think this
information's interesting, for

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.750
those people who
want it though.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.820
So the idea here is that you can
tap on each of the days.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.530
You can then go forward into a
subsequent screen, which is

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.430
going to give you details about
that one night's sleep

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.332
that you've tracked.

00:09:20.332 --> 00:09:21.510
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:28.940
NICK BUTCHER: So here, on the
next slide, instead of having

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.215
this whole roll of graphs--

00:09:33.215 --> 00:09:35.870
that kind of view of all the
different days as a graph

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.170
didn't really tell me much.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.870
I didn't find that
very glanceable.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.630
You couldn't really look at it
and say, oh, that was a good

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.360
night, oh, that was
a bad night.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.190
But the graphs themselves
are quite cool.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.390
So we demoted them down
to a detail screen.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.870
So if you touched each of the
line items from the previous

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.320
screen, you get through to sleep
details that will tell

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.900
you how long you actually slept
for, how long of that

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.590
was in deep sleep, what
percentage, and give you that

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.720
really nice graph showing
you exactly what

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.420
the night was like.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.480
That's where there's
a [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.790
information can capture when
you record your sleep--

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.620
like a rating or a comment on
how good a night it was.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.280
So these are really details
that truly change the

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.452
information hierarchy and
can put these down to

00:10:13.452 --> 00:10:14.591
a subsequent screen.

00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:15.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.920
ROMAN NURIK: I think it was
just a great job, just

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.820
splitting up a very, very
complex screen-- a complex

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.590
screen that has good
data, but it's just

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.730
not as easy to consume.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.090
And showing you something that's
letting you really look

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.920
at the content, or one specific
piece of content, the

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.390
specific day, and seeing
all the details on it.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.070
I think it's just a good
combination of different types

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.880
of pieces of the content, like
a graph, some averages, some

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.090
data like that.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.160
Potentially allowing the user to
provide a comment, or even

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.230
providing a recommendation.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:55.160
Like maybe you should wear
something or sleep stiller.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.620
Who knows?

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.573
I know nothing about sleeping
medication or

00:10:58.573 --> 00:10:58.950
anything like that.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.680
But giving the user all these
different types of components

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.680
to their one night of sleep is
a really interesting and

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.380
unique way to present that.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:07.830
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.695
Personally, I really like the
typography that you've used

00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:12.500
here, Nick, on both this screen
and the other screen.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.927
It just really brings out the
important information, and

00:11:14.927 --> 00:11:16.550
plus the coloring
really helps.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:21.410
It helps you glance at it
and see what's going on.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.930
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.170
And there's one final redesign
idea we had for this

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:26.910
application.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.940
And that's to take advantage
of a cool new feature in

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.410
Android 4.2 called Daydreams.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.360
So for those of you who might
not be aware, Daydreams is

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.160
like a screensaver
functionality.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.660
So you can set up a Daydream to
say that when my device is

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.590
docked or charging, kick
over into this--

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.800
kind of like a screensaver.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.570
So what I thought would be
really, really cool is rather

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.917
than having to manually go into
the application and start

00:11:51.917 --> 00:11:55.840
it to track you sleeping,
it would be awesome if--

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.950
just the fact that, I guess,
most people like me probably

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.130
plug their phone in at night
so it's charging overnight.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.740
So just doing that is enough
to say kick off a Daydream,

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.630
which will then start
tracking your sleep.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.480
I imagine you'd probably put
some logic in there if it's in

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.310
the middle of the day, or
something like this.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.990
You wouldn't actually
kick off Daydream.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.910
But just the act of plugging in
the device and putting it

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.490
down on your bed could then kick
off the functionality.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.840
So I really find it's a bit of
a burden on the user to have

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.210
to go into this application
every night and

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.340
remember to do it.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.290
Hit the Start button,
hit the Stop button.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.710
Remember to do that
in the morning.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.490
So anything you can do to
automate that process I think

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.430
is going to make the
user more regular.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.170
They're going to keep on using
it and see the value of their

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.140
application.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.060
So I thought a Daydream might
be a cool way to do that.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.225
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:12:43.225 --> 00:12:45.940
It's just another way to step
up the level of, or the

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.080
feeling of, magic in this
app, where, if you can

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.160
automatically track these
things, then do it.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.980
So before 9:00 PM, 10:00 PM,
if it turns on, or if your

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.930
phone goes idle, maybe you
just show a clock.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.810
It's fairly easy to just create
a simple clock Daydream

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.010
that just shows the current
time and the current date.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.420
But then after a certain point,
it kicks into kind of

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.070
tracking mode and
shows the clock.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:17.150
And maybe this is a way to play
like soothing sounds in

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.170
the background or something,
as you're sleeping.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.890
So since this app is already
doing all this data capture,

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.340
maybe it can use that
intelligently to even improve

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.400
your sleep as you're sleeping,
maybe by playing sounds or

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.210
something like that.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.730
So, lots of ideas here.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.000
I think the Daydream idea
is really good, here.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.360
Nick.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:35.720
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.060
And, of course, you
can interact with

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:37.880
Daydreams, as well.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.200
So you could still have
something that you could touch

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.660
and resize, or potentially
graphs during the day that you

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.120
could look at or something
like that.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.675
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:13:47.675 --> 00:13:49.510
So overall, a really nice app
with lots and lots of

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.160
functionality.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.960
I hope the developer likes some
of the ideas we've thrown

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.890
around there and perhaps
runs with them.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:57.130
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.160
And if you're the developer of
this app and you're watching,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.350
feel free to let us know what
you think on Google+ or even

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.130
email or whatever.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.140
But we're definitely looking
forward to talking to you if

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.540
you have any questions or if
you want some of the ideas.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.810
Or even some of the source.psd
files, or anything that.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.000
If we ever review your app or
take a look at your app and we

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.420
do a mock up, if you want to
sources, they're are always

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.390
available--

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.740
no licensing issues.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.260
We'll just hand them
over to you.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.600
NICK BUTCHER: And we
do it with love.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.800
I saw some comments for our past
redesign of [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.550
saying, is that a slap-down
from Google having them to

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.540
redesign your app?

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.010
That's not what this
show is about.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.820
This is about what
it could be.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.930
We'd love to work with you to
help you get the best Android

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.750
design that you can.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.240
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.410
And almost all the apps we
review, they're awesome apps.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.010
They're really just good.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.800
They're fulfilling their
functions really well.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:51.980
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.110
We need to move on.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.530
ROMAN NURIK: Yes, we should.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:53.750
ADAM KOCH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.710
ROMAN NURIK: So we've
got 15 minutes left.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.340
We need to fly through backward
compatibility.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.390
So we have a lot of slides on
backward compatibility--

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.250
fortunately, a lot of them
are screenshots.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.080
But let's get started.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.310
So before we talk about our
strategies and tips for

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:11.180
backward compatibility, and
specifically for designing for

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.730
backward compatibility, not so
much for developing for that.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.910
We have lots and lots of
training sessions and all that

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.240
for developers, but
this is really

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.030
more targeted at designers.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.500
Before we share some of our own
tips here, I'd definitely

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.820
make sure that you guys, you
designers out there, are

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.260
looking at the design guidelines
for compatibility.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.890
The guideline's page for
compatibility is fairly short.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.900
It only talks about a few
important things.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.740
Some of the things include the
Legacy menu button, how Action

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.800
Overflow behaves across
different devices.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.120
So it's definitely stuff that
you should be aware of before

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.580
jumping into mockups
or anything.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:48.945
NICK BUTCHER: Just pause
this video right

00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:50.336
now and go read it.

00:15:50.336 --> 00:15:52.776
We'll wait.

00:15:52.776 --> 00:15:53.550
And we're back.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.240
ADAM KOCH: Let's move on.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.470
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.650
We do have a lot to cover.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.640
So backward compatibility.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.490
The way we view backward
compatibility is that for each

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.960
screen in your app-- and you
could extend this to your

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.400
entire app or just an
individual widget--

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.060
for each screen, visual styling
and the behavior,

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.570
basically visual and interaction
design, can

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:20.970
operate along a spectrum of how
close it is to the primary

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:21.930
version of the app.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:26.700
So for example, and if I have an
app design for Android 4.0

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.350
and above, and I have Holo
elements in there, on earlier

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.060
versions, on Android 2.3,
Gingerbread, Froyo, whatever,

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.070
you can make a choice of either
taking that Holo design

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.070
or your completely
custom design and

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.070
using it on that device.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.260
Or you can kind of
say whatever the

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.840
device default is--

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.280
for example, for check boxes
on Gingerbread, they were

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.760
green instead of blue--

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.560
in some devices back
then, it was like

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.220
blue, red or whatever.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.250
You can make the choice that I
should use a device default,

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.060
or you could just choose
something in the middle.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:07.500
So usually it's a little harder
to make everything Holo

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.900
back to Gingerbread and Froyo.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.310
It's very, very easy
for developers to

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.530
use the device defaults.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.640
And then this hybrid is
somewhere in the middle.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.114
So the hybrid solution--

00:17:21.114 --> 00:17:23.260
you have to be kind of
careful about it.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.300
It can still really work, and
we'll show you guys in the

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.860
screenshots coming up that
hybrid UIs, where some

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.210
components are Holo and some
components are using the

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.480
device default styling,
they can work.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.490
So we'll show a couple
of examples of those.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:43.270
But this is really how we see
the way you decide on a

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.290
backward compatibility
strategy.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.860
You kind of pick somewhere
along the spectrum.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.180
And depending on where you
choose, you need to work with

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.000
your developers on this.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.060
But depending on where you
choose, that will change the

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.900
amount of effort involved for
developers, and certainly it

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.250
will change the final outcome.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:03.050
But just be aware that these are
the different options, and

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.740
there's really no correct
choice, I'd say.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.940
Like I said before, you can do
it correctly, you can do it

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.030
right using any one of these
different options.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.892
It's really up to you to make
sure that it just works well.

00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:13.260
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.530
It's really just a
trade-off between

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.320
these different options.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.240
Like there's more effort
involved on the left side of

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.460
the spectrum, but you'll have
a more consistent look.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.721
On the right side, it can still
work, as we'll show you

00:18:23.721 --> 00:18:26.410
in the screenshots shortly.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.103
NICK BUTCHER: A bit
more effort.

00:18:27.103 --> 00:18:27.830
There's some tools out
there to help.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:28.350
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.520
And we'll talk about the tools
out there that are more

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.830
relevant to the developers
and designers, but still,

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.010
definitely, there is stuff
out there to help.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.520
So having said that, Holo--

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.185
a lot of people ask
us-- is Holo for

00:18:42.185 --> 00:18:43.970
Android 4.0 and above?

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.390
In the end, should I even try
to use Holo in earlier

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.240
versions of the platform?

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.320
And our answer is yes.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.250
Holo is not designed just for
the latest devices out there.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.060
Holo is really designed for all
people, for all humans.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.230
It's really a design language
for human-computer

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.400
interaction, not just
human-Android 4.0 Plus

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.440
interaction.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.910
It can work everywhere.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.180
Obviously, it takes some effort
to make it work, but

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.020
again, as a designer, you to
think of it less as the

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.200
styling of Android 4.0,
and really as

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.850
the identity of Android.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:18.980
So that's an important
point to make.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.620
Another is that the core
experience across all

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.260
platforms should really
be consistent.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.480
You shouldn't really have to
design an entirely separate

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.940
app for Gingerbread and for
Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.730
So things like the action bar,
those should be visible and

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.590
persistent across all devices.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.290
You shouldn't switch into a
completely different UI on

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.910
earlier versions just
because there's no

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.130
built-in framework component.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.190
And, again, we'll
talk about that.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.420
So things like layouts, the core
layouts, the navigation--

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.230
like swiping between tabs--

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.320
and the core interactions--

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:58.480
like the basic way you choose
a contact, for example.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.230
Those should really behave
the same across

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.810
different OS versions.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.410
And I think that for design--
and the last point is really

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.380
more about developers--

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.710
but be opportunistic.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.530
Beyond the core experience, the
core navigation, really,

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.660
the core feel of the app, like
the individual check boxes,

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.050
and the spinners, and
things like that, be

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.000
opportunistic about it.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.100
Make sure that nothing looks
really bad, obviously, but be

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:25.750
opportunistic.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.330
And don't put yourself in a
position where you must have

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.520
everything pixel-perfect,
because that's

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.550
just a losing battle.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.960
It's going to take too much
time, and you're going to lose

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.460
focus from what's really
important, and that is the

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.190
core experience of the app.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.250
So before we go on, any
other points, guys?

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.146
About these three?

00:20:46.146 --> 00:20:46.530
NICK BUTCHER: Nope.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.290
ADAM KOCH: Let's go.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:47.560
ROMAN NURIK: Solid.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:47.740
Let's go.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.290
ADAM KOCH: Let's do it.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.070
ROMAN NURIK: Another thing to
mention-- this is more on the

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.280
tactical side.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.450
So one of the big differences,
and you'll see this in

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:58.050
screenshots, between Android 4.0
and Android 2.3 and such

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.020
is the topography,
is the font.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.150
So Roboto is the default on
Android 4.0 and higher, and

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.420
Droid Sans was the default
everywhere else.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.190
So this is one area where you
really shouldn't try to just

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:16.190
take Roboto and use it
everywhere on Android 2.3.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.920
The reason being that users
are really accustomed to

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.200
seeing-- like their eyes almost
expect to read text in

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.320
a certain way on their device,
and so you should really just

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.800
use the system default font.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.620
The good thing is that for
designers, when you're

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.193
planning out the widths of your
elements and things, you

00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:38.070
have to think, obviously, how
many characters will fit in

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.780
this line or in this
UI widget.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.750
And the good thing is that
Roboto and Droid Sans are

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.370
metrics-compatible, meaning
that if you take the same

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.630
piece of text in Roboto and
Droid Sans on an Android 2.3

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.470
device and an Android 4.0
device, you'll notice that

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.720
they're pretty much
the same width.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.090
So what's more important here
is things like translations,

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.980
where, for example, the German
version or the German strings

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.810
for something will cause
things to be

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.110
really, really wide.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.750
That's more important to think
about than just saying, oh, I

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.920
need to choose the
right font here.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.770
So be more aware of that than
just the difference between

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.650
Droid Sans and Roboto in
English, for example.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.160
And then also--

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.050
this is, again, more
for tactics--

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.670
but in your process, it's really
important for designers

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.170
to participate in the
device-testing process.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.330
So usually, you'll have a QA
team or maybe a developer that

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:34.200
has a whole bunch of devices,
and they're kind of testing

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.960
the APKs on all those devices.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.300
Designers should really
participate, because sometimes

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.030
designers in a team are
some of the most

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.590
visually sensitive folks.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:49.100
So they'll be able to pick out
what the little quirks are.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.580
So, as a designer, you should
try to introduce yourself into

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.610
the QA process.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.620
Not, obviously, full-time, but
spend some time making sure

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:01.130
that you're testing the output
on earlier versions of the

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.400
platform as well different
devices, so you just get a

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.790
feel for what it looks like.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.780
NICK BUTCHER: And there's
a bunch of continuous

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.110
integration tools that test your
app on different versions

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.300
and will produce screenshots.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.980
And you can take a look at the
screenshot generated on older

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.850
or smaller devices [INAUDIBLE],
which will help

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.590
you [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.580
ROMAN NURIK: And this is
something that, Nick, you

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.070
alluded to earlier, but if a
developer comes to you as a

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:27.150
designer and says, we can't do
this specific UI because it's

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.830
only available on Honeycomb
and above or

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.140
Android 4.0 and above.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.350
That's not always a great
excuse, because there are

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:38.480
great libraries out there that
solve this for them.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.780
So you don't have to think that,
oh, I need to design an

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.280
app with an action bar and an
app without an action bar, and

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.590
an app with all Holo components,
and an app with

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.700
zero Holo components, because
it's just not available.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.640
There are lots of libraries out
there that will help you.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.700
Here are just a few.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.980
So ActionBarSherlock, I'm
sure a lot of you

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.000
are familiar with.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.800
That, basically, is almost a
100% backport of the action

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.670
bar to previous versions
of the platform.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.850
HoloEverywhere actually gives
you a lot of the standard

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.020
widget styling, like spinners
and text fields and such.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.230
And, actually, they do a lot
more, like calendars, calendar

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.030
view, and things like that.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.310
The give you a lot.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.210
This library gives you a lot
of stuff that you can just

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.980
backport to earlier versions.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.330
So if a developer comes to you
and says, I absolutely cannot

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.200
use the action bar because it's
not available on earlier

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.640
versions of the platform,
fight that.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.540
Tell them that you do have tools
available to you, and

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.460
maybe that's not the greatest
reason for not doing it.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.630
Before we move into the
screenshots, any extra

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.015
thoughts, parting wisdom for
backward compatibility

00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:45.220
strategies?

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.260
NICK BUTCHER: Holo
all the things.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.060
ADAM KOCH: Holo everything.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.810
ROMAN NURIK: Holo
all the things.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.510
But it's really up
to you, right?

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.280
As a designer, you should be
aware of the different types

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.770
of devices out there, be aware
of the tools that developers

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:59.410
have to them, and make the right
decision for your app.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.970
NICK BUTCHER: More seriously,
I'd say that if you had

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.975
infinite resources, you'd
probably end up writing a

00:25:02.975 --> 00:25:04.550
version of your app which
[INAUDIBLE] write a home in

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.072
Ice Cream Sandwich, write a home
on Gingerbread, write a

00:25:06.072 --> 00:25:07.150
home on Froyo.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.150
But given not everyone has the
resources to do that, you want

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.590
to put most of your effort into
skating where the puck's

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.910
going, and designing for Holo
and then, like Roman says, be

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.340
opportunistic about backporting
the finer pixel

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.250
control stuff, where you
have the capacity.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:23.570
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.380
So in the interest of time,
since I think our producer

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.680
actually has to run in about
five minutes or so.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.630
So let's fly through
some screenshots.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.690
So all these screenshots are
going to be apps that we feel

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.800
do the right thing, and you're
going to see that it's a

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.940
combination of that universal
Holo everywhere, kind of a

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.880
pure, device default, and
somewhere in the middle.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.490
So this is tasks-free.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.400
This is both the interactions
and visuals on Gingerbread and

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.430
Jelly Bean, and you'll see
that throughout all these

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.220
screenshots.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.340
So this is just their
edit screen.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.050
You'll notice that they have
Holo styling everywhere.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.890
This is the same, tasks-free.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.810
And all these slides will
be available after.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.180
And, by the way, guys,
feel free to jump

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.250
in as you see fit.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.030
But this is all just, again,
another example of apps that

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.897
have a pure universal
look and feel here.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.240
This is Pattern, another app
that is a really good example

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.900
of how to do things almost
perfectly replicated across

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.960
Gingerbread and Jelly Bean.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.890
And this is the first example
you see where

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.470
there's hybrid styling.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.160
So the Play Store on Gingerbread
uses kind of the

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.380
standard text fields and a
custom button style, and on

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.410
ICS and above, they use
the Holo text field

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.710
styling and the Holo--

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.670
well, actually, I guess it's
also a custom button.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.010
But, again.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.500
It works really well
in both cases.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.750
There's no obvious mismatch
of components here.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.030
This is one minor case I wanted
to point out, where

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.890
almost everything here in Series
Guide in Holo, except

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.440
for the little stars.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.810
And so these stars, here, in
Gingerbread are green, on ICS,

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.630
they're blue.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:06.930
And, really, again, it doesn't
really detract from the

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.970
experience that it's sharing
some styling, and that it's

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:15.220
using what the device
has as a default.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.250
This is an example
of the I/O App.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.110
This is just one minor
screen, where

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.830
there's a mix of styling.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.090
This, actually, we need to
improve this for next year.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.190
I think this could be better.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.490
But this is an example of where
it kind of works fairly

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.080
well, but it can be improved.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.500
NICK BUTCHER: And that's a great
example of what you're

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.590
talking about with the
typography, where the Droid

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.410
Sans looks right at home on
Gingerbread, and the Roboto

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.070
looks right at home on ICS.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.210
ROMAN NURIK: And note all of
these use Droid Sans on

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.420
Gingerbread, and
Roboto on ICS.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.110
Another quick example from the
Recipe Search App of text

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:52.920
field on the left, text
field on the right.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.110
This is an example of using--

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.210
I think it's from How About
We, which is an

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.460
online dating site--

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:07.140
a mix of Holo styling for
Gingerbread and platform

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.880
default styling.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.800
And again, it works OK.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.820
The core feel and experience
in the app is really

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.180
maintained.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.980
It's just this one screen has
kind of a mix of widget

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.990
styling, so I think it still
works quite well.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:26.690
Another example from
How About We.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.550
So this is another case, Search,
where by default, the

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.220
platform has this built-in
search mechanism.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.860
So if you're using the
[? called ?] search manager,

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.960
which is kind of irrelevant
for designers, but the

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.310
platform default search looks a
certain way on Gingerbread.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.996
And you should really try to
use that, because users are

00:28:42.996 --> 00:28:43.920
really used to that.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.810
Whereas in Jelly Bean, there's
another, different type a way

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.270
to do it using something called
Search View and the

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.370
action bar.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.910
That shows that same kind
of auto-complete stuff.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.350
So it's really very,
very similar.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.100
The implementation's slightly
different for developers.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.380
But, again, it's using what
users would expect--

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.275
standard platform stuff on the
left, and the standard action

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:05.525
bar stuff on the right.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.690
ADAM KOCH: Another example of
Ted Search View versus old

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:12.940
Gingerbread styling.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.390
ROMAN NURIK: And this is an
example of preferences, where

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.860
you generally want to use the
system defaults styling.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.050
You don't want to have your
own custom styling there.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:28.090
So, where possible, use the
standard preference, activity

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.970
preference fragment to do
all that stuff for you.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.860
And apps like tasks which have
generally themed everything

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.140
Holo style, in the preferences,
they still fall

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.450
back on the standard--

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.730
oh, here we go.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.000
You beat me to it.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.240
Yeah.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.412
The same as Ted.

00:29:42.412 --> 00:29:43.662
ROMAN NURIK: The same as Ted.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.290
And then this is, real
quick, to talk

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.370
about contextual actions.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.900
Jeff, if you have to
go, by all means.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.790
So contextual actions-- this
is something that's kind of

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:56.950
controversial.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:00.190
Do you backport the contextual
action bar, which is kind of,

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.000
I'd say, a minor interaction.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.540
And I think that's really
up to the developer.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.240
If it's easy, then do it.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.600
If not, then don't do it,
unless it's the core

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.690
experience in your app.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:14.790
In this case, for Pattern, the
core mechanic here is to work

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.650
with patterns, so allowing users
to do multiple selection

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:22.100
on the patterns make sense here,
but certainly, I think

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.600
it's still secondary, where you
can still perform these

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.590
actions in a detail screen.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:30.860
So don't feel completely
obligated to backport your

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.980
contextual action bar.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.660
I will say the ActionBarSherlock
does this

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.185
contextual action bar
backport for you, so

00:30:36.185 --> 00:30:38.660
something to keep in mind.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.640
And this is an example of the
I/O App, which in which we

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.920
chose not to backport the
contextual action bar.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.190
So here, when you long-press
something, you just get a

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.030
Context menu, which, again, is
more standard on earlier

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.870
versions of the platform.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.290
Another screen from Pattern
where they've chosen the

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.540
device default styling
for dialogs.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.910
And they've actually correctly
flipped the positive and

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:06.940
negative actions in the
dialog, which is good.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.580
And some more from the Play
Store, and I think

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.890
that's the last one.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:10.400
Yes.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.010
OK.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.080
ROMAN NURIK: So that was
backward compatibility.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.155
Obviously, we can't cover
such a big topic in

00:31:14.155 --> 00:31:16.390
such a short period.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:18.600
If you guys have comments,
thoughts, feel

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.710
free to post online.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.120
And if there's anything we
missed, we even touch on this

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.395
sometime in another episode.

00:31:25.395 --> 00:31:25.860
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.255
Maybe we should do
a follow-up show.

00:31:27.255 --> 00:31:27.720
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, for sure.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.610
NICK BUTCHER: Lots
of content here.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.070
ROMAN NURIK: Let's fly through
Design News, since we have

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.050
very little time.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:35.880
First, Taylor, as always, has
been doing redesigns.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.890
He just did a really cool
redesign on a movie ticketing

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:43.100
app using the Wizard Pager
example that I pushed out a

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.610
few weeks ago, which
is really cool.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:48.070
And this is kind of a custom
card style, here, for the

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.771
tickets you've purchased.

00:31:48.771 --> 00:31:50.021
It's really cool.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.050
Obviously we recently launched
the official Android Design

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:57.330
Community on Google+.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.610
Here's just a couple of examples
of post there.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.880
If you haven't seen it yet,
I'd recommend joining--

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.990
lots of good content coming
out from there.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.110
NICK BUTCHER: I'm loving
this community.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.310
Really high quality of
discussion going on in there.

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:08.530
Good job, guys.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.420
ROMAN NURIK: And lastly, Nick,
do you want to talk about the

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.620
response of Headache Relief
for Android slides?

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.090
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.950
This is a really beautiful
presentation.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.250
I highly encourage you to check
this out if you want a

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.300
good summary or take the
temperature of where

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.920
Responsive Design is on Android,
especially from a web

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.300
developer's point of view--

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.875
