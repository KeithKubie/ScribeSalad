00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
You're a good citizen, right?

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.080
You voted in the last election, or you're
looking forward to voting in the future.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.170
You pay your taxes.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.690
You're happy to exercise the full range of
your civic responsibilities.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.280
The point is, you might already know all about
how your government works.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.080
If you don't, and you're American, well, there's
a Crash Course for that.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.000
But even if you're an informed citizen who knows
every line of your constitution by heart, that doesn't
mean you know why your government works.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.120
For that, we need a different kind of political
knowledge.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.280
Civics can tell you how your system works,
but sociology can help you understand why.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:41.520
[Theme Music]

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.480
So, what do we mean when we talk about politics?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.920
A civics class can define politics in terms
of the particular systems of government, but
sociologists have a broader definition:

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.080
Politics is the major social institution by
which society organizes decision-making
and distributes power and resources.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.400
By this definition, politics obviously
includes things like the government itself,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.580
but it also includes things outside of it, like
political party organizations and lobbying groups,
and even social movements.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.180
Voting is a political action, but so is going
to a demonstration or calling your representative.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.640
Or boycotting a company whose CEO has ideas
that you find disagreeable.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.800
Because, these are all ways of trying to influence
societal decision-making and the distribution of power.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.540
That being said, the government does have special
importance here, because it's the major formal
organization that organizes and regulates politics,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.560
so it’s responsible for making decisions
for the whole of society.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.080
And it can carry out these decisions,
because it has a lot of power,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.120
which our old friend Max Weber defined as the ability
to achieve desired ends over the objections of others.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.680
Now, Weber considered a government's
power to be coercive power, or power that’s
backed by the threat of force.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.960
You might not think of your government as a threat,
but Weber actually defined a state as the organization
that has a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.060
Of course – and thankfully – not every
action that a government takes requires an
overt use of force.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.560
Under normal circumstances, people respect
the political systems at work in their government,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.200
and they tend to view state power as an
expression of authority, where state leaders
have the right to use legitimate power.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.420
And so, while violence for Weber is always
the ultimate last resort of the state, most
of the time, it isn't necessary.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.860
Weber also recognized that the power of a
political system comes in a variety of forms.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.520
Traditional authority is power that’s legitimized by
respect for long-standing cultural patterns and beliefs.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.380
It’s based on the same idea as the traditional
mindset we talked about in episodes 9 &amp; 17,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.560
namely that the world has a basic order to it,
and that order must be respected.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.020
Another style of power is known as rational-legal
authority, or power legitimized by legally enacted
rules and regulations.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.000
This is the power behind the US Constitution,
whose written rules determine the entire American
political and legal system.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.240
When the Constitution is changed or reinterpreted, the
rules change, as with when the Supreme Court ruled that
same-sex marriage was legal in 2015, for example.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.780
Finally, we have a kind of wildcard power:
charismatic authority, which is power legitimized
by the extraordinary personal qualities of a leader.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.520
Jesus of Nazareth leading a new religious
movement, or Martin Luther King Jr. leading
thousands of people in the civil rights movement

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.480
are examples of personalities that
mobilized precisely this kind of authority.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.700
But authority that rests entirely on the qualities
of one person can be unstable.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.720
So sometimes that power becomes transferred
to something outside – separate from – that
one charismatic person.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:34.900
This is called the routinization of charisma, and it’s
where charismatic authority is transformed into some
combination of traditional and/or rational-legal authority.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.180
The founding of the Church after Jesus' death
is a good example of this.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.520
Now, just as there are different kinds of
authority, so too are there different forms
of government.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.800
For instance, democracy – a political system
that gives power to the people as a whole –
tends to be backed by rational-legal authority.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:58.580
This isn't terribly surprising, since, in Weber’s model, democracy as a form of government and a rational-legal approach to authority both emerged with rationalization and the rise of bureaucracy.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.860
And we can see a certain affinity between democracy
and rational-legal authority in the fact that leadership
in democracies is linked to office-holding.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.680
So, the power is attached to a legally defined
office, not to a particular person.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.560
By contrast, monarchy is a political system
in which power is legitimized by traditional
authority and held by a single family.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:24.340
This is maybe most obvious in the feudal European
idea of the Divine Right of Kings, in which the monarchs
were held to be ordained by God from time immemorial.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.580
And just as democracies are much more common
in modern bureaucratic states, monarchies are more
common in traditional agrarian societies.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.540
But a certain type of authority doesn’t
always reside in a specific form of government.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.620
Monarchy, for example, is just one type of authoritarianism, which is any system that denies people participation in their own governance and leaves ruling to the elites.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.260
And while monarchy relies on traditional authority,
another variety of authoritarianism, totalitarianism, does not.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.280
Totalitarianism is a centralized political
system that extensively regulates people’s lives.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.940
And it has some of the same affinities for
legal-rational authority that democracy does.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.160
Both are modern systems, for one thing, but
it's also much easier to closely control a people
through a system of bureaucratic rules.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.220
For example, a totalitarian government might
enact a law that, say, every household has to
display a picture of the ruler.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.560
It’s a small bureaucratic rule with major
political implications.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.580
And democracy isn’t always associated with
legal-rational authority, either.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.840
Take the United States!

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.680
The President has power because of the rules
set out in the Constitution – which is a form
of legal-rational authority –

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.260
but the President attains that power by winning an
election, which can often rely on charismatic authority.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.040
We can even see traditional authority of a kind at work
in the reverence with which the Constitution and the
"Founding Fathers" are invoked in political discourse.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:45.920
Now, the US as an example can move us from what has so far been a pretty theoretical discussion of authority and politics, to seeing how sociology can help us understand what they look like in practice.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.960
To understand power, authority, and politics,
we need to understand the political attitudes 
of a population.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.740
And to do this, we need to talk about the
political spectrum, the broad array of beliefs and
ideas that make up the politics of a society.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.280
In the US, this ranges from liberal on the left
of the spectrum to conservative on the right.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.460
And again, this isn’t just a theoretical
difference of ideas;

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.240
these beliefs shape the distribution of power and
resources in the US in some very fundamental ways.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:19.560
On economic issues, for instance, left-leaning or liberal
perspectives often favor government intervention in the
economy to help guarantee an equality of outcomes.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.660
Equal pay for women, equitable distribution of
wealth among races, and regulations that promote
workplace and product safety

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.300
are all examples of economic issues that
the left is frequently concerned with.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.580
By contrast, conservative or right-leaning
perspectives may tend to take a more laissez-faire
or “hands off” approach,

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.360
in which government regulation is seen as
hampering the natural flow of economic activity.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.699
So, that’s how the political spectrum can
look when it comes to economic matters.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:49.700
On social issues, one way of understanding the gap between left and right is in terms of the different kinds of authority that each faction tends to support, or endorse.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.520
Here, the right tends to build its arguments
on traditional authority, while the left tends
to look to legal-rational frameworks.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.380
We can see this in the issue of marriage equality,
for example:

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.620
The right has often described its opposition as a defense of “traditional marriage,”

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.860
while the left has argued that marriage
equality was an extension of legal, civil rights.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.700
Now, no matter where your political
leanings fall on the spectrum,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.200
in the end they’d be pretty meaningless without
some way to give them form in the struggle for
things like power and wealth.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:23.060
That’s where political parties come in, as well as interest groups, like political action committees, which organize around particular issues rather than around a whole party platform.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:30.820
And beyond the formal, institutional politics, there are
also social movements that try to mobilize masses of
people to further particular political goals.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.640
Black Lives Matter and the Tea Party are both
good examples of this.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:40.800
But lobbying, special interest groups, and
social movements all raise difficult questions about
how truly democratic the American system is.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.220
Why would you need to demonstrate in
the streets if you’re supposed to be able to
express your political beliefs by voting?

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:53.020
The answer lies in sociological theories of
power – that is, the different understandings
of how power is distributed in a society.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:58.840
One common view is known as the pluralist
model, which sees power as being very widely
distributed.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.140
In this view, politics is a matter of negotiation,
but everyone has at least some voice in the process.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:10.400
This model was closely linked with structural
functionalist theory and dominated much of
American sociology in the 1950s and early 60s.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:19.080
In this line of thinking, demonstrations are seen as
irrational outbursts, pointless gestures in a political
system that already distributes political power fairly.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.860
However, in the power-elite model, political
protests make perfect sense.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.620
This view sees political power as being
concentrated in the hands of small groups,
especially among the very rich.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.780
If this is the case, protests may be the only
way for many people to advance their interests
and have their voices heard.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:39.800
Finally, there’s the Marxist political economy
model, which holds that both of the other
two models really miss the point:

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.720
Here, power isn't evenly distributed, but it's
also not held by a strictly political elite.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:53.760
Instead, the cause of the imbalance of power is
seen as being systemic, and the powerful few are seen
as the products of a particular economic system.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.400
So meaningful political change, in this understanding,
is only possible through a change in the underlying
economic system.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.680
So to understand politics – in the United
States or anywhere else – we need to look
at all the aspects we’ve talked about –

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.980
the types of authority, the kinds of
government, political beliefs, models of power,
and how they all relate to each other.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.980
Today we learned about the sociological approach
to politics.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.860
We defined politics and power.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.800
We discussed the different types of authority
and how they relate to different political systems.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.240
And we looked at American politics in some
detail, talking about demographics and political
organizations.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.840
Finally, we discussed different sociological
theories of power.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:37.400
