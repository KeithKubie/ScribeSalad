00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.170
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.530
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.070
Many of you are regulars.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.370
Thanks for being here.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.670
And some new folks as well.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.970
My name is Nick Brown.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.720
I'm a music specialist
and concert producer here.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.800
Very pleased to welcome you
on behalf of the library

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.710
and also the Freer
Sackler Galleries,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.640
who are co-presenting this
concert with us tonight

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.430
of musicians from Marlboro.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.420 position:56%
And I'd love to go down the line and
have everyone introduce themselves

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.910
and say what your instrument is
your name and where you're from.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: My name is Peter
Stumpf, and I play the cello and I'm

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.380
from Bloomington, Indiana.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.980
&gt;&gt; Alexi Kenney: My
name is Alexi Kenney.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.840
I play the violin, originally
from Palo Alto, California.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.160
&gt;&gt; My name is Robin Scott,
and I also play the violin

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.810
from Indianapolis,
Indiana originally.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.230
&gt;&gt; My name is Zoltan Fejervan.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.180
I am from Hungary.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.680
That's where I live right now.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.630
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Oh, I knew I
couldn't say his name properly,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.920
so I figured I would just like,
[laughs] leave it out there.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.220
Wonderful.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.520
So thank you all for being here.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.820
You are four of the five
musicians for the evening.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.980
And Shuangshuang will be onstage
later for you to enjoy her playing.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.410
Can you tell us a bit about how you
came together as a chamber ensemble

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.150
within the context of Marlboro?

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.610
Did you work together before that?

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.120
Or did some of you work together?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.420
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: Well, actually

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.290
with the Marlboro tours often the
way they are structured is they're

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.170
based around a group that performed

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.130
at the Marlboro Music
Festival in the summer.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.700
So, in this case the
Brahms, a major piano quartet

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.580
that we're playing this evening
was a piece that we've worked

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.910
on as a group already at Marlboro
for a certain number of weeks

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.730
and then performed there.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.320
And that was sort of the
foundation of the tour group.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.950
We added a violinist to fill out
the program for the first half

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.590
with the string quartets
that we're doing,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.810
and that's Alexi Kenney
joined us for that.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.880
So originally it was the Brahms,
[inaudible] Zoltan and Robin

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.840
and Shuangshuang and myself.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.070
So that's how it came together.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.370
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.370
And how far into the
tour are you all now?

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.870
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Halfway
today, right?

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.270
Yeah. Third of five.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.570
[laughs]

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.880
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown:
How's it gone so far.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.180
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Fantastically.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.480
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Yeah.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.780
Great. [laughs]

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.080
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Couldn't be better.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.380
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Wonderful.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.680
[laughs] And where
is next after D.C?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.980
&gt;&gt; Zoltan Fejervan: We'll going
to do Philadelphia tomorrow.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.540
We're playing there.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.950
And so far all the places
we've played were so different.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.160
So we'll look forward for the stage
version for our concerts today.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.330
I have to say I really
love this hall actually.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.850
It has a certain warm atmosphere
and also the sound is very warm,

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.510
so I think it's more
difficult to play not nice.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.620
[ Laughs ]

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.920
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Cool.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.390
So can you tell us a bit about
the thinking behind the repertoire

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.680
selection for this program?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.100
So we have the Haydn and the
Brahms and the vaporing [sp].

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.260
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: Well, the Bones
piano quartet is, you know,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.790
one of his greatest
chamber music works.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.140
I think it's very and it's
a very sophisticated piece

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.040
and it's a very, it's a big piece.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.430
It's very, substantial.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.990
And one of his longer
works actually.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.970 position:56%
So the idea is to keep the beginning
of the program, the first half

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.970
of the program on the shorter side

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.170
and also somewhat on
the lighter side.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:34.750 position:56%
And so for that reason the Haydn was
selected, the Haydn String Quartet,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.570
which I think is a very
nice balance for the bonds.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.380
And then the vaporing that we're
doing, the idea with that was

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.590
in part that it's brevity.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.560
It's not as short as most
vaporing pieces are, but it is,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.700
you know, a very compact work.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.160
And also it's very rarely played
and very few people know it.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.840
So that was sort of -- those
two elements were the two things

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.550
that were the basic idea
behind doing the vaporing.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.370
I think in addition to that
though because the Brahms is

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.830
such a great piece it's important
to make sure that the pieces

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:28.430
that precede it are in that
realm and level of composition,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.070
which I think both of these
without question are, you know,

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.900
said that was also
one of the reasons

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.610
for choosing the Haydn
and the vaporing.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.910
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.380
Have any of you worked
together in different settings

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.570
than the Marlboro tours
or the festival?

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.410
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Yes.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.810
I've worked with Alexi
and with Peter.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.830
Actually in a previous
Marlboro tour Peter and I came

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.850
to a [inaudible] gallery
a few years ago.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.890
And so we played together for
six years, [laughs] on and off.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.190
&gt;&gt; Alexi Kenney: Yes.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.490
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: And Alexi and
I have played together some

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.780
and some chamber context as well.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.080
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Cool.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.090
And so you all have very
interesting backgrounds.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.830
Some of you have done
very well in competitions.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.030
Some of you are doing a lot
of orchestra work or did.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.410
When you have these kind of
different courses in your careers,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.310
how do you think you approach
your creative process together

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.310
differently or similarly to other
chamber experiences that you have?

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.070
So like do you have in mind, oh,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.720
this happened when we were
doing this Beethoven thing

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.600
with this conductor
and that was silly.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.030
So let's not do that
here kind of deal.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.050
[ Laughs ]

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.370
&gt;&gt; Alexi Kenney: I mean
I guess we all come at it

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.610
from different places, but
eventually at the end of the day

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:02.690
for me collaboration is king in
music, so all experiences stem

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.820
from chamber music in my opinion.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.800
And so whether I'm playing a
solo Concerto with orchestra

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.580
or in an orchestra or
in a string quartet.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.450
Obviously the way you approach
it is slightly different,

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.220
but I think if you come
at it with an open mind

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.520
and in a collaborative
spirit, then I don't know,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.860
these things are all
kind of similar.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.040
We don't have any issues
working together for instance,.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.340
[laughs]

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.640
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great, cool.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.780
What kind of -- sorry, I'm going to
get silly with questions for a bit,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.060
but what might be some issues
where you have very strong feelings

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.690
about that say the group
is on one side and one

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.320
of you is on a different position.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.250
Would that be something
having to do with tempo,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.670
performance practice
issues, articulation even.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.130
Or do you kind of just
it's like a relationship.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.820
You kind of give and
take and find a balance

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.980
and somehow have a nice
combo platter at the end.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.230
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: What you said
at the end is about right.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:04.230
I think oftentimes also what
people perceive at the time

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.910
to be contradicting
ideas, oftentimes aren't.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.390
There are many times in music
I think when you can try

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.440
to actually combine two things
that almost seem to be opposites.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.760
But when you put them together
actually make something that's far

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.430
stronger than just one of
those things by itself.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.200
I mean I often think that about
when you have people who think

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.510
about a piece very
differently, they're looking --

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.410
they're coming from a
different direction.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.230
They're looking for a little bit
different things perhaps in it,

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.000
but when you get both of
those qualities actually,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.810
you get a better product
than maybe what you thought,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.350
how you thought you loved
it in the first place

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.250
when you take other
people's ideas into account.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.700 position:56%
And then you also are forced to find

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.200
out what you really
like about the piece.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.420
Was it really the speed at which
it goes by that you like it.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.870
Well, no, that's probably
not what it is.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:08.200
It's other deeper things and then
you find you can actually do your

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.090
own ideas and add to them
other people's suggestions

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:20.080
and the product oftentimes is
much better than it was initially.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.380
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.100
So since we're in a library,
we're going to go a little nerdy

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.410
and you all just got to see some
cool manuscripts in the lobby

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.010
of the auditorium over here.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.000
And for those of you who haven't
seen them yet, there are a variety

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.770
of Vayburn manuscripts out,

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.080
which are from the library's
Moulden Hour archives,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.640
which is a very large archival
collection split amongst

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.480
institutions in North
America and in Europe.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.360
And we have all kinds of
really cool stuff in there,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.660
and just go to lsu.gov and put in
Moulden Hour in a very German way

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.520
and you will find it in
full collection guide.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.680
But so these manuscripts
are there and you all kind

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.790
of mentioning the fact that
it's a unique thing to be able

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.220
to see the manuscripts when
you're going to perform next door.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.210
And then on top of that Vaburn
manuscripts don't exactly

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.510
exist everywhere.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.110
Like maybe some Mahler manuscripts
would or Beethoven manuscripts.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.090
So what was that little
experience like for you,

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.610
because I got to watch
it and it was fun,

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.080
and we enjoy provoking
that for sure.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:26.950
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: Well, I mean it's
the manuscript issue is kind of,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.040
I mean I was shocked to see
that, because, you know,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.750
the issue with manuscripts is
that some of them are hidden away

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:42.390
in private collections, in
somebody's personal library.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:47.290
So we don't have access to a
lot of manuscripts and in some

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.830
in some cases we don't
even know where they are

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.640
or if they even exist
for that reason.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:11:00.680
There's no real organizational
sort of entity that controls that.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:07.670
So to see that one I was really
surprised, because it's not

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:13.360
that well-known of a piece anyway,
but we were really impressed

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:19.060
by how very neatly written it was.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:24.590
He was apparently very meticulous
about his copying and writing.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.870
It's not one of these, you know --

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.170
&gt;&gt;

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.470
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Yeah.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.770
[Inaudible]

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.070
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: -- messy,
floppy looking manuscripts.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.370
It was very, very fine.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.670
And it was edited.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.140
I mean there was some
editing in there.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.440
&gt;&gt; Alexi Kenney: It's
also interesting

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.070
to me just knowing this piece
now and realizing how passionate

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:48.490 position:56%
and how dark and depressing parts of
it are, [laughs] the tempo marking

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.620
or tempo marking at
the beginning is just

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.260
to [inaudible] which
is dark and heavy.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.270
And to contrast that with the way
that he seemed to have conceived

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.030
or written it down
very daintily is kind

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.950
of funny [laughs] contrast for me.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.130
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: It's
also just interesting

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.890
to see the actual handwriting
of the composer that you play.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.140
I think that adds to the
shock value of [laughs] it.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:19.700
Today I and Zoltan went over
to the gallery and I was trying

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.970
to find individual brushstrokes
of Rembrandt, and then to see

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.730
that out there, it's
all pretty remarkable.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.340
There aren't too many
places where you can go

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.620
and see this sort of stuff.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.920
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.220
Thank you for sharing
those reflections.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.750
Where is some of the other venues

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.230
where you've experienced
something similar,

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.490
like have any of your
performed at the Morgan Library

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.140
or for other places like that?

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.130
Or is this it?

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: I have played there,

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:51.850
but they didn't show me manuscripts
[inaudible] [laughs] I do know they

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.950
have some great, very
great manuscripts there.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.250
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Cool.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.460
So before we open up to Q&amp;A
one more question for me.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:05.120
And that is I'd love to hear
you guys discuss your experience

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.440
with summer festivals, and then
compare sort of your experience

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.310
with Marlboro versus those
other festival experiences.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.660
I've had the opportunity to
some summer festivals and it's

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:21.290
such a unique, creative, vibrant
space where people kind of let go

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.410 position:56%
of a lot of their inhibitions and
there's a much more social component

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.070
in different ways where you're
going to meet new people,

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.510
rather than the folks you're
working with all the time.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:36.960
What about Marlboro offers an even
more unique festival atmosphere

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.610
for you?

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:44.150
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: Well, Marlboro
is actually completely unique

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.640
as a festival.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:56.650 position:56%
In summer festivals there is a
range of different sort of concepts.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:01.810 position:56%
Some are educational, which
involve, you know, will have faculty

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.380
and students and their lessons

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.450
and student performances,
faculty performances.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.750
Some festivals are just
professional where you go

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.790
when you perform chamber
music and oftentimes

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.540
in those cases you're
playing with people you may

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:20.160
or may not know very well, may have
played with before but maybe not.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.420
And you're playing in a short
period of time rehearsing

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.820
and rather quickly putting
together a repertoire

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.970
and presenting it in a concert.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:34.040
So those are the two kind
of ends of the spectrum.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:41.310
Marlboro is kind of in a different
category, because the concept

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.390
of it is it's seven weeks long.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.750
The first two weeks there
are no performances,

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.600
so it's just rehearsal.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.790
Then the concerts begin from the
from the third week to the end

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:58.090
of the festival, so they
cover a span of five weeks.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:03.960 position:56%
And the program is only determined
ten days in advance of the concerts.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.770
And the reason for
that is that the groups

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:12.100
that are rehearsing
decide amongst themselves.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.040
You have complete control
over whether

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.410
or not you perform something.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:22.270
You can spend the whole summer at
Marlboro and not perform at all.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.960
You could just rehearse.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.150
There's no requirement
to perform anything.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:32.090
So you only perform if you feel
inspired as a group to do so.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:37.450 position:56%
And of course most groups are aiming
towards that possibility, but,

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.480
you know, it's not a requirement.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.260
So we have an option to not
perform, which means that it's only

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.040
when it really feels right, you
know, that the group chooses

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.800
to offer it for performance.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.940
Now having even if it's
offered for performance,

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.370
it isn't necessarily selected,
because then they have

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.910
to choose the program
that makes the most sense,

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.590
as some pieces even be
offered and not chosen

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.470
and those aren't performed.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.000
And you really have
much more rehearsal time

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.080
than you would ever
have at most festivals.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.970
So it's completely
different in that sense,

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:25.540
so the performances have a
different kind of aura about them.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.740
They're not a group that's
rehearsed very quickly

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.270
and put something together.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.660
They're not formed to a music
a group that's played together

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:41.340
for years, but they are a
group that's rehearsed a lot

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.010
and spent a lot of time
together on preparing the piece

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.440
and really not been under any
pressure to hurry to perform

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.570
so they can really delve
into it in great depth.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:58.400
And then on top of all of
that, it's also a program

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.150
that involves younger
players and older players.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.890
So there's a certain number
of older players who are kind

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:10.170
of in a somewhat of a mentor role
that are in each one of the groups.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.120
There's one person like
that in each group,

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.000
and the others are very
talented and young players,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.500
some very best from
around the world.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:25.480
And what the idea is to really have
it be encourage them to rehearse

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:33.130 position:56%
as peers and to work as like just a
group of musicians working together.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.620
And the role of the mentor varies
from one group to the next,

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.660
so depending on the group itself.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.050
If the group needs a lot of help
with something then they're there.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.730
If they don't, they don't.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:50.160
But then the person in that role
also plays somewhat of a role

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.280
in deciding about whether the
group is offered for performance.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.250
But the group decides, they kind
of choose themselves to do that.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.300 position:56%
So that's just completely different.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:06.690
And this was the, you know, kind of
the brainchild of Rudolph Serkin,

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:12.970
who had this idea and
it really is --

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:19.460
there are other festivals that have
tried to sort of do similar things,

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.430
but none of them do
exactly like this.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.490
This is totally unique.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:25.790
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.650
Does anyone else have
some ideas or thoughts?

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Zoltan Fejervan: And I think
[inaudible] everything was important

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.240
about Marlboro.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.720
Maybe he didn't mention
the sona and the pound.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.910
[laughs] So Marlboro provides
lots of things besides that also,

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:47.250
which makes it special and makes
somehow the participants feel

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.100
that they really belong
to that place.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:58.980
And like socially get together
like you literally every day,

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.210
every night that we spend together.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.960
So we are far away from big city,

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.850
away from like the
every days duties,

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:17.600
and it really somehow brings
this almost ecstatic feeling

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.350
of the everyday music making.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.710
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:28.140
I think we'll open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.480
So if you have a question just
throw your hand up in the air

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.000
and my colleague Jay will
come around with a microphone.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.620
&gt;&gt; On the vaporing how long
did it take to put it together?

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.340
How long did you practice on it?

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.320 position:56%
And had any of you played it before?

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.570
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Peter had
played it before I believe,

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.850
but the rest of us I think
it was the first time.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.170
We had a week.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.660
Well five days.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.010
About five days.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.610
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Six days?

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.910
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: Six days.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.210
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Six days where
we rehearsed the Vaporing

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.510
and the Haydn every day.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.390
And it came together
actually pretty well I think.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.490
We had all done some
preparation on our own,

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.130
so that we weren't sight
reading when we came together.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.430
&gt;&gt; Zoltan Fejervan: Right.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.730
[laughs]

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.030
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: So that
makes a big difference.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:24.690
You haven't some clue of what to
do, but it came together very well.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:29.040
It's not quite as complicated as
some of the more, the later more --

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.340
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: Yeah.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.580
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: -- 12 tone
compositions, but it has a lot

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.460
of chromaticism in it, which
takes some figuring out for sure.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.850
You really have to figure
out what you need to hear.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.150
&gt;&gt; When was it composed?

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.450
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: In 1905.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.750
&gt;&gt; '05, okay.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.050
&gt;&gt; Alexi Kenney: I actually
had never even heard

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.350
of this piece before.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.710
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Yeah, so same here.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:50.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm sure [inaudible]

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.940
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: It's actually
it's written the same year

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.270
as another string quartet that he
wrote called Long Summersaults.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That one I know.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.970
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: A slow piece.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.820
And that's very, very romantic.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: And this is very
different from that, very traumatic,

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.900
largely, and yet written
the same year.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.000
It's interesting I think to me.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.860
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: I'm just
going to keep asking questions,

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.100
and if you guys don't have ideas.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.710
There you go.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I don't know
exactly what I'm asking,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.840
but back in the '60s I used to
get and go up to the Marlboro

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.880
with my parents for all time.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.960
And felt it was just unbelievably
amazing, because it was

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.990
like the musicians were able to go
up on the mountain and try to find

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.050
out what the hell was going on.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:52.020
And then they'd work on
it, apparently much more

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.550
than your average group of guys

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:58.140
and then they'd come
back down and report out.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.150
And it was incredible.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:05.210
And I was wondering it sounds
like it pretty much the same,

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.880
and if you guys have some feeling

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.570
for that I'd be interested
in knowing.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.890
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Yeah, there
is definitely that element.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.240
I think one of the things I
love to do most there is to have

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:23.150
at least one group or one piece
that is a really big masterwork,

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:28.450
like a big Beethoven
quartet or partite quartet,

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:33.740
something that takes a lot of time
that justifies spending five, six,

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:39.890 position:56%
seven, even weeks on it with a group
of musicians that you really love.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:46.540
And then, you know that you've got
all this time and that you feel

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.030
that you really have a good
chance to do it justice.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:54.130
I played a professional string
quartet outside of Marlboro

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.430
and sometimes we have to put
things together very quickly.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.540
Even though we play all
the time together we have

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.060
to learn something very quickly
for an upcoming performance

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.860
and to have the flexibility,

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:11.400
the space of an entire summer
is a great luxury, frankly.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.850
And you have the time to
form a sound as a group

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:20.300 position:56%
that you don't really when you just
throw something together at a usual,

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.850
at a normal festival
or at some serious.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.990
Even if the players are very good.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:31.340
You really get to hash out and
discuss and try all sorts of ways

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:36.480 position:56%
of doing things and you can
settle, you can find the flexibility

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:43.070
that oftentimes isn't
as easily accessible.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.370
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Anyone else.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:51.000
Oh, just once for the microphone.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.690
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry I was a little late,
but just maybe you covered this.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.300
But how are you chosen?

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.600
How do you get there?

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.900
Do you apply?

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.200
Do you have try outs?

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.500
Do you pay?

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.920
What is the situation?

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.040
[ Laughs ]

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:17.930
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: So the way it
works is there are auditions

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:23.650
for the festival, and
that's primarily the way

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:31.320
that the participants are selected.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.600
And they're required to
perform some solo works,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.100
but also to prepare some
chamber music parts.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.810 position:56%
And they're given actually a limited
amount of time to prepare the parts.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:46.020
So it may be a couple of weeks in
advance they get the repertoire.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.360
I don't know, something like that I
think, and then and then they have

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:56.500 position:56%
to -- and often it's difficult parts
[laughs] that they have to learn.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.980
And then they perform those
as well in the audition.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.910
There are also circumstances
where people are invited.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:11.690
In some cases when they're younger
or more often when they're older

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:15.630
to sort of participate
as more of a mentor role

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:21.720 position:56%
or if they're a younger person maybe
just someone has already achieved,

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:28.400 position:56%
you know, a certain success as a
performer and they are just invited.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.630
&gt;&gt; And are they funded?

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.180
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: It is funded.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:38.010
There is a tuition,
but nobody pays it.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.490
[ Laughs ]

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.460
There is, for whatever
reason there is, yes.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.970
There is actual tuition,
but it is always --

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:49.900
it's a full scholarship for
everybody that's involved.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.170
&gt;&gt; What are the different
[inaudible]

00:25:54.170 --> 00:26:01.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: Well, [laughs] a
little bit of it comes from the NEA.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.570
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Currently.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:07.730
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: And the rest of it
is from donations from, you know,

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:13.010
generous supporters and
corporations and things like that.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.600
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: Most arts
organizations these days.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.340
Also the Marlboro College
provides the --

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.730
well we pay the Marlboro
College event.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.320
That also has to be paid for, but
that's where people are housed

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.700
and then there's food and
everything provided through that.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.000
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Anyone else?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.070
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Another
kind of a question.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:59.140
I sort of got the impression when I
was in Marlboro and you would talk

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:05.610
to people that because you
guys aren't provided a lot

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:12.590
of independence and time to figure
things out that there were people

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:16.400
who would say, well there was
a little bit of reluctance

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:22.420 position:56%
to employ some people who've been to
Marlboro because they didn't see --

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:27.470
maybe the word isn't docile
enough, but [laughs] they would be

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:32.280 position:56%
in an organization and they wouldn't
exactly be doing what they were told

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.720
to do, in a very good sense.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.900
I don't mean having a grand time,
but I wondered whether you had run

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.030
into that at all in your
professional career.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.040
[ Laughs ]

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.960
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: On the record too.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.260
[laughs] No, I don't think --

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.490
so is the premise that people who
have been to Marlboro are difficult

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:59.100 position:56%
to work with or hard to employ or --

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:06.150
&gt;&gt; My thought was that,
yeah, there were --

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.090
let's see [inaudible] [laughs]

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.390
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: It's like
[inaudible] making music.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.690
Yeah.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: There are many
musicians who that could be said of.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.760
[laughs]

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.050
&gt;&gt; Well I think that's a
very positive thing, but --

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.260
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: It's
an interesting point.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.420
You know, it's awful -- I think
that there could be some validity

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.780
to what you're saying, but I
think it's awfully hard to define.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:39.900
You know, because it's sort of a --
it's a conceptual thing, you know.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.990
But, yeah, I think that
there's a little bit

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.830
of validity there to that idea.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:53.800 position:56%
I think that it can be seen as a
kind of elitist kind of way of going

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.930
about things, you know, that's
very idealistic, you know.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:07.160
But, on the other hand, you know,
so many fine musicians have gone

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.270
through there and I don't think any
of them are having a lot of trouble

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.250
with their employment fortunately.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:20.950
So I think it's generally had a
real positive impact overall on.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:24.750
I think it has quite
an important influence

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.370 position:56%
in the musical community in general.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.670
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Anyone else?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.450
Last call or I'm going
to do another one.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.700
OK. So for those of us who have
not yet been to the festival,

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.810
which is probably most of us
in the room and myself included

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.780
and I'm very eager to get there.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.870
Would you recommend
going for a full weekend

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.790 position:56%
and catching all the performances to
get a sense of everyone that's there

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.590
or would you recommend, you
know, go one day, one weekend,

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.890
one day, another weekend.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.190
Go at the beginning of the summer,
go at the end of the session?

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:02.900
&gt;&gt; Alexi Kenney: You never know.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.200
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Okay.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.470
[laughs] And where are the
places to stay and hang out

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.920
and what museums are
around, that kind of thing.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.120
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: Well, the
closest town is Brattleboro,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:21.390 position:56%
Vermont which is, you know, an
interesting, you know, Vermont city.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:28.910
And, you know, it's a funky
place, but very, you know,

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.010
there's actually great
restaurants there

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.860
and art galleries and all kinds.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:40.730
It's artistic oriented community.

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:46.130
Marlboro itself has a
post office and an inn.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:50.600
There is an actual inn right
there in the center, and a church,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:55.100 position:56%
so there's inn, church, post office.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.400
And --

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.700
&gt;&gt; College.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.250
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: And then
the college, but that's not

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.760
in the center of the town.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.150
The college you have to drive
to the college from there.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.450
&gt;&gt; Alexi Kenney: It's really
in the middle of the woods.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.470
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: It's in the middle
of the woods up in the mountains.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:13.970
So it's, yeah, it's
beautiful, quiet country there.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.250
Bears and mooses.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:17.550
[laughs] But, yeah.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:22.690
So actually there, there
is only this one small inn

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.030
and then there are a
couple other inns nearby.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:31.470
And there are people, a lot of
people that come up just to be

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.550
in Vermont and to go
to the concerts.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:39.440
And some stay for the
whole summer to do that.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.820
And some people just
come up for a weekend.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.200
It's a great weekend trip.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:51.060
You know, because then you can --

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.710
the Sunday concerts
in the afternoon,

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.190
so you can travel somewhere in
that evening if you need to.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:58.070
And the Saturday concerts at night.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.050
So it's really set up for people
to come up for the weekend,

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.580
and I think a lot of people
from New York do that, you know,

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.930
because they can just
go up for a weekend

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:10.560
and hear a couple of concerts.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.550
So, you know, whenever
you have the time

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:18.500
and interest for I think really.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.780
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Anyone
else any suggestions,

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.890
places to steer clear of.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.360
[laughs] Okay.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.320
So last question I'll throw out

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.670
and then we'll let you guys have
a little dinner break is perhaps a

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:34.970
controversial question,
but you don't have

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.980
to get political or anything.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:41.460
How do you interpret your roles
in society as artists in terms

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:47.550 position:56%
of what do you think your role is in
inspiring people to think critically

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.100
about their lives, about music

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.480
or about the way music
can affect positive change

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.190
or anything in that world?

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.280
If you have any thoughts
that don't cause you

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.990
to reveal anything too sensitive,
feel free to jump in there.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.260
I think the reason for my
question is I think we're

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.560
in Washington, right.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.850
So Washington is an
epicenter of a lot

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.510
of different things
going on in society.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.260
For better and for
worse, and the Library

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.480
of Congress definitely
values the role of the arts

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.400
and culture in humanities.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.950 position:56%
And we really want to know where you
all are at and how we can complement

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.590
that work to really make sure
that we're serving the population.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:33.250
I guess. Like education, work.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.580
Do you do performances
for specific causes?

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.750
Do you steer clear of it all
and just focus on the music

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.970 position:56%
and that's the way you deal with it.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.510
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: I think each one

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:46.980
of us does something
different, you know.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:51.350
I mean we all have different
ways that can do that.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:56.730
I mean at this point in my life
I'm a professor at the University.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:02.300
So I mean what I'm doing
is, you know, mentoring

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:11.700
and helping young aspiring
musicians to participate in music,

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:17.650
and to get involved, and
to see it go forward.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:24.960
And I think, you know, I
think probably most people

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.370 position:56%
that are involved in the arts in
general it comes from a certain kind

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:39.260
of it's about inspiration that
comes from whatever the art

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:45.850
that that particular person is
drawn in by, whether it be visual

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:49.250
or musical or writing, whatever.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:59.560
And so I think ultimately it's
in particular for what we do,

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:05.080
we're bringing something to life
that otherwise would not, you know,

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.990 position:56%
there's no way to know what you --
there are a few people that can look

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.710
at a score and know exactly what
it sounds like and experience it

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:16.020
without ever having heard it.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.190
[laughs] You actually can.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.930
Some people can.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:25.500
But generally it has to be played.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:34.920
And there's such a huge range
of different areas of music

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.920
that people get involved in.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.130
You know, it's just it's
endless and limitless.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:46.190
But I think it's about the
inspiration and the connection

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:57.030
between what it affirms for
us in our experiences in life

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.150
that we don't speak about.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.330
Things we don't say.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:10.540
Things we don't talk about, but
the things that we know to be true,

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.640
but often only internally.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:19.980 position:56%
So we don't realize necessarily
this is something that we all share.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:27.210
You know, and when each piece
of music has within it some --

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:34.560
well I'll say a great range
of expressive qualities

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:42.920
that go past our intellectual
experience and understanding

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:52.850
and touch the inner kind of core
of each person in different ways.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.820
But it affirms for
them the existence

00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:00.540
of this reality that they have.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.010
And there's something
tremendously comforting about that.

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:11.910
And also gives you a sense
of community, you know,

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:15.420
and a sense that you're
not alone with that feeling

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.770
or that experience in your life.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.070
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Thank you.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.370
That's very insightful.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:22.670
I appreciate it.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:23.970
Anyone else have some thoughts?

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.270
You can say no.

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.570
That's okay.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:27.870
&gt;&gt; Alexi Kenney: I was going
to say I mean just in terms

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.480 position:56%
of my experience, I do a lot of
traveling to perform with orchestras

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.600
or recitals around the country.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.860
And a lot of the time kind of
in the middle of the country

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.080
where I wouldn't necessarily
go on vacation

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.400
or travel too, particularly.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.080
And I'm often asked to do some sort

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.820
of educational outreach
when I travel.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:55.190
And this is something that
I've grown to really love.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:38:00.330
Sometimes even more than
playing the concert itself.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.400
Although, of course, I love
performing and all of that,

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:08.920
but there's something
incredibly important obviously

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.850
about playing for kids.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:18.630
And I think a lot of that -- when
I play for a school, for instance,,

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:24.540
I find myself being as
passionate or even feel

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:32.520
like being more passionate is
so important, because, you know,

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.420
to go along with inspiration
and all of this, of course,

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.850
I agree that yes there's
this incredible quality

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.790
about music that is unspeakable..

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:47.520
You can't put it into words.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.920
And that beauty for me keeps me
going as a musician day to day.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.380
But for a group of kids who
are listening to music maybe

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.990
for the first time
listening to a violin player,

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:05.890
I think what touches somebody
is energy and raw kind

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.900
of that sort of inspiration.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.320
Somebody is seeing somebody
very, very passionate

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.320
about something they love to do.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:21.850
And I feel that's a great duty
for my life to bring to people,

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:26.070
especially to kids but also in
every performance, you know,

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:31.680
just giving it 120 percent
because why do it otherwise.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.980
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Yeah.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.630
You have you have the chance to
possibly really reach someone

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:43.240
who may never heard a violin or
any classical music, for instance,,

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:49.230 position:56%
and then you really I think it helps
you find what you really want to say

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.840
in a way, because they don't
care about all the other details

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:58.880
that other professionals who might
listen to you, might care about.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.430
And they also can tell --

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:05.820
I think they can see right
through fakery [laughs]

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.240
or disingenuous sorts of things.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:16.870
And so you have to be really
honest and do your very best

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.000
to really command their attention.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.740
That's difficult.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:26.620
[laughs] But it's totally worth it.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.920
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.300
Zoltan, did you want
to add anything?

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.810
&gt;&gt; Zoltan Fejervan: I can
only agree with everybody.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:38.210
It just comes to my mind what
Gabriel Garcia Marquez wrote

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.390
about him being a writer.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:46.420 position:56%
And I think he writes that you
shouldn't be a writer if you realize

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.700 position:56%
that you can't live without writing.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.780
So it's something similar
with the musician I think.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:59.850
So we have to realize if you
can't live without making music,

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.140
that's like so if we can live

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:09.300
without making music then
let's stop making music.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:17.450
And we certainly have to have a
very strong message in our playing.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:21.270
That's what matters for sure.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:23.030
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Thank you
for sharing those thoughts.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:27.760
I think it means a lot for all of
us to hear about that from you,

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.820
and in a very thoughtful
way that probably puts

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.360
into words what we
experience in these concerts,

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.630
because a lot of us are regulars

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:39.600
and we share these moments
together we might never speak

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.900
about what happened.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.320
We don't necessarily know
what the artist was intending,

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.340
but I guarantee that in the
concerts that really touch us,

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.900
whether it's you guys or another
ensemble, there are these moments

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.100
that as you said are really
affecting people in ways

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.250
that they didn't really
think could happen.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.790
Well, I guess one more question
then we have to let them go.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:01.310
So if you just wait
for the microphone.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.000
The gentleman in the
corner over here.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:12.850
&gt;&gt; I was wondering when you were
talking about the unsaid or portion

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.900
of the content of music,

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:21.480
do you communicate among your very
small community about that aspect

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.450
of the pieces you played together

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:30.120
so that you were all
communicating the same message?

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.420
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: Absolutely.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.720
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: I'm sorry.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.640
What is the question
specifically are we talking about?

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.470
&gt;&gt; Do you communicate
among yourselves

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:42.860
about the unspoken content
of the music you play,

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.540
so that you are a more
homogeneous community?

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.510
&gt;&gt; Peter Stumpf: No, we
don't speak about it.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.820
[ Laughs ]

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.540
No, I mean actually we do.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:59.500
We do. But I think it's
actually the same thing happening

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.690
in the group itself.

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:06.930
A lot of what we're doing we
couldn't actually talk about.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.550
It's impossible.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.790
And that's where the
mystery comes in.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.090
How are we doing?

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.890
Like how does that even happen?

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:18.310
That's a real mystery, you know,

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:22.290
and I think we experience this
kind of thing all the time.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.330
And sometimes we just don't
even think about the fact

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:28.510
that we're experiencing it, but we
are, even just amongst ourselves.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.970
You know, because things change
from one orchestra to the next,

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.900
even from one minute to
the next in a rehearsal.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.830
You couldn't always define
all of those elements

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.810
that are shifting and changing.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:47.840
And it's just kind
of a real mystery.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.240
You know, how did that happen.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.940
I mean I had this experience
even very literally in a number

00:43:53.940 --> 00:44:00.400
of instances in my life
where something changed

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.070
and there was an acknowledgement
that that had happened,

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:08.280
but nobody can really
define or say what it was.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:16.260 position:56%
You know, except that it was more of
a connection between the musicians.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:23.120
&gt;&gt; Robin Scott: But also we do
absolutely talk about what sort

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.520
of quality what we want
to convey, so that we --

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:31.850
I think the effort of trying

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:36.990 position:56%
to describe even these indescribable
things is very good to go

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:40.890
through because it makes you really
think about how you want to sound

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:44.860 position:56%
and what you want to convey and
then if you do that also as a group,

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:50.410
then you can find that you have
a better more cohesive vision

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:51.910
for the piece.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:56.990
So, yes, there's some things that
you can't always get 100 percent

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:58.880
with words to describe music,

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.280
but it's I think a good
exercise actually to go

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.530
as far as you can oftentimes.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:05.830
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.940
Well, thank you all
for your questions

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.340 position:56%
and your attention this evening, and
thank you so much to the gentleman

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.300
up here for spending some time
with all of us and speaking.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.010
And then we're very
much looking forward

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:21.140
to the non-speaking
portion of the evening.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.430
[laughs] And we encourage
you if you are interested

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.850
in watching recent performances
of musicians from Marlboro

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.130
at the library to visit
our website loc.gov.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.350
And in the search box type
in "musicians from Marlboro,"

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:35.180
and you will find the videos
from last year's two concerts

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:36.600
that were here at the library.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.680
And then the concerts from
this season will be put

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.080
up in the next few months
for you to check out as well.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.490
And do consider going up
to Marlboro for a weekend.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:47.180
I think I'll probably be up there
this summer, and happy to hang

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.970
out with you guys if
you're up there.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:50.270
Thank you so much.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.510
Thank you gents, and we'll
see you in a little bit.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.700
