00:00:01.164 --> 00:00:02.720
- [Voiceover] In the last video,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.372
we set up this differential equation

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.566
that described an LC circuit,

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.802
and now we're gonna go about solving

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:12.052
this second order circuit.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.470
The technique that works here is the same

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.910
that worked with first order

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.017
ordinary differential equations.

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:20.207
We're looking for a function of I

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:22.575
that makes this whole equation true,

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:25.652
and we're gonna do that
by guessing at an I,

00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:27.091
put it back into the equations,

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:28.222
and see if it works.

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:29.378
If it works, we win.

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:31.615
If it doesn't work, we have
to think of something else,

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:34.054
and we keep doing that until we solve it.

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:37.261
So, knowing what I know about derivatives,

00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:39.084
and knowing and looking at this equation,

00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:42.084
can I guess at a plausible solution?

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:44.607
So what we have here is two things.

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:47.195
We have two terms that
have to add up to zero

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:48.278
for all time,

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:52.832
and so that means that
whatever function I pick for I,

00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:54.590
and there's some scaling factors here.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.590
Lemme write this equation like this.

00:01:09.623 --> 00:01:12.657
So what I have here is
a scaling factor times I

00:01:12.657 --> 00:01:14.584
has to somehow fully subtract

00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:17.251
from the second derivative of I.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.997
So these two terms have to
somehow look alike for all time.

00:01:23.948 --> 00:01:27.067
There's one function I
know where its derivatives

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:28.907
sort of look like what we started with,

00:01:28.907 --> 00:01:31.305
and that's the exponential function.

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:32.580
So I'm actually gonna make a guess.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.830
I'm gonna guess that I of T

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.974
is something of the form

00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:39.557
some constant times

00:01:42.153 --> 00:01:44.070
the exponential of time

00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:49.548
with some other scale factor.

00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:52.879
Now, K is an adjustable parameter,

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.879
and that's an amplitude.

00:01:57.938 --> 00:02:00.736
So it tells us how big the signal is,

00:02:00.736 --> 00:02:02.013
and what's S?

00:02:02.013 --> 00:02:04.921
S is up in the exponent along with T,

00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:05.989
and we know that by the time

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.519
we take an exponent of anything

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.830
that whatever's up here
has to have no units,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.455
so that means that ST, S times T,

00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:14.645
has no units,

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:16.395
and that means that S

00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:20.001
has units of one over time

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.751
so S is a frequency of some sort.

00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:28.982
And in particular, it's
gonna be a radian frequency.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.982
It's gonna be in radians per second.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.080
So, S is gonna be called
a natural frequency.

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:46.444
So let's keep working on this.

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:50.293
We're gonna plug I back into our equation,

00:02:50.293 --> 00:02:51.960
and see if it works.

00:02:57.183 --> 00:02:59.185
So we can plug I straight into here,

00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:01.328
and we need the second derivative of I.

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:05.328
Let's first take the first
derivative D, DT of I

00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:09.665
equals D, DT of K

00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:14.872
E to the ST,

00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:17.580
and we can take that derivative,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.663
and that equals K times S

00:03:23.193 --> 00:03:24.693
times E to the ST.

00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:28.972
So it's also an exponential,

00:03:28.972 --> 00:03:30.718
and now we need the second derivative,

00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:33.198
so we wanna take the
derivative of this guy,

00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:37.031
so second derivative of
I with respect to time

00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:42.687
equals the first derivative of S,

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:49.784
K, E to the ST,

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.736
and that equals--

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:56.754
Another S comes down,

00:03:56.754 --> 00:03:58.504
so it's S squared, K,

00:04:00.446 --> 00:04:01.446
E to the ST.

00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:06.639
Good, now we have our second derivative.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.929
We can plug that in here,

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:09.552
so let's do that.

00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:12.740
So the equation becomes S squared,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.990
K, E to the ST,

00:04:15.323 --> 00:04:16.740
plus one over LC,

00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:20.335
times K, E to the ST,

00:04:23.548 --> 00:04:24.548
equals zero.

00:04:26.644 --> 00:04:27.805
Let's do a little factoring.

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:28.925
There's a common term here.

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:30.417
There's a common term.

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:31.555
K, E to the ST,

00:04:31.555 --> 00:04:33.245
K to the E, to the ST,

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:35.605
so lemme factor that out.

00:04:35.605 --> 00:04:36.772
K, E to the ST

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.053
times, what's left?

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:42.220
S squared plus one over LC

00:04:47.298 --> 00:04:48.298
equals zero.

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:53.381
Okay, we have how many
adjustable parameters here?

00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:54.464
We have K, S.

00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:57.469
Those are the two.

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.670
L and C are constants that
are values of our circuit.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.552
So, we need to find some values of K and S

00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:06.147
that make this equation zero.

00:05:06.147 --> 00:05:08.897
Okay, I can make K equal to zero,

00:05:09.797 --> 00:05:12.173
and that would mean that zero equals zero,

00:05:12.173 --> 00:05:13.816
so our amplitude would be zero.

00:05:13.816 --> 00:05:15.563
So if we put nothing in the circuit,

00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:16.706
we get nothing out.

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:18.471
Okay, that's totally boring.

00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:21.426
So that's not so
interesting of a solution.

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:24.461
Now, does E to the ST ever become zero?

00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:27.775
E to something, does it ever become zero?

00:05:27.775 --> 00:05:28.608
It never does.

00:05:28.608 --> 00:05:31.775
If I let T go to plus infinity,

00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:33.382
and S is negative,

00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:35.681
then E to the ST would become zero,

00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:37.715
but plus infinity time from now

00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:40.285
is pretty far in the future,

00:05:40.285 --> 00:05:42.603
and I don't wanna wait that long.

00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:45.051
So the interesting solution becomes

00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:48.218
can we make S squared plus one over LC

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.477
equal to zero?

00:05:53.922 --> 00:05:55.237
This equation is referred to

00:05:55.237 --> 00:05:57.820
as the characteristic equation.

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:10.265
So let's see what happens
when we try to solve this.

00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:13.239
Well, the first step of this is

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:15.158
I'm gonna get S squared

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:17.241
equals minus one over LC,

00:06:18.968 --> 00:06:20.885
or S equals square root

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.546
of minus one over LC.

00:06:28.047 --> 00:06:29.392
Uh oh, look what happens here.

00:06:29.392 --> 00:06:32.256
We're taking the square
root of a negative number.

00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:33.896
So what's gonna happen here?

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:37.968
We're gonna get an imaginary
number for our answer.

00:06:37.968 --> 00:06:39.551
I can write this as

00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:44.862
square root of minus one

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:47.612
times square root of one over LC,

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:53.507
and that gives me two answers,

00:06:53.507 --> 00:06:56.066
and I'm gonna call the first answer S one,

00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:57.703
and that's gonna be equal to J,

00:06:57.703 --> 00:07:00.002
which is the imaginary number.

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:03.062
That's the square root of minus one

00:07:03.062 --> 00:07:05.408
for electrical engineers,

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:06.241
times what?

00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:08.991
Times square root of one over LC,

00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:13.239
and the other, S two,

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:15.913
is the negative of that,

00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:16.746
minus J.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.624
So these are two possible solutions

00:07:23.624 --> 00:07:26.601
to our differential equation.

00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:30.375
Now, I'm gonna give a nickname
to this expression here

00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:32.215
because I don't wanna write it so much.

00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:34.798
I'm gonna call this omega knot.

00:07:38.855 --> 00:07:43.261
So this is a lower case
omega Greek letter.

00:07:43.261 --> 00:07:45.967
This is the capital omega

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:47.245
that we use for Ohms,

00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:48.748
but little omega is often used

00:07:48.748 --> 00:07:50.935
as this variable here.

00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:53.435
So I can say that S one equals

00:07:56.335 --> 00:07:57.918
plus J, omega knot,

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.772
and S two equals minus J, omega knot.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.000
So we're gonna use this
notation for a little bit,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.908
but just remember I made
that simple substitution.

00:08:12.908 --> 00:08:13.843
We have two different roots

00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:16.949
that can cause our differential
equation to go to zero.

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:21.639
So when we combine these
into a solution for I,

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:24.320
we're gonna use a
combination of these two.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.035
We don't know which one it is.

00:08:26.035 --> 00:08:27.155
It could be both.

00:08:27.155 --> 00:08:29.879
So they could be
superimposed on each other,

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.905
and this is what superposition is for.

00:08:31.905 --> 00:08:34.302
So we're gonna now have,

00:08:34.302 --> 00:08:35.481
we need to have K one.

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:37.187
We'll have two constants,

00:08:37.187 --> 00:08:38.520
E to the S one T

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.537
plus K two, E to the S two T,

00:08:50.748 --> 00:08:52.681
and I could also write this as--

00:08:52.681 --> 00:08:55.403
Let's fill in some of the numbers here,

00:08:55.403 --> 00:08:57.320
K one, E to the plus J,

00:09:00.245 --> 00:09:01.412
omega knot, T,

00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:04.662
plus K two,

00:09:07.054 --> 00:09:09.721
E to the minus, J omega knot, T.

00:09:12.876 --> 00:09:16.203
So that's my proposed solution,

00:09:16.203 --> 00:09:17.410
and what we need to do now,

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.316
we found S.

00:09:18.316 --> 00:09:19.476
We found two values of S.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.224
Now we have these two constants.

00:09:21.224 --> 00:09:23.405
We gotta work those out.

00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:24.828
So, in the next video,

00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:27.277
we'll use the initial conditions

00:09:27.277 --> 00:09:29.535
to figure out what K one and K two are.
