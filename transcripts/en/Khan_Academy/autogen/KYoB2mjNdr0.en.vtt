00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.630
 We ended the last video with the Kingdom of Terror, 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:17.940
 which began in April 1793 and lasted until July 1794, 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.691
 where Robespierre ended up in the guillotine. 

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:27.371
 So it seems that France had overcome the heaviest period of the Revolution. 

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.941
 In the same way, the French themselves have understood. 

00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:36.530
 Then we pass in 1795. 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.210
 France is able to withstand wars with 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.830
 most of Europe. 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.575
 And peace has been declared with Prussia and Spain. 

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:52.010
 Peace with Prussia and Spain. 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.720
 So the two main enemies that remain are 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.710
 Great Britain and Austria. 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.590
 So slowly, France faces its enemies. 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.130
 First of all, this was a victory for France. 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.480
 So France is the winner with the big number 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.290
 of the civilian army he has created. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.440
 All this happened in April 1795. 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.100
 Then in August of the same year 1795-let me do it in another color- 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.010
 in August 1795 in the new republic 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.520
 the constitution was approved. 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:41.950
 And it is passed through the votes of the people, which 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.160
 makes France officially a republic. 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.430
 They no longer need a king. 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.580
 And regulated the structure of the government where the executive 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.940
 consisted of five leaders. 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.900
 Thus the executive is called the "Leader" 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.290
 So you did not have a president, 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.910
 but five leaders. 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.880
 Five leaders. 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.250
 And then the legislature, and this is important because 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.070
 this was the first "two chambers" legislature for France, which it had 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.920
 "two houses" - (as a legislative body) 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.170
 There was a Council composed of 500 people, which is the same as that of the United States. 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.095
 The House of Representatives. 

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:19.740
 Which had 500 members in it, 500 representatives. 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.600
 Let me write it down. 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.520
 was "two-room". 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.000
 There were two houses, the same as the US Congress. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.480
 And the Council composed of 500 people. 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.640
 Then you had the "Old Council, with 250 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.400
 representative. 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.730
 All this, if you want to look at it from the US point of view, 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.420
 which was the same with the US Senate. 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.420
 And the "leader", the leaders, the candidates 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.520
 from the "500 Council" were submitted to the Council 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.870
 Old people, who then chose five executives-five 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.870
 the people who would be leaders in France. 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.480
 So far, it is seen that things are going well. 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.770
 Yet, even though they had military victories, again 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.910
 were concerned. 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.450
 There were still monarchists there. 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.870
 Still, Great Britain was still causing problems. 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.020
 Great Britain is attacking the western regions of France. 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.560
 Monarchists were found everywhere in Paris. 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:28.850
 Then, in October 1795, a Monarch was planning revolt. 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.130
 And the monarchists were the ones who wanted to 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.420
 restored royal power. 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.900
 Or they were against the revolutionary government. 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 And to a higher degree, they were not just bored of 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.590
 the fact that there was no royal power. 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.910
 They were also bored of the fact that 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.690
 were excluded from the "Leader" 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.330
 Thus they expelled the monarchists. 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.020
 Even before creating the 'Leader' of broader routes, 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.790
 Monarchists were revolting in Paris. 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.510
 Monarchists were revolted in Paris. 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.530
 And they fired the Tuliites. 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.940
 This is the same place if you have remembered earlier, 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.190
 some videos earlier, where the King and the Queen were 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.100
 in house arrest. And later they were attacked by 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.360
 the revolutionary government. 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.120
 It was this painting here. 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.600
 It was only three years ago. 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600
 That was in 1792 when they got 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.660
 The King and the Queen as prisoners. 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.690
 And they executed Luigi 16 alone 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.040
 after a few months. 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.500
 Now everything was heading in the other direction. 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.950
 Rather than the monarchists were with the Tuliers, and 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.020
 surrounded by revolutionaries, revolutionary government 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.720
 it was with the Tulims and were rebuilt by the Monarchists. 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.940
 In fact, the situation did not look good for 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.030
 the revolutionary government. 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.470
 They were few in number. 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.075
 It seemed that the monarchists were better in number. 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.980
 But fortunately for the revolutionary government, 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.830
 there was a young, very ambitious, very selfish, 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.300
 military commander who had observed 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.470
 Tulier's siege when Luigi 16 and Marie-Antoinette 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.420
 were caught. 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.830
 At the time, he had marked it in the head. 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.030
 He had said that they would only stop besieging if he would 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.080
 they had good artillery. 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.860
 Considering that he had been artillery commander. 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.900
 Thus began to become famous. 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.520
 In the Toulon Siege he was able to use artillery 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.680
 effectively to suppress a revolt. 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.850
 In fact, he was watching this scene three years later. 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.450
 And now, in 1795, where the revolutionary government is with 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.110
 The firemen and monarchists are ready 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.750
 take power, Napoleon, using it 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.070
 who had learned to look at it at the first time, was capable of 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.460
 put balls and artillery in the right way. 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.750
 And he fired so they called "grapeshot". 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.240
 It was as if a singer came from a canon. 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.410
 Although they were significantly few in number compared 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.270
 with the monarchists, he was able to fight 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.240
 pushing with balls. 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.620
 Even though you had more numbers, you did 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.840
 all these carps. 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.780
 Let me draw you one. 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.560
 You had a carpal and the ammunition would contain these 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.470
 small bullets. 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.290
 That is why it is called "grapeshot", it looked like 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.670
 bunch of grapes. 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.080
 And after the shot, it would go in all directions. 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.850
 You can imagine, kill, whoever it was 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.150
 in the same direction as the carambola. 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.160
 Thus Napoleon was able to save 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.660
 the revolutionary government. 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.630
 And let the "Leaders" get the power. 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.370
 So again, Napoleon was in the right place and 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.790
 at the right time. 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.740
 And he was very capable of military tactics. 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.330
 He was selfish, narcissistic, 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.350
 but she knew very well what she was doing. 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.350
 And so Napoleon was becoming more and more famous. 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.540
 This event, on October 5, 1795 where Napoleon is capable of 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.276
 revolve the revolutionary government, this is also known as 

00:06:45.276 --> 00:06:48.880
 "13 Vendemiaire" 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.180
 I know I'm wrong. 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.310
 Still, that was the month of October at 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.580
 New French Revolutionary Clare. 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:03.690
 You appreciated Napoleon more as a national hero, or even 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.040
 hero revolutionary. 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.320
 People are beginning to understand this man, eventually 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.220
 I know what you are doing. 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.390
 But you can imagine at the same time, "Leader" 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.790
 he really did not want this man to stay so close to him 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.650
 the waters of power. 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.110
 It seems he was ambitious. 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.100
 Obviously he was competent. 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.180
 In a way, it must be a threat 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.140
 for "Leader" 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.030
 So they give him power. 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.620
 But they ensured that he would stay as far away from France. 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.570
 Thus he was placed at the helm of the organization 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.420
 campaign for Italy. 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.410
 So Napoleon was put in charge. 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.800
 Remember, we are still fighting Austria and Great Britain. 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.810
 So we are fighting Austria in Italy. 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.710
 And Napoleon became Commander of 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.390
 Italian forces. 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.010
 And he's incredibly successful. 

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.630
 This was the least important front of the war 

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.170
 with Austria to this point. 

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.620
 But of all the generals of the various fronts, 

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.010
 Napoleon was the only one to show that 

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.650
 was extremely innovative and versatile and 

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.820
 in the end a good general. 

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.700
 So Napoleon was "telling pleasure" to Italy. 

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.330
 Napoleon in Italy. 

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.940
 And yet, he was starting to become more and more famous, 

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.850
 increasingly known. 

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:28.010
 Eventually, Austria admits it will not 

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.300
 defeat France. 

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.780
 They are looking very good for us. 

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:43.370
 And they make peace with France in October of 1797. 

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.890
 The Italian campaign ended in 1796. 

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.350
 So he defended 

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.890
 the revolutionary government in 1795. 

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.320
 He "shows his pleasure" in 1796 to Italy. 

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.330
 In 1797 it is in peace with Austria. 

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.740
 So only Great Britain remains. 

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.150
 But this peace with Austria will be in fact 

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.400
 very short. 

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.015
 This is from the Campo-Formio Treaty. 

00:09:11.015 --> 00:09:12.265
 Let me write to you. 

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.090
 And yet it was peace with Austria. 

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.160
 But France was the winner. 

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.040
 So this is another victory of France. 

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.610
 And the only true enemy remained Great Britain. 

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.530
 But the main problem was that Great Britain had 

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.170
 the dominant marine fleet in the world. 

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.500
 So France, and especially Napoleon, was not ready 

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.030
 to face the UK in the water. 

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.660
 And that was somehow a controversial decision. 

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.070
 In 1798 - and if you keep in mind, "The Leader" did not really like it 

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.470
 Napoleon would stay in France. 

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.490
 They were like: you are very famous, you are one 

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.460
 good general, you are a great general. 

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.690
 Go do what you want. 

00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:59.920
 Whatever you think is right. 

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.080
 Thus Napoleon attacks them to attack Egypt. 

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.090
 And people were not 100% sure which was the main strategy 

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.090
 of the purpose of attacking Egypt. 

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:15.140
 So in 1798, he leaves Toulon. 

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.450
 If you keep in mind Toulon was the port where he helped print. 

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.200
 He leaves Toulon on the way to Malta.
