00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.970
The following tape diagram
describes the relationship

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.310
between the amount of red paint
and the amount of blue paint

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.230
needed in order to make
Plummy Purple paint mix.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.410
So they show us here that
for every 4 parts red,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.510
you need 3 parts blue.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.950
Or you could say that the
ratio of red to blue is 4 to 3

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.440
or that the ratio of
blue to red is 3 to 4.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.850
Now, they tell us, suppose
the x-axis represents

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.840
the number of red paint
cans and the y-axis

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.760
represents the number
of blue paint cans.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.180
So let's scroll
down a little bit.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.470
So the x-axis is
the number of red.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.850
The y-axis is the
number of blue.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.850
First, find two sets
of corresponding values

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.230
of x and y and graph them.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.630
Then determine whether the
relationship is proportional.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.750
So we know if we have 4 parts
red, we need 3 parts blue.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.720
So let me graph that.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.850
So if we have 4 parts
red-- that's that axis--

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.720
we're going to
have 3 parts blue.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.480
And what if we had 8 parts red?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.069
If we had 8 parts red, well,
that's 2 groups of four.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.670
Then we're going to need 2
groups of 3 for the blue.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.710
Once again, the ratio of
blue to red is always 3 to 4.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.676
Here, literally, you
have 3 blues and 4 reds.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:17.800
So you have a 3 to 4 ratio.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.760
Here, you have 6 parts
blue, 8 parts red.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.330
The ratio of 6 to 8
is the same as 3 to 4.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.280
Now, the question is,
is this proportional?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.550
So you have a
proportional relationship

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.589
if the ratio between these two
variables is always the same.

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:35.380
And we already said,
the ratio between them

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.200
is always the same.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.530
The ratio of blue to red is
always going to be 3 to 4.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.660
Another sign that this is
a proportional relationship

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.420
is that it's a line.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.240
And not only is it
a line, but it's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.905
a line that goes
through the origin.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:50.780
And that makes sense.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.070
If I have 0 red, well, I'm
going to have 3/4 of that blue.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.700
Well, 3/4 times 0 is
still going to be 0.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.377
So this is a proportional
relationship.

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:02.460
We could check our answer.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.290
Yes, it is.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.760
And let me explain
that last point

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.580
in a little bit more detail.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.250
So as we said, the
ratio-- and I'm

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.100
going to do this in the
right colors-- of blue

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.657
to-- I don't have an exact red.

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:17.490
I'll do this orange.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.323
That's close enough.

00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:20.960
The ratio of blue
to red is always

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.470
going to be equal to 3 to 4.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.340
And so if you multiply both
sides by the number of red,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.510
you could say that the
amount you have in blue

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.910
is always going to be 3/4 the
amount that you have in red.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.020
You can also verify this.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.490
When R is 4-- if you have
a 4 here-- 3/4 of 4 is 3.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.430
Blue is 3.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.410
And so if R is a 0, if this
is really proportional,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.140
then this is also going to be 0.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.620
A proportional relationship will
always go through the origin.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.130
If you don't go
through the origin,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.710
it's not a proportional
relationship.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.004
If it's not linear, it's not
a proportional relationship.
