00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.450
Okay. So I deleted my old tickets sold field.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.790
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.010
&gt;&gt; And remember when we went to the festival, and there

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.020
were all those people outside like, get your tickets, get your tickets.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.770
&gt;&gt; I think they had a sketchier voice than that. Like, you need some tickets?

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.720
&gt;&gt; Get your tickets, yeah.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.720
&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.997
[LAUGH]

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:15.110
&gt;&gt; Okay, totally sketchy, I don't want these scalpers at

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.960
my festival. the reason this stuff always happens is because

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.480
You know, one person could buy like a thousand tickets

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.340
and then they can sell them at like 10X value.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.541
&gt;&gt; Which is super-annoying. so, so how can I, say,

00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:32.080
for example, don't let anyone buy more than one tickets?

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.220
&gt;&gt; So that's really easy to do in Salesforce, because

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.210
you can just create a rule that prevents that from happening.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.400
And what that is called in Salesforce is a Validation Rule.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.650
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.760
&gt;&gt; And so basically you set up some

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.640
sort of condition that shouldn't happen, and if

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.462
it does, it throws an error at whoever's

00:00:49.462 --> 00:00:51.360
you know, trying to create or modify the record.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.070
&gt;&gt; Okay, let me try and do this. So this is on

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.670
attendees, because we don't want the attendee to buy more than eight tickets.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.220
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.669
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to click my little friend on the right.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.190
Oh, okay, a few validation rules. Add one.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.560
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.800
&gt;&gt; Okay, let me give this a shot and tell me if I make any mistakes.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.590
&gt;&gt; Alright.
