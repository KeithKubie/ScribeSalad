00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.440
Hi everyone, hi.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.620
&gt;&gt; This is my twin brother Palter,
he loves phones and shopping.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.442
&gt;&gt; Sup.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:09.272
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:10.076
All right, so

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:14.070
well the question today is what do
you want out of a shopping list app?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.704
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:16.750
What do you think, Palter?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.660
&gt;&gt; Well, I think what you really-
&gt;&gt; Okay, I know instarritos.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.660
&gt;&gt; Whoa, interrupt much?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.550
&gt;&gt; Sorry, Paul.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.670
&gt;&gt; It's Paulter.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.288
It's a family name.

00:00:26.288 --> 00:00:27.252
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:31.652
to clarify multi touch
Instarrito interface.

00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:32.673
&gt;&gt; I have a better idea.

00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:37.083
&gt;&gt; What about an app that let's you take
regular drivers like you and me, and

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:39.871
pick each other up and
go to the grocery store.

00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:40.915
&gt;&gt; Isn't that Uber?

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:45.130
&gt;&gt; Ooh, or
64 bit synchronized Instarrito support.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.340
&gt;&gt; What is that even?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.850
Look, I think we really need to
be focusing on the gut reaction.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.758
Right?
So maybe even have swipe support.

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:55.033
Swipe right for cream puffs,
swipe left for broccoli.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:55.718
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:55.718 --> 00:00:56.833
That's ridiculous.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:00.270
Who wants to be swiping for
their food all day.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.250
Now cloud based API.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.030
&gt;&gt; This is a shopping list app, right?

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.538
Yeah.

00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:08.698
&gt;&gt; I'm not even sure how
you add stuff to the list.

00:01:08.698 --> 00:01:10.277
How do you add items to the list?

00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:14.537
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:14.537 --> 00:01:17.254
Okay, so I've got a great
idea about what to do next.

00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:18.089
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:21.200
&gt;&gt; Wasn't trained by developing
that Instaritto API, but

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.480
I think we should focus on building
out the core app functionality.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.988
Here, let me show you.

00:01:26.988 --> 00:01:30.329
Here's our [INAUDIBLE] again and
in version to the app, we're going

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.970
to work on the shopping list screen and
the shopping list details screen.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.996
Right now the shopping list
screen only has one list, but

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:40.760
instead what I want is for
us to have a collection of lists.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.310
Now, you should be able to click
on each of these lists, and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.640
it will take you to a shopping
list detail screen,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.039
which is where will actually
show what items are in the list.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.860
And then we'll be allowing users
to collaboratively add and

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.950
remove items from any of these lists.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.990
&gt;&gt; To do that, you and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.650
the developer are going to need to
a lot more than just set value.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.970
You'll need to master the different
methods of reading and

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.700
writing with firebase.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.940
&gt;&gt; All right, ready to start coding?
