GILBERT STRANG:
So complex numbers

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.528
are going to come in to today's
video, and let me show you why.

00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:10.648
So I'm going to
solve the problem.

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:14.280
The differential equation
we know-- first order,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.640
linear with a source term,
but now the source term

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.390
has both the cosine
and the sine.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.500
And the sine, you notice, has
this imaginary square root

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.480
of minus 1 involved.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.940
So I'll call this y
complex with a little c,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.930
because the answer
is going to come out

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.600
a complex number instead
of a real number.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.450
So the previous lecture
solved it with the cosine,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.390
and now we're going to solve
it with that combination,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.610
and you may wonder why.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.790
The reason is that Euler left
behind a fantastic formula

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.620
for that the cosine plus i
times the sine of an angle

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.710
equals the exponential of the
angle, e to the i omega t.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.620
And the good part
about that is--

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.740
which we saw earlier
for exponentials--

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.300
that when the source
term is an exponential

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.520
the solution is an exponential.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.120
So I look for a solution
of this with that same e

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.220
to the i omega t, and it's
got some factor capital Y

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.080
that we have to find.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.500
And we find that by substituting
this into the equation,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.930
and then we learn what
this capital Y is.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.460
So let me put that in.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.730
The derivative,
the left side, is--

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.030
so this is the still going
to be our complex solution.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.570
It's still complex.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.180
So I put this into the equation.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.470
The derivative will be
i omega-- of course,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.110
the derivative of
the exponential

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.620
brings down the number
there, whatever it is.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.170
i omega y e to the i omega t.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.810
That's what we get for
the derivative of this,

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.860
and now that should
equal a times

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.360
the function plus the
source, e to the i omega t.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.090
Just as we did before with
a real, e to the st, now

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.960
it's s is i omega.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.140
And the beauty is we
divide everything by e

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.280
to the i omega t, and then
we get a simple equation.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.392
i omega-- bring the a on the
other side-- times y is what?

00:02:46.392 --> 00:02:48.180
Good.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.890
So y we now know is 1
over i omega minus a.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.850
It involves the frequency
omega in the source term,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.300
and it involves the rate
of growth, the constant,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.510
in the 0 order term.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.140
Good.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.260
That's our expression
for capital Y,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.710
and if I put that in here,
I have the complex solution,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.090
but my idea is to use this
complex solution to find two

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.760
real solutions-- that's really
why I'm-- this video is about--

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.460
using this complex source term
to find the solutions for both

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.130
that one and sine omega t.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.560
And the trick will
be-- the way to do

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.130
it will be I will take--
here's my complex solution.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.730
I'll take the real part
of this complex solution.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.240
It will be the results.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.300
Match the cosine.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.770
That's the real part of this
expression, which I now know,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.830
and the imaginary part
of this same expression

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.250
will give me the
sine, the output,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.010
the response to the sine term.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.430
So to problem solve one
method, but there's a step

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.810
that I have to take.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.840
How do I find the real
part of this expression?

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.970
The real part is easy
if the complex number

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.240
is written a plus ib.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.175
Real part is a.

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:43.665
The imaginary part is b, but I
don't have it a plus side ib.

00:04:43.665 --> 00:04:48.390
I have it in this form, and
in a way, it's a better form.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.900
So now I have to think
about-- and y itself has

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.440
this thing in the denominator.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:05.840
So can I practice by looking at
this number i omega-- i omega

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.040
minus a?

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.820
That's really the
awkward quantity

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.980
that I have to get
into a good form,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.860
and the form you want
for complex numbers

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.800
when you're going to multiply
them is the polar form.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.800
I want to put this in the
form re to the i alpha.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.710
So a positive number,
the magnitude of this,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.720
and the angle-- so I have
to draw the complex plane.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.910
I guess this is the first
time in these lectures.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.920
So there is the real axis.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.720
Here's the imaginary axis,
and here's a complex number,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.510
i omega minus a.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.280
So in the imaginary
direction, I go up omega,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.310
and in the real
direction, I go minus a.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.180
So here's my number.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.070
This is up to i omega
and back to minus a,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.865
and there is the
number I omega minus a.

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:19.190
And there is the angle
alpha, and the length

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.040
of that is the r.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.800
So I have those
two things to find.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.490
That's called putting the
number into its polar form.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.670
This is its rectangular
form, real, imaginary.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.320
This is its magnitude, and now
what is the magnitude of that?

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.340
Easy.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.820
| a right triangle with height
with that side is omega.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.940
This side is minus a.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.360
I use Pythagoras to
know that this r is

00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.510
the square root of a
squared plus omega squared.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.020
That length squared-- the
minus sign disappears.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.870
That length squared, omega
squared-- so that's the r.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.680
Now, what about
e to the i alpha?

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.140
What's the angle--
e to the i alpha?

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:20.280
The best I can say is I
know what that angle is.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.510
I can only tell you
its tangent, but let

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.590
me just leave it as alpha.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.470
Alpha is the angle.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.440
The tangent of
this angle will be

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.780
that number over that number.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.190
I'll leave it that way.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.300
So that's a key step, a first
step with complex numbers,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.980
and in a later video,
we'll be devoted entirely

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.760
to working with complex numbers.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.470
Here you're getting
a first look at it,

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.360
or you may have seen it before.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.020
So now I had to divide by that.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.300
That's why I like this form.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.120
Dividing by it-- so
now I'm ready for-- I'm

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.760
ready to put in my complex.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:13.790
y complex was this y, which
was 1 over i omega minus a,

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.470
and e to the i omega t.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.890
That's what we have,
but now i omega minus

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.060
a we have in this nicer form.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.320
I can divide by that.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.290
If I divide by that, it'll
be 1 over the square root

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:40.700
of a squared plus omega squared
times e to the i alpha--

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.730
e to the minus i alpha.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:48.610
When I divide by an exponent--
that exponent-- exponential--

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.780
that exponent changes sign--
times e to the i omega t.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.670
Are you good with that?

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.130
So this number produced both
of those terms, the magnitude

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.760
part and the angle part, and
then this part was pure angle.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.250
And that's my answer
in a nicer form,

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.060
and here is even better form.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.490
I combine these two.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.120
e to the i something
times-- when

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.890
I multiply two exponentials,
I can put that as e

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:28.290
to the i omega t minus alpha.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.970
You see that it has that factor
e to the minus i alpha as well

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.000
as the e to the i omega t.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.150
Now I'm ready to take the real
part and the imaginary part,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.060
and that will give
me my two solutions--

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.360
my two real solutions
to the real equation.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.580
So take the real
part, and that's

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.010
why I'll concentrate
on the real part

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:04.020
is the original y of t-- y
real coming from the cosine.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.810
The cosine of
omega t is the case

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.080
I'm redoing from what
I had in an earlier

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.100
lecture as a combination
of sines and cosines.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.090
Now we're going to see
it more beautifully.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.000
So I'm ready to take
the real part of that.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.680
Well, this is a real number--
1 over the square root

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.505
of a squared plus omega squared.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.360
And what is the real part of
e to the i times an angle?

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.440
The real part of e to the i
theta is the cosine of theta.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.860
The real part is the cosine.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.010
That's where using Euler--
always using Euler.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:59.240
So it's just the cosine
of omega t minus alpha,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.970
and that's exactly
what we ended up

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:06.010
with with more work in
the previous lecture.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.570
The magnitude-- this
was called the gain.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.590
This was the G part.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.430
This is the G, the gain.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:22.180
The input was the size
of cosine was size one.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.580
It's increased or
decreased by this factor,

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.280
and then the cosine
is still here.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.720
And alpha, you remember,
is the time lag.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.540
The input is a pure
cosine, but the output

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.960
is a shifted cosine, which is
also a combination of cosine

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.420
and sine.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:55.540
So there you've used complex
numbers-- maybe the first time,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.620
maybe not-- to get the
nice form for the answer.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.350
And of course, if the input
was the sine of omega t,

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.150
then I would have
the same thing.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.340
That would be a sine.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.920
So it's really the
physically important quantity

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.420
is the gain and the phase lag.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:18.920
Good.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.390
So that's the first
use of complex numbers

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:28.050
to get us back to an
exponential, after which

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.840
the solution is easy.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.270
I'll have more source
terms-- a few more--

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.470
and then I'll look
for a formula that

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.170
applies for any source term.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.990
Thank you.
