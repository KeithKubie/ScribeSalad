00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:12.940
If you happen to 
think killing two birds with one stone is

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.839
a bit inefficient, or you have found your
way into a zombie apocalypse, you might be

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:22.220
interested in a special type of gun known
as a “punt gun,” that used to be somewhat

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.460
common among commercial waterfowl hunters.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.960
What’s so special about this gun?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.430
It is capable of killing upwards of 50-100
birds in a single shot.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.800
Market hunters first made their appearance
in what would become the United States around

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.480
the time of the Pilgrims and continued plying
their trade en masse until around the beginning

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.100
of the twentieth century.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.660
Some earned their living by bringing as many
ducks or other waterfowl to market as possible.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.750
While various methods were used for bringing
down the maximum number of birds per hunting

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.900
trip, the most effective was ambushing a large
flock with a punt gun.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.580
punt-gunFirst put in use in the 1800s, the
punt guns were never manufactured on a large

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.220
scale, with each being custom made by a gunsmith
to fit a buyer’s specifications.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.890
But in general, the barrels had openings upwards
of 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter and weighed

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.450
over 100-pounds (45 kg).

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.390
They generally could fire more than a pound
of shot at a time and usually measured over

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.840
10 feet (3 m) long.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.770
As you might imagine from this, they were
too heavy and the recoil too strong for a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.810
hunter to fire them by hand.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.020
Instead, they were (usually) mounted to small,
often flat bottomed, boats known as “punts.”

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.020
Hunters aimed the gun by maneuvering the boat
into position one or two dozen meters from

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.209
their targets, and then fired.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.020
That said, not all punt guns were always mounted
to boats.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.469
One of the smallest examples of a punt gun
is the Herfurth’s Cannon.

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.719
Crafted by German gunsmith August Herfurth
in Wisconsin, it measures 63-inches (160 cm)

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:58.459
long and includes a 46-inch (116 cm) long
Remington octagonal barrel with a one-inch

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:59.509
diameter.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.060
As for the weight, it’s approximately 26-pounds
or just under 12 kilograms, making it a featherweight

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.750
compared to most punt guns.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.780
However, it is still much too big and has
too much kick to be fired like a normal shotgun.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.040
But its relatively small size did allow the
owner to hunt from the shore with proper bracing

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040
before pulling the trigger.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.700
On the other end of the spectrum, the world’s
largest punt gun, “Irish Tom,” was reported

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.460
to have taken down a little over 100 birds
with a single shot, according to its original

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.460
owner.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.590
(However, a more usual haul per shot was in
the typical range of 50 birds, give or take

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.750
a dozen or two.)

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.480
Irish Tom’s barrel measures more than 14-feet
long (4.2 m), and the whole gun weighs more

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.750
than 300 pounds (136 kg)!

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.560
More akin to a cannon than a shotgun, it could
fire over three pounds of shot with the help

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.840
of about 10 ounces of black powder.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.960
The size of Irish Tom meant its first owner
was forced to build a specially reinforced

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.630
punt boat 24-feet long.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.380
Punt-gun2Market hunters used punt guns from
the nineteenth through the early twentieth

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.380
century.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.510
The hunters often worked in groups of eight
to ten and fired their combined punt guns

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.420
at the same time to maximize the number of
waterfowl they could hit.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.630
As an example of how effective this was, a
market hunter in the eastern United States,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.900
Ray Todd, claimed he and three other hunters
with punt guns managed to kill 419 ducks one

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.040
night in a single volley after encountering
a huge flock “over a half-mile long and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.560
nearly as wide.”

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.680
After the first volley, he stated, “The
birds flew off a short distance and began

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680
to feed again.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.350
We made three more shots that night.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.760
By morning we had killed over 1,000 ducks.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.960
They brought $3.50 a pair in Baltimore, and
it was the best night’s work we had ever

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960
done.”

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.540
Not surprisingly, in the years after market
hunters began using punt guns, the population

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.930
of wild waterfowl began to decline in the
United States dramatically.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.900
Punt guns most certainly played a role in
the decline along with the decrease in available

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900
habitat.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.540
Sportsmen who hunted for personal use of the
killed waterfowl, rather than for profit like

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.380
the market hunters, began advocating for hunting
regulations and limits.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.990
In response, many states in the U.S. outlawed
the use of punt guns by the 1860s, while the

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.630
Lacey Act of 1900 and the Migratory Bird Treaty
Act of 1918 effectively ended their use in

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.630
the country.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.459
That said, punt guns are still legal in the
United Kingdom, though their barrels are restricted

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.780
to a diameter less than 1.75-inches.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.100
Hunters must also have a permit from the government
for the gun and black powder, and they must

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.460
adhere to strict hunting seasons.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.190
All this hasn’t proved much of a problem
as there are only a few dozen currently used

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:45.150
punt guns left 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:05:14.389
in 
the U.K. today.
