00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.090
SPEAKER 1: Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.520
Welcome to our talk today.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.937
We have here Timothy Zahn.

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:11.770
TIMOTHY ZAHN: Hello.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.247
SPEAKER 1: He is the author
of his latest novel, "Thrawn."

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:17.580
You've also written a bunch
of other "Star Wars" novels,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.430
including "Heir to the
Empire," and you said over

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.600
50 short stories and
novellas at this point?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.470
TIMOTHY ZAHN: Well, over
50 novels, 11 of them--

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.890
"Thrawn" is the 11th "Star
Wars" novel-- over 50 total,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.706
and something over 100 short
stories and novelettes.

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:34.331
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:34.830
Cool.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.705
TIMOTHY ZAHN: But I've
been at it since 1980,

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:39.740
so you know, I've
had time to do this.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.490
SPEAKER 1: So we have
a bunch of questions

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.389
from Googlers for you today.

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:44.930
The first question
we have is, having

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.820
written for both the old EU
and the new Disney canon,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.430
were there any
noticeable differences

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.929
in how much creative control
you had over the official "Star

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.500
Wars" continuity?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.460
TIMOTHY ZAHN: Not a
lot of difference.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.070
When I started with
the "Thrawn" trilogy,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.190
no one had been allowed to write
post-Return of the Jedi before,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.070
so I had a very clear canvas.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.900
And I could basically
suggest what

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.260
I wanted to do to Lucasfilm,
and at that time, Bantam.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.010
And they would tell
me, yes, this is fine,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.462
or this may be
encroaching on something.

00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:20.920
But I didn't have to worry
about running into anybody else.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.740
I think Dark Horse
Comics was doing

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.010
a series at the same time, but
it was a pretty clear canvas.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.240
As time went on and more
authors got involved,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.660
the canvas started
getting filled in,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.510
and there were dangers of
running over each other's toes,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.480
duplicating what
everybody else was doing.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.400
I think there are two, possibly
three, different versions how

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.340
Han Solo got the Millennium
Falcon from Lando Calrissian,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.910
with slightly different
dates on all three of them.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.410
So at some point, Lucasfilm had
to make the call to say, OK,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.610
this is the official one.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.305
The problem back then was
that we had the publishers

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:00.680
and we had the
comic book people,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.210
and we didn't know what
each side was doing.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.490
It took Lucasfilm a
few years to get up

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.630
to speed on monitoring
all of it as well--

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.900
also in games and
all the other stuff

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.370
that was coming out as well.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.840
Now, since the change to
legends and official canon--

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.080
I think they hate the word, but
we're stuck with it, canon--

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.790
the Story Group is in place
that is overseeing everything.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.022
So unlike the old
days when nobody

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.480
knew everything
that was happening,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.849
Story Group knows everything.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.390
They know what comics
are doing, what

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.110
the movie's going
to be doing, the TV

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.560
shows, novels, et cetera.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.870
So for example,
with "Thrawn," there

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.830
were a couple of cases
where I got a note back.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.700
OK, TIE fighters don't exist
at the beginning of this book,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.540
but they will come into
service part way through.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.420
So at the beginning, use
this kind of starfighter,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.060
and then you can add in
the TIE fighter later on.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.060
So they help me keep
within continuity that way.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.230
And they also, in
the other direction,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.250
walk on character in
one of the chapters--

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.220
they came back.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.400
This character's name
is very similar to one

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.580
that's going to be
used in another project

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.300
in the near future.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.900
Can you change it so
there's no confusion?

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.620
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.540
Search and replace--
easy enough to do,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.070
but I wouldn't have known.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.730
I don't even know what part of
the story of the "Star Wars"

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.750
saga this is coming at, but
again, they know everything.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.470
So it frees me up
to write what I've

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.460
been authorized to write and
not worry about the details,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.214
because there are people down
the road who will catch that.

00:03:48.214 --> 00:03:49.600
- Cool.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.850
How do you feel seeing
"Thrawn" on "Star Wars Rebels?"

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.141
Would you ever want to see
him on the big screen in one

00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:55.300
of the live-action movies?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.210
TIMOTHY ZAHN: You're
joking, right?

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.709
Absolutely.

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.390
No, I was flabbergasted when
I got the news that "Thrawn"

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.270
was going to be in "Rebels."

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.145
I think they've done a
terrific job with him.

00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:09.230
How many of you have
seen "Rebels" all the way

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.720
through season three?

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.800
How many of you have not
seen it and are going to?

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.740
OK, so no spoilers, people.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.310
But I think they did a great job
capturing not only the essence

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.960
of who Thrawn is,
but also the meta,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.960
how he interacts with the
politics, the military,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.461
his enemies, et cetera.

00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:34.210
I'm looking forward
to seeing what they're

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.660
doing with him in season
four, which has been announced

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.890
as the last season.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.560
I don't know where they're
bringing him, but we'll see.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.610
Again, though, you also
have to remember-- people

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.110
who are nervous
about this, remember

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.630
that these guys Dave Filoni, the
Story Group, all these people

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.860
grew up with the
old legends books.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.000
They grew up in the '90s with
the "Thrawn" trilogy and all

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.950
the others.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.320
They are going to
be careful with it.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.270
They love this stuff.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.520
They are going to be cautious.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.410
They're not going to change
anything they don't have to.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.800
And Leland Chee, the
Keeper of the Holocron,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.840
the man with the utterly amazing
memory for everything Star

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.784
Wars, said something
a few years ago

00:05:16.784 --> 00:05:17.950
that I've always remembered.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.410
This was before the sale,
before new movies, et cetera.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.800
He said, everything in "Star
Wars" is somebody's favorite.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.390
So the point of
that was, we don't

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.590
want to change something-- we
don't want to kick something

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.300
out of existence just
because we don't like it.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.960
We are only going
to do something

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.920
like that if it's necessary for
stories that we want to tell.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.850
So for example, they glossed
over the whole early days

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.750
after "Return of the
Jedi," in the call

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.490
for "The Force Awakens."

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.160
On the other hand,
Chewbacca's back,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.829
so Vector Prime
either doesn't exist

00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:59.370
or else, when they threw that
moon at Chewbacca, they missed.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.102
Well, it's easy to do.

00:06:02.102 --> 00:06:04.560
How many of you has ever tried
throwing a moon at somebody?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.730
Yeah, it's not as
easy as it sounds.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.850
So they are picking and
choosing what gets relegated as,

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.030
no, this didn't happen.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.550
Everything else that
they haven't overwritten

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.530
is, kind of, still there.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.020
It's often in the shadows.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.860
They could bring it in
any time they wanted to.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.480
So people will be able
to cheer the calm--

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.210
I have to give this speech
every convention at least

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.692
once, so you guys are
getting a preemptive.

00:06:33.692 --> 00:06:36.150
SPEAKER 1: If you could change
anything about the Star Wars

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.620
canon, even things from the
movies, what would you change,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.250
and why?

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.050
TIMOTHY ZAHN: I would
probably change how

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.600
Anakin fell to the dark side.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.880
All the pieces were ready,
but it seemed too quick

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.210
when it happened.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.630
I would like to see a little
more manipulation by Palpatine,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.200
a little more hesitation,
or a little more--

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.740
after he's agreed--
questioning, not sure,

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.200
two steps forward, one
step back type of thing.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.470
I think it happened
a little too quickly.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.180
And it's a pivotal moment
in the "Star Wars" saga,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.560
and I would like to have
seen that a little bit more

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.400
played out.

00:07:28.507 --> 00:07:30.340
SPEAKER 1: "Thrawn" was
the first appearance

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.690
of the alien Chriss race which
went on to become popular

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.949
in the expanded universe.

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:35.490
What was it like to
see your creation

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.970
spread through "Star Wars"
more by other authors?

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.330
TIMOTHY ZAHN: It was exciting.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.970
It can also be frustrating,
because a friend

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.200
coined a term, out-of-character
experience, when someone

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.550
has taken a known character and
done strange things with them.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.900
Some authors do better
with characters or races

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.690
I've created.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.350
Others don't do as well.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.040
I try to avoid taking
other writers' characters

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.070
for that very reason.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.780
I don't want to get them wrong.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.320
The popularity of the Chiss has
been, kind of, amazing to me.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.690
I don't play the online game,
because A, I don't have time,

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.300
and B, I suck at it.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.050
But I've been told
that the Chiss are

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.450
very popular in that game,
as characters for the players

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.390
to play.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.030
So I'm not quite
sure what it is.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.770
I assume it's the legacy of
Thrawn, that if Thrawn is cool,

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.340
all the Chiss are cool,
so let's play a Chiss.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:38.649
But when I finish a book, I
don't know if it's any good.

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:40.440
I don't know if anybody's
going to like it.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.120
I know it's the best I can do,
but I know all the plot twists,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.010
all the character arcs, all
the story arcs, all the jokes.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.620
I can't assess it.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.200
I have to wait until
readers get it and read it,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.060
and then they make a decision.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.730
So while I hope characters
like Thrawn and the Chiss

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:08.700
capture the imagination, there's
no way I can know about it.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.470
Suddenly, we are getting echoes.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.070
So it's always very
gratifying, but it's always

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.122
unexpected as well.

00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:20.861
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:22.610
Are there any personal
favorite characters

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.550
you'd like to see return
to canon from the EU,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.966
such as Mara Jade, Talon Karrde,
Gilad Pellaeon, et cetera?

00:09:28.966 --> 00:09:30.257
TIMOTHY ZAHN: Yup, all of them.

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:33.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.970
Yeah, let's go ahead and just
address the Pellaeon issue.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.430
A lot people weren't happy that
Pellaeon is not in any book.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.930
Spoilers!

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.026
I think the thing
a lot of people

00:09:46.026 --> 00:09:49.160
liked about Pellaeon
in the "Thrawn" trilogy

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.680
was the relationship
with Thrawn.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.710
The but the Thrawn in
the book, "Thrawn,"

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.640
is not in the same situation.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.700
He's not in overall command
of pretty much everything

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.200
imperial.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.520
He is an up-and-coming officer.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.370
He's dealing with superior
officers, some of who

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.560
recognize his potential,
others who just don't like him,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.590
period.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.031
You would not have that
dynamic that you had

00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:15.680
before in Thrawn and Pellaeon.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.300
Even if you brought
Pellaeon in here,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.320
there didn't seem to be
any point in changing

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.555
that dynamic just
to shoehorn Pellaeon

00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:25.450
in, which is why I
created Eli Vanto, who

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:31.100
is our point of view, our
Doctor Watson, the readers'

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.120
point of view into the saga.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.410
As different dynamic,
one where now he's

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.290
going to grow, change along
with, and follow Thrawn's path,

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.399
he gets to do it as
well, whereas Pellaeon

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:47.440
would have been a superior
officer at this point.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.340
It really wouldn't have worked.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.060
But I would like to see Pellaeon
come back in at a proper time.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.450
Obviously, Mara Jade--
people have been nagging

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.610
about that since, about,
a minute and a half

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:06.570
after "Thrawn" was revealed in
the London celebration trailer.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.570
I think, about, the fourth
question that came up

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.100
was about Mara Jade.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.820
And Filoni said, yep,
we knew this was coming.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.330
Patience.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.970
We'll see what
they do with that.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.570
I think the popularity
of Thrawn in "Rebels"

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.880
and hopefully the
popularity of the book

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.760
will induce people
at Lucasfilm to start

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.170
looking at other characters
that are popular among readers.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.380
Can we bring these
back and make them

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.790
popular for the general
"Star Wars" fan?

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.200
Remember, the readers
are a small subset

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.840
of overall "Star Wars" fandom.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.450
And they needed to balance the--

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.200
OK, the readers really
want Thrawn back in,

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.360
but everybody else doesn't
even know who he is.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.390
Can we make him a
compelling character again

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:57.080
and introduce him to all of
these other fans as well?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.650
So we'll see what
they choose to do.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.540
I'm ready anytime
they give me a call.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.320
Yeah, I can have an outline to
them in, oh, three, four hours.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.972
I'm inspired.

00:12:08.972 --> 00:12:10.430
SPEAKER 1: What
kind of research do

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.721
you do before you write a book?

00:12:11.721 --> 00:12:13.897
How long do you
spend researching?

00:12:13.897 --> 00:12:15.980
TIMOTHY ZAHN: I do as
little research as possible,

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.740
because I'm lazy.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.400
Typically, I do whatever
is needed at the time.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.550
If I am in a "Star
Wars" book, if I

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:31.390
am about to go to some planet,
I will pause the writing,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.916
look at the "Star Wars Atlas,"
cross-check with Wookieepedia,

00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:38.220
and see if these
things will work.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.910
So I do the research in bits
and pieces as I need it.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.960
Sometimes, I need to do
something at the beginning,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.750
but most of the research
is as I go along.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.540
And again, as much of it
as I could make up and not

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:58.238
have to go into real
science, the better.

00:12:58.238 --> 00:12:59.404
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.820
So you write a lot of short
stories in addition to novels.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.736
Do you prefer writing
one more than the other?

00:13:03.736 --> 00:13:05.149
Or how are they different?

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:07.190
TIMOTHY ZAHN: It's the
difference between a mural

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.930
and a little cameo.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.750
Short stories have to
be very tightly written.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.750
There's not a lot of time,
or there's not much time

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.900
for character development.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.330
You can't do a lot
of plotting in it.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.580
I'm of the opinion that there
are stories that are just--

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.830
every story is naturally
its own length,

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.870
that there are some ideas that
are short story ideas, some

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.520
that are novels, some
that are trilogies,

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.884
some, you know,
"Wheel of Time"--

00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:38.300
what's a 10?

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:38.920
Dectology?

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.840
Something like that.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.580
But when I get an
idea, generally,

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.440
at this point in my career, I
know how long it's going be.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:53.050
For example, one of my short
stories 15, 20 years ago

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.310
was called "The
President's Doll."

00:13:55.310 --> 00:14:00.080
The idea came to me as two
words, voodoo acupuncture.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.390
Instead of you getting
the pin stuck in you,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.850
the doll gets the
pin stuck in them.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.390
OK, that is not going to
support a whole novel's worth,

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.520
but it was a great
short-story idea,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.600
whereas something like
"Thrawn" or "Sibyl's War,"

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.120
the new series coming out
and starting next month--

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.450
that's at least a
trilogy, maybe five books,

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.620
depending on what
Tor wants from that.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.740
"Thrawn" has a couple
of books for sequels,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.270
pitching ideas to Del
Rey at this point.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.010
Actually, Del Rey is interested.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.100
The ideas are wending
their way through Lucasfilm

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.590
to make sure I'm not,
again, stepping on something

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.600
that I have no idea
is even out there.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.165
- Cool.

00:14:44.165 --> 00:14:45.459
Thank you.

00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:48.000
One of my favorite things about
reading Thrawn as a character

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.747
is watching him make
decisions in warfare

00:14:49.747 --> 00:14:52.330
that seem counterintuitive, only
to see his plan come together

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.990
in victory, sometimes
against insurmountable odds.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:59.030
How do you orchestrate these
pieces of strategic warfare?

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.840
TIMOTHY ZAHN: I'm not
sure counterintuitive

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.990
is the right word.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.280
Obscure, may be a better one.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.837
In a lot of ways, writing
battles and such with "Thrawn"

00:15:09.837 --> 00:15:10.920
is like writing a mystery.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.240
You start from your endpoint
and work your way back.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.750
Or OK, I know this is going
to be your initial setup,

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.420
and then you start playing
chess against yourself.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.840
OK, this is the enemy's move.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.760
Turn the board around.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.240
OK, here's Thrawn's
move, and turn it around

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.390
for the next one.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.520
And a lot of the battles
work out that way

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.460
as I'm writing them.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.940
OK, we need a clever thing
here for the bad guys.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.600
Let's see, this would work.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.700
How is that going
to be countered?

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.090
And they just work
their way out.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.670
And along the way,
I usually come up

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:55.550
with the obscure or
not-quite-noticeable facts

00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:00.840
or details that Thrawn can pick
up that other people might not,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.230
and then use those in building
the scene of the battle

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.942
or whatever.

00:16:06.942 --> 00:16:08.327
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:16:08.327 --> 00:16:10.160
What books have you
read recently or are you

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.040
reading right now?

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.150
TIMOTHY ZAHN: The book at home--

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.040
I read paper books at
home, I read on a Kindle

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.810
when I'm on the road because I
don't have the pounds to spare

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.470
for regular books.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.130
The book I'm
reading at home is--

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.590
I think the title
is just "D-Day."

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:34.830
It's the story of all the
details of the Normandy

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.030
invasion.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.590
What I'm reading
on Kindle right now

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:41.340
is, I'm going through my
complete collection of Sherlock

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.170
Holmes once more,
because those are fun.

00:16:46.054 --> 00:16:47.970
SPEAKER 1: What made you
want to write sci-fi,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.990
and what drew you into
writing for "Star Wars"?

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.320
TIMOTHY ZAHN: I always
was a sci-fi fan, always

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.680
read a lot of science
fiction-- some fantasy,

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.520
but science fiction
was what I liked best.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.770
Working on a doctorate in
physics, in November 1975,

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.569
I watched a bad TV show.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.729
I turned it off and I said, I
could write better than that.

00:17:11.729 --> 00:17:12.599
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.160
So over the next two
weeks, in my spare time,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.599
I wrote a story which
was pretty abysmal

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:21.160
but it showed how much fun it
was to write and finish stories

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.190
and such.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.849
It was "The Invisible Man" with
David McCallum, by the way,

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.560
if anybody wanted to know.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.150
I like David McCallum,
I liked him in "The Man

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.010
from U.N.C.L.E.," and
I liked him in "NCIS,"

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.890
but you've got to give the
guy something to work with,

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.740
even him.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.375
So my adviser was
out of town a lot,

00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:41.250
and the project was not working.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.600
In fact, there was
a fatal flaw in it

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.990
and we didn't know at the time.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.400
I started writing
in November '75,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.975
and sold my first
story in December '78.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.660
I sold my second
story in July of '79,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.530
the day I found out my adviser
had died of a heart attack

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.750
the night before,
leaving me with,

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.890
as I said, a project that
was never going to work.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:16.670
So I worked with a new professor
on new project for a semester,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.410
and discovered I
couldn't write and do

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.370
a new project at the same time.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.350
I had time, I just didn't
have enough mental energy.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.910
I was having more
fun writing than I

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.230
was with this new project.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.880
They'd also said, by the way,
two years, eight to 10 hours

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.529
a day, six days a week,
and you can probably

00:18:34.529 --> 00:18:35.320
get your doctorate.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.390
I wasn't sure I wanted to
invest that much time anymore.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.030
So in December of '79,
I quit the department

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.070
and started working
full-time in 1980.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.770
I started make a living in
1984, for those of you who

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.990
might be thinking about that.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.840
Don't give up your day
job, especially a day

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.820
job as this one.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:02.630
"Star Wars" was one of those
completely out-of-the-blue,

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.030
platinum-platter type of things.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.450
In 1988, Lou Aronica, who
was head of Bantam Spectra,

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:13.360
contacted Lucasfilm, suggesting
that since George wasn't doing

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.270
anything more with
Star Wars, that Bantam

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.800
would like to pick up the saga
after "Return of the Jedi."

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.100
The letter languished
for about a year,

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.100
about that same time the
Lucasfilm people were

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.400
considering restarting
their adult fiction line

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.060
and looking around
for a publisher.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.270
The two came together, Bantam
and Lucasfilm made a deal,

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.120
Bantam's editors were
asked to find an author,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.510
they made up a short list,
Lucasfilm decided they liked

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:48.000
my style best, and I had a
November of '89 phone call from

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.197
my agent with the
understatement of the decade--

00:19:51.197 --> 00:19:52.780
Tim, we have a very
interesting offer.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.120
The two kickers of
that story are--

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:07.350
first of all, my editor
almost didn't suggest my name

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.050
at that Bantam
meeting, because I

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.740
had three books under
contract and she told me later

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.460
that she didn't want me getting
sidetracked with media stuff.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.120
I think that was her terms.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.230
The other kicker is, I'd
been with Bantam books

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:24.370
at that point for a
grand total of six weeks.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.670
We had just left Baen Books,
because they couldn't afford

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.930
what my agent was going to ask.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.080
And actually, Russ and I had
a couple of conversations.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.670
He almost took me to Tor Books
because one of the editors

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.536
there really liked me,
and he thought, you know,

00:20:39.536 --> 00:20:41.035
we could probably
get an extra 5,000

00:20:41.035 --> 00:20:43.780
in advance for a
book out of Tor,

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.770
but I think Bantam is where
you really should be right now.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.620
Little did he know.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:57.570
So all the pieces just came
together, and the rest, 1991--

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.910
by the way, nobody knew
if those books would sell.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:04.090
Nobody knew if "Star Wars" fans
were even out there anymore.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.820
Well, this is '91, the
last movie was '83,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.540
and the fans were very
quiet, because there's

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.580
nothing to glom onto.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.830
So of course, they were quiet.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.340
When "Heir to the
Empire" hit the stands,

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.680
the first spring was
gone in a couple weeks.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.830
They were scrambling to, A,
print more copies, and B,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.660
make more deals with
Lucasfilm for more books.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.860
They ultimately did 12 more,
wound up, I think, like, 15.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.550
Bantam's contract ran out, Del
Rey outbid them for the next,

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.360
and the book's been
with Del Rey ever since.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.270
But nobody knew if the
"Star Wars" fans were there,

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:50.180
and they were, and still are.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.440
And "Star Wars" is bigger,
brighter, and prettier

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.770
than ever, like Emerald City.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:21:59.770
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.131
Do you hope we'll see
more of Eli and the Chiss?

00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:03.130
TIMOTHY ZAHN: Let's see.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.265
The short answer is, yes.

00:22:05.265 --> 00:22:07.630
The long answer is, yes, please.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.855
Yeah, again, I have
two sequels pitched.

00:22:14.855 --> 00:22:16.980
Now, we're going to have
a little bit of a problem,

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.150
possibly.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.720
My son pointed out that we have
the original "Thrawn" trilogy.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.610
If I do two sequels
to this book,

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.390
that's another "Thrawn" trilogy.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.430
His solution is, I
sell three more books

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.560
and make a "Thrawn" tetralogy.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.940
So I'll have the "Thrawn"
trilogy, "Hand of Thrawn"

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.530
duology, and the
"Thrawn" tetralogy.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.272
I mentioned this to the
editor a few conventions ago,

00:22:42.272 --> 00:22:44.730
and she turned to one of the
other Del Rey people and said,

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.534
see how smoothly he does that?

00:22:46.534 --> 00:22:48.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.930
So we will see.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.780
I got at least two more in mind.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.760
We'll see if the
market is interested,

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.270
if Del Rey's interested,
if Lucasfilm's interested.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.692
There are always more stories
to be told in "Star Wars."

00:22:57.692 --> 00:22:59.400
That's the great thing
about "Star Wars."

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.670
It's such a big galaxy.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:05.390
There are always more
stories to tell--

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.490
pick new characters,
you know, meld them up

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.340
with older ones and such.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.925
It's a wide-open universe.

00:23:12.925 --> 00:23:17.070
It was always very
wide-open, with a lot

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.210
of stories to be told.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.164
And it will continue to be
that way, and in the meantime,

00:23:22.164 --> 00:23:23.080
we've got more movies.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.910
We've got more TV shows,
we get more books,

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.390
we get more everything.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:30.480
And lightsabers are cool.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.104
What can I say?

00:23:31.104 --> 00:23:32.566
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:34.440
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
very much for your time.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440
TIMOTHY ZAHN: Thank you.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.390
[APPLAUSE]
