00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.140
The main aim of any given movie is to encapsulate
its audience.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.400
As a general rule, that's the job of the actors,
so the audience's eyes are generally focused

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.400
on them.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.210
Whether it's through breathtaking action,
hilarity, sheer emotionally-inspiring brilliance

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.170
or otherwise, an actor's performance is designed
to keep an audience fixated.Sometimes that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.540
can mean missing interesting, weird and wonderful
things that might be going on in the background;

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.930
Extras behaving strangely, bizarre cameos,
strange objects or things that simply shouldn't

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.710
be there have all been seen in the background
of movies.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.269
This video will take a look at some great
examples of those things.

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.339
Here are the ten weirdest things found in
the background of famous movies scenes.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:51.200
Ron Jeremy in Ghostbusters
Set in New York City, 1984's Ghostbusters

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.221
saw the titular team - played by Bill Murray,
Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson

00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:55.059
respectively - defending the Big Apple from
a wave of supernatural beings and activity.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.690
Towards the end of the movie, after their
ghost containment unit had exploded, a crowd

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.440
of people gathered to witness the resulting
devastation.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.500
That crowd was mostly made up of generic acting
extras, but if you look close enough, you'll

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.090
actually see that a legend of the pornographic
industry was among them.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.580
None other than Ron Jeremy himself - sporting
his iconic trademark moustache - can be seen

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.480
to the left of the screen in one particular
shot.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.830
A Man Throwing a Dog in the Ocean in Mr. Nanny
Hulk Hogan in movies... that's something we'd

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.030
all rather forget, right?

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.480
Well, sadly, it definitely happened, as the
early 1990s saw the wrestling superstar failing

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.130
emphatically in his attempts to become the
next Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.862
1993's Mr. Nanny was atrocious, but the weirdest
thing in the movie happened very randomly

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:37.862
in the background.

00:01:37.862 --> 00:01:41.821
As Hogan's character was riding on his motorcyle
near the ocean, a random guy can be briefly

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:44.560
seen throwing his dog into the water behind
him.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.170
It's a good job Hogan didn't notice this bizarre
act by the man in question, as it might have

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.560
resulted in Hulkamania running wild all over
him, brothers!

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.310
The Gross Restaurant Name in Anchorman
In the hilarious Anchorman: The Legend of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.820
Ron Burgundy, Christina Applegate's Veronica
Corningstone - Burgundy's rival, lover and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.700
eventual co-anchor - visits a Mexican restaurant
with a group of her female co-workers.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Prior to the scene in question, the sign for
the restaurant is shown on screen.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.759
Its name is “Escupimos en su Alimento”,
which means absolutely nothing to the movie's

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.319
predominantly English-speaking audience.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.560
However, when the name is translated into
English, it actually means “We spit in your

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560
food.”

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.740
Nice, huh?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.200
Tyler Durden's Facebook Page in The Social
Network

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.870
In David Fincher's brilliant The Social Network,
Mark Zuckerberg was played by Jesse Eisenberg.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.810
In one particular scene in the movie, Eisenberg's
Zuckerberg is seeing working on Facebook at

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.810
his computer.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.500
For a brief moment, he could be seen on the
profile of a certain Tyler Durden, as the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.760
words "Tyler Durden's Photos" were clearly
visible on screen.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.370
Tyler Durden was, of course, the iconic main
character in Fight Club - a movie that was

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.560
also helmed by Fincher earlier in his career.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.810
The Kid Needing to Pee in Back to the Future
Part III

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.530
At the end of Back to the Future Part III,
when Christopher Lloyd's Emmett Brown returns

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.740
from his time-travelling exploits to visit
Marty McFly in the present day, he reveals

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.520
that he and Clara had produced two children
- Jules and Verne.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.810
While Emmett and Marty are chatting, in the
background, the child playing Verne can be

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.620
seen making a "come on" gesture whilst pointing
at his crotch.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.471
One theory regarding this is that he was indicating
that he needed to use the bathroom, while

00:03:13.471 --> 00:03:17.950
another suggests he was mimicking a gesture
being made off-camera by a member of the movie's

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.950
crew.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.950
Either way, it's a little bit creepy.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.440
An Extra Falls to the Floor For No Reason
in The Dark Knight Rises

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.600
As a general rule, the fight choreography
in all three of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.340
Trilogy movies was pretty amazing, but a particular
scene in The Dark Knight Rises had a very

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.830
farcical moment in it.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.569
There's a scene on a rooftop in which Christian
Bale's Batman and Anne Hathaway's Catwoman

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.303
are fighting Bane's henchman and, in the background,
you can see one the extras portraying one

00:03:43.303 --> 00:03:45.349
of the henchman in a combat pose.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.300
Then, out of nowhere, without anyone actually
touching him, he falls to the ground as if

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.940
he'd been nailed by the Dark Knight.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.500
Nice work, Mr. Extra

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.260
A Man in a Cowboy Hat in Pirates of the Caribbean:
The Curse of the Black Pearl

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.220
In the final scene of Pirates of the Caribbean:
The Curse of the Black Pearl, after reclaiming

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.819
the Black Pearl itself, Johnny Depp's Captain
Jack Sparrow orders his merry band of pirates

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.400
to get to work on the deck.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.090
As they start to spread out in order to get
on with their respective duties, a very out-of-place

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.070
man can be seen in the background wearing
a white T-shirt and a cowboy hat, staring

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.160
out into the ocean.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.079
Basically, a crew member had managed to accidentally
place himself in shot and nobody noticed it

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.609
during the post-production process.

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.830
Shiver me timbers!

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.730
Pac-Man in Tron
The very nature of Tron meant that it was

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.530
begging to be packed with video game references
and Easter eggs - and there were indeed several.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.790
The most prominent allusion to any video game,
however, is definitely Pac-Man.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.710
When one of the movie's antagonists, Sark,
is on the bridge of his command ship surveying

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.880
a map of the system, a tiny Pac-Man can be
seen working his way around the map.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.080
Moreover, if you listen carefully enough,
you can even hear the sound effects from the

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.220
game - namely the noise Pac-Man himself makes
as he makes his way around his maze-like levels.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.970
R2-D2 in Star Trek Into Darkness
Star Trek and Star Wars have long been seen

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.040
as the two mightiest science-fiction franchises
in Hollywood and, as a result, there's something

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.150
of a rivalry between the two franchises and
their fans.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.350
However, in Star Trek Into Darkness, there's
actually something of a minor crossover between

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.350
the two.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.250
In the middle of the Vengeance's attack on
the U.S.S.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.100
Enterprise in the movie, when part of the
iconic starship was badly damaged, Star Wars

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.100
character R2-D2 can be seen being sucked out
of it and propelled into space.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.080
Of course, J.J. Abrams was on directorial
duties for this movie - and he would later

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.780
go on to direct Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.130
Given that he's a fan of both franchises,
that probably explains this.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.220
Captain America's Shield in Iron Man

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.290
Thinking about it now, seeing Captain America's
shield in any Marvel Cinematic Universe movie

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.919
wouldn't be much of a surprise.

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.460
However, when a prototype of it first appeared
on Tony Stark’s work bench in the first

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.270
Iron Man movie back in 2008, it was nothing
short of mind-blowing for comic book fans.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.300
At that time, shared comic book movie universes
didn't even exist and a Captain America movie

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.630
wasn’t even on the cards, so it was really
quite a surprise to see it.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.150
Of course, since then, the prototype appeared
even more prominently in Iron Man 2 and Captain

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.740
America has had three of his own movies, as
well as appearing in two Avengers ensemble

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.680
offerings, but that doesn't alter the fact
that it was strange seeing it at the the time.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.419
