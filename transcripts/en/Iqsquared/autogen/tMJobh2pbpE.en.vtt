00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:26.870
understand that we're all in this
 

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.840

that the internet Percy is any different
 

00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:22.650
that the internet Percy is any different
than a lot of Technology that there have

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:22.660
than a lot of Technology that there have
 

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.530
than a lot of Technology that there have
been introduced and I think that we need

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:25.540
been introduced and I think that we need
 

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:28.770
been introduced and I think that we need
to pay some costs in order to add the

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:28.780
to pay some costs in order to add the

police monitor the situation and trying
 

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:35.270
police monitor the situation and trying
to catch them early on I think that a

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280
to catch them early on I think that a
 

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:39.270
to catch them early on I think that a
lot of people got upset for the NSA

you be on something like that I'm not an
expert on the details but I think that

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:02.530
expert on the details but I think that
 

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:05.850
expert on the details but I think that
it is a bit dangerous to guarantee
