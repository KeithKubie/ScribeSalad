00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:07.568
- I just wanted to give
you a huge thank you

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:11.037
for your support in 2016,
it has helped Khan Academy

00:00:11.037 --> 00:00:14.204
reach over 100 million
learners and has laid

00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:17.292
the foundation for 2017,
where we will further

00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:20.880
develop all of our content
in math, science, humanities,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.498
our adaptive software,
our work around test prep,

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:26.901
our ability to localize
and internationalize

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:30.300
so it can be used by learners
all around the world.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.775
So once again, thank you
for your trust, your support

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:36.546
in myself and the team
here at Khan Academy.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:38.670
We look forward to continuing to deliver

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.337
on that trust for years to come.
