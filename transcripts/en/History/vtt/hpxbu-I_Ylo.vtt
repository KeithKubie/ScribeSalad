00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.960
RICK HARRISON: So
what exactly is this?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.880
CHRIS: This is an original
Nepalese Bira gun.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.710
RICK HARRISON: I can
honestly say I've never

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.830
actually seen one of these.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.830
But it's pretty amazing.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.170
CHRIS: I think there are
probably less than 25 around.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.500
RICK HARRISON: You
can ask my wife

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
and kids, I always
have something to say,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
but I'm a little speechless
at the moment, ah--

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.000
CHRIS: I'm a gun collector.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.250
And I work in the
firearms industry.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.210
And this Bira gun
fell into my lap.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.420
And it was an opportunity
that I just couldn't pass up.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.750
I'm asking for $30,000, which
I think is a fair price.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.880
RICK HARRISON: Does it work?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.750
CHRIS: I've been told it works.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.920
So you haven't fired it?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.880
CHRIS: I have not fired this.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.080
RICK HARRISON: Can I open it up?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.750
CHRIS: Sure.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.380
[music playing]

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.750
RICK HARRISON: I mean
the machining looks nice.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750
And how much do you want for it?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.580
I am asking $30,000 $30,000.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.080
RICK HARRISON:
$30,000, well that

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.920
is a figure I have no idea on.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.920
Let me call up a friend.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.210
Let me get him down here.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.620
I just want him to
look at this thing,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.750
confirm it's old enough
for me to buy it, OK?

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.420
Because if this thing
is post 1899 or newer,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.960
I'm not going to deal in it.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.210
Because then we have to
start doing federal paperwork

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.710
and everything like that.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.580
So if everything checks
out with the date,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.040
can you take this out to
the firing range tomorrow?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.460
CHRIS: We can.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.420
I have a vehicle that
will get this out there.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.960
RICK HARRISON: OK.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.080
Let me go make some phone calls.
I'll be right back.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.420
CHRIS: OK.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.960
RICK HARRISON: This
Bira gun is so rare,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.380
I don't think I'll see
another one in my lifetime.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.750
So it would be great to
see this thing in action.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.880
But I have to be 100%
sure when it was made.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.960
So I called to the guy with all
the answers, Mark Hall-Patton.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.210
MARK HALL-PATTON:
This is nice, a Bira.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.460
I've seen pictures
of this gun before.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.670
But I've never
seen one in person.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.500
To be able to see this one
today is really interesting,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.080
and it's in beautiful condition.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.830
This is an amazing piece.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.620
What's your concerns on this?

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.290
RICK HARRISON: So this was
definitely made in 1896 or '97.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.170
If it's after 1898, I
can't buy it legally.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.330
MARK HALL-PATTON:
Yeah, they were

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.120
only made in 1896 and 1897.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.500
RICK HARRISON: All right, sweet.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.920
MARK HALL-PATTON: Those
are the only two years

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.460
that they were produced.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.080
So they're completely
legal to own.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.170
This fire's only
with each crank.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.750
RICK HARRISON: Cool.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.830
MARK HALL-PATTON: Are you
planning on shooting this?

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.080
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.830
RICK HARRISON:
We're gonna take it

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.500
out to the firing range in the
morning and meet up with Alex.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.670
Wanna come?

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.960
MARK HALL-PATTON:
Yeah, you mind?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.540
RICK HARRISON: Oh,
yeah, no problem.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.290
MARK HALL-PATTON: Oh, I'd
love to see this thing shot.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.540
RICK HARRISON: I will get some
guys to help you load this.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.790
CHRIS: I would greatly
appreciate that.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.210
RICK HARRISON: All
right, no problem.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.540
MARK HALL-PATTON: It
weighs about 1,100 pounds.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.000
RICK HARRISON: So we're
out in the desert.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.040
I got Alex, my gun
expert coming out to tell

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.380
me what this thing is worth.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.040
And we're going to
shoot the Bira gun.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.000
Look at this.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.380
The Bira gun.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.120
The Nepalese, a
man named Gehendra,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.380
was able to smuggle in American
Gardner gun out of England

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.540
into Nepal.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.710
And he attempted
to reverse engineer

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.290
the American Gardner gun.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.380
And it became the Bira gun.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.880
But he made some
radical changes.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.460
I mean the most notable
change is that pan magazine.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.380
Now this pan magazine holds
120 rounds of this ammunition,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.540
which I brought today.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.000
This is a Martini-Henry
ammunition.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.250
Look at the size of that round.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.250
[gunshot]

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.380
It is tremendously unique.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.250
And I have never seen one fire.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.670
RICK HARRISON: Who's first?

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.000
MARK HALL-PATTON:
That's why I'm here.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.250
RICK HARRISON: OK,
you're the Guinea pig.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.670
MARK HALL-PATTON: No.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.080
ALEX: I'm steppin' back.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080
MARK HALL-PATTON: All righty.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.580
[gunfire]

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.540
ALEX: Nice, nice.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.540
[gunfire]

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.670
RICK HARRISON: I've never
loved a gun so much.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.000
MARK HALL-PATTON:
You gotta try it now.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.420
RICK HARRISON: This is sweet.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.380
OK, here we go.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.330
[music playing]

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.000
[gunfire]

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
This is awesome.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.670
[music playing and gunfire]

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.710
ALEX: Nice.
Right on target.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.380
RICK HARRISON: I just think
it's absolutely great.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.210
[gunshot]

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.620
This gun is awesome.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.460
I mean, really, it's that cool.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.960
It looks really,
really steam punk.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.790
It looks really neat.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.290
It looks really weird.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.960
It's a great show piece.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.710
What's it worth?

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.290
ALEX: Well, a few have been sold
over the last couple of years.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.290
The market value for
these is about $27,500.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.960
RICK HARRISON: OK.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.580
So what's your best
price on this thing?

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.620
CHRIS: I'm asking $30,000.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.580
I'll give you 18 grand for it.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.170
How about 26?

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.460
RICK HARRISON: The
fact of the matter

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.620
is I gotta resell this thing.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.790
And $20,000 is
the most I can do.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.000
It's the most I
can pay and still

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.170
make sense, plain and simple.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.830
[music playing]

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.000
I can do $20,000.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.330
RICK HARRISON: All right, sweet.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.920
I am like a kid
in a candy store.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.170
This is like one
of the coolest guns

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.790
I've ever bought in my life.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.500
I just have to test
it a few more times.
