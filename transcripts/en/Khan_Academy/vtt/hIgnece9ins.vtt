00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.940
Let's see if we can use
everything we know about

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.020
differentiation and
concativity, and maximum and

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.760
minimum points, and inflection
points, to actually graph a

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.530
function without using a
graphing calculator.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.650
So let's say our function,
let's say that f of x is equal

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:27.630
to 3x to the fourth minus
4x to the third plus 2.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.850
And of course, you could always
graph a function just by trying

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.370
out a bunch of points, but we
want to really focus on the

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.830
points that are interesting to
us, and then just to get the

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.240
general shape of the function,
especially we want to focus on

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.160
the things that we can take out
from this function using our

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.930
calculus toolkit, or our
derivative toolkit.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.940
So the first thing we probably
want to do, is figure

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.680
out the critical points.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.590
We want to figure out, I'll
write here, critical points.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.520
And just as a refresher of what
critical points means, it's the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.320
points where the derivative
of f of x is 0.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.200
So critical points are f prime
of x is either equal to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.460
0, or it's undefined.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.160
 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.610
This function looks
differentiable everywhere, so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.320
the critical points that we
worried about are probably,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.920
well, I can tell you, they're
definitely just the points

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.580
where f prime of x are
going to be equal to 0.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.620
This derivative, f prime of x,
is going to actually be defined

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.840
over the entire domain.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.010
So let's actually write down
the derivative right now.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.390
So the derivative of this,
f prime of x, this is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.470
pretty straightforward.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.530
The derivative of 3x to the
fourth, 4 times 3 is 12,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.420
12x to the, we'll just
decrement the 4 by 1, 3.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.750
Right?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.910
You just multiply times the
exponent, and then decrease the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.020
new exponent by one, minus 3
times 4 is 12, times x to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.910
the 1 less than 3 is 2.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.990
And then the derivative of
a constant, the slope of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.810
a constant, you could
almost imagine, is zero.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.600
It's not changing.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.350
A constant, by definition,
isn't changing.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.884
So that's f prime of x.

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:11.230
So let's figure out
the critical points.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.750
The critical points are where
this thing is either going to

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.270
be equal to 0, or
it's undefined.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.930
Now, I can look over the entire
domain of real numbers, and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.610
this thing is defined
pretty much anywhere.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.970
I could put any number here,
and it's not going to blow up.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.720
It's going to give me an answer
to what the function is.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.680
So that it's defined
everywhere, so let's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.400
just figure out where
it's equal to 0.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.300
So f prime of x is equal to 0.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.670
So let's solve, which x is,
let's solve-- I don't have

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.130
to rewrite that, I
just wrote that.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.570
Let's solve for when
this is equal to 0.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.350
And I'll do it in
the same color.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:56.980
So 12x to the third minus
12x squared is equal to 0.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.530
And so let's what we
can do to solve this.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.860
We could factor out a 12x.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.830
So if we factor out a 12x, then
this term becomes just x,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.450
and then-- actually, let's
factor out a 12x squared.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.900
We factor out a 12x squared.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.500
If we divide both of these by
12x squared, this term just

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.990
becomes an x, and then minus
12x squared divided by 12x

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.650
squared is just 1,
is equal to 0.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.680
I just rewrote this
top thing like this.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.370
You could go the other way.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.420
If I distributed this 12x
squared times this entire

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.870
quantity, you would get my
derivative right there.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.530
So the reason why did that is
because, to solve for 0, or if

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.530
I want all of the x's that make
this equation equal to 0, I now

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.960
have written it in a form
where I'm multiplying one

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.250
thing by another thing.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.960
And in order for this to be
0, one or both of these

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.480
things must be equal to 0.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.920
So 12x squared are equal to 0,
which means that x is equal

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.750
to 0 will make this
quantity equals 0.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.255
And the other thing that would
make this quantity 0 is if

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:04.100
x minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.050
So x minus 1 is equal to
0 when x is equal to 1.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.510
So these are 2 critical points.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.560
Our 2 critical points are x is
equal to 0 and x is equal to 1.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.190
And remember, those are just
the points where our first

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.050
derivative is equal to 0.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.280
Where the slope is 0.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.560
They might be maximum points,
they might be minimum points,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.400
they might be inflection
points, we don't know.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.850
They might be, you know, if
this was a constant function,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.590
they could just be anything.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.690
So we really can't say a lot
about them just yet, but they

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.300
are points of interest.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.580
I guess that's all we can say.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.340
That they are definitely
points of interest.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.450
But let's keep going, and
let's try to understand the

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.520
concativity, and maybe we can
get a better sense

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.260
of this graph.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.980
So let's figure out the
second derivative.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.540
I'll do that in
this orange color.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.320
So the second derivative of my
function f, let's see, 3 times

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.590
12 is 36x squared minus 24x.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.380
 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.220
So let's see.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.570
Well, there's a couple
of things we can do.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.290
Now that we know the second
derivative, we can answer the

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.890
question, is my graph concave
upwards or downwards at

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.300
either of these points?

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.270
So let's figure out what,
at either of these

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.780
critical points.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.010
And it'll all fit together.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.140
Remember, if it's concave
upwards, then we're

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.340
kind of in a U shape.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.370
If it's concave downwards,
then we're in a kind of

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.850
upside down U shape.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.400
So f prime prime, our second
derivative, at x is equal

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.800
to 0, is equal to what?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.530
It's equal to 36 0 squared
minus 24 times 0.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.350
So that's just 0.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.210
So f prime prime is
just equal to 0.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.120
We're neither concave upwards
nor concave downwards here.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.420
It might be a transition point.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.990
It may not.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.850
If it is a transition point,
then we're dealing with

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.620
an inflection point.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.190
We're not sure yet.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.910
Now let's see what f prime
prime, our second derivative,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.190
evaluated at 1 is.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.580
So that's 36 times 1, let me
write it down, that's equal

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:11.910
to 36 times 1 squared, which
is 36, minus 24 times 1.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.650
So it's 36 minus 24,
so it's equal to 12.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.150
So this is positive, our second
derivative is positive here.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.880
It's equal to 12, which
means our first derivative,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.500
our slope is increasing.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.950
The rate of change of our
slope is positive here.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.945
So at this point right here,
we are concave upwards.

00:06:30.945 --> 00:06:34.020
 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.200
Which tells me that this
is probably a minimum

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.770
point, right?

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.550
The slope is 0 here, but we are
concave upwards at that point.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.880
So that's interesting.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.920
So let's see if there
any other potential

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.780
inflection points here.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.460
We already know that this is a
potential inflection point.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.680
Let me circle it in red.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.640
It's a potential
inflection point.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.830
We don't know whether
our function actually

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.970
transitions at that point.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.310
We'll have to experiment
a little bit to see if

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.130
that's really the case.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.860
But let's see if there any
other inflection points, or

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.140
potential inflection points.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.050
So let's see if this
equals 0 anywhere else.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.790
So 36 x squared minus
24 x is equal to 0.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.240
Let's solve for x.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.780
Let us factor out, well,
we can factor out 12x.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:25.070
12x times 3x, right, 3x
times 12x is 36x squared,

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.560
minus 2, is equal to 0.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.090
So these two are
equivalent expressions.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.520
If you multiply this out,
you'll get this thing up here.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.510
So this thing is going to be
equal to 0, either if 12 x is

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.710
equal to 0, so 12 x is equal
to zero, that gives us

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.240
x is equal to zero.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.880
So at x equals 0,
this thing equals 0.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.850
So the second derivative is 0
there, and we already knew

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.690
that, because we tested
that number out.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.180
Or this thing, if this
expression was 0, then the

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.970
entire second derivative
would also be zero.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:55.740
So let's write that.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:03.090
So 3x minus 2 is equal to 0, 3x
is equal to 2, just adding 2 to

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.280
both sides, 3x is equal to 2/3.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.310
So this is another interesting
point that we haven't really

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.050
hit upon before that might
be an inflection point.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.620
The reason why is it
might be, is because the

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.330
second derivative is
definitely 0 here.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.580
You put 2/3 here,
you're going to get 0.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.830
So what we have to do, is see
whether the second derivative

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:28.050
is positive or negative
on either side of 2/3.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.200
We already have a
sense of that.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.540
I mean, we could try out
a couple of numbers.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:37.210
We know that, you know, if we
say that x is greater than 2/3.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.690
Let me scroll down a
little bit, just so

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.420
we have some space.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:50.410
So let's see what happens
when x is greater than 2/3,

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.580
what is f prime prime?

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.470
What is the second derivative?

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.900
So let's try out a value
that's pretty close, just

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.020
to get a sense of things.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.190
So let me rewrite it. f prime
prime of x is equal to,

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.080
let me write like this.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.550
I mean, I could write like
that, but this might be

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.490
easier to deal with.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:13.030
It's equal to 12x
times 3x minus 2.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.790
So if x is greater than 2/3,
this term right here is

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.270
going to be positive.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.240
That's definitely, any
positive number times 12

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.560
is going to be positive.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.390
But what about this
term, right here?

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.270
3 times 2/3 minus 2
is exactly 0, right?

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.490
That's 2 minus 2.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.270
But anything larger than that,
3 times, you know, if I had

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.670
2.1/3, this is going to
be a positive quantity.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.670
Any value of x greater than
2/3 will make this thing

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.580
right here positive.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.400
Right?

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.670
This thing is also
going to be positive.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.250
So that means that when x
is greater than 2/3, that

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.700
tells us that the second
derivative is positive.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.800
It is greater than 0.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.530
So in our domain, as long
as x is larger than 2/3,

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.110
we are concave upwards.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.200
And we saw that here,
at x is equal to 1.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.840
We were concave upwards.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.240
But what about x
being less than 2/3?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.540
So when x is less than 2/3,
let me write it, let me

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.720
scroll down a little bit.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.170
When x is less than
2/3, what's going on?

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.320
I'll rewrite it.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.500
f prime prime of x,
second derivative,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.000
12x times 3x minus 2.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.020
Well, if we go really far left,
we're going to get a negative

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.230
number here, and this might
be negative.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.020
But if we just go right
below 2/3, when we're still

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.700
in the positive domain.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.250
So if this was like 1.9/3,
which is a mix of a decimal and

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.640
a fraction, or even 1/3, this
thing is still going

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.810
to be positive.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.910
Right below 2/3, this thing is
still going to be positive.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.265
We're going to be multiplying
12 by a positive number.

00:10:50.265 --> 00:10:53.310
But what's going on right here?

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.850
 

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.760
At 2/3, we're exactly 0.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.700
But as you go to anything
less than 2/3, 3

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.230
times 1/3 is only 1.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.820
1 minus 2, you're going
to get negative numbers.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.280
So when x is less than 2/3,
this thing right here is

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.290
going to be negative.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.480
So the second derivative, if x
is less than 2/3, the second

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.370
derivative, right to the left,
right when you go less than

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.270
2/3, the seconds derivative
of x is less than 0.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.690
Now the fact that we have this
transition, from when we're

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:28.115
less than 2/3, we have a
negative second derivative, and

00:11:28.115 --> 00:11:30.340
when we're greater than 2/3, we
have a positive second

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.300
derivative, that tells us that
this, indeed, is an

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.800
inflection point.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.240
That x is equal to 2/3 thirds
is definitely an inflection

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.940
point for our original
function up here.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.180
Now, we have one more candidate
inflection point, and then

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.210
we're ready to graph.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.970
Then, you know, once you do all
the inflection points and the

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.700
max and the minimum, you are
ready to graph the function.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.460
So let's see if x is equal to
0 is an inflection point.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.520
We know that the second
derivative is 0 at 0.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.380
But what happens above and
below the second derivative?

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.670
So let me do our
little test here.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.310
So when x is, let me draw a
line so we don't get confused

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.070
with all of the stuff
that I wrote here.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.400
So when x is greater than
0, what's happening in

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.840
the second derivative?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.850
Remember, the second
derivative was equal to

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.790
12x times 3x minus 2.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.010
I like writing it this way,
because you've kind of

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.830
decomposed it into two linear
expressions, and you could see

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.030
whether each of them are
positive or negative.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.720
So if x is greater than 0, this
thing right here is definitely

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.900
going to be positive, and then
this thing right here, right

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.820
when you go right above x is
greater than 0, so we have to

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.810
make sure to be very close
to this number, right?

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.360
So this number,
let's say it's 0.1.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.070
You're right above 0.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.260
So this isn't going to be true
for all of x greater than 0.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.000
We just want to test exactly
what happens, right when

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.920
we go right above 0.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.020
So this is 0.1.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.080
You would have 0.3, 0.3
minus 2, that would be a

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.520
negative number, right?

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.470
So right as x goes right
above 0, this thing

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.410
right here is negative.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.630
So at x is greater than 0,
you will have your second

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.250
derivative is going
to be less than 0.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.010
You're concave downwards.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.530
Which makes sense, because at
some point, we're going to

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.900
be hitting a transition.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.430
Remember, we were concave
downwards before we

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.250
got to 2/3, right?

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.400
So this is consistent.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.580
From 0 to 2/3, we are concave
downwards, and then at 2/3,

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.540
we become concave upwards.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:38.390
Now let's see what happens when
x is right less than, when x

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.400
is just barely, just
barely less than 0.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.520
So once again, f prime, the
second derivitive of x is equal

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.030
to 12x times 3x minus 2.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.590
Well, right.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.830
If x was minus 0.1 or 0.0001,
no matter what, this thing is

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:57.470
going to be negative, this
expression right here is going

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.410
to be negative, the 12x, right,
you just have some negative

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.910
value here, times 12, is
going to be negative.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.940
And then what's
this going to be?

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.000
Well, 3 times minus 0.1 is
going to be minus 0.3,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.090
minus 2 is minus 2.3.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.250
You're definitely going
to have a negative.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.363
This value right here is going
to be negative, and then when

00:14:15.363 --> 00:14:17.075
you subtract from a negative,
it's definitely going

00:14:17.075 --> 00:14:18.120
to be negative.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.270
So that is also going
to be negative.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.090
But if you multiply a negative
times a negative, you're

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.290
going to get a positive.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.660
So actually, right below x
is less than 0, the second

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.455
derivative is positive.

00:14:28.455 --> 00:14:32.420
 

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.140
Now, this all might have been a
little bit confusing, but we

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.120
should now have the payoff.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.390
We now have the payoff.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.050
We have all of the
interesting things going on.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:46.060
We know that at x is equal to
1, we know that at x is equal

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.690
to 1, let me write
it over here.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:55.106
We've figured out at x is
equal to 1, the slope is 0.

00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:59.840
So f prime prime is, sorry,
let me write this way.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.500
I should have said, we
know that the slope is 0.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.670
Slope is equal to 0.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.020
And we figured that out because
the first derivative was 0.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.000
This was a critical point.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.860
And we know that we're dealing
with, the function is concave

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.860
upwards at this point.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.740
And that tells us that this is
going to be a minimum point.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.100
 

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.520
And we should actually get
the coordinates so we

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.390
can actually graph it.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:24.980
That was the whole
point of this video.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.600
So f of 1 is equal to what?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.510
f of 1, let's go back to our
original function, is 3 times

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:38.190
1, right, 1 to the fourth is
just 1, 3 times 1 minus

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.810
4 plus 2, right?

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:47.510
So it's 3 times 1 minus 4 times
1, which is minus 1, plus 2,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.930
well, that's just a positive 1.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.920
So f of 1 is one.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.420
And then we know at x is equal
to 0, we also figured out that

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.260
the slope is equal to 0.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.020
But we figured out that this
was an inflection point, right?

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.040
The concativity switches
before and after.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.510
So this is an inflection point.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.080
 

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.700
And we are concave below
0, so when x is less

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.535
than 0, we are upwards.

00:16:17.535 --> 00:16:20.040
 

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.180
Our second derivative
is positive.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.250
And when x is it greater
than 0, we are downwards.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.420
We're concave downwards.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.400
Right above, not for all
of the [? domain ?]

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.760
x and 0, just right
above 0, downwards.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.520
And then what is f of 0,
just so we know, because we

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.660
want to graph that point?

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.960
f of 0.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.620
See, f of 0, this is easy.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.380
3 times 0 minus 4 times 0
plus 2, that's just 2.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.080
f of 0 is 2.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.630
And then finally we got the
point, x is equal to 2/3.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.270
 

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.420
Let me do that in
another color.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.970
We had the point x
is equal to 2/3.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.670
We figured out that this
was an inflection point.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.670
The slope definitely isn't 0
there, because it wasn't one

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.740
of the critical points.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.390
And we know that
we are downwards.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.210
We know that when x is less
than 2/3, or right less than

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.100
2/3, we are concave downwards.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.120
And when x is greater than 2/3,
we saw it up here, when x was

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.810
greater than 2/3, right up
here, we were concave upwards.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.040
The second derivative
was positive.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.885
We were upwards.

00:17:35.885 --> 00:17:38.460
 

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.790
Now we could actually figure
out, what's f of 2/3?

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.420
That's actually a little
bit complicated.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.530
We don't even have to
figure that out, I

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.320
don't think, to graph.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.180
I think we could do a pretty
good job of graphing it just

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.270
with what we know right now.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.370
So that's our take aways.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.740
Let me do a rough graph.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.340
Let's see.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.840
So let me do my axes,
just like that.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.200
So we're going to want to
graph the point 0, 2.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.120
So let's say that
the point, 0, 2.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.570
So this is x is equal to
0, and we go up, 1, 2.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.610
So this is the point 0, 2.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.640
Maybe I'll do it in that
color, the color I was

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.480
using, so that's this color.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.050
So that's that
point right there.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.650
Then we have the point x,
we have f of 1, which is

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.930
the point 1, 1, right?

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.090
So this point right here.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.100
 

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.150
So that's the point 1, 1.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.250
This was the point 0, 2.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.260
And then we have x is equal
to 2/3, which is our

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:36.940
inflection point.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.730
So when x is 2/3, we
don't know exactly what

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.110
number f of 2/3 is.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.350
Maybe here someplace.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.890
Let's say f of 2/3
is right there.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.840
So that's the point, 2/3, and
then wherever f of 2/3 is.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.960
It looks like it's going
to be 1 point something.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.280
f of 2/3.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.840
You could calculate it, if
you like, you just have

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.500
to substitute back
in the function.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.440
But we're ready to
graph this thing.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.100
So we know that at x is
equal to 1, the slope is 0.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.110
We know that the slope is 0.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.750
It's flat here.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.520
We know it's concave upwards.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.070
So we're dealing, it looks
like this, looks like

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.030
that over that interval.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.480
We're concave upwards.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.440
And we know we're concave
upwards from x is equal

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.480
to 2/3 and on, right?

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.690
Let me do it in that color.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.310
We knew x equals 2/3 and
on, we're concave upwards.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.670
And that's why I was able
to draw this U-shape.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.390
Now we know that when x is less
than 2/3 and greater than

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.760
0, we're concave downwards.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.740
So the graph would look
something like this,

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.270
over this interval.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.890
We'll be concave downwards.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.820
Let me draw it nicely.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.080
Over this interval, the
slope is decreasing.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.950
And you could see it, if you
keep drawing tangent lines.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.660
It's flattish there, it gets
negative, more negative, more

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.490
negative, until the inflection
point, and then it starts

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.330
increasing again, because we
go back to concave upwards.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.600
And then finally, the last
interval is below 0, and we

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.280
know below 0, when x is less
than 0, we're concave upwards.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.110
So the graph looks like this.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.820
The graph looks like that.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.490
And we also know that x is
equal to 0 was a critical

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.620
point, the slope of 0.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.820
So the graph is actually
flat right there, too.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.880
So this is an inflection point
where the slope was also 0.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.260
So this is our final graph.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.060
We're done.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.550
After all that work, we were
able to use our calculus

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.590
skills, and our knowledge of
inflection points, and

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.600
concativity, and transitions
in concativity, to

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.510
actually graph this fairly
hairy-looking graph.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.395
But this should be kind of what
it looks like, if you graph

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.100
it on your calculator.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:30.866
