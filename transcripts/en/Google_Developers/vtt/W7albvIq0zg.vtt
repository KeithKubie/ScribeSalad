MARTIN OMANDER: Hello.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.830
My name is Martin Omander.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.290
And I welcome you to "Google
Root Access," the show where

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.170
startups and investors
share their experiences

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.880
and lessons they've learned.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.140
Today, I'm joined by Nicolai
Wadstrom from the investor

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.670
BootstrapLabs.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.330
Nicolai, would you tell us
a bit about BootstrapLabs?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.650
NICOLAI WADSTROM: So we are
a global venture investment

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.150
company, and we try to
find top talented founders

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.550
from around the
world, invest in them,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.770
and help them build
global companies.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.270
What makes us a
little bit different

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.026
is that we don't really
care where they're from,

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:38.980
if they're from Silicon
Valley or outside.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.355
And the majority
of our deal flow

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:42.760
actually comes from
outside of Silicon Valley.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.090
But we always bring part
of a team to Silicon Valley

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.780
to benefit from this fantastic
ecosystem to build companies.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.305
But they usually stay
and build-- at the end,

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:56.930
they usually have more employees
where they originally started.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.900
So we're trying
to keep that hub.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.870
One good example of a
past portfolio company

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.560
is a company called Prezi,
which started in Budapest,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.040
in Hungary, about
five years ago.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.438
So they've grown from
six people back then

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:16.889
to 270 something,
I think, today.

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:18.430
MARTIN OMANDER: It's
a great product.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.230
I've used it.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.650
NICOLAI WADSTROM: Yeah.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.290
I love it.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.190
It's amazing.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.700
And that's the exciting thing.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.705
People get so excited
about the product itself.

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:26.410
It sells itself, in a sense.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.620
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.270
So Nicolai, both you
and I have a past

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.110
as programmers and
chasing semicolons

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.140
and such, which is great fun.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.400
But some people say that
technology doesn't really

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.900
matter.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.020
All that matters is
the idea or the team.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.420
Others say the
technology is very

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.730
important for what platform
or technology a startup picks.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.030
When you look at
investments, do you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.102
look at the technology
a startup's built on?

00:01:56.102 --> 00:01:57.310
NICOLAI WADSTROM: Absolutely.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.530
I think it's super important.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.632
But the core thing
is really, really,

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:02.090
of course, the team
and the ability

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.530
to execute at the
end of the day.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.460
So because we invest early on
in a post-accelerate or seed

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.240
stage, having a technology
background for me

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.860
is very helpful to understand
what they're building,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.330
how competitive the opportunity
is, and all these things.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.060
But looking at technology early
on and how they go about it

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.030
is really crucial
for us to understand

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.390
how that team
thinks, and how they

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.910
try to use that as
an advantage to move

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.210
faster and quicker,
figure things out.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.940
So as a team, it's
the most important.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.365
But technology--
down the line, it

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:37.806
becomes really,
really crucial how

00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:39.180
they apply
technology, of course.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.263
MARTIN OMANDER: How they
apply technology, got it.

00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:42.600
Yeah, got it.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.332
So do you still program
any, by the way?

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:46.290
NICOLAI WADSTROM: I do.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.780
I try to keep pretty brilliant.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.970
If I leave my Swedish
culture behind,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.524
I'm actually damn good still.

00:02:54.524 --> 00:02:55.190
I'm pretty good.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.134
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, good, great.

00:02:57.134 --> 00:02:59.550
I try to program a little every
now and then as well, just

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.592
to keep the skills sharp.

00:03:00.592 --> 00:03:02.758
NICOLAI WADSTROM: Some real
work every now and then.

00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:05.490
MARTIN OMANDER: Some
real work, there we go.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.640
So what are your criteria for
determining if a technology

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.660
that a startup has is
interesting right now,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.260
or if it isn't?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.460
NICOLAI WADSTROM: Well, so
looking at new innovation

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.590
ideas-- and yes,
it's about ideas.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.500
But we invest in technology.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.910
So being able to
apply technology

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.410
at the end of the day that has
impact and great efficiencies

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.660
is really important.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.660
Vetting criteria we look at--
let's step back a second,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.860
so looking at areas where
we go in and invest,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.540
and deciding if whatever
these founders are very

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.140
passionate about
and trying to build

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.820
is relevant and interesting.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.300
I try to look at the bigger
technology landscape.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.935
It becomes-- I build software.

00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:55.330
It becomes like an architecture
map of the value chain

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.250
from one end to another where
value is being received.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.370
And some of these pieces of
technology are commoditized.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.970
And that's an
advantage, because that

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.230
means you can focus on
building value on top.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.290
Like Clayton Christensen says,
when it becomes commoditized,

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.197
the value and innovation
is above and below, right?

00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:17.450
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, right.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.769
NICOLAI WADSTROM: So
it's the same thinking.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:19.649
So look at pieces.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:24.280
And there's lots of things
through open source software

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.160
libraries that are
readily available,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.590
and things like that,
that you can use, and then

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.420
iterate much quicker
on top of that.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.270
There are services like
the Google App Engine

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.900
that allows you to focus
maybe on the functionality

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.080
of your app that's
closer to where you add

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.280
value on your mobile phone,
versus a lot of infrastructure

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.630
on the back end to scale.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.660
And early on, this becomes
really even more important.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.740
Because when you iterate and try
to find a product market where

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.870
it's really relevant or
where people even care about,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.020
the quicker you can move, the
better-- how you get to build

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.756
data points and validate
those assumptions.

00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:08.130
MARTIN OMANDER:
Ah, right, I see.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.940
So that actually leads me
to the next question, which

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.550
is, some people say,
build quick and dirty.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.360
You're going to
throw it away anyway.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.700
And others say, no.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.820
You're actually going to
build a business on this

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.528
and make revenue.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:24.460
You need to build something
that works snf scales.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.640
I imagine the startups
that you invest in,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.210
you give them advice on this.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.132
What kind of advice
do you give them?

00:05:31.132 --> 00:05:33.340
NICOLAI WADSTROM: Yeah, so
it's a very good question.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.006
Because somebody comes
out and will say,

00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:37.120
should I do this
quick and dirty,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.654
or should I build
a stable platform?

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:40.320
And the CEO says,
build quick and dirty.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.970
And the CEO says, no, no, no.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.980
It needs to be a
stable platform so we

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.310
can-- at the end of the
day, our advice is really,

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.730
this changes over time.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.290
A startup goes through phases
and metamorphoses between them.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.840
Early on, it's
really, really crucial

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.400
just to find what
people care about.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.570
So you build
quickly, push it out,

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.190
get data points, what
people really care about,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.540
assumptions to turn
into data points.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.540
And you measure, you learn,
and you iterate that way.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.730
Once you figure those things
out, a lot of mechanics

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.740
change-- how we
apply technology,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.520
lots of other pieces
of the startup,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.500
how you scale ten users.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.745
And there's a lot of
growth hacking aspects.

00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:22.995
But if you talk about the
technology, all of a sudden,

00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:26.590
you need to be able to
sustain heavy load, growth,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.920
and all these things.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.240
So a proper technology
platform that can handle that

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.660
becomes really important
really quickly.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.030
And a lot of startups,
that is a hard job.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.410
Because from iterating quickly,
you're hacking things together

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.970
to test.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.520
And all of a sudden,
it takes off.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.760
So what do you do?

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.280
So again, I think there's a
lot of ready-made commodity

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.910
solutions that you don't
need to build yourself

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.160
that you can rely on to
quickly transition into that.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.350
And I like the
mix of App Engine,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.690
the platform as a service.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.360
Because you remove
a lot of complexity

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.820
on storing massive amounts of
data and retrieving it quickly,

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.220
the scale out of your web
servers, and all that.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.120
But for other pieces,
you might need

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.170
to really manage
parts of these things.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.540
For heavy processing and
analytics and all these things,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.330
you might need to build
an infrastructure.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.000
Using infrastructure
services is what everybody

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.900
of our startups use.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.420
They don't have
their own service.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.640
Well, there's one exception.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.390
But everybody else used
really an infrastructure

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.760
as a service, Google
Compute Engine,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.460
for example, to assemble bricks
to get it quickly up and down,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.270
and scale up when you
need lots of processing,

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.480
and scale down when you
don't, and things like that.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.920
MARTIN OMANDER: So when do you
advise startups to use platform

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.810
as a service, as
Google App Engine,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.270
versus infrastructure
as a service,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.319
like Google Compute Engine?

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.110
NICOLAI WADSTROM: So
it comes down to that.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.180
If most of the value add of
the product they're building

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.420
and they're iterating on is on
the front end in a mobile app

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.660
or such, I think the
App Engine is perfect.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.340
Because you can build
an-- and I think

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.860
it's much better
than things like Path

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.850
where you can't really
program the back end.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.434
But an app engine,
Google App Engine,

00:08:18.434 --> 00:08:20.100
you still will deploy
your applications.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.300
And you can still build
a lot of logic and value

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.950
add on the back end, which
is important, in my view,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.820
to differentiate.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.820
But you take away some of the
scaling issues and all those,

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.340
you can be really
focused on that value.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.159
On the other hand,
again, let's say

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.725
you have massive
amounts of data where

00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:40.610
you need to do
customized analytics

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.740
and analyze that data.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.280
You usually need to
build some Hadoop cluster

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.060
and some processing,
and customize

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.450
a lot of things
that happen on top.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.740
Then I would recommend
to use the Google Compute

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.254
Engine for that.

00:08:56.254 --> 00:08:57.420
MARTIN OMANDER: Interesting.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.160
Well, thank you
very much, Nicolai,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.440
for your time in coming
on here and telling us

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.460
about and sharing
your experiences.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.710
NICOLAI WADSTROM: Of course.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.501
MARTIN OMANDER: We hope
you found something

00:09:06.501 --> 00:09:08.430
you can use in your startup.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.730
Your input matters.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.340
Please leave your
comments below.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.110
We read everything you write.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.380
To learn how Google
can help your startup,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.670
go to
developers.google.com/startups.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.890
If you would like to
be a guest on the show,

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.820
go to bit.ly/applyrootaccess.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.150
That's it for now.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.897
See you next time.
