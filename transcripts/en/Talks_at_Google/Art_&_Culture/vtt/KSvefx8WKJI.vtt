NICK: To kick us off, the
first thing we're going to do

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.210
is actually watch a quick
video about the Kenny Aronoff

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.280
experience before
Kenny comes up here.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.208
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:24.000
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.980
- To have him performing
right in front of you, along

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.200
with being a
motivational speaker,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.360
is such a unique combination.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.095
It was absolutely remarkable.

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:37.390
- And I realized there
were seven things--

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.220
I narrowed it down to seven--

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.080
that have made me successful--

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.349
the same seven ways that I
have an extraordinary life

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:46.390
in the music business,
which is so unpredictable,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.880
for over 3 and 1/2 decades.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.410
- The life principles--

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.990
you don't get to his level
without the education

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.760
and the dedication
and the hard work.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.570
- I motivate my audiences
from my experiences playing

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.540
with people like Sting, Elton
John, people like Buddy Guy,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.850
Ray Charles, Avril
Lavigne, Michelle Branch.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.680
Every experience I have, it
seems like a life-changing

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.080
experience--

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.320
made me grow, made me
become who I am today,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.485
has helped me become successful.

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:18.670
We're going to play a bunch
of songs from some artists

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.212
that I've recorded
through the last 35 years.

00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:22.670
I'm going to tell
you some stories.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.025
And then I want to share with
you how I became successful

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:31.735
and have stayed successful
in the music business, which

00:01:31.735 --> 00:01:34.190
is one of the most difficult
businesses in the world,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.850
for 35 years.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.410
And what I tell you will
transfer into anything

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.597
you do in life.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.560
NICK: So Kenny has
drummed on over 60

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.710
Grammy-nominated or awarded
recordings, representing over

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.980
$300 million in
sales, with over 1,300

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.870
that went gold,
platinum, or diamond.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.830
"Rolling Stone" cited him as
one of the top 100 drummers

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.760
of all time.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.732
He's the author of "Sex, Drums,
Rock and Roll," Kenny Aronoff.

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:22.403
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:22.403 --> 00:02:23.444
KENNY ARONOFF: Hey, Nick.

00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:25.390
Thank you.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.920
Awesome.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.090
NICK: So Kenny, let's
start from the beginning.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.540
How did a kid from
rural Massachusetts

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.379
become one of the most
famous drummers of all time?

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.920
KENNY ARONOFF: Well, I was just
a little kid playing outside,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.880
because there was nothing
to watch on TV back in 1801.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.810
Well-- and so there was
nothing to watch on--

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.110
we had a little black RCA
TV set with the rabbit ears.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.970
And so there was
nothing to watch.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.185
So we played outside.

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:56.760
And one day, my mom yelled at my
brother and me to come inside.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.785
And I thought I was in trouble.

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:00.630
I came in like, uh-oh.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.370
And the Beatles were on TV
at the "Ed Sullivan Show."

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.570
And I looked at that.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.510
And naively, as an
11-year-old kid,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.600
I just said, Mom, I want to be
in the Beatles, call them up.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.410
And then I saw the drum set.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.310
And Ringo's playing.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.770
And I'm like, that is so cool.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.440
And being a hyper kid, I
related to what Ringo was doing.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.270
I said, Mom, I want a drum set.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.990
Silence again.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.830
And so she obviously
didn't call the Beatles up.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.130
And so I started my own band.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.810
When I'm passionate
about something,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.170
"no" is not an option.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.740
So I started my own band
called the Alley Cats.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.660
I was gardening
at $0.50 an hour.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.050
And I saved up enough money
for a snare drum and a cymbal

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.540
and started my own band
and played Beatles music.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.630
And that's how I got started.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.480
But the amazing thing
about that story,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.430
in the light of dreams come
true, is 50 years later,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.090
I'm playing with Paul and
Ringo on a CBS special--

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.140
a tribute to the Beatles
for that "Ed Sullivan Show."

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.010
So really, my story is,
how did a little kid who

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.790
saw the Beatles at 11
and 50 years later, I'm

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.890
playing with them.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.490
You had to be relevant.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.660
And you had to be happening
and still in the game.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.269
I guess that's the end
of the interview, right?

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:21.779
We're done.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.869
Any questions.

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:26.160
NICK: Now you didn't have
immediate success right away.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.350
So talk me through the
time at Tanglewood.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.642
I think you didn't get in
on your first three tries.

00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:32.100
And it was the
fourth time that you

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.310
got into Tanglewood, which is
the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.590
KENNY ARONOFF: Well, my
education went like this.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.920
When I was young,
rock and roll was new.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.920
So there was no
mentors or a teacher

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.530
to teach me how to
play rock drums.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.320
But the Boston Symphony
Orchestra was three miles away

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.910
from my house in Western Mass.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.150
So I don't know.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.032
Somebody told me about this
percussionist, Arthur Press,

00:04:57.032 --> 00:04:58.740
who was in the Boston
Symphony Orchestra.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.840
So I started studying with him.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.060
And he maybe played tympani and
mallets and not rock and roll.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.690
But I had nowhere to--

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.750
I wanted to become educated.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.040
I wanted to learn more.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.990
Taught me how to
read and theory--

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.500
and in my family, we
all went to college.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.520
So when it came time to, what's
your major going to be, I went,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.750
music.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.950
That was like the most logical.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.740
So I started to
apply to colleges.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.830
And I got into the
University of Massachusetts.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.560
And I was not in the high
school band, the marching band.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.540
I had my own rock band.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.220
I didn't want to
listen to squeaky

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.970
clarinets or
out-of-tune violins.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.410
I was playing in clubs when I
was 13, playing Led Zeppelin.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.720
Why would I want to do that?

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.520
But I was behind when it
was time to go to college.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.000
And I got into UMass.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.540
And the reason why I got in,
the teacher was blown away by--

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.815
part of the audition is
they put some music up

00:06:04.815 --> 00:06:05.940
you've never played before.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.356
And you're supposed
to sight read.

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:09.180
And I'd never even
played a marimba before.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.960
And I'm trying to
play this marimba,

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.820
because I had a set of vibes
at home that I practiced on.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.800
I'm trying to sight read.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.720
I missed most the notes.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.480
And the teacher
went, oh, um, well--

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.760
I went, no, I'm going
to try it again.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.630
I think I stayed there
for five minutes,

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.671
trying to learn this piece
right in front of him.

00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:31.220
And he went, I'm going to
enjoy teaching this guy,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.900
because this guy works hard.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.040
He's trying.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.900
He really wants to make it.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.180
So I got into UMass.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.630
And then during that year, even
though I wasn't the greatest,

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.510
my eyes were always
forward-thinking.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.350
I got to be with the best
school with the best musicians.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.470
Up the road about five hours
was Eastman School of Music.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.330
I applied there to transfer.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.670
Got in, but there was no room
for me as a transfer student.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.900
And there was this
hot cellist that

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.320
was a junior at UMass
who said something

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.180
about going to Aspen
School of Music,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.110
run by Juilliard--
summer program.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.930
I went, ooh, I got to go.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.810
So I auditioned.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.050
And the audition was play
three out of four categories,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.150
like snare drum,
tympani, marimba,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.325
and multiple percussion.

00:07:18.325 --> 00:07:20.750
Well, I made a tape
of all four, thinking

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.580
I'd get some extra credit.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.390
I don't get in.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.562
I don't get in.

00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:26.270
Last day of school,
I'm going to go home,

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.478
study with the percussionist
from the Boston Symphony

00:07:28.478 --> 00:07:29.110
Orchestra.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.170
I got a rock band.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.160
And as I was leaving school,
I went, oh, I forgot my--

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.500
I should check my mail.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.520
I go there.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.200
Looks like there's a check.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.000
And I open it up.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.660
And it's, you've been
accepted to Aspen.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.090
Two weeks later, I'm in Aspen.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.100
Worst percussionist
there-- by the way,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.012
the cellist never showed up.

00:07:49.012 --> 00:07:50.720
But I was the worst
percussionist there--

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.560
one of my most humiliating,
degrading experiences

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.290
in my life.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.970
I got in, but I was the worst.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:04.270
But if you look at the picture
that was taken of all of us,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.890
I may have been the worst,
but I became the most famous

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.500
and probably the most
successful out of that group,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.830
from just pounding it
in like a running back.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.410
I've just been that running
back that just keeps--

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.180
all I see is the end zone.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.040
And I have a line
that's like, I'll never

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.960
be as great as I
want to be, but I'm

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.180
willing to spend the
rest of my life trying

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.899
to be as great as I can be.

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:25.940
It's like a running back.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.517
The greatest running back--

00:08:27.517 --> 00:08:29.100
you name me the
greatest running back,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.430
and he definitely doesn't
score a touchdown every time

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.780
he gets the ball, does he?

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.690
He doesn't.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.960
But he's constantly,
play by play, game

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.650
by game, season by season,
looking at that end zone.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.169
And that's how you
become successful.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.980
So at that music
school was a teacher,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.090
who taught at Indiana
University School of Music,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:53.240
which was rated number one in
the country in classical music.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.690
It was Indiana
University, Juilliard,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.590
which ran Aspen, and Eastman,
which I had an audition for.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.320
So I'm like a bottom
feeder at UMass,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.354
but I was going for the top.

00:09:05.354 --> 00:09:06.770
And I get into
Indiana University.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.010
The teacher up there that
taught-- very, very demanding,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.310
very strict audition.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.351
That school is kind of like
being in the Navy SEALs.

00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:15.600
They're going to weed you out.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.510
If you get in, you have to
prove yourself constantly,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.910
because that's how they
keep their standards high.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.050
They always have
the best students.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.810
And I saw many people
get washed out.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.620
Anyway, I did four years there.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.140
Back to Tanglewood--
so Tanglewood

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.510
had this very elite,
number one student

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.290
orchestra in the country.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.160
So I auditioned in I
think my first year

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.690
at Indiana University.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.840
Horrible audition--
I don't get in.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.940
Second year, I'm better.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.200
I don't get in.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.772
Third year, I don't get in.

00:09:51.772 --> 00:09:53.230
It's like strike
three, you're out.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.610
And I'm like, no.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.320
Once again, I was passionate.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.330
I got to get into this thing.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:58.900
I got to.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.820
I go back a fourth time.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.680
I get in.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.530
I get in.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.070
I work with Leonard Bernstein,
Aaron Copland, Arthur Fiedler,

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.790
[INAUDIBLE],, mentored by the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.900
You are well-groomed.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.900
And when I graduated
college, I'd

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.980
gotten to the Jerusalem Symphony
Orchestra and Quito, Ecuador

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.510
Symphony Orchestra.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.760
And not to jump
ahead, but that was

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.970
the end of my formal education
pretty much, as far as

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.020
orchestral stuff.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.210
NICK: Let's jump ahead,
because Bloomington

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.760
and being at Indiana
ultimately led

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.795
to you meeting John Mellencamp.

00:10:35.795 --> 00:10:36.670
KENNY ARONOFF: Right.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.240
So when I was at school,
I didn't meet John.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.560
What I did was--

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.040
I talk about seven ways to
be successful in your life

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.580
and career.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.940
And one of them is
to create a plan,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.140
execute the plan to
reach your goals.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.490
A lot of people have ideas, but
they don't know how to execute.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.470
You have to take action.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.910
Zero equals zero.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.050
You do nothing, you get nothing.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.820
So if you're waiting for
something to pop out of the sky

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.210
by just sitting on
your couch watching TV,

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.449
ain't going to happen.

00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:09.490
It's not going to happen.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.330
I made my career.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.580
I made it happen.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.980
And so when I got into the
Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.660
my passion to be
in the Beatles was

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.019
so strong I went back
to creating a new plan,

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:25.810
because I had executed
my first plan, which

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:26.980
I call the American dream.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.360
You go to college.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.130
You learn a trade.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.470
And then when you
get out of college,

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.962
you get a job in the
field that you studied.

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:35.920
That's what my dad did.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.994
That's what my mom did.

00:11:36.994 --> 00:11:38.410
That's what this
country was built

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:45.110
on-- that type of thing and
hard work and self-discipline.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.670
So my passion to
be in the Beatles

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.590
was so strong, what do I do?

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.330
I go back and live
at my parents' house,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.620
humbly, in Western Mass and
start studying with a drum set

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.370
teacher in New York, a
drum set teacher in Boston,

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.160
practicing eight hours a
day, seven days a week.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.460
And I should add that when
I graduated high school--

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.560
the day I graduated
high school, because I

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.860
was so afraid I was going to be
behind in the classical world,

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.830
I started practicing eight
hours a day, seven days a week,

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.510
relentlessly.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.120
Everybody's partying
before they go to college.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.110
Not me.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.790
And not to get off track, but
I have a new book I'm writing.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.640
And it's like the why would
I do such a thing like that?

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.150
What motivates me
to be what I am?

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.950
And I'll tell you what it is and
what it was back then-- fear.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.730
Fear to fail.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.080
Failure, to me, was like dying.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.540
It's like, I refuse
to die on the vine.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.800
That's my phrase.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.510
I live my life loud.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.100
I go after stuff.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.350
Yeah, man, 4:00 in
the morning-- you

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.030
know that feeling when
you're like, oh, my god,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.930
what am I doing?

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.090
Oh, this isn't working--

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.850
or you feel that
insecure feeling.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.290
Well, you know at that
hour, the dopamine,

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.420
serotonin levels are down.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.740
The coffee is gone.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.570
And you're taking on too much.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.110
And now what I do in those
moments is go, wait a minute,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.530
every time you
persevere, you succeed.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.560
It will happen.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.270
It's not if.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.440
It's when.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.010
And that's my mentality.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.160
And I talk myself off
a ledge all the time.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.740
And I say, just chill, man,
you're going to get this.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.610
It may take a little bit longer.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.620
So I'm back at home,
practicing, going, oh, my god,

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.600
what am I doing?

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.180
I could have been in the
Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.840
with a bow tie,
playing Beethoven

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.070
instead of rock and roll.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.700
So I'm practicing,
practicing, practicing.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.340
Finally, a bunch of
guys from Indiana

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.780
talk me into moving to Indiana.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.630
We're going to
get a record deal,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.630
make records, and
tour like the Beatles.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.520
I see the business model.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.040
Go there, get a band
house, seven guys in house.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.730
We got an investor
that gave us $30,000--

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.570
back then, was a lot of money--
got a truck, PA, lights.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.540
We got a whole business plan.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.200
Three years later, and I'm
living in, by the way--

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.260
I think my rent was $62 a month.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.000
I lived on an outdoor porch
converted into a room.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.700
I had a little bed with
an electric blanket,

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:26.760
drum set, stereo, little
teeny closet for clothes.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.020
That was it.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.950
But I was happy, man.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.230
I was going to be
in the Beatles,

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.790
or my version of the Beatles.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.160
After three years,
it didn't happen.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.440
I'm going to move back to
New York, create a new plan,

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.850
execute.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.360
And then I hear about
this Johnny Cougar guy.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.140
And some girl tells me as
I'm leaving a restaurant

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.250
to fly to LA actually to
audition for Lou Rawls,

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.400
that this Johnny Cougar
guy just fired his drummer.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.530
Well, I go right
to a pay phone--

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.740
no cell phones-- with a
quarter, put it in, call up

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.180
the guitar player, because
I'm thinking, wait a minute,

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.490
this guy's on this new
TV show called MTV.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.260
And I've seen him,
and he's touring.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.410
He's opening up for Kiss.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.270
And wait a minute,
what am I thinking?

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.200
This is what I
always wanted to do,

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.140
and it's right here in
Bloomington-- my backyard.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.810
So I'm on the phone
going, I want this.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.430
And the guitar
player says, well,

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.510
call back in a couple
weeks, we just got off tour.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.060
I go to LA, didn't get the Lou
Rawls gig, which was probably

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.640
very appropriate,
come back, and now I'm

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.780
like foaming at the mouth.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.550
I got to do this.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.650
And they tell me
they'll audition.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:38.850
John has heard about me
being a local big guy

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.070
and for my hard work.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.214
Now I earned the right
to have an audition.

00:15:44.214 --> 00:15:44.880
That's my point.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.890
I earned it.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.230
So what do I do?

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.300
Back to my eight hours a day--

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.040
they said, be familiar
with the record.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.660
Be familiar?

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.760
Does that mean drink some
beer and listen to the songs,

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.260
go, yeah, man, that's cool?

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.740
I wrote every single note
out, memorized every song.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.200
I'd walk out of the room and
go, I need a lover, [DRUMMING],,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.260
walk out, and say--

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.100
I'd just keep drilling myself.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.290
Play this song, play
those two songs--

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.110
I was so ready when I walked in.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.542
When I got to the audition--

00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:20.250
I almost didn't even
get to the audition,

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.420
because I had this
old, beat-up car.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.550
John's looking at it.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.000
It's leaking oil
on his driveway.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.190
I was not dressed cool
like I am right now.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.360
I was not cool.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.390
I had a drum set the size
of Neil Peart from Rush.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.040
I didn't know John wanted that
Ringo Starr, Charlie Watts, one

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.465
rag tom, one floor tom.

00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:42.090
And he sees it.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.760
And I go up to him,
hey, Ken Aronoff.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.540
He goes, John Mellencamp,
turns around and walks away.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.080
I'm like, whoa, OK.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.149
So I set up my
big, huge drum set.

00:16:54.149 --> 00:16:55.940
And they say, do you
know any of the songs?

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.950
I went, oh, yeah I'm
familiar-- "familiar."

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.980
I'm ready to dive in the pool.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.970
We play two songs.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.450
I crush everything.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.079
I think I broke cymbals, sticks.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.312
And John goes upstairs and
he yells at Mike, Mike,

00:17:10.312 --> 00:17:12.770
get up here.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.650
And I'm packing up.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.260
And I'm nervous, because
I really want this bad.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.619
Mike comes down.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:24.300
He smiles at me, shakes my
hand, goes, welcome to hell.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.160
I went, yay, ooh.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.860
And I went, what does
he mean by "hell"?

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:37.870
Well, what that meant was John
was a very intense boss, which

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:38.650
I understand.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.110
I give him credit for it.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.740
He grew up with the
name John Mellencamp.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.040
And when he got his record
deal, they changed his name

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.690
to Johnny Cougar.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.330
Now he's a proud man
from the Midwest.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.350
And his uncles and his
grandfather and parents

00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:00.490
didn't want John Mellencamp
to come home as Johnny Cougar.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.350
I'm just imagining, you know?

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.922
What's wrong with your name?

00:18:03.922 --> 00:18:05.380
And that's basically
what John said

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.810
to the manager, who created
the name for David Bowie, Ziggy

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:11.680
Stardust.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.596
That was kind of an "in"
thing back then where

00:18:13.596 --> 00:18:14.950
they would create stage names.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.680
Well, John took it,
because that's all he had.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.230
He didn't have any bargaining.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.832
But he loses his record deal.

00:18:21.832 --> 00:18:24.040
And he went back to working
for the telephone company

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.640
back in Seymour, Indiana.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.010
That was very humiliating.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.630
Now he's got
another record deal.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.690
This guy did not want
to lose his record deal.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.080
He did not want to go back
to climbing telephone poles.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.800
So me, I was just glad
to be out of the clubs

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.440
and maybe get on MTV
and make a record.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.840
But John was way beyond that.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.560
He realized what he could lose.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.790
NICK: So you recorded a ton
of famous songs with John.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.700
But one in particular-- the
famous drum solo that comes

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.990
in "Jack and Diane"--

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.154
how did that come about?

00:18:59.154 --> 00:19:01.570
Because you don't have much
time to work on that, correct?

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:01.830
KENNY ARONOFF: Right.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.329
OK.

00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:05.370
First of all, "Jack and Diane"
was John's only number one hit.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.200
And when I mean
number one, back then,

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.530
there was only two
formats for radio.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.370
And it was basically
album-oriented rock

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.850
where they would play every
cut on an album or top 40,

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.380
they played singles.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.350
Album-oriented would
play everything.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:25.170
And the top 40 stations
would look at the stats.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.700
What were people
most excited about?

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.710
What songs do they like?

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.570
And they grab those and
put them on the top 40.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.490
And when you became
number one, you

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.320
couldn't get us off the radio.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.040
It was on every station, on TV.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.824
We do every TV show imaginable.

00:19:44.824 --> 00:19:46.740
By the way, when I got
in the Mellencamp band,

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.900
five weeks after being in,
we had to make a record.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.020
Two days later, I'm fired.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.910
I was devastated--
absolutely devastated.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.180
We're at the Chateau Marmont--

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.970
this famous hotel with
Belushi died and all these--

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.580
I ran into DeNiro
when he was looking

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.710
like "Godfather 2"
and Meryl Streep

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.020
with hair down to her calves.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.260
And I was Sunset Strip.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.190
I did it.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.780
Mom, I made it.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.250
And then I get fired.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.627
And when John's firing
me, he was basically

00:20:16.627 --> 00:20:19.085
saying, because I didn't know
what the purpose of a drummer

00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:20.040
is.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.510
And the purpose of a drummer,
which I now know, back then

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.430
was really--

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.580
my purpose as a drummer is to
get John's songs on the radio

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.960
and be number one, because as
an employee of the corporation

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.570
John Mellencamp, if he gets
a song to be number one,

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.570
he makes gazillions of dollars.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.490
If I was hired by
Microsoft, they

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.280
would hire me to make them
gazillions of dollars.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.820
And then I'd get some money,
and I'd raise my family.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.770
But nobody explains
that in rock and roll.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.560
It's just like sex,
drums, rock and roll.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.820
Let's rock.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.360
So I didn't know
that my purpose--

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.530
my whole mental approach to
coming up with a drum part

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.780
to serve the song to be on
the radio and be number one--

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.270
I had no clue of that.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.990
John knew that.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.270
Producer of the
record knew that.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.530
Time was an element.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.050
You've got to get the
drum track done first.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.140
Back then, you had to be able
to play from beginning to end.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.490
There was very little editing.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.110
You had to have your time
down, your feel down,

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.440
your sound down--

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.320
everything perfect, one take.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.300
There was none of this editing
and pro-tools like you can now.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.820
You can take a crappy drummer
and make him sound OK.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.740
That wasn't happening back then.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.420
And they realized I was green.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.609
So as John was telling
me this, you're

00:21:35.609 --> 00:21:36.900
not going to be on the record--

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.380
I'm going, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope,

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.000
no, I'm not going home.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.250
Because he was suggesting
I go back to Indiana.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.450
I went, no.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.070
It's almost like
if somebody were

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:50.760
to fire you and you
go, no, I'm not fired.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.220
And they go, no, wait,
I just fired you.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.540
No, you don't mean that.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.937
You don't mean to fire me.

00:21:55.937 --> 00:21:57.020
That's what was happening.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.390
And I had to come up with a plan
or some sort of business model

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.740
that would benefit
the both of us.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.600
And I did.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.120
And here's how it went.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.690
And I'm scrambling, by the way.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.035
It was like an angel
spoke on my behalf.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:19.480
Well, [STAMMERING] no, I'm
going to go to the studio

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.740
and watch those drummers
play my parts on your songs.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.192
And I'm going to
learn from them.

00:22:25.192 --> 00:22:26.650
And I'm going to
benefit from that.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.200
Yeah, I'm going to
benefit from that.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.070
And I said, am I
still your drummer?

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.920
And he went,
perplexed, like, yeah.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.362
I says, well, if I get
better from that and benefit

00:22:35.362 --> 00:22:36.820
from that, you're
going to benefit,

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.127
because I'm your drummer.

00:22:39.127 --> 00:22:40.210
And here's the deal-maker.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.080
I went, you don't
have to pay me.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.080
And I think that did it.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.850
And I'll sleep on the floor.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.950
Well, he didn't pay me,
but I did sleep on a bed.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.330
And it was humiliating.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.930
So I go home four weeks later,
back to eight hours a day

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.090
practicing.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.730
I'm trying to learn how
to serve John's songs.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.180
How do you practice
something simple?

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.560
It's easy to practice
something technical

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.090
or learn something technical.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.207
How do you practice simplicity?

00:23:07.207 --> 00:23:09.040
There aren't that many
method books on that.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.590
So I had to create a method.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.250
And I start doing that.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.320
All I could focus on
was the next record.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.250
A year and a half later,
we're making "American Fool."

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.060
"Jack and Diane," number one
hit single, was off the record.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.040
We, as a band, didn't know
how to serve the song.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.440
It was a cool folk song.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.250
[SINGING] Little ditty
about Jack and Diane--

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.050
that type of thing.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:37.180
[MIMICKING DRUMS] Now
I had that cool beat.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.305
But it's kind of--

00:23:38.305 --> 00:23:39.430
where do you go from there?

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.346
It was kind of boring.

00:23:40.346 --> 00:23:42.490
You have to develop
it into something.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.052
We didn't know how to do that.

00:23:44.052 --> 00:23:45.010
So it's off the record.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.830
One day, a guy walks
in with this metal box.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.470
And I said, what's that?

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.670
He says, it's a
Linn 1 drum machine.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.240
What are you going
to do with that?

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.840
And he says, well, we're going
to try it on "Jack and Diane"

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.640
and program the drum.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.250
I'm going to be replaced
now by a machine?

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.020
A human, but a machine--

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.920
this is back then.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.310
I grabbed the thing.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.800
I went, I'm going to program it.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.900
So I'm programming my
parts on a drum machine.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.135
And here's your box.

00:24:10.135 --> 00:24:11.380
And I go back.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.150
And I'm in the
lounge playing pool

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.320
going, man, this really sucks.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.040
I'm now being replaced by a box.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.470
And then all of the sudden,
a couple hours later, Aronoff

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.480
get in here.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.940
John says, we need a drum solo.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.455
I'm like, on a ballad?

00:24:26.455 --> 00:24:27.700
I'm like, wow.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.170
I'm thinking, what
would Buddy Rich do?

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.440
He'd say, the song sucks,
get rid of the song,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.430
give me another song.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.200
Well, I couldn't
do that obviously.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.270
So I have to sit there.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.310
We spent a whole day
getting this big drum song,

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.700
because back then, they didn't
put drums in the big room.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.520
They put them in vocal
booths, because you

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.170
could control the sound better.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.480
So we spent a whole day trying
to create this new sound.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.557
And then it's time for me to
come up with the big drum solo.

00:24:54.557 --> 00:24:56.140
So I was starting
to learn my purpose.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.540
So he said, this is where
we want you to come in.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.510
So I went, boom,
blam, and stopped.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.240
That was my entrance--
like, ta-da--

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.829
simple and big.

00:25:05.829 --> 00:25:07.120
And I look in the control room.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.244
There's nine guys in there.

00:25:08.244 --> 00:25:09.372
And they're like--

00:25:09.372 --> 00:25:13.210
I'm like, whew,
still got my job,

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:14.460
because they could replace me.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.839
They did before.

00:25:15.839 --> 00:25:17.130
So then I started doing things.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.900
I know I'm going to go--

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.910
I was looking at the
thing that everybody--

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:24.240
you can look at something that
everybody sees a certain way.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.110
And then you put a twist on
it by looking at it different.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.290
Typically in drumming,
you go down the tom-toms.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.480
I decided I'd go
up the tom-toms.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.296
And so I hit a deadend.

00:25:35.296 --> 00:25:37.170
Next thing you know,
I'm in the control room.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.710
And I got everybody saying,
you should try this,

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.293
you should try this, you should
try this, you should try this.

00:25:41.293 --> 00:25:42.900
And you're thinking,
wait a minute,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.452
all I know is I've got to
come up with something.

00:25:45.452 --> 00:25:47.160
Trying to pay attention
to them, but also

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.600
come up with my own ideas--

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.540
and I'm like, all I
know is I'm walking back

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.670
to the drum set 40 feet.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.660
I remember saying, you got
40 feet to save your career--

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.576
30 feet, 20, 15.

00:26:01.576 --> 00:26:02.700
What are you going to play?

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.580
I don't know.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.080
Oh, my god.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:04.719
Oh, my god.

00:26:04.719 --> 00:26:05.760
What are you going to do?

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.490
Five, one-- I turn around
and there they are.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.419
I felt like a goldfish
in a goldfish tank,

00:26:11.419 --> 00:26:12.710
and they're looking down at me.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:18.790
I'm like-- and the
angel shows up again.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.530
Do this.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.900
I played the rhythm
I had programmed.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.535
And at first, I had
played it on the beat.

00:26:25.535 --> 00:26:29.380
"Doosh, doosh,
doo, dun, un, un."

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.230
And I went "do, do, do,"
and they didn't like that.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.290
So this time, I moved it over.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.570
The same idea-- moved it
over by an eighth note.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.840
So instead of playing on one,
I go one, two, three, four,

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.660
one-- "un, un, un."

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.210
The same rhythm,
but displaced, which

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.010
gave it a kind of a twist.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.840
I look up-- oh, no, I
didn't even look up.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.240
John hit a cymbal,
which mean obviously he

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.350
liked what I just did.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.000
I went "da-ga gsh."

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.232
And then I went, "do,
do, do, do, do, do,"

00:26:57.232 --> 00:26:58.690
because I had to
go down the drums.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:26:59.440
Ran out of drums--

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.560
I went back up,
"blah, do, do, doom.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.640
Doosh, ga.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.770
Do, do, do.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.230
Da gong, do, do, do, do, do,
do, do, blah, do, do, doosh."

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.120
And then they're
like, do a groove.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.890
Long story short, I came up
with, "doosh, do-ga doosh, goh.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.960
Do do-ga doon, shh.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.830
Doon, do-ga doon, shh."

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:23.110
And on top, they went,
mm-hum, so let it rock.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.570
So let it roll--

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.410
became this big anthem thing.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.720
Bingo, number one--

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.670
John's a gazillionaire.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:34.162
And I got credit for being the
drummer on the whole thing.

00:27:34.162 --> 00:27:35.620
And it's like,
who's Kenny Aronoff?

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.480
Who's this guy?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.910
I was in the same
room that I got

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.730
fired in at the Chateau
Marmont where I heard

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.680
the song went to number one.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.560
And to be honest with you,
I celebrated for about one

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.280
second.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.760
And then I got scared
like, oh, my god, I

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.760
have to do this again.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.840
Can I do this again?

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.040
How do I do this again?

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.860
Whoa-- pressure.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.170
There I was again-- fear.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:07.240
And yeah, so that was, I'd
say, arriving and executing

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.010
my second plan and
reaching a goal.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:12.640
I now was on a number one
single that's still played today

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.340
and launched my career as
a rock and roll drummer.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.684
NICK: And you did it
again a few more times.

00:28:18.684 --> 00:28:21.100
KENNY ARONOFF: Not only have
I been on number one singles,

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.870
but they were huge, iconic--

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.460
like, "I'll Do
Anything for Love,

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.190
but I Won't Do That"
by meatloaf, which

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.410
that album sold 40 million.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.670
I was on "That Thing You Do"--

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.680
the Tom Hanks thing.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.240
You guys may not
remember this song,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.540
but Belinda Carlisle, "Heaven
on Earth" was a huge single.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.590
That was my first number one hit
single outside of Mellencamp.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.780
"Blaze of Glory" by Bon
Jovi was a huge hit--

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.410
a very pinnacle moment
for John, because he did

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.510
a solo record that
went number one

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.830
and sold millions of copies.

00:28:54.922 --> 00:28:56.380
I've recorded with
so many people--

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.310
Johnny Cash to Tony
Iommi from Sabbath

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:03.460
to Alice Cooper to BB King,
Bonnie Raitt to Mellencamp,

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:09.370
Elton John, Santana, Rod
Stewart to Avril Lavigne,

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.380
Celine Dion, Michelle Branch.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.620
It's just all over the map,
which is a difficult thing

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.790
to do as a session drummer.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.270
Usually they go,
oh, he's a rock guy.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:22.240
But there I am, recording with
George Jones, Conway Twitty--

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.570
last performance ever.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.029
It's been incredible.

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:28.570
NICK: So let's
transition to the book

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:32.820
where a lot of these
incredible stories are.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.720
How did you find
time to write a book

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.450
with all the touring and all the
studios and all the sessions?

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.340
Were you able to--

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.640
KENNY ARONOFF: Well, I didn't
want to write the book.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.990
Didn't you hear?

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.730
I never wanted to write my book.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.235
I knew this was going to be a
pain in the butt, and it was.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.120
I went on tour with
this super-group

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.060
called Chickenfoot, which
is Sammy Hagar and Mike

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.540
Anthony from Van Halen, and
then the genius guitar player,

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.550
Joe Satriani.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.310
And Chad Smith, the drummer
from the Chili Peppers, who's

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.800
the original member--

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.080
Chad had to go back on
tour with the Chili Peppers

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.150
and make his $8
billion a month salary.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.090
Just Joking.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:16.070
And so Chad said,
Kenny's your guy.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.780
And so Sammy-- and
this is an example

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.510
of being successful
also, which I

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:25.159
call communication skills,
teamwork, being able

00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:26.200
to get along with people.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.840
Sammy calls you up and goes,
hey, Kenny, it's Sammy.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.642
Listen, there's a lot of
drummers that want this gig,

00:30:31.642 --> 00:30:33.850
and there's a lot of drummers
that can play this gig,

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.510
but I want somebody I get
along with and have fun with.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.550
Teamwork, communication skills--

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.910
I get hired more, probably,
because people want me

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.270
in the room next to them,
because I motivate the room.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.160
I'm a good guy to have around.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:52.030
Doesn't matter if I've been on
over 300 million records sold--

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.041
I still know that I am there.

00:30:55.041 --> 00:30:55.540
I listen.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.260
I learn.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.850
I lead, because I'm a drummer.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.230
But I ain't the boss.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.820
If I want to be the boss,
then I become the boss.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.660
Till I'm the boss, yes,
sir, what would you like?

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.600
The 15-year-old kid that hires
me to play on the record--

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.640
how would you like
me to do that?

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.830
I have to still consider
that I'm an employee.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:16.420
So yeah, I said to
Sammy, well, why don't we

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.040
get together and hang out?

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.650
And then we'll
play a little bit.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.770
I'll fly myself up there
in northern California.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:24.740
And that's what we did.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.030
And I got the gig.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:30.390
So the writer that's
writing about Joe Satriani--

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.840
a book he was
writing-- said, god,

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.670
I want to do a book on you.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:34.796
And I went, nah.

00:31:34.796 --> 00:31:37.135
He said, no, no, really,
it will be great.

00:31:37.135 --> 00:31:38.980
And I says, well, I
don't want to just talk

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.590
about recording and touring.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.050
I want to talk
about other things.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.424
Whatever you want
to talk about--

00:31:43.424 --> 00:31:45.490
he made it sound like
all I do is dictate

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:48.880
into the phone every so
many weeks or every month,

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.360
and then he transcribes it.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.870
And next thing you know,
we got a great book.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:53.920
Boy, was I naive.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.010
My gut was telling me, this
is not going to work out easy.

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:58.840
What happened after
about two years--

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.730
no disrespect to the writer--

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.480
it didn't sound like me.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.764
So now I've got to take over.

00:32:04.764 --> 00:32:06.430
And I have a couple
of friends out there

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.846
in the audience right now,
they know what it's like for me

00:32:08.846 --> 00:32:09.760
to take over.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.790
I have a vision that--

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.850
I realize only I
understand my vision.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.360
And so I had to go and
edit every single page.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.380
Once again, no disrespect to
the editor, who was brilliant,

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.270
and the writer that
was co-writing with me.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.950
But it didn't sound like me.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:29.740
I couldn't stomach
letting one page go by.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.770
So I'd spend 16 hours a
day on my days off on tour,

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.360
pulling my hair out.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.520
Well, it was already out.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.660
Pulling something,
pacing, and just

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:45.100
rewriting one chapter for
weeks till it sounded like me.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.620
And by the way, they
cut 300 pages out.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.740
There's some juicy stuff-- a
thing with me and Cameron Diaz.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.854
And me and Dave
Grohl and all this

00:32:52.854 --> 00:32:54.520
stuff that you would
love to know about,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.250
but they had to cut it
out, because there wasn't

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.410
enough room to put it in there.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.300
Next book.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.360
Or I'll see you after this.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.780
The thing is, is that it
was an amazing experience.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.100
It was like making a movie.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.202
They leave more on the floor
than they put in the movie.

00:33:12.202 --> 00:33:13.660
And to shape a
book, what I learned

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.490
is the way you shape
a book and there's

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.350
certain techniques and
supposed to be a certain length

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.550
and at this point, you've got
to put a little bit of humor in.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.730
At this point, you put a
little bit of a story here.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:27.800
And I'm very proud of the
way the book came out.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.750
I'm very, very proud.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.620
But it was really,
really difficult.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:35.570
And the trip is, it's not
like my career is over.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.930
I wrote it while I'm still
relevant and happening.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.240
And the best thing
about it is what

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:46.620
I learned about my own
life is teaching me.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.600
I literally said, so well--

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.780
people ask me, how
did you do this?

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.670
How did you play on so many
records, so diverse, a touring

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.790
career, 10 years with Joe
Cocker, touring, making

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:00.330
records--

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.640
17 years with Mellencamp,
touring, making records--

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.690
the Smashing Pumpkins, 24
years with John Fogerty,

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:08.659
the iconic songwriter
of America,

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:13.530
the Creedence Clearwater--
records and touring and Melissa

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.000
Etheridge for 10 years, Michelle
Branch, the Jefferson Airplane,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.050
a Bob Seger--

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:21.780
blah, blah, blah, touring,
and then stylistically

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.429
all over the map.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:24.489
How did you do--

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.980
I sort of asked myself
the same question.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.400
Wait a minute, if I have to
explain this to somebody,

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.310
how did I do this?

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:34.860
So I came up with this.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.469
I believe there are
seven ways a person can

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:40.290
be successful in their
life and their career--

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.246
the same seven ways that led
me to this extraordinary career

00:34:44.246 --> 00:34:45.870
in one of the most
difficult businesses

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.510
in the world for four decades--

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.280
the music business.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.280
It's such a broken
business, man,

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.850
for the drummer, the musician.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.600
It's so difficult. It
doesn't work like it used to.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.690
Like, I'm on three records
that sold 40 million copies.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.120
That's a lot of money
coming into the corporation

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.730
that then they
reinvest in new bands,

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.380
like the John Mellencamp band.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.830
You have millions of dollars
to get songs on the radio,

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.960
to promote it, to put
the band on the tour,

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.540
to invest and invest and invest.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.200
And it worked.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.620
That business model worked,
only because the companies were

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:26.950
making money from selling CDs.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.239
That doesn't happen anymore.

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:29.780
So the investment
money is not there.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.790
So that business model
kind of fell apart.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:37.320
So my point is, I came up
with several ways I truly

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.080
believe that this works.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.720
And when I talk about
seven ways or fundamentals,

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.720
there is no magic pill.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.400
There is no genius
thing that somebody

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.960
is going to come up with and
say, whew, if you do this,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.360
this will change your life.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.690
Nobody's ever said this before.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.360
It's all been said.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.170
But fundamentals at
anything are what

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:05.090
makes us become successful
and stay successful.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:07.070
Why do we look at
the 10 Commandments?

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.349
To remind us how to live our
life with certain values.

00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:12.140
We have to keep looking
at them, because we

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.240
get sidetracked sometimes.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.340
I know I have on
my third marriage.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.060
So the thing is--

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.466
are they going to edit that out?

00:36:22.466 --> 00:36:22.965
No.

00:36:22.965 --> 00:36:25.880
But my point is that
fundamentals are fundamentals.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:30.620
I don't care if it's sports,
music, living your life--

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.130
anything.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.080
There are fundamentals
that work.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.120
And sometimes we
have to be reminded.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.610
And when I speak--

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.320
I have a speaking business--

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.260
I remind people maybe
of these fundamentals.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.070
And my version is my version.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:49.070
But it gets down to, it's always
going to be self-discipline.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:51.150
It's always going
to be hard work.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.480
It's always going to be
able to create a plan,

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.440
execute it to reach your goal.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.350
It's always going to
be communication skills

00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:59.060
and teamwork skills.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.670
It's always going to be, well,
I talk about a healthy life

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.290
is a wealthy life.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.350
No mental, physical,
and emotional health--

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.000
you can't go to work.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.160
You can't get out of bed.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.840
And I have eight steps
to being healthy.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.630
This is important.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.310
These are fundamentals
that we have

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.140
to be reminded of all the time.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.320
And my last one is staying
relevant and staying focused

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.760
to stay relevant to adapt.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.340
For example, in my business,
the vinyl record went out.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.860
CD came, turned into Frisbees.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.040
Downloading, streaming--
all the sudden,

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.430
people couldn't afford to fly me
from Indiana all over the world

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.450
to make a record.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:39.260
I had dreams in New
York, Nashville, LA,

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.020
Japan, and Germany.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.700
And all of a sudden,
the budgets went.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.450
What did I do?

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.120
Got an apartment in LA,
eventually moved to LA,

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.910
eventually got a studio.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:53.600
People couldn't afford to pay
2 and 1/2 1,000, $3,000 a day

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.740
to be in a studio.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.810
So I have a studio.

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:56.870
Studio's free.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.940
I'm not free, but
the studio is free.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.940
And I created a
business model that

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.780
has kept me relevant
in the music business

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.500
where people hire me to record--

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.260
I just did this cool band,
Supersonic Blues Machine.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.840
I went to play with Billy
Gibbons, Steve Lukather, Robben

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.910
Ford, Warren Haynes--

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:17.630
on and on.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.760
Great guitar players-- we
feature guitar players,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.790
all done in my studio.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.770
I just did a song with
Sammy Hagar and DMC,

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.000
on and on and on.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.710
I've made it
affordable, and I've

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:33.336
had to adjust to the way
my business has changed.

00:38:33.336 --> 00:38:35.210
We're basically the
horse and buggy business,

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.520
and the car showed
up 15 years ago.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.791
But I'm still riding the buggy.

00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:41.540
NICK: So this part,
we're going to open up

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.456
to audience questions.

00:38:42.456 --> 00:38:43.850
We have two mics.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:47.180
While people are lining up,
I'll do a few rapid fire.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:51.592
What's the most memorable
show you ever played?

00:38:51.592 --> 00:38:54.050
KENNY ARONOFF: The inauguration
maybe or the Kennedy Center

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.800
honors--

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.710
Obama's inauguration or
the Kennedy Center honors.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:00.140
NICK: What's your
favorite venue to play at?

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.200
KENNY ARONOFF:
Madison Square Garden.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.250
NICK: And what's your favorite
city you've visited on tour?

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.800
KENNY ARONOFF: Oh, that's tough.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.100
Oh, I've been in 62 countries.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.920
Can I narrow it down?

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.530
Places like New York, LA--

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.980
they're just the
center of everything.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.216
So I love playing
in these cities.

00:39:21.216 --> 00:39:22.050
NICK: OK.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.830
We have-- we'll start over here.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.130
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.780
Hi.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.390
KENNY ARONOFF: How
you doing, man?

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.130
AUDIENCE: So entertaining.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.664
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:39:28.664 --> 00:39:30.080
KENNY ARONOFF: Oh,
you're welcome.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.310
Thank you for having me.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:33.046
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:39:33.046 --> 00:39:34.670
I want to thank
whoever organized this.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.797
This is awesome.

00:39:35.797 --> 00:39:36.380
I'm a drummer.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.360
And I just--

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.250
I don't know.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.630
This is a treat.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.097
Thank you.

00:39:41.097 --> 00:39:41.930
I had two questions.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.500
I can ask one if you want.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:48.320
They're mostly specifically
about playing and writing

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.940
music.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:54.530
When you do drum parts,
do you like usually

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.030
working with the
backing track or do

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:58.220
you prefer working with
the live musicians?

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.980
Like, say, do you prefer
laying down your drum parts

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.080
with the guitar and
the bass player?

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.655
Or do you prefer just listening
to the tracks and just--

00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:09.155
KENNY ARONOFF:
That's a great ques--

00:40:09.155 --> 00:40:11.855
AUDIENCE: Things like to
the grid with a click now--

00:40:11.855 --> 00:40:13.730
KENNY ARONOFF: Well,
that's a great question.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:16.430
And I'll tell you how I do it.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:21.050
Obviously, I prefer
playing in the studio

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.900
with all the players
at the same time,

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.700
because there's
that interaction.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.950
And the better the
players, the better it is,

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.490
because boy, they'll push
you and you push them.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.500
But nowadays, with
that business model

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.750
that I was telling you
about, a lot of times, people

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.250
send me demos.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:41.230
Sammy sent me an electric
guitar and his voice--

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.050
bad ass.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.190
It was so bad-- so inspiring.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.150
But there was an open palette.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.920
So can you imagine,
oh, my god, I

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.260
don't want to do the wrong
thing, what is your vision,

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:52.760
Sammy?

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.051
That's the first thing I asked.

00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:57.000
And he goes, well, kind of
make it like Led Zeppelin.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.350
And I went, OK.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.520
So I ask a few more questions.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.360
Since it was a duet
with DMC, I says,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.590
who's singing the verses,
who's singing the chorus?

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:09.000
And so when I know DMC's
going to do the verses,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.700
then I'm going to play
with a little bit of space

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.630
to allow him to do his thing.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.500
Bottom line is, I get a click.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.750
I want the guitar part and the
vocal part that Sammy recorded.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:26.490
And I want the click track
that he recorded, too,

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.770
because we got to have a
click track, because then I'm

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.050
going to play to the click
track and they're going

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.476
to overdub everything to me.

00:41:33.476 --> 00:41:34.350
Does that make sense?

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:34.975
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:34.975 --> 00:41:36.930
KENNY ARONOFF: OK.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:40.975
So I write everything out.

00:41:40.975 --> 00:41:44.610
I'm very meticulous so
that when I go in there,

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:47.280
I'm like, bam, bam,
bam, bam, bam, bam.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.570
It's live.

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:49.270
I'm excited.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.160
I'm pumped.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.990
It's like, I've done
all the prep work.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.280
OK, let's go to a
different scenario.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.030
Sometimes people will send me
demos with all kinds of parts--

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.560
guitar, bass, keyboards.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.410
First thing I ask
them is like, are you

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:07.320
keeping any of these parts?

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.110
And if they say no, which
is usually what they do,

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.000
that's good, because
then I put the click up,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.458
because I want to make sure
I'm tight with the click track,

00:42:14.458 --> 00:42:15.990
because they're
going to overdub.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.950
Then I ask them, well, are
these parts the parts that--

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:23.220
even though they're not
the parts you're going to--

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.830
the actual recording of
those parts, but those

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.160
are the basic parts that
you're going to overdub to me.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.800
So I want to make sure that
my parts will fit with theirs.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.270
And when they say yes,
then that tells me a lot.

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:39.140
Most of the demos I'll get will
already have a drum program.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.590
And this is the part
you'll like here.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.580
So what I do is I write out
everything in the program,

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:49.230
because when they say,
just do your own thing--

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.142
I learn the hard way.

00:42:50.142 --> 00:42:51.600
When they say, "do
your own thing,"

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.570
they've been listening to
those drum parts for so long

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:56.970
that they don't
really mean that.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.520
They mean, do your
own thing to a point.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.960
So what I do is I
write everything out.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.250
Everything-- cymbal, tom-toms.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:08.700
And I'll give them one take
precisely what they programmed,

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.950
but with my feel.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.170
The next take I
give them is now I

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:15.254
start putting in my own fills.

00:43:15.254 --> 00:43:17.420
I might, instead of the
open high hat in the chorus,

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.050
go to the crash cymbal.

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:23.325
Or maybe in the B section, I
play fours like a Motown beat,

00:43:23.325 --> 00:43:25.080
because I feel like
it drives it more.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.020
The third take, I
go even further.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.276
That way, you see how I'm
taking care of everything.

00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:32.530
I hope that helped.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:33.219
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:33.219 --> 00:43:34.260
Can I ask one more thing?

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.510
KENNY ARONOFF: Yeah, go ahead.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.175
AUDIENCE: Sorry, one, can I?

00:43:37.175 --> 00:43:38.050
It's related to that.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.460
How do you take
this-- sometimes you

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.410
might get not very
clear guidance

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.390
on what they want you to do.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.140
Do you have any
tips for language

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.480
when they tell you, oh, I
want it to be more open,

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.610
or I want it to be more intense?

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.980
How do you take that?

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.730
KENNY ARONOFF: This is
that people skill thing.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:03.670
I did a record with Billy Corgan
from the Smashing Pumpkins

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:06.220
and Tony Iommi
from Black Sabbath.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.160
Billy walks in.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.477
He goes right down to business.

00:44:09.477 --> 00:44:11.560
Says, Tony, play me a lick
you've been working on,

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.890
because Tony comes up
with the greatest licks.

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:19.660
[MIMICKING GUITAR] Billy
plays it on guitar or bass.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.319
And I went, man, that's bad ass.

00:44:21.319 --> 00:44:22.360
He said, give me another.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:27.950
[MIMICKING GUITAR] I'm like,
ooh, that's so awesome.

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.420
Billy looks at me and goes--

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.130
I went, does that mean you
want me to go out there?

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:33.690
Yeah.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:34.390
I go out there.

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:35.140
I'm on the drums.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.180
OK.

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:44.890
No vocals-- I start writing down
dark section, purple section.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:50.820
Then I hear Billy said,
no, be more fluent.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.450
OK, fluent-- OK, fluent--

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:57.170
I'm sitting there going,
does he mean by "fluent"?

00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:00.340
So I have to come
up with something.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.260
And what I always do when they
say something like, be this--

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.845
Brian Wilson from the Beach
Boys once said something to me.

00:45:05.845 --> 00:45:06.595
I was overdubbing.

00:45:06.595 --> 00:45:10.130
I went, oh, my god,
what does he mean?

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.980
What do I do, because I don't
understand what he's saying?

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.580
And this is the great Brian
Wilson from the Beach Boys.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.190
Here's what I do in a
situation like that.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:20.660
Do something.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.070
Just do anything.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.410
Do the best that you can do.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:28.030
And wait for them to tell
you, no, make it more like--

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.420
and now you've got the
thing going back and forth.

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.530
If you just go,
what do you mean--

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:35.480
that's where you blow it.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.340
If you ask them to
explain it again--

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.340
unless you're with somebody
you're real close to

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.050
and you got that chemistry.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:45.660
But there was no way I was going
to do that with those guys.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.600
I just, oh, OK.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.240
And a lot of times, yeah,
that's exactly what I meant.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.290
I'm like, whew.

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:54.040
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.540
Thank you.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:55.686
KENNY ARONOFF: Awesome.

00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:56.797
NICK: Go over.

00:45:56.797 --> 00:45:57.380
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.090
Thanks, again, so much
for being here today.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:45:59.907
KENNY ARONOFF: Could you
just speak a little closer

00:45:59.907 --> 00:46:00.180
to the mic?

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah, of course.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.390
So it was interesting
listening to you

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:04.580
talk about all the tracks
that you've been a part of,

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.246
all the artists that
you've worked with.

00:46:06.246 --> 00:46:08.150
And in a lot of
these cases, I think

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.790
that the recognition
of the songs

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:14.240
goes towards the front man or
the front woman of the band.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.170
I'm curious, as a drummer, if
that's a frustration for you,

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:19.550
or if it's almost considered
a blessing that you're sort

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:23.450
of not the recognizable one.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:27.180
KENNY ARONOFF: I've
always understood my role,

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:31.340
so to speak, as a drummer.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.500
But at the same time, I'm
not the mellowest guy.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:40.030
I have a way of being the
second spotlight on stage,

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.830
and not on purpose.

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:42.620
It's just my nature.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:46.010
But the bottom line
is, I'm cool with--

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.080
I've never had a problem.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:52.880
Usually, the guy up front or the
girl up front writes the songs.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.350
They hire me.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:55.940
It's about them.

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.357
I understand that.

00:46:57.357 --> 00:46:58.940
And maybe it's just
the way I'm wired.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:02.940
But I'm cool with my position.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.970
The only time I
get uncomfortable

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:11.330
is when somebody doesn't
treat me with respect

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:15.680
when I'm trying my hardest to
make them look like rock stars.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.130
I'm trying to make the
team win the Super Bowl.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:22.760
And then someone's
throwing spears at me.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.380
That's like, come on.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.630
So I'm OK with it.

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:29.570
The cool thing is now that
I've been doing speaking,

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:32.600
I'm up front, kind
of like right now.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.820
And I still get to perform.

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.830
And I love it.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:38.810
But basically, I
understand my role.

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:43.370
And I really feel
honorable doing what I do.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:45.510
And it's perfectly cool.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:46.260
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:46.990
Thank you.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.823
KENNY ARONOFF: Yeah.

00:47:47.823 --> 00:47:50.060
Did you want me to play
in your band or something?

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.610
Because dude, I've got a studio.

00:47:54.665 --> 00:47:56.040
AUDIENCE: It's
really interesting

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.180
hearing you speak about a lot
of these history of the music

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.400
industry and the general
trend and direction.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.191
I've been reflecting
on these, because I've

00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:06.409
just recently seen a documentary
on HBO, "The Defiant Ones."

00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:08.450
And I guess I was curious
about if you'd seen it,

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:10.408
if you had thoughts on
it, and just in general,

00:48:10.408 --> 00:48:13.160
where you think the general
direction of the industry

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:13.760
is going.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.385
KENNY ARONOFF: I
haven't seen that one.

00:48:15.385 --> 00:48:17.557
Is that the one with--

00:48:17.557 --> 00:48:19.010
AUDIENCE: It's
with Jimmy Iovine.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.426
KENNY ARONOFF:
Yeah, Jimmy Iovine.

00:48:20.426 --> 00:48:22.160
And I've known Jimmy
for a long time

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.020
when he was just a producer.

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:27.320
And he is an example
of somebody--

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.120
I think somebody
mentioned that he

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.600
talks about how he just pounded
and pounded and pounded.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.137
AUDIENCE: Your
stories are similar.

00:48:34.137 --> 00:48:34.970
KENNY ARONOFF: Yeah.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:38.460
So he did it in his
way in the business,

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.260
and I did it my way
in the business.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.850
Yeah, we both are
bald and beautiful.

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:44.360
No, joking.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.020
It just sounds good-- bald,
beautiful, and bad ass.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.730
Bald, beautiful, bad ass--

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:52.820
anyway, like I said,
the music business

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.860
has drastically changed.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.410
The thing that I am
most frustrated with

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.450
and disappointed
with is that I feel

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:03.080
that given that the
budgets are where they are,

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.370
that mediocrity has
been accepted too much.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:12.770
I think mediocrity is an
epidemic across the board--

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:15.350
that people are
settling for stuff

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:17.960
that doesn't have
the value that I

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:23.510
think that music, in my
business, has had in the past.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:27.770
And it's the whole
system perpetuates that,

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.282
because you don't have money.

00:49:29.282 --> 00:49:31.490
When I was with Mellencamp,
we could do a whole album

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:36.320
and throw it away and
start again, painfully,

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:39.550
because we had the money
and the budget to do that.

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.690
John wasn't loaded, and
we lived in Indiana.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:46.910
But we would throw away stuff
and come up with great stuff.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:52.030
Four years-- I thought it was
going to be a year and a half.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.314
Great stuff takes time.

00:49:53.314 --> 00:49:54.730
I was talking to
a movie producer,

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:58.960
because Kodak Film is going
to do a documentary on me.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.720
And I was talking to
another film producer.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.860
And he's talking about
seven years making--

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.640
I think he was involved with
the Janis Joplin documentary.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.650
And six years on this--

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.090
things take time.

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:16.510
And time is attached to
money a lot of times.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:17.480
That's the problem.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:22.900
So there's a lot of stuff that
is being praised as a genius,

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.130
and it's not.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:25.180
I'm sorry.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.250
It just is not.

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.810
And when I say
"mediocrity," the thing

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:39.020
is, if people are saying they
love that, then they love that.

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:41.930
And then if people
are buying that,

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.150
then it's considered successful.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:47.330
But that doesn't mean
it's genius or great.

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:48.800
I guess that's what I'm saying.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:53.390
And that's OK, man, because
everything's in trends.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:56.000
When you have stuff like
that that will perpetuate,

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.590
other people go, no.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:02.240
People somehow find a way
of writing and creating

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.547
great stuff, whatever
business they're in.

00:51:05.547 --> 00:51:06.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.580
KENNY ARONOFF: You're welcome.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.590
AUDIENCE: I'll try
to make it quick.

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:11.426
Thanks for the talk.

00:51:11.426 --> 00:51:13.970
It was very interesting
and inspiring.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:16.030
I guess my question is--

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:19.600
the two things-- rock and
roll and working hard--

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.510
by intuition, they don't
go along that well, right?

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.170
And as a kid, it
seems like you talked

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:25.400
about looking at Ringo Starr.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.820
And I think when Lennon was
asked about Ringo Starr,

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.234
whether he's the best
drummer in the world,

00:51:30.234 --> 00:51:32.150
he said something like,
he's not even the best

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.280
drummer in the Beatles.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.530
So my question is,
as a young kid,

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:41.150
how could you see through
something that looks easy?

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:44.360
How could you see through it and
realize it demands hard work?

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.890
And how can we
teach our kids today

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:49.550
that this is the way to go and
it's not as easy as it seems,

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.370
like going to Joshua Tree
and just produce a number one

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.210
record?

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.591
KENNY ARONOFF: Well,
the reason why--

00:51:55.591 --> 00:51:56.090
yeah.

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:58.256
When you're a little kid,
I'm looking at the Beatles

00:51:58.256 --> 00:52:00.020
like, I want to do that.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:00.935
I was naive.

00:52:00.935 --> 00:52:02.060
I thought you get up there.

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:06.120
But when I started to try
to do that, I realized,

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.460
wow, this is hard.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.410
This isn't good.

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:11.450
Then you start practicing.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:14.210
And you're seeing it
doesn't come quickly.

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:17.780
I didn't mention the fifth
thing in my seven keys

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.970
to be successful,
which is called RPS--

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:24.830
Repetition of anything is
the Preparation for Success.

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:28.460
Jason Day, this amazing golfer,
won seven PGA tournaments

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.110
in 10 months last year.

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:33.710
Six hours a day, seven
days a week, he practiced.

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:35.360
And that's what
made him successful.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:41.000
And to stay successful, six
hours a day, seven days a week.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.060
You have to be reminded, man.

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.010
I can't just become
Ringo Starr by saying

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:47.330
I want to be Ringo Starr.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.840
I have to practice.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.510
So I learned very quickly,
woo, this is not easy.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:55.744
And the thing is, I was
watching Buddy Rich back then.

00:52:55.744 --> 00:52:56.660
Rock had just come in.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.720
So it was like Buddy Rich,
Elvin Jones, Gene Krupa,

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.250
Louie Bellson--

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:05.390
all these amazing jazz drummers
that had really practiced,

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.515
had all this technique.

00:53:07.515 --> 00:53:09.140
I didn't know where
to begin with that,

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.056
because they were way above me.

00:53:11.056 --> 00:53:13.430
The other thing that took me
a while-- because back then,

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:15.920
people would go like,
ah, Ringo Starr--

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.230
look at Buddy Rich.

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:21.800
And Ringo's just doing, "I
want to hold your hand."

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:28.010
But then later on, I realized,
wow, style, personality, vibe,

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:32.240
influence to the
corporation, the team--

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.882
that's what he was brilliant at.

00:53:34.882 --> 00:53:36.590
Mick Jagger-- I recorded
with the Stones.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:42.110
And Mick said, I was
playing on a beaded gourd

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:46.160
with a brush [HUMMING] at
the beginning of a song.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.440
Charlie Watts is
playing the high hat.

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.600
Mick comes up to me and
says, be careful not

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:53.690
to get in the way of
Charlie Watts' high hat,

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:55.140
the vibe and the--

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:59.670
it would be as if you did
stroke across a canvas like,

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:00.680
oh, I can do--

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.710
wow, that's really good.

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:05.030
Something about it is magical.

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:06.240
Charlie Watts is that guy.

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.270
Mick said, no Charlie
Watts, no Stones.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:15.680
I went, that guy
knows who he has.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.570
He gets it.

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:19.620
He gets it.

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:20.310
Mick gets it.

00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:23.970
He understands the
genius of Charlie Watts,

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.410
even though he's simple.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:26.640
He is brilliant.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.280
Same with Ringo--
on paper people

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.290
go, oh, man, I don't get it.

00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:32.280
It's not technical.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:38.010
It's not [DRUMMING SOUND],,
you know, all that.

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:42.740
But they are serving the
song and the team geniusly,

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:44.460
and affect everybody.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:48.010
Those two things I just told you
about is what made me realize,

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:50.820
wow, you can't sit on
a couch and drink beer,

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:55.090
smoke pot, and
expect to be great.

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:57.780
And if you do get
lucky, because you just

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.910
happen to be the coolest
band in the world

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:04.819
and somebody wrote a genius
thing, to do it again,

00:55:04.819 --> 00:55:06.360
you're going to have
to eventually be

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:10.350
disciplined and have a formula.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.940
It's like anything else.

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:15.000
To repeat and repeat
and repeat and repeat,

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.120
you've got to
understand what it takes

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.262
to do that in any business.

00:55:22.262 --> 00:55:22.845
NICK: Perfect.

00:55:22.845 --> 00:55:23.640
Thanks, everybody.

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.540
That's all the time we have.

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.060
We have Kenny's book
for sale in the back.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:26.976
He'll be signing them.

00:55:26.976 --> 00:55:28.282
So come on back.

00:55:28.282 --> 00:55:30.240
And Kenny, thanks for
being here with us today.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:30.600
KENNY ARONOFF: Awesome.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.100
Thanks.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.950
[APPLAUSE]
