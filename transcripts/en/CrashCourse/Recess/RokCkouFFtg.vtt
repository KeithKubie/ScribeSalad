00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.760
On September 16, 1890, a man boarded a train
in Dijon, France, waved goodbye to his brother,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.760
and headed for Paris.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.769
He was carrying one of the greatest inventions
of the age – the world’s first motion

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.610
picture camera technology… two years before
it was developed by anyone else.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.620
In fact, our man was on his way to New York
to complete his patent and unveil his discovery

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.620
to the world.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.160
But when the train pulled into the station
in Paris, the man was nowhere to be found.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.920
He – and his invention – had disappeared
without a trace.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.120
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.020
Louis Le Prince was an artist and inventor,
a painter and a photographer, who entered

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.620
the arms race to create the first movie camera
in the 1880s.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.219
His initial attempt, completed in 1886, was
a camera with 16 different lenses arranged

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.269
in a grid pattern that would each capture
a sequential frame of film.

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.629
The problem was that each lens took its photo
from a slightly different angle.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.429
When played back, the resulting movie looked
odd and disjointed.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.020
Like any good scientist or artist, Le Prince
went right back to work, revising and refining

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.260
his technology.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.510
In 1887, he created a much simpler camera
that used a single lens and took photographs

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.100
onto small glass plates.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.920
But Le Prince wasn’t satisfied.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.119
In order to both capture and project the
images fast enough to achieve the illusion

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.990
of motion, he needed a material that was strong
but still flexible, heat-resistant, and transparent.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.710
He experimented with systems that used glass
plates, and paper-backed film strips, none

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.909
of which worked very smoothly.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.939
Then, in 1889, while visiting his brother
in France, he got his hands on a new medium

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.950
that would soon revolutionize the world of
photography – the flexible, emulsion-coated

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.840
material known as celluloid.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.130
Seeing its potential, Le Prince immediately
began cutting it into strips and reworking

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.850
his camera and projector to take advantage
of this new medium.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.850
And it worked.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.200
The world had its first dedicated movie camera
and projector!

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.360
HUZZAH!

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.280
Punches Eagle!!!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.620
Le Prince contacted his wife, told her to
set up an event back in New York to unveil

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.780
his invention, and initiate new patent proceedings.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.219
Then he hopped on the train bound for Paris.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.680
And just like that – he disappeared.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.159
So what happened to the man who invented the
first motion picture camera?

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.159
No one knows.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.770
His body was never found.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.850
Some have suggested that he committed suicide,
and threw himself from the train.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.090
Others wonder if his brother might’ve killed
him, though no motive leapt to mind.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.229
Another other theory – one advanced by Le
Prince’s family at the time of his disappearance

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.789
– pointed the finger at competing inventors.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.530
Less than a year later in 1891, Thomas Edison
applied for his first motion picture patents.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.230
By 1894, he’d opened his first kinetograph
parlors in New York.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.040
And in December 1895, the Lumiere Brothers
held the world’s first commercial movie

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.220
projection in Paris.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.920
So, if Le Prince actually made the first movie
camera and filed for the patent, why is the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.780
invention credited to Edison?

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.840
Under American law at the time, a person was
not considered dead until seven years after

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840
their disappearance.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.490
So, during those years, it was hard for the
Le Prince family to legally pursue or protect

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.490
Louis’ patents.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.490
Though they tried.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.900
The Le Prince family joined a lawsuit against
Edison soon after his disappearance.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.060
Their star witness was Le Prince’s son and
assistant Adolphe.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.780
But despite his best efforts, the trial ended in 1901 with a ruling for Edison.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.860
That same year, a distraught Adolphe died of a gunshot wound while duck hunting

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.700
on Fire Island, New York.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.980
Whether it was a suicide or an accident we may never know...

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.720
Whatever really happened, Le Prince’s reputation
– and his contributions to cinema – have

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.280
survived... he didn't though... might have been better if he survived.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.140
If I were him I'd prefer to have survived, myself.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.520
His camera and projector design concepts,
as well as his use of celluloid film, are

00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:15.549
strikingly similar to the technologies that
Edison, W.K.L.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.650
Dickson, and the Lumiere Brothers would come
to in the following years.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.920
Even though he may not get enough credit,
there’s no doubt that Louis Le Prince got

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.920
there first.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.129
And today, many film historians consider him
the “father of cinematography.” Other than Wheezywaiter, of course.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.000
Not to mention the subject of one of the great
unsolved mysteries of film history!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.360
As well as the subject of the great animated Crash Course video you just watched.
