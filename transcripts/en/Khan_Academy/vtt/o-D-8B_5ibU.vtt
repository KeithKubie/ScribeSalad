00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:05.357
- Rectangle 1 is blank meters
blank than Rectangle 2.

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:07.499
Let's look at this.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.690
Rectangle 1 has a width of 3 meters.

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:15.835
Rectangle 2 has a width of 9 meters.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.434
Rectangle 1 is, if you compare 3 to 9,

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:23.892
it's going to be 6 meters shorter.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:29.195
6 meters shorter than Rectangle 2.

00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:30.775
You see that right over here,

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:34.152
because 3 meters is 6 less than 9 meters.

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:35.315
It's 6 meters,

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:36.825
and you know it's not going to be longer.

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:38.416
Rectangle 1 is definitely ...

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:40.041
it has less width.

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:43.075
It's definitely shorter than Rectangle 2.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:45.715
It's 6 meters shorter than Rectangle 2.

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.113
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.272
Line 1 is blank centimeters long.

00:00:50.272 --> 00:00:51.457
We can measure it.

00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:53.465
We could measure it right over here.

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:56.717
Line 1 is 9 centimeters long.

00:00:57.547 --> 00:00:58.956
9 centimeters long.

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:02.149
Line 2 is blank centimeters long.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.868
Let me actually zoom this in a little bit

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:05.415
so that we can see it a little bit better.

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:09.060
Line 2 is blank centimeters long.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.671
Line 2 is 5 centimeters long.

00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:15.606
Let me zoom in a little bit more even.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:20.344
Line 2 is 5 centimeters long.

00:01:20.344 --> 00:01:24.268
Line 1 is blank centimeters
blank than Line 2.

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:26.927
Well, Line 1 is 9 verses 5,

00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:30.305
so it's 4 centimeters longer than Line 2.

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:35.305
Line 1 is 4 centimeters
longer than Line 2.

00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:37.137
You can see it right over here.

00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:38.554
To go from Line 2 to Line 1,

00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:42.408
you'd have to add 1, 2, 3, 4 centimeters.

00:01:43.777 --> 00:01:46.329
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.904
Triangle 1 is blank centimeters long.

00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:50.250
We can just use a ruler to measure

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.166
that it's 3 centimeters long.

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:55.393
Triangle 2 is blank centimeters long.

00:01:55.393 --> 00:01:57.466
Let me scroll down to look at Triangle 2.

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:01.622
Triangle 2 is 5 centimeters long.

00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:05.592
Triangle 2 is 5 centimeters long.

00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:10.271
Triangle 1 is blank centimeters
blank than Triangle 2.

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:13.884
Well, Triangle 1 is 2 centimeters
shorter than Triangle 2.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:15.881
3 is 2 less than 5.

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:18.587
It's going to be 2 centimeters shorter.

00:02:18.587 --> 00:02:21.071
Remember, Triangle 1, we see it's shorter

00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:22.468
it's smaller than Triangle 2,

00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:23.710
so it makes since that it's shorter.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.398
How much shorter?

00:02:24.398 --> 00:02:26.464
2 centimeters because 3 centimeters

00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:28.635
compared to 5 centimeters.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:30.346
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:30.522 --> 00:02:32.857
Rectangle 1 is blank centimeters long.

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:34.649
We can just look right over here.

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.286
It's 9 centimeters long.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.180
We have one end of the ruler
at one end of the rectangle,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.363
and then we just measure
off 9 centimeters.

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:44.289
Rectangle 2 is, well,

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.748
it looks like it's 6 centimeters long.

00:02:47.178 --> 00:02:49.370
6 centimeters long.

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:51.705
Rectangle 1 is longer,

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:55.490
and it's 3 centimeters
longer than Rectangle 2.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.428
9 centimeters is 3 centimeters
more than 6 centimeters.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.087
It's 3 centimeters longer.

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:03.571
Rectangle 1 is the longer Rectangle.

00:03:04.124 --> 00:03:05.497
Then, we're done.
