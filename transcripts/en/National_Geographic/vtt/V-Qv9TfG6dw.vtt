00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.133
There are always consequences
to what we create,

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.533
often unintended.

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.033
And some can cause
serious problems.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.934
But sometimes, those unintended
consequences are for the best.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:13.300
Nowhere is this more true
than with our advancements

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.900
in transportation.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.066
One early ride came to symbolize
freedom for an entire gender.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:27.100
Illinois, 1893, Frances Willard,
the famous fighter for women's

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.500
rights, experienced
the wind in her face

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.200
for the very first time on
the seat of a safety bicycle.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.533
AMANDA FOREMAN: I
think it's hard for us

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.967
to imagine today what it
is like to be literally

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:39.633
trapped inside your own house.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.433
Women were literally trapped
at home in the 19th century.

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:44.433
Their clothes trapped them
because they were so heavy.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.400
They weighed up to 25 pounds.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.967
And they couldn't get about.

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.800
They were dependent on a man
to either put them on a horse

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.600
or put them in a carriage
and take them there.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.433
The bicycle offered
them a way of freedom.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:01.900
How do you ride it?

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.300
With great courage
and dexterity,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.934
of which you are very capable.

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:09.900
And how do you peddle wearing
such cumbersome things?

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.834
Carefully.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:12.533
[chuckles]

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.266
Your turn.

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:19.367
She who succeeds in gaining
the mastery of the bicycle

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:21.533
will gain the mastery of life.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.967
And the two things
that must occupy

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:27.066
your thoughts to the
exclusion of everything else--

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.667
First, the goal.

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:29.900
Indeed.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.633
And today's goal
will be that plow.

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:35.200
OK, then.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.166
The first is the
goal and the second?

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.433
The momentum
requisite to reach it.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.133
Exactly.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.400
Don't look down.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.000
Aim directly for your goal.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.600
Look straight ahead, not at me!

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.734
Oh.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:50.567
[chuckling]

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:51.400
ANNA GORDON: Oh!

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.200
[clang]

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:56.400
[laughter]

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:19.800
Go home to your husband!

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.600
It's the same as
with all reforms.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.867
Sometimes they seem to lag,
then they barely balance,

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:41.467
and away they go again, as
merrily as if they'd never

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.166
been threatened to stop at all.

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:50.934
Ooh.

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:51.767
Oh.

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:52.767
We made it.

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:54.900
[laughter]

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.867
Hello.

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:57.333
Hello, lovely to see you.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:59.400
HOST: The freedom of movement
Frances Willard found

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.533
on her bicycle helped her
give her speech on time,

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:04.633
a speech about another
kind of freedom--

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:05.400
[cheering]

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.600
--equal rights for women.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.934
And let them know the world
was made for women too.

00:03:11.934 --> 00:03:14.633
[cheers, applause]
