00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:04.890
Dan!

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.030
Thanks for coming!

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I heard you wanted to talk
about Sunshine, great app isn't it?

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.354
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great learning exercise,

00:00:13.354 --> 00:00:16.830
and with a little more polish
it could be a great prototype.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.310
&gt;&gt; Prototype?

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.330
I thought we were done with Sunshine.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.420
Wasn't that what the great
party was all about?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.700
&gt;&gt; Well, you're half right.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.405
It was a great party.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.320
Look, Sunshine does function,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.500
but we've got a long way to go
before it's production ready.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.080
Remember, it's that last 10% of
polishing those unique features that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.040
make all the difference to real users.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.510
Get it ready for real users, and then
you'll be ready for your own lab coat.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.010
Maybe.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.530
&gt;&gt; Well, sure, I had a couple things
in mind that we didn't get to.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.800
&gt;&gt; Great.
I thought you'd have some ideas.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.780
And I've brought in some extra help for
you to get it done.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.378
You need to go talk to the fix-it team.

00:00:58.378 --> 00:00:59.975
&gt;&gt; So I guess I should be leaving now?

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:06.601
Here's to more Sunshine.

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:16.601
[MUSIC]

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:25.889
So, I've got this app, and
it's not production quality,

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:31.840
and students are watching,
and I need your help.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.978
&gt;&gt; Sure, we can take a look.

00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:34.913
[SOUND] Yeah.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.303
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:39.426
&gt;&gt; Oh my.
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:42.428
Mm, well,
this is certainly functional and

00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:46.480
we can work with you to help
you make it production ready.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.470
&gt;&gt; Awesome,
what do we need to do to get started?

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.800
&gt;&gt; I think it would be good to hear from
you on exactly where Sunshine is now.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.190
&gt;&gt; No time like the present.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.690
Let's go.
