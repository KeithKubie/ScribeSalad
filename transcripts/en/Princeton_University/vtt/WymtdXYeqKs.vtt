00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:09.649
My name is Waqas Jawaid, and I trained
to be an architect at Princeton.

00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:14.531
I majored in architecture and graduated
in 2010.

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:19.505
My name is Andy Chen, I graduated from
Princeton in 2009.

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:24.435
I studied sociology and
I got a certificate in East Asian studies.

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:33.539
Waqas and I met at Princeton. We've been
creative and professional partners,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.010
I think, for a majority of the time 
that we've known each other.

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:38.563
It's been nine years.

00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:42.323
I was born in Karachi, Pakistan.

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:46.740
I guess I practiced art in all levels and
A-levels and I was really excited

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.860
to go to Princeton 
because there seemed to be a

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.882
great number of opportunities there to
pursue the arts.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:56.242
My greatest inspiration
was Professor Esther da Costa Meyer,

00:00:56.548 --> 00:00:58.979
who is in the Art and Archaeology Department.

00:00:59.252 --> 00:01:02.771
Her introductory course to modern
architecture and its theory

00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:05.891
was one of the reasons 
I decided to major in architecture.

00:01:06.418 --> 00:01:09.107
I grew up in Los Angeles 
to Taiwanese immigrants.

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:12.036
The arts were not a priority, 
except for piano

00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:14.851
which is, I think, 
just what you did

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:16.772
because you're an obedient child.

00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:20.803
Surprisingly, the most influential professor 
I had at the Lewis Center was Tim Vasen

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.306
who taught theater.
He basically argued that you can't control

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:29.445
the art, it corresponds to the reality
around you, and taught me so much

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:31.379
about, you know, what it meant 
to be an artist,

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:35.187
and to be directing other artists to do
creative work.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.548
The Student Design Agency came about
because me and somebody from

00:01:38.771 --> 00:01:41.924
the class of '07 who was a really 
good friend, Tiffany Wang,

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.531
she thought there were so many 
student organizations that needed design.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.289
I had only started to do graphic design. 
We ended up being extremely successful, very quickly.

00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:55.278
Our studio Isometric was founded in 2013,

00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:58.059
shortly after I graduated 
from graduate school at RISD.

00:01:58.252 --> 00:02:01.933
Isometric creates design that promotes
inclusion, equality, and progress.

00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:06.156
We basically use instruments of mainstream
culture and adapt it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.453
to think about the dignity 
of marginalized people.

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.667
Morven actually approached us through the
Student Design Agency, and they wanted

00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:20.955
to somehow comprehensively portray the
lives of Charles &amp; Anne Morrow Lindbergh.

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:25.548
Morven was a great experience at
doing an exhibition, and this is

00:02:25.756 --> 00:02:29.037
our first museum exhibition 
that's going to last a whole year.

00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:32.637
So they asked us for exhibition panels, 
and we're like, "That's no fun at all!"

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:36.476
And we showed them, like, you
scale in this old mansion house, you know,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.325
take the history of the house and reinvent
it for today. The reasoning was that

00:02:41.548 --> 00:02:44.717
we want people to engage with it on a
visceral level. We want people to stand

00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:49.484
in the aura of these people, and at the same
time strip that aura away

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:51.774
so that you could see their humanity.

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:57.053
All the design was catered to an
older audience but at the same time

00:02:57.246 --> 00:02:59.614
making it accessible to younger people 
as well, you know,

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:02.716
the height of the benches, 
the size of the typography.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.532
The curators were incredibly responsive 
to our thinking. They loved

00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:12.305
the idea of taking this old mansion house 
and turning it into basically

00:03:12.528 --> 00:03:14.226
what is similar to a modern art gallery.

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:16.960
We work as equal partners.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.944
Every single decision we have to discuss
and decide together. I'm all about lists

00:03:23.232 --> 00:03:27.280
and organization and planning, and you
know, who does what, and

00:03:27.537 --> 00:03:32.736
Andy is a lot more free and open 
in the creativity.

00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:40.021
We spend a lot of time walking outside
of here, walking away from the studio,

00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:44.241
even if it's in the middle of the day, and
things, there's a little bit of friction,

00:03:44.513 --> 00:03:47.889
we'll say, "Let's step outside," and we'll
go out and go talk.

00:03:48.147 --> 00:03:51.745
So that's how we kind of make decisions 
and come to an understanding

00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:55.457
which ultimately has to be 
on a professional and rational level,

00:03:55.665 --> 00:04:02.210
but also on a personal level, like, you know,
I get you, I understand you. I hear you.

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:06.241
Let's do it in a way that works 
for everybody.
