00:00:00.572 --> 00:00:03.238
Now let's figure out how
much the single person

00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:07.402
making $50,000 a year would
pay in state income taxes,

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:10.004
assuming that they're in a
state that has income taxes.

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.870
And this right here are the
current tax brackets for my state

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.535
and every state will have
different income tax brackets and

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:18.270
they're likely to change year
after year, but the important

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.291
thing to take away is just
how all of this is calculated.

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:24.075
So at the state level, you
still get ... you still,

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:26.292
or at least at the state I'm in,
there is a standard deduction.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:31.436
It's $3,769 for a single
filer, for a single person.

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:33.403
And instead of having a personal exemption

00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:35.240
which reduces your taxable income,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.353
which is we saw at the federal level.

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:40.070
They have a tax credit,
a personal tax credit

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.337
which essentially just
a credit on your taxes.

00:00:42.337 --> 00:00:44.202
So this doesn't reduce
your taxable income.

00:00:44.202 --> 00:00:45.563
This can actually be used against

00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:48.004
the actual taxes that you owe.

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:49.207
So first, let's think about what our

00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:51.896
taxable income is in my state.

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:54.803
So I'm starting with $50,000.

00:00:54.803 --> 00:00:57.136
$50,000 is my gross income

00:00:57.136 --> 00:01:00.004
and then I have a standard
deduction in my state.

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:06.896
A standard deduction in my
state of 3,769 ... $3,769

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:14.971
gets me to taxable income in
my state of $46,231 or $46,231.

00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:16.070
Now if you look at these brackets,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.669
it looks like we are falling into
this 8% bracket right over here,

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:21.670
but just as we've said in this
... in the federal example,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.480
that does not mean we pay 8%
on all 46,000 ... $46,231.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.563
It means we only pay
the 8% on the increment

00:01:29.563 --> 00:01:34.004
above $37,005. For the rest
of the brackets, we pay

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:38.938
1% on the first 7,000 or for
$7,124, 2% on the increment

00:01:38.938 --> 00:01:42.737
up to 16,980. So on and so forth.

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:45.004
So let's calculate what that is.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:50.269
So we're going to pay ...
We're going to pay 1% ... 1%

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:58.313
on the first $7,124. Then to
that, we're going to pay 2%.

00:01:58.313 --> 00:02:05.069
We're going to pay 2% on
the increment up to $16,980

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:12.812
and that increment is
$16,980 - $7,124 and then

00:02:12.812 --> 00:02:17.480
we are going to pay 4%
... We're going to pay 4%

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.562
on the increment up to
$26,657 and so that's

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:34.936
that number minus 16,890
and then we're going to pay

00:02:34.936 --> 00:02:38.774
6% ... We're going to pay 6%

00:02:38.774 --> 00:02:44.137
on the increment up to $37,005.

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:50.238
So it's 37,005 - 26,657

00:02:50.238 --> 00:02:52.587
and then, we're in the home stretch here,

00:02:52.587 --> 00:02:56.812
we're going to pay ...
We're going to pay 8% on the

00:02:56.812 --> 00:03:01.480
increment ... on the
increment above $37,005.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.564
So our taxable income,
we already saw is 46,231.

00:03:05.564 --> 00:03:12.937
So it's 46,231 - 37,005.

00:03:12.937 --> 00:03:19.146
37,005 bring us to ... Did
I type all that in right?

00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:23.099
Let's see, 7 x 1% and then we have 2% x,

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.515
yep that looks right and then we have 4%.

00:03:25.515 --> 00:03:28.008
I want to make sure I'm
typing all this in correctly.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:32.671
And then 37,000 - 26,657
and then that's 6% and then

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:37.336
8% on that last increment.
Drum roll, please.

00:03:37.336 --> 00:03:42.813
We get to $2,018 just based on
the brackets right over here.

00:03:42.813 --> 00:03:47.671
So 2,000 ... So at the ... at the
state level ... At the state level,

00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:50.735
it looks like we have $2,018
just based on our taxable

00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:54.403
income, but now we have to
factor in this tax credit

00:03:54.403 --> 00:03:56.479
and a tax credit as opposed
to a deduction, remember,

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.403
a deduction or an exemption
takes ... It reduces your taxable

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:04.063
income. A credit goes
directly against your taxes.

00:04:04.063 --> 00:04:08.336
So we were going to pay
$2,018, but we get a credit

00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:12.337
of $102, which gets us to what?

00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:20.513
That gets us to 1,916 ...
$1,916 in state taxes.

00:04:20.513 --> 00:04:24.737
So our total taxes, $9,754
at the federal level.

00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:30.737
$1,916 at the state level and
so our actual take home pay

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.738
is going to be ... Let's
see, $50,000 is what we're

00:04:33.738 --> 00:04:36.896
starting with. We're going
to pay ... We're going to pay

00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:38.197
at the federal level.

00:04:38.197 --> 00:04:39.730
I actually already figured
out in the last video

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.403
what we're left with, but at
the federal level we're going to

00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:44.480
start off ... We're going to pay $9,754.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.146
Then at the state level, we're
going to pay $1,916 getting us

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:58.404
to $38,330 take home pay.
$38,330 ... 330, is what I'm

00:04:58.404 --> 00:05:04.059
actually ... I'm actually
going to be able to spend.

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.145
And so based on this, we can
figure out what an effective

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:10.146
tax rate is, based on both the
federal and state income tax.

00:05:10.146 --> 00:05:14.671
So we are ... If we look at that
as a fraction of our original

00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:21.736
income, $50,000, we are left
with 76.6% or another way of

00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:28.729
thinking about it is, roughly
23.4 or 23â…“ % of your income

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.813
gets taken for taxes. That
is your effective tax rate.

00:05:31.813 --> 00:05:33.736
So effective tax rate
... Let me write this.

00:05:33.736 --> 00:05:39.981
Effective ... Effective tax rate
and then we're including both

00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:45.032
federal ... federal +
state ... federal + state,

00:05:45.032 --> 00:05:46.205
just look at the number again.

00:05:46.205 --> 00:05:52.646
You're keeping 76.6, so you are
paying 23.4 ... 23., actually,

00:05:52.646 --> 00:06:00.204
it looks like 23.34. So
approximately 23, approximately 23%.

00:06:00.204 --> 00:06:02.737
If you want to think on a monthly basis,

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:08.504
at $50,000 you thought ...
So $50,000, you thought

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:13.069
that you would be taking
home $4,166 a month,

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.562
but now you're actually going
to be taking home $3,000 ...

00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:23.758
38,330 / 12. You're only going
to bring home about $3,000,

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.670
a little bit under $3,200 a month.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.670
So you have to plan accordingly.
