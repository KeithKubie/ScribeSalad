00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.805
I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT MY SELF-CENTERED ASS

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:08.342
JUST SCORED WITH THE HOTTEST,
SEXIEST WOMAN

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.676
IN THE WHOLE WORLD!

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.811
- I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.913
- AND, SHE ONLY WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT ME.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:15.182
SHE DIDN'T WASTE MY TIME
TALKING ABOUT HER.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.051
OH, YEAH, AND WE HAD THE WILDEST
SEX YOU COULD IMAGINE.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:19.653
IT WASN'T UNTIL
IT WAS ALL OVER

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.256
THAT SHE FINALLY ASKED FOR
SOMETHING FOR HERSELF.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.290
- WHAT WAS THAT?

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.558
- $500.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.059
I'M ASSUMING
IT WAS FOR CAB FARE.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:28.495
AND I'M ASSUMING THE CAB HAD TO
TAKE HER TO A DIFFERENT STATE.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.796
I'M ASSUMING,
MEXICO.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.266
- STEVE, I THINK
THAT WOMAN WAS A--

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.267
HOW SHOULD I
PUT THIS?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.535
- THAT BITCH WAS A HO!

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.703
- DON'T TALK ABOUT
LADY TANQUERAY LIKE THAT!

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:39.206
BESIDES, IF SHE
WAS A PROSTITUTE,

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.974
WHY DIDN'T I
WEAR A CONDOM?

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.076
RIGHT?

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.414
- STEVE, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I WARNED YOU ABOUT

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.449
TAKING PART IN
HIGH-RISK BEHAVIORS?

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:50.651
- OH, MY GOD.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:52.519
SOMEONE JUST LEFT THIS
LAYING HERE?

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:55.322
WELL, IT IS
COLD AND FLU SEASON.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.790
IS THAT CORNED BEEF?

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.792
I'LL GIVE YOU THREE BUCKS
FOR A BITE OF THAT.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.261
WHO WANTS TO BECOME
BLOOD BROTHERS?

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.163
ALL OF YOU?
OKAY!

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:05.199
- FRANKLY, IT'S A
STATISTICAL MIRACLE

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.466
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
GOTTEN SICK YET--

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.501
- <i>SEE?</i>

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.535
- UNTIL NOW.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.870
- WHAT?

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.872
- STEVE, MEDICINE DOESN'T
HAVE WORDS TO DESCRIBE

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.874
HOW HORRIFIC
YOUR ILLNESS IS.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.676
I'VE NEVER
SEEN IT BEFORE, BUT--

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.445
WELL, TRY TO IMAGINE IF
SYPHILIS DID IT WITH CANCER

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.646
AND GOT FULL-BLOWN AIDS.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.748
- CAN-A-SYPHIL-AIDS?

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:24.451
- YES,
CAN-A-SYPHIL-AIDS.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.119
THAT HAS A NICE
RING TO IT, STEVE.

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:28.088
THE GOOD NEWS IS, YOU'LL ONLY
BE SICK FOR TWO WEEKS.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.189
- YES!
