00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.255
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.810
PENDO O'DONOHOE: So
absolutely delighted to have

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.460
Zim visit us today,
and talk to us

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.410
a little bit about how
she's managed to build

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.724
an unconventional company.

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:16.390
So Zim, first and foremost, tell
us a little bit about yourself.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.240
Because you've got
an impressive resume,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.570
which goes from being a
biologist to various things.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.050
And finally, entrepreneurship.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.390
So tell us how that's
all come about.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.297
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: OK.

00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:28.520
Ooh, where do I start?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.020
OK.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.370
So I was born and
raised in Minnesota.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.390
I was one of those kids
that loved to get lost.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.540
So I was always
wandering around.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.120
My mom often tells me the
story of how I let myself out

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.880
of the apartment that we
were staying at when I was--

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.967
I think I was one.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.300
It was the middle of the winter.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.000
And I walked around
the parking lot

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.520
until child services
came to pick me up.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.210
And so she likes to
tell me that story.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.810
And so I linked that to--

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.300
kind of to what I'm doing now.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.940
I'm kind of a wanderer at heart.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
After I left Minnesota, I
was about eight years old.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.720
I moved to North Carolina,
and I got into biology

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.250
my freshman, sophomore,
junior year of college.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.960
And at the age of
19, I cloned a gene.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.740
I was one of those, like
nerdy kinds of kids.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.610
I was crushing fruit flies and
was doing really weird things.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.400
And so that led me to
traveling around the state

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.500
to talk about my research.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.680
I also teamed up
with my best friend

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.664
who did a lot of anti-tobacco
work at the time.

00:01:42.664 --> 00:01:44.080
And we traveled
around the country

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.780
talking to young people
about big tobacco

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.480
and how to protect
ourselves against them.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.410
And so after that,
I did some travel.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.870
I went and I moved to DC.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.700
I moved to San Francisco
to organize churches--

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.540
or pastors of those churches
in the Fillmore District,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.439
which is the oldest black
neighborhood in San Francisco.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.850
And then, I moved back to North
Carolina for my senior year.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.440
I had five years of university.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.840
I stayed an extra year.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.050
And I started an organization
to help open a civil rights

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.160
museum.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.870
It was a museum that hadn't been
open for, I think, 14 years.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.960
Come on in.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.560
Sorry.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.286
I definitely put
you on the spot.

00:02:29.286 --> 00:02:32.730
I'm sorry.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.760
And so my senior year,
this museum opened.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.510
And I decided that I wanted
to do something a little bit

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.750
different.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.130
Instead of traveling and
living in San Francisco and DC,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.500
I wanted to try
something international.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.790
So I applied for this
program, and I got it.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.240
And I sold everything that
I owned after I graduated

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.860
college, and I moved to India.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.670
So I was in India for
a little over a year.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.110
I learned Hindi.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.472
And I lived on a train
for a portion of the year.

00:03:05.472 --> 00:03:07.930
So I was just doing all of
these really interesting things.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.260
And I went to India with
braids similar to this.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.780
And so as my diaspora
folks know, at some point

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.310
the braids have to come out.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.800
So I took the braids out.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.950
And I didn't know what
to do with my hair.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.650
The hair of a lot of Indians
was very different from my own,

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.170
and I didn't have anything
to take care of it.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.380
So my hair started breaking.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.270
And I thought to
myself, you know,

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.060
I don't see any people
who look like me.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.850
I don't see any
travelers or any ex-pats

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.630
who I can talk to about
what's happening with my hair.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.860
And so the idea for Travel
Noire was born there.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.540
But I sat on it for two years.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.370
I traveled through Asia.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.800
I spent all of my
money, and ended up

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.340
broke back home in Southern
California at my mom's house.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.320
And so it's kind of--

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.330
Travel Noire kind of
started out of that.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.680
So it was the seed planted
while I was living in India,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.120
and then I kind of
came back to the US.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.790
My mom tried to get
me into medicine.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.900
As again, all of my diasporic
folks here, you all know.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.550
So I'm Nigerian.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.397
And for my mom, you were
either a doctor, a lawyer,

00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:22.480
an engineer, or a failure.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.490
Like anything
else, there was a--

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.770
there was this little box that
you kind of had to fit in.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.940
And so when I came home
after spending all my money

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.280
traveling, my mom
was like, yeah,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.590
so here's this nursing program.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.180
Here is this doctor's program.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.870
Here's this post-bac program.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.450
And after six months, I was
like, all right, I love you,

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.950
mom.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.892
But.

00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:44.350
I'm going to move
to San Francisco.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.560
So I had $300 in
my bank account.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.260
And somebody offered
a couch for me

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.130
in San Francisco
on Treasure Island.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.130
I don't know if anybody's
been to San Francisco,

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.160
but there's this little
island called Treasure Island.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.870
between San Francisco
and Oakland,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.370
if you were to cross
the Bay Bridge.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.180
So I lived there.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.930
I slept on a couch/bed
for six months.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.530
And I worked four jobs.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.040
And I had this
really interesting--

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.540
like I sold luxury sunglasses.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.700
I was a nanny, which
was very short-lived.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.660
And I helped my friend
start her company.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.140
And what else did I do?

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.050
And I was an intern
at a startup company.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.450
And being an intern at
that startup company

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.450
was what kind of
fine-tuned this idea

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.700
that I had for Travel Noire.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.960
So that is a very long
answer to your question,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.460
but I hope it gives
some background.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.626
PENDO O'DONOHOE: Absolutely.

00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:41.143
And it sounds like you chose
the failure option when

00:05:41.143 --> 00:05:43.090
it came to what the
Nigerian parents wanted,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.516
which is-- hence you
founding Travel Noire.

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:47.890
But tell us a little bit about
what Travel Noire actually

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.287
is, what it does, and who
your target audience is.

00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:52.120
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Sure.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.270
So started Travel Noire in 2013.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:01.540
And this was after not seeing
travelers who looked like me.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.260
If you go to any store, you
pull any travel magazine

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.710
off the stands, you'll never
see somebody who looks like me.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.836
You'll never see a black girl
in Italy, or in whatever.

00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:15.460
And what that meant
for a lot of people

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.370
was, if they didn't see somebody
who looked like them traveling

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.620
in all these different
places, they then

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.320
thought that it might have been
dangerous for them to travel,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.020
or that travel might
not be for them,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.570
or that travel is only
for the rich and famous,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.950
like Beyonce and
Jay-Z, or whatever.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.030
And so I wanted to bring
that down to earth.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.010
I mean, when I was
living in India,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.485
I was flying on Air Asia for
$8 to Malaysia from India.

00:06:40.485 --> 00:06:41.360
I mean, it was crazy.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.680
And so I wanted
people to know this.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.720
And so Travel Noire started
out as an editorial site.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.900
So we had about 100 writers who
lived all over the globe, who

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.580
shared their love of travel.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.640
And what it was like being
a person of color while they

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.140
traveled.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.150
I remember being in--

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.555
I think I was in
the Netherlands.

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:04.180
And somebody asked
me, they said, well,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.013
what's the difference
between a black person

00:07:06.013 --> 00:07:08.810
traveling, a black American
traveling, and a white American

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.310
traveling?

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.966
And I told them--

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:12.340
I gave them a
couple of examples.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.890
But one that stood
out was in China,

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.780
when I would go into a store
and I'd ask her for face wash,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.400
they'd give me skin
whitening cream.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.387
Or a kid would come
and try to rub off

00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:24.970
my skin thinking it
was dirt and there

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.550
was like white underneath.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.160
Or people who would
constantly pull my hair.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.310
There were all of these
different experiences that

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.220
were very unique to a
certain subset of people

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.750
that nobody was talking about.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.060
So we started out as
an editorial site,

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.500
and then we grew from that to
hosting live classes about how

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.590
to get your boss to let you
work from anywhere in the world,

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.430
or how to get paid to travel.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.970
And we started building
an audience that way.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.330
And one thing that I
learned that we did--

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.110
we didn't make
money for 18 months.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:02.260
So 18 months, we spent the
time building an audience.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.390
And we just offered
a lot of free things,

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.040
a lot of free classes.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.360
And when we did end up selling
a product, we sold out of it.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.250
And so we started as
an editorial site.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.900
We started doing a
lot of free things,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.300
And Then we launched
Travel Noire Experiences

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.076
in July of 2015.

00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:19.450
Travel Noire
Experiences, they're

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.650
small group experiences.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.790
About 14 people.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.670
They're 14 strangers from
anywhere in the world.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.460
They meet in one of
our seven destinations

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.470
and we take them for
the ride of their life.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:35.890
It was inspired by
my time in India.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.192
My time in India was
awesome, but it was also

00:08:38.192 --> 00:08:38.900
very challenging.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.641
Who in here has been to India?

00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:41.140
All right.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.680
So you all know
that India is not--

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.290
some people used to tell me,
oh, like India's like traveling

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.120
to like any other Asian country.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.350
Or it's like traveling
to any other country.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.380
And it's not.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.740
It's like very difficult.
It's very challenging.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.410
You either love
it or you hate it.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.160
And I thought to
myself, if India had not

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.090
been so challenging, I
would not have grown so much

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.130
or been so transformed by it.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.630
And so I thought
to myself, how can

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.260
I compress that into seven
days where you challenge people

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.660
enough that you know
they don't hate you,

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.040
because it's a vacation.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.450
But you also build in
moments of transformation.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.780
So on any one of
our trips, you'll

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.070
find days that challenge,
days that lift you up,

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.640
days that may make you upset.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.850
Like in Cape Town for instance,
we talk a lot about apartheid.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.330
In Jobar, we talk a
lot about apartheid.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.870
And we go and talk to people.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.036
And we go into people's
homes and we cook with them.

00:09:37.036 --> 00:09:40.330
And so the idea behind
those experiences

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.820
is that they are an experience.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.430
It's like you're living
just like a local, which

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.870
isn't easy in a lot of places.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.660
And so we launched
TN Experiences.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.770
We run about 60 trips a
year across 5 continents.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.470
Each trip comes with a
private photographer.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.100
And that's because I didn't want
people to look through travel

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.040
through their phone.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.560
I wanted people to be present.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.290
And I wanted people to
really enjoy the moment,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.110
and enjoy conversations,
and not try and gram

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.750
everything, or Snapchat
everything, or tweet things.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.490
And so those are
the experiences.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.980
They're typically seven
days, eight nights.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.120
Seven days, six nights.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.250
And then, we launched
Compass earlier this year,

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.120
which is a platform that
helps travelers travel better.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.050
So if you want to move abroad,
if you want to travel solo,

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.840
if you want to move
your family abroad,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.090
we have resources that we
deliver every single week

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.110
to help you do that.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.840
So that's what Travel Noire is.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.290
And I always tell everything
in a story, just so you know.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.949
So sometimes, the answers are
very long, but bear with me.

00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:45.490
PENDO O'DONOHOE:
We'll remember them.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.990
ZIM UGOCHUKWU:
You'll remember them.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.714
PENDO O'DONOHOE:
So that step off

00:10:49.714 --> 00:10:51.630
towards being an
entrepreneur is obviously one

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.660
that some people are
a bit nervous about.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.240
How did you find it?

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.810
What emotions did
you go into when

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.420
you were making that decision
and actually deciding that this

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.920
was going to be for you

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.100
well the decision was made for
me I didn't make the decision.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.050
So two days before
my birthday actually

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.590
my boss sent me an
email firing me.

00:11:16.154 --> 00:11:19.800
So it was two days
before my birthday,

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.144
and I think two weeks
before a vacation

00:11:22.144 --> 00:11:23.310
that I was supposed to take.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:30.060
And that kind of forced
my hand, you know?

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.790
I was planning on leaving
a couple of months later,

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.790
but it was such a
blessing because had I

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.830
left a couple of months
later on my own terms,

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.870
I wouldn't have
gotten the severance.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.230
But since she fired me, I was
able to keep that severance,

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.560
which went into
this pocket of mine

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.900
to help me kind of live
for the next 18 months

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.520
that Travel Noire
didn't make any money.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.170
And so entrepreneurship,
I would say,

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:59.670
is probably the hardest
thing I've ever done.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.790
Anybody who is an
entrepreneur or who has been

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.800
will probably say
the very same things.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.280
I mean, just a couple of
months ago, I was like,

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.100
what if I just give it all up?

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.020
And just buy a
little house in Italy

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.110
with no internet,
no electricity,

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.250
and just look at the water?

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.307
I'll be fine.

00:12:18.307 --> 00:12:18.890
I'll be quiet.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.700
I'll live a nice,
quiet existence.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.940
Every entrepreneur has talks
like that with themselves.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.410
And it's a matter of
really understanding

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.610
your mission and what you are
called to do in this world.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.090
And it's hard.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.350
It's not easy.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.160
We have a team.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.320
I have a team of full-time
folks of eight people.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.355
But you count all of
our contractors in

00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:45.000
and that brings it up to 30.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.940
You're holding these
people's lives in your hand.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.620
And you know, every
move that you make,

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.830
their livelihood depends on it.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:59.880
And that pressure of having
to figure out whether or not--

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.010
you have this really
great idea, but it's not

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:02.894
financially feasible.

00:13:02.894 --> 00:13:03.810
But you want to do it.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.150
You can't do it because
you have these--

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.730
you have the livelihoods of
these people in your hands.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.780
People who have families.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.550
People who are
considering proposing

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.870
to their significant others.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.770
You have all of these
different things.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.420
And so it's been a challenge,
but it's also pretty beautiful.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.790
I mean, you build
something out of the dust.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.410
And one of the things that
I thought was really cool,

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.980
last year in January, we
had a team of four people.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.310
And got a tweet one
morning in January

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.700
that we had been named
by Fast Company as one

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.620
of the most innovative
companies in the world.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.420
And it was kind of
mind-blowing because we

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.480
were such a small
team, but it was

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.680
kind of validating, too, that
anybody with an idea that

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.310
has a penchant towards
execution can really

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.700
do some good in the world.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.274
And so that's what I've
learned about entre--

00:13:57.274 --> 00:13:59.190
there's a lot that I've
learned around entre--

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.440
I could talk about it all day.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.520
But it's really hard.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.450
And I tell people.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.850
People ask me what
their advice is

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.220
for want-to-be entrepreneurs.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.210
And a lot of times, I
tell them not to do it.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.470
And I know that's really
bad, but it really is hard.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.260
And when you think
about entrepreneurs

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.510
that are charismatic
specifically,

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:24.270
they have a higher
rate of depression.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.730
Being a charismatic
entrepreneur,

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.242
who are you going to talk
to when things go wrong?

00:14:30.242 --> 00:14:31.950
If you have a significant
other, perfect.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.930
But are there people
around you that

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.810
really understand the
perils and the plight

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.580
of being an entrepreneur?

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.010
And I know it's hard to
put into words for people

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.150
who aren't entrepreneurs.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.790
But sometimes, it can
get really challenging.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.840
But it's also beautiful.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.760
So there's a balance.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.550
So just to pick up on
your point around needing

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.480
to have other people
to talk to, who

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.167
have your mentors been over
your journey with Travel Noire.

00:14:55.167 --> 00:14:56.000
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Yeah.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.400
So I have a group of advisers.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.070
They all come from
different walks of life.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.885
But I also have a
group of entrepreneurs

00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:10.320
that I meet with maybe
four or five times a year.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.220
These are entrepreneurs
from all over the world.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.880
And we all come together
to talk about issues

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.140
and what we're going through.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.190
And one thing that
I've learned is

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.815
that no matter how
much money you make,

00:15:20.815 --> 00:15:22.250
you're still messed up.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.630
Everybody still has problems.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:24.824
Everybody has problems.

00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:26.990
You think when you get into
a room with somebody who

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.230
has a $200 million company
that they're just going

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.450
to be like relaxing and maxing.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.560
But it's just the problem's
magnified on a different scale,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.190
on a different level.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.640
And so that's one
thing that I've learned

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.860
is that your problems don't
go away when you got money.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.450
They're still there,
just in different ways.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.040
PENDO O'DONOHOE:
And congratulations

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.059
on being named one of
the Forbes 30 Under 30.

00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:52.100
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Thank you.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.520
PENDO O'DONOHOE:
That's absolutely

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.780
fantastic from last year.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.749
So apart from that particular
highlight, what other highs

00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:57.290
have you had?

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.330
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Other highs?

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.810
I would say having a team
of really cool people.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.490
You know, it's always
great when you're

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.310
able to work with people that
you get along with and people

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:16.930
who are just a lot of
fun, who are grounded

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.270
in the same mission
that you're grounded in.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.310
I can take a month
off and not have

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.510
to worry about anything
because they handle everything.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.780
And so I think that that's
been the biggest blessing.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.760
Launching Compass this year
has also been a big blessing.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.140
I'm trying to think.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.750
There have been so many highs.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:40.900
I tell my team not to get
caught up on all of them.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.780
So while we do celebrate
what we've got going on,

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.759
we are also still very rooted
in the work that we have to do.

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:49.300
Because we have more
people to reach.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.630
And we have more
people that we want--

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.090
more people whose lives
we want to help transform.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.530
And so we do celebrate the
wins, but then we go back

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.915
and we dive into the
work that we have to do.

00:17:03.915 --> 00:17:06.040
PENDO O'DONOHOE: And you
have hundreds of thousands

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.589
of followers on social
media at the moment.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.480
So what role has
digital actually played

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.770
in helping build your brand?

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.525
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Huge.

00:17:16.525 --> 00:17:18.880
You talk about millennials
today and how much

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.579
our lives are kind of
intertwined with social media.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:26.349
I remember I was first starting
the Travel Noire Instagram

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.369
account.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:30.820
It was so hard to
find black travelers,

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.540
like I would sit and browse
on Instagram for hours

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.740
to find one photo.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.870
And we would post
12 photos a day.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:44.000
So if you can imagine, it
was a lot of hard work.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.880
But over time, it got easier.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.320
People liked seeing themselves
featured in different places.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.920
So that made it
easier for people

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.960
to kind of tag their photos.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.640
So it's been such a great help.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.057
In fact, people,
when they tell me

00:17:57.057 --> 00:17:58.973
they've heard of Travel
Noire, the first place

00:17:58.973 --> 00:18:01.720
that they say that they've heard
of Travel Noire is Instagram.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.210
And so we use Instagram as
like the top of the funnel.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:09.070
And so a lot of times, when we
need somebody to do something,

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.770
we have a call to action,
we start on Instagram

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.540
or we start in email.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.610
And we direct people
where we want to go,

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.142
which has been really cool.

00:18:18.142 --> 00:18:19.100
PENDO O'DONOHOE: Great.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.370
And sort of back
to more your travel

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.590
and personal experiences.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.849
What's the craziest place
you've ever visited?

00:18:25.849 --> 00:18:28.015
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: The craziest
place I've ever visited?

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.980
Probably India.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.810
I will always say India
for any crazy adventure.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.240
Craziest place I've visited?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.560
So my boyfriend and
I, he came to India

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.610
while I was living there.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:51.520
And we took a bus, like
a 4 by 4 up to Kashmir,

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:58.540
which is the disputed territory
of India and Pakistan.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.560
And it was so beautiful, though.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.470
It was so beautiful.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.010
But it was quite
treacherous getting there.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.520
We had to sit in the--

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.430
it wasn't the trunk,
but it was like--

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.202
if you imagine a Jeep.

00:19:11.202 --> 00:19:12.160
And you have the chair.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.290
You have the driver's seat
and the passenger seat,

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.750
and then you have like
another row of seats,

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.250
we were in the back, like
where there were no seats, just

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.750
the floor.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.600
So we were just sitting in the
back looking at the outside.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:32.110
And we rode on this
canyon with no fence.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.030
It was the craziest thing.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.040
It was the craziest adventure.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.650
People die on that road.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.900
And you know, we
got stopped by--

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.540
there were either cows or
goats that were crossing

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.690
and it caused a
whole traffic jam.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.920
And for those that have been
to India, you know how cows do.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.390
They just do whatever they do.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.770
And everybody just stops.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:58.460
But it was cool.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.180
It was fun.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:19:59.680
PENDO O'DONOHOE: Great.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.660
I'm just going to open
it up to the audience,

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.910
to see if anyone has got
any questions for Zim.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.312
We've got a mike.

00:20:06.312 --> 00:20:07.240
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.581
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Thank you.

00:20:12.581 --> 00:20:13.830
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much, Zim.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.690
I love the way that you
answer questions in stories.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.732
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Thank you.

00:20:17.732 --> 00:20:19.148
AUDIENCE: So I was
just wondering,

00:20:19.148 --> 00:20:21.720
using what you know now, what
would you have told yourself

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.910
when you first decided
to start Travel Noire?

00:20:26.837 --> 00:20:28.420
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: That's
a good question.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.900
Back than, hm.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.440
I'd probably say have a
close relationship with God.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.380
And I think that--

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.550
so when I first started
Travel Noire, I had a team.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.510
But because we didn't
make any money,

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.700
we couldn't afford
to pay anybody.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.300
And I think that the way that
I treated people back then--

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.430
it wasn't bad.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.650
Like, I wasn't
yelling at people,

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.910
or kicking them, or
doing anything like that.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:09.140
But I think that had I had a
closer and tighter relationship

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.490
with God, I would
have been much calmer.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.240
I would have been
nicer to people.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.670
And so I think that's probably
one of the big things,

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:24.170
because I had a team fallout
before we hired a new team.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.460
So if you can imagine
running a company, and then

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.460
you lose your team.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.530
And then you kind of
have to start over.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.875
And then another thing that I
would say would probably be--

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.500
I don't know.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.630
Sometimes, because
we're not out there,

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.550
like we're not hosting
a lot of events

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:51.140
or we're not at every
event, people kind of

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.420
see us as standoffish or a
little secretive, or whatever.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.300
And it's not the case.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.080
Maybe it's just like the ethic
or the ethics or the drive.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.870
We just love our work and
we love doing good work.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.580
And sometimes, we
just get consumed

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.750
in doing that good work.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.020
But not being afraid to peek
out of the curtain every

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.760
once in a while and
say what's up to folks.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.310
Yeah.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.810
AUDIENCE: How did
you find your team

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.830
when you were starting off
when you couldn't offer them

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.544
any money?

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:28.380
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: So I think
everybody for the most part

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.680
has been really intrigued
with this idea about,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.910
like working from anywhere, or
working for a travel company.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:38.360
We have unlimited vacations
and we don't have an office.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:43.020
And so obviously, we couldn't
pay people back then.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.286
So before we could
pay people, I think

00:22:46.286 --> 00:22:47.660
people were just
really attracted

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.840
to the brand and the
culture of the brand.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.330
And people wanted
to be associated

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.670
with what we were doing.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:23:01.460
So it wasn't difficult
to find a team.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.730
I mean, it's always difficult
to find a quality, quality team.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.730
But it wasn't challenging to
find people who loved travel.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:11.090
Because back then,
not that there

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.340
was a small subset of
black folks traveling.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.570
There were a ton, but we
weren't all connected.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.740
And I think once people
found that nexus,

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.090
they kind of wanted to
gravitate towards it.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.540
So some people were
like old friends

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.010
that I brought
into this project.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.260
And some people-- we had
a fellowship program.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.060
And the fellowship
program, I taught you

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.000
how to earn enough miles
for a free vacation anywhere

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.500
you wanted in the world.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.280
And a lot of people
were like, oh, sure, OK.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.490
You're not paying me,
but you're showing me

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.340
how to travel for free.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.704
And that's like the
next best thing.

00:23:46.704 --> 00:23:49.120
AUDIENCE: First of all, your
work on Instagram is amazing.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.270
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Thank you.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.728
AUDIENCE: I'm one
of the people who

00:23:50.728 --> 00:23:52.570
found you through Instagram.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.774
So when you talk about
building of culture--

00:23:55.774 --> 00:23:57.440
previously, I used
to work for a startup

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.370
and that's one of the biggest--

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.080
I guess starting is
pretty tough to do it.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.890
How did you go about
building culture,

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.300
especially from Instagram?

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.900
Sort of getting
the follower base.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.270
Because you've got
lots of travelers

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.214
that you're sort of
connected in there.

00:24:13.214 --> 00:24:15.272
I guess you connected
a group of travelers

00:24:15.272 --> 00:24:18.040
all over the world on Instagram.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.610
I learned other peoples'
travels through that [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:21.680
Travel Noire.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.060
So how did you go about
doing that and just creating

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.320
this community?

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.490
And then my second question
was about the locations

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.410
that you have already listed.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.510
How do you go about selecting
those and organizing

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.320
the experiences?

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.570
For one, I lived in Cape Town.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.645
And most experiences you see
there is very touristy, which

00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:43.089
is you don't learn about the
history and what's going on,

00:24:43.089 --> 00:24:44.630
and the actual people
who live there.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.197
So how did you go
about creating?

00:24:46.197 --> 00:24:47.030
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Yeah.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:47.870
OK.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.270
I have very short-term
memory, so I'm

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:52.180
going to try and
remember both of them.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.120
OK, so the first question
was, how do we build culture?

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.360
Culture was an extension--
is an extension

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.770
of who we are as a team.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.020
So right when I had
that team fall-off,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.810
we had two people that stayed.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:08.384
And so what I did was
I said, all right.

00:25:08.384 --> 00:25:09.800
We got to build a
tighter culture.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.140
So we had a summer
culture project.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.010
And we worked.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.620
We had, I think,
Friday all hands

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.240
on deck for like two months.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.800
And we built out
the entire culture.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.700
We built, all right.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.230
We want unlimited vacations.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:24.187
We want to be able to
work from anywhere.

00:25:24.187 --> 00:25:26.770
I feel like now if I went back
to my team and said, all right,

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:26.960
y'all.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.640
We're going to put
an office in Chicago,

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.740
they would like
revolt. They really

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:35.040
love being able to
work from anywhere.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.920
We pay their cellphone bills.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.720
Like We have all of
these different things

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.580
that we do to make it easy
to work for Travel Noire.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.540
And so our culture was an
extension of who we are.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.540
So everything is figureoutable
is one of our tenets.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:56.810
And that just means
that if I can't find--

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.760
if I flip this chair
over, even if it doesn't

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.570
have a name on it,
I will find out

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.570
who made this chair
some way, somehow.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.490
And that's one of the
cultures of the team.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.580
That's one of the tenets
for our culture of the team

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.950
is that if we can't find
a solution right away,

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.200
we figure it out.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.030
And so every time we are
considering candidates,

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:24.770
we run them through a really
interesting questionnaire.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.480
I don't know if it's similar.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.030
Google used to have
something where it was like,

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.730
so how many pennies are in
the Empire State Building,

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.720
or something like that.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.580
PENDO O'DONOHOE: We got
rid of those questions.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:33.860
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Yeah.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.360
So you got rid of
those questions.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.500
We actually have that.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:42.080
We have the pennies
question in one of our forms

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.390
because it goes back
to that everything

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:45.710
is figureoutable value.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.470
Instead of telling
me what the number is

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.652
for that particular-- like how
many pennies are in the Empire

00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:54.230
State Building, you can ask
me questions like, is there

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.750
furniture in the lobby?

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.780
How many people are there?

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:04.370
Are the coins from the UK?

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.670
Are they American
pennies, like whatever.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.690
It allows us to see who people
are without them telling us who

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.030
they are, if that makes sense.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:22.219
So we also have one of our
values is be you, stay true.

00:27:22.219 --> 00:27:23.510
Everybody on our team is weird.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.390
Like the weirdest
people that I know.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.820
And I'm also weird.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.040
But I want people who come
into the Travel Noire team

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.040
to also feel like they
are welcoming their weird.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.340
And it's OK to be weird
because we're all weird, OK?

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:40.610
It's like a very--

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.320
kind of like a familial vibe.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.230
It's kind of almost how I
would imagine Google was back

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.662
in '90--

00:27:46.662 --> 00:27:47.870
PENDO O'DONOHOE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.850
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Back in '98.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.310
And so that's the
culture question.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:56.480
For the destination
questions, sometimes we

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.430
choose places based
on where I've been

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.860
or where some of
my staff has been.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.850
And then we go there.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:02.720
We travel there.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.900
And I remember
going to Cape Town.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.181
Who's been to Cape Town?

00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:07.680
All right.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.540
So we got folks who
have been to Cape Town.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.030
So when I landed in
Cape Town, I wanted

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.820
to build an experience
that I could relate to,

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.820
which was a black
Cape Town experience.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.677
But when I landed in Cape
Town, I stayed in Camps Bay.

00:28:21.677 --> 00:28:23.760
I don't know if y'all are
familiar with Camps Bay,

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.370
but it's like near the
water, near the ocean.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:30.360
And the only people of color
that I saw were the help.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.020
And I was like, hm.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.290
So in order to
build an experience

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.650
that I can relate to, I have to
find people who look like me.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.750
And so I was racking
my brain trying

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.000
to figure out how to build
a Cape Town experience that

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.410
was one that focused on
culture, meeting people.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.260
And so I ended up
figuring it out.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.452
And I remember we
were at a point

00:28:52.452 --> 00:28:54.660
where we were trying to
figure out whether to include

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.780
Robben Island in the tour.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.300
And I talked to
one of the guys who

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.720
grew up in Langa, which is the
township outside of Cape Town.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:09.750
And I said, I'm kind of
torn between Robben Island

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.700
and the District Six Museum.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.480
And we landed on
having those stories

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.370
told by the people
who lived them

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.680
themselves in the township.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.600
And so we encouraged
people on their free day,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.641
if they want to go to
Robben Island, to go there.

00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:26.370
But the guards in
Robben Island don't even

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.650
like giving the tours there
because it-- remind you,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.710
they're former prisoners
who spent their lives

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.931
in this prison.

00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:35.430
And they're now
forced, because they

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.888
have to make a
living-- nobody will

00:29:36.888 --> 00:29:38.520
hire them-- to
retell the stories

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.270
that were so painful for them.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:43.770
And so when building
that experience--

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.540
and all of our
experiences, really--

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.410
we have to be very sensitive
to all of these things.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:53.930
So people are paying for that
sensitivity, if you will.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.220
So understanding the
issues as they exist.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.810
People still go
to Robben Island,

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.610
and they find out
for themselves.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.500
Just like in Bali.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.750
We have an experience in Bali.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:06.390
People go to the elephant--
they're not elephant farms,

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.790
but they're like the elephant--

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.780
not sanctuaries, but
the elephant places.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.155
I don't know what
they're called.

00:30:12.155 --> 00:30:14.880
But people go there, and
then they come back sad.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.870
Like they realize for
themselves that this wasn't what

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:19.872
I expected.

00:30:19.872 --> 00:30:21.330
But we get a lot
of questions like,

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.670
why don't y'all include
an elephant tour?

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:24.700
Why don't you do x?

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.830
Why don't you do y?

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.470
And it's our job to
be mindful and to be

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.710
sensitive to how the locals
really live their lives.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:35.370
And how to create a
space where we're only

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.920
working with local vendors.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.160
We're building up economies
and things like that.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:46.320
So the mantra is travel to
meet people, not see things.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.260
So traveling to have
conversations with people.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.980
Sometimes, I know when
I've traveled in the past,

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.710
I would go to monuments
and take pictures.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.630
But at the end of the
day, what I really

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.060
remembered about the trip
were the people that I met

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.950
and the homes that
people invited me into.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.800
And the coffee shops we sat
at and talked and whatever.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.930
And so that's kind
of the philosophy

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.700
that we used to build
those experiences.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.860
Yeah.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.315
You're welcome.

00:31:12.315 --> 00:31:13.165
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:13.165 --> 00:31:15.605
So I have a question
around money.

00:31:15.605 --> 00:31:19.470
It's one question, but
multiple questions pop up.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:25.244
So [INAUDIBLE],, how can someone
transition from employment

00:31:25.244 --> 00:31:26.700
to entrepreneurship?

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.440
Because [INAUDIBLE]
employment, you're

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.602
being paid at the end, at
least on a specific date.

00:31:31.602 --> 00:31:33.566
So if you decide, you know what?

00:31:33.566 --> 00:31:35.114
I'm just going to
follow my dream,

00:31:35.114 --> 00:31:36.780
you need to be able
to generate revenue.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.680
Because at the end of the
day, you're a human being.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.034
You need a roof.

00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:39.700
You need to eat.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.720
You need clothes.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.790
You need everything.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:45.811
And you don't know how long
that business is going to--

00:31:45.811 --> 00:31:47.435
how long the business
will take to grow

00:31:47.435 --> 00:31:49.670
to be able to sustain the
current standard of living

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:50.610
that you have now.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.470
So that's something
that I think.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:54.920
And then again, the
question of passion.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.950
And also, being-- maybe that's
not the right word to use,

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:59.260
but realistic.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.980
So I'm passionate
about this idea.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.313
But at the end of the day, look.

00:32:02.313 --> 00:32:04.330
You got bills to pay, right?

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.845
So how do you manage?

00:32:06.845 --> 00:32:08.980
Because that's the
conversation that you need

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.420
to have with yourself, right?

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:10.830
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Yeah, for sure.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.840
AUDIENCE: So how do
you go about that?

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.494
Basically, this
whole money thing.

00:32:14.494 --> 00:32:15.910
And maybe the
[INAUDIBLE] question

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.210
would be, how do you know this
is the right time to stop?

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:20.340
Maybe you have a nice idea.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.770
You're working on it, but the
money's just not coming in.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:24.480
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Yeah.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.340
All right.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:27.840
OK.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.015
So first question was--

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:36.040
the first question was, I
know what you were getting at.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:36.590
OK.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.872
So when I was living in
San Francisco, after I

00:32:38.872 --> 00:32:40.080
spent all my money traveling.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.538
I lived with my
mom for six months.

00:32:41.538 --> 00:32:45.030
I moved to San Francisco,
and I had all those jobs.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.890
I had a $3 a day budget.

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:51.810
So it was either I used
that $3 for the bus or I

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.280
used it to eat food.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.640
And with any startup--

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.490
well, not any startup, but a lot
of startups in San Francisco.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:58.350
They had free food.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.760
Just like y'all do at Google.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.910
So I was able to
kind of offset that.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:06.000
But $3 a day is not
a lot, you know?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.730
At all.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.730
And so that was the budget
that I had for six months.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.160
So when you think
about-- and not

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.350
every entrepreneur's
journey is like that.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.740
But a good number
of folks, when they

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:20.440
leave their high-paying
jobs, maintaining

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.860
that standard of living,
you have to reconcile that.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.620
Because if you're
making six figures

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:30.840
and you are trying to start
a company that is making $0,

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.677
if you quit your job,
then you're not--

00:33:35.677 --> 00:33:37.260
the numbers aren't
going to shake out.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.610
So I remember after I
got fired from my job,

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.280
those checks stopped
coming, but I had saved--

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.790
I think I saved maybe,
like $15,000 or something.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:51.360
But that was for the next 18
months that I had to live.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.340
Like $15,000 for 18 months?

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.610
That's not a lot of money.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.740
And so I had to move
out of my apartment.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.380
I was living in San Francisco.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.710
I moved out of my apartment.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.660
And I just traveled
for six months.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:05.100
And so there are lots
of different ways

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.270
that you have to reconcile
what your passion is

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.159
and your current
standard of living

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.719
and how comfortable you are.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.920
You have to be comfortable
with being uncomfortable.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.977
Otherwise, at the
first sign of hardship,

00:34:16.977 --> 00:34:18.060
you're just going to quit.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.960
And you're going to go back
to the high-paying job, which

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.340
I think is a lot-- it's a
danger for a lot of people.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.820
They don't give their
business or their idea

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.949
enough time to really incubate.

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:33.060
I started Travel Noire while
I still had my full-time job.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.909
So I started Travel
Noire in 2013.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:37.152
I got my job in 20--

00:34:37.152 --> 00:34:39.360
I started Travel Noire two
months after I got my job.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.880
So all I needed was
that security net.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.091
And I was like, OK.

00:34:43.091 --> 00:34:43.590
Boom.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.389
This idea, let's get it going.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:48.389
I started Travel Noire
and I didn't quit until--

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.100
well, I got fired.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.380
So I was forced into
entrepreneurship.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:57.720
But I ran with that idea
while I had a steady paycheck.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.510
I didn't quit the job, and
then start Travel Noire.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:02.999
So I think that's also
something to consider.

00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:03.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.290
I am also a huge
Travel Noire fan.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.300
So you were talking about how
one of the main things that

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.210
gets you through the tough times
is knowing what your mission is

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.770
and hanging onto that.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.520
So I'm wondering,
what is your mission,

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.240
personally or for the company?

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.790
And how did you come
about pulling it together?

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.480
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: I looked
back at my thread.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.320
So I took my mom to this, like
Oprah event a couple of years

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:27.820
ago.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.550
And Oprah said,
what's your thread?

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.091
What is the thing
you were doing when

00:35:31.091 --> 00:35:34.020
you were a child that you can
link to what you're doing now?

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.860
There was one story that
she gave of a girl who

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.880
loves to be organized.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.490
And she got a file cabinet
for her seventh birthday

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.560
and was the happiest
person ever.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.480
And now, she's like
one of the best

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.930
accountants in the country,
or something crazy like that.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.640
But what is that thing that you
were doing when you were young

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.290
that you stopped doing
because people maybe said,

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:56.914
oh, you can't make
any money with this?

00:35:56.914 --> 00:35:59.060
Or, oh, you can't do x.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.550
And tie that into the thing that
you were the most passionate

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:03.050
about.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.550
Right

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.800
So for me, my mom told me
this story when I was one

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.380
and I left the house.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.700
I just let myself out.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.520
And I was just walking around.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.650
I was probably
throwing snowballs,

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.620
like having a good-- making
snow angels as a one-year-old.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.100
And so she was like,
this was who you were.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.170
You were always
wandering around, trying

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.490
to find the newest adventures.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.372
And so I often tell
people, I will go

00:36:26.372 --> 00:36:27.580
anywhere that's not war-torn.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.290
And I want everybody
to feel the same way.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.950
That anywhere that you travel
to is your place to travel to.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.110
And you are welcome
in that place.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.960
And so I think that the
mission of Travel Noire

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.040
came out of that.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.124
Like, you also belong here.

00:36:47.124 --> 00:36:48.290
Just because you don't see--

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.248
I grew up in Minnesota.

00:36:49.248 --> 00:36:51.500
Minnesota is very white.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:56.090
I was like one of three
people in my class.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.670
And so I grew up living
a very different life,

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:03.009
like I was this one black
girl with the exotic name.

00:37:03.009 --> 00:37:04.550
People were like,
where are you from?

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:07.040
So I shortened my name to
Zim instead of [? Zimusa, ?]

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.312
which is my full name.

00:37:08.312 --> 00:37:09.770
And then I moved
to North Carolina,

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.650
where I was crushing fruit
flies and cloning gene.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.800
There were no other
black girls in my school

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.270
who were doing those things.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.630
And so I was always used
to just being the other.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.770
And it took me time to figure
out that that was also OK.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.380
And I wanted everybody
to be able to feel OK

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.810
with being other.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:31.490
And so I think the Travel
Noire mission kind of came out

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:32.750
of that.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.575
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:33.575 --> 00:37:34.010
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Hey.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:35.900
AUDIENCE: You sound like
the emails you send.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.182
Very [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:38.182 --> 00:37:41.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.850
With all that you
do and the team

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:50.560
that you manage, how do
you find time for self?

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.310
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Oh.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.180
So I block out--

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.760
so a couple of things.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.700
So from like 6:00 AM to 10:00
AM, I have just nothing.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.120
So I usually do a lot of
praying, or reading the Bible,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.310
or studying scripture,
or something like that.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.830
And then, I take a
one-week off per month.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:13.120
So I take one week off a month.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.210
And that usually doesn't
include vacations.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.180
So I kind of mix
those all in as well.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.970
I am one of the most
restful people you'll meet.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.520
I have friends that I
know that are really busy.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.890
I just have them block off
a month in their calendar

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:30.700
and send me an invite, so I know
that if they change the dates--

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.890
you know if you send
somebody a confirmation,

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.990
if you change the
time or whatever,

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.310
they get the notification.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.290
So if I get any
notification from my friends

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.005
that they moved their
ofttimes, I'm calling them

00:38:41.005 --> 00:38:42.880
and we're going to have
a serious discussion.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.430
And so I think that
rest is so important.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.230
Because who are
you without rest?

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.850
If y'all worked from January
to December with no days off,

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.100
y'all would be frizzle,
frazzle, shaken, gray hair,

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.750
hair falling out, everything.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.670
And you wouldn't be
of no use to anybody.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:02.470
And so I think that of the
things that I've learned,

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.320
you have some entrepreneurs that
are like, work till you die.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.160
Sleep.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.880
Like whatever.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.100
Like don't sleep ever.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.034
And I'm like, what?

00:39:10.034 --> 00:39:11.200
That doesn't make any sense.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.250
So I think that I've been very
intentional about the time

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.880
that I have to myself.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.577
Yeah.

00:39:17.577 --> 00:39:18.160
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:18.580
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Hey.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.913
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:39:19.913 --> 00:39:21.450
First of all, I
would like to know

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.440
what's next for Travel Noire?

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.170
And maybe, are there
any other industries

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.218
with a lack of representation
of people of color

00:39:29.218 --> 00:39:31.981
that you're looking into
branching into maybe?

00:39:31.981 --> 00:39:33.980
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: That's
actually, a good question.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.880
So for TN experiences,
more destinations.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.880
We're launching a new
destination this summer.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.990
We're also looking at
different segments.

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:46.640
So I know that I've gone
to a lot of conferences

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.140
where people who are
50-plus for instance,

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.410
will be like, I want
to go to your trips.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:55.190
Everybody on those trips look
like they're my children.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:56.870
They could be my kids.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:00.420
And so things like that.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.500
There are always places that
need more representation,

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.540
I think.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:08.330
We've thought about interiors.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.660
I mean, travel kind of
like intersects a lot

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.480
of different industries in
really interesting and unique

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.650
ways.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:19.070
So those are some of the
things that we're thinking

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.010
about in terms of what's next.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.399
Yeah.

00:40:22.399 --> 00:40:22.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:23.972
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Hey.

00:40:23.972 --> 00:40:26.430
AUDIENCE: When you were talking,
you talked about execution

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.460
and how that's important
for entrepreneurship.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.970
And when you answered
your question,

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.450
you talked also about
taking time for yourself

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.860
and having rest.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.942
And I feel like
most of us always

00:40:35.942 --> 00:40:37.400
have this illusion
that we're going

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.130
to do what's important now
and we're going to rest later.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:44.580
Were you like this since 1, or
did you have this moment of--

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.670
I think in six months when
it's going to take off,

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.643
I'll rest then?

00:40:50.116 --> 00:40:51.740
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: I was
actually working--

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.310
so when I moved to San
Francisco, I had the four jobs.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.670
So I was like a crazy person.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.945
And then when I got my
full-time job as a producer

00:41:00.945 --> 00:41:02.820
in San Francisco, and
I started Travel Noire,

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.490
I did those two
jobs simultaneously.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:09.230
So I would work on Travel
Noire from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM,

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:12.290
go to work from 9:00 to 5:00,
and then work on Travel Noire

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:13.880
from 5:00 to midnight.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.750
And then, like do it all over
again, until I got myself sick.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.450
And I wound up in a hospital.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:25.340
And then I realized like,
you can't do that forever.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.230
Like Hustle isn't
sustainable forever.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.900
There is a period and a
time and a place for it,

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.490
but it can't be
an everyday thing.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.340
And so then, that
was maybe in May.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.590
So then I was like, all right.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.230
So Travel Noire is
doing pretty good.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.740
I've saved up
enough money to be--

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.850
well, it wasn't enough.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:44.857
I mean, whatever.

00:41:44.857 --> 00:41:45.440
It's relative.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.740
But I was like, OK.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.640
So there has to be a time
limit for working these two

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.870
jobs simultaneously.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:56.130
They're both full-time jobs.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:42:01.520
And so July was my date that
I was going to say, all right.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.720
I'm out of here.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.630
But my boss had other plans.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.900
So yeah, I think
in the beginning,

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.140
it was very much like
work, work, work.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.630
Work, work, work
all the time, 24/7.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:19.010
But then you get sick and
you can't work anymore.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.390
If you don't give
your body rest,

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:22.100
your body's going to
force you to rest.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.130
And at the point where your
body is forcing you to rest,

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:27.890
you're like, just
no good to anybody.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.600
And so it's a
lesson that I've had

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.140
to learn time and time again in
those periods of like working,

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:33.950
working, working.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.780
My body is like, all
right, not today.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:39.240
And you just have to listen
because you can't do anything.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.040
So I think it's a constant
lesson that as entrepreneurs,

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.845
you're taught all the time.

00:42:45.845 --> 00:42:48.477
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
last question, sorry.

00:42:48.477 --> 00:42:50.935
Do you think the idea is more
important than the execution,

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:54.830
or is the execution [INAUDIBLE]
important than the idea?

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:55.950
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Execution.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:57.699
Execution is more
important than the idea.

00:42:57.699 --> 00:43:00.470
Because listen, when
I was living in India,

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:04.740
I had a spreadsheet of all
these ideas that I had.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.580
80% of them now exist today.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.710
I just had these ideas.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:09.770
And I was like, oh.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:12.220
I could be an idea machine.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.160
But if I don't execute on
them, they're just there.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.210
They just exist.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:20.720
And execution, like
you could find ideas.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.170
You could find ideas anywhere.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:25.700
But if you have an
execution mindset, then

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.045
any idea that comes your
way you can make happen.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.510
Execution.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.362
PENDO O'DONOHOE:
Well, on that note,

00:43:34.362 --> 00:43:36.070
I'll say thank you so
much for coming in.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:36.280
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Thank you.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.630
PENDO O'DONOHOE: I think it's
been an inspirational talk

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.260
on so many different levels.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.100
You've taught us that we
should follow our dreams, first

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.120
and foremost.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.910
You had this wanderlust
biting at the age of one,

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:49.500
which is pretty amazing.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.930
But also, the
importance of rest.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:52.997
And that it's not easy
to be an entrepreneur.

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:54.830
Running your own business
is not the nirvana

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.100
that some people think it is.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.146
But if you really hold on
and challenge yourself,

00:43:58.146 --> 00:44:00.020
and create a culture
within your own company,

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.600
it could be something that
your dreams are made of.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600
So thank you again.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.360
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: You
are a good summary.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.622
Like you have good summaries.

00:44:05.622 --> 00:44:06.538
I could never do that.

00:44:06.538 --> 00:44:07.690
PENDO O'DONOHOE: I'm going
to tell stories for you.

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:09.350
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: I can't
even remember what I

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.600
talked about five minutes ago.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.391
That's cool.

00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:11.890
Thank you.

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:12.230
PENDO O'DONOHOE: Brilliant.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.690
Thanks again.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:13.731
ZIM UGOCHUKWU: Thank you.

00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:16.760
