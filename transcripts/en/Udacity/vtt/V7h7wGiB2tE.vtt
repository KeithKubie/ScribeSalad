00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.250
Okay, let's take these one at a time. We

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.050
have two copies of a silent mutation in OCA2. Silent

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.160
mutations don't change amino acids. So we aren't going to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.620
expect any change in the overall function of the OCA2

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.590
protein. So it would be fully functional. And should

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.735
give us the brownest. Which should be a ranking of

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:20.370
one. Two copies of a nonsense mutation in OCA2. Nonsense

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.990
mutations are going to make a shortened protein. Probably dysfunctional largely,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.300
meaning it's not going to carry out it's normal function, is

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.210
likely to be bluer, but we're not sure if it'll be

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.720
the blue list yet, so let's actually take a look

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.560
at the last option. One copy of the mutation in the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.120
OCA2 promoter reducing transcription. Well, this doesn't sound as severe,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.260
right? We still have functioning copies of OCA2 But we just

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.110
don't have as many of them. So maybe we don't get

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.090
as much pigment. This doesn't sound as severe as this one.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.995
So this would be somewhere in the middle and this would be the bluest or three.
