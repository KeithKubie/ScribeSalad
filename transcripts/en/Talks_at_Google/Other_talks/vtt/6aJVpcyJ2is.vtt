00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
&gt;&gt; Well, welcome everybody to -- what I'm
happy to say is becoming a regular occurrence

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.160
here to another brewer series here in Google
New York.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.439
So, cheers to that, right? [clapping]
Today, I have the pleasure of introducing

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:25.919
Rob Tod, who is the owner/operator of Allagash
Brewery up in Portland, Maine.

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:32.680
Allagash started -- first beer sold in 1995,
and then going strong ever since.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.821
So, just to let you know kind of where this
stems from -- some of you probably remember

00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:44.410
when Sam Calagione was here from Dogfish Head
a few months ago back in March.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.370
About two months after that, I got added to
a string of e-mails because Rob did a talk

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.570
at the Google San Francisco office.
And e-mailed Sam and said, "Hey, I did a talk

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.710
at Google.
You really should give it a shot. It's great."

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.532
And Sam responded to that with something like,
"Hey, I beat you to it.

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:09.530
I did one about a week ago."
But my absolute favorite part of that whole

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.920
interaction was the e-mail that shows up in
my inbox.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.579
Imagine this -- for all you beer lovers out
there.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.829
I get an e-mail in my inbox, subject line
is "Yo."

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.680
It's forwarded to me. It's from Rob Tod to
Sam Calagione.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.110
And the first line of the e-mail subject line,
"Yo," is "What up Mitch?" [laughter]

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.489
I love my job.
So, without further ado, Rob Tod.

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:39.489
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:44.429
&gt;&gt; Rob Tod: Thanks a lot.
Good. Good. You can hear me.

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.819
First of all, sorry, my voice is a little
hoarse.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.979
I did a couple of events yesterday and finished
the night at the Blind Tiger.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.819
And, I was there -- I don't know if any of
you guys have ever been there, but it's very

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.229
loud, and I was screaming at the top of my
lungs basically for four hours straight.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.920
So it's a good time.
And then, I ended up standing on a chair and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.109
yelling to everyone.
And at that point basically, my voice was

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.240
gone, so.
It's actually coming back a little now, which

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.830
is good.
But, yeah, so I did talk out in at the San

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.640
Francisco headquarters, which was a lot of
fun.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.580
The way this whole thing started -- I was,
in February, out at San Francisco Beer Week

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.880
doing an event in Oakland.
And Dave Cohen and Dustin Diaz -- who work

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.350
out of the San Francisco branch -- were at
an event I was at.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.220
And I had just switched over from another
e-mail over to Gmail.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.950
And at first, it took me a little getting
used to, but after awhile, I just fell in

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.340
love with Gmail.
I was like, "This is like the coolest thing

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.050
on the planet."
It just saved me so much time. I love the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.760
way it worked.
I'm just like a huge believer.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.910
And I was like all excited about this Gmail,
and these guys from the Gmail team were at

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.471
this event.
And they came up to me and they were like,

00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:06.550
"Oh, we love Allagash beer.
We're on the Gmail team at Google."

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.370
I was like, "No way! I love what you guys
do." So.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.760
And we talked for awhile and then they said,
"Would you be interested in coming out to

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.580
talk about beer at the Google campus?" I was
like, "Absolutely.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.350
Just tell me when you want me there, and I'd
love to do it."

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.330
So, that's how I ended up out there.
We had a great time out there.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.620
And then, yeah, like Adam said, I was so excited
about it, I told Sam.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.050
And I guess Sam had already spoken here, so.
But I'm not sure if he's been out there yet.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.310
But, so I didn't have like a super-firm talk
planned.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.061
I just figured I'd talk a little bit about
the brewery and the beer, talk a little bit

00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:49.840
about each of these beers we're trying today,
and then, do a little slide show as we talk.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.830
But anyway, brief history of Allagash -- I
started the company back in the summer of

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.819
1994.
Spent about a year basically just building

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.180
the brewery, cobbling it together with a lot
of dairy equipment.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.770
We were extremely small.
It was a 15-barrel system -- like I said,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.580
with dairy product -- not very sophisticated.
Then, I ran it alone for the first year, brewing

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.830
all the beer, washing the kegs, loading the
trucks, unloading the trucks, continuing to

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.870
build the brewery.
Our first year's production was 120 barrels,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.820
which was equivalent to 240 kegs.
And that made us one of the smallest breweries

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.740
in the country.
There are definitely some smaller breweries,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.170
but that's tiny production.
Just to kind of put that in perspective, you

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.620
know, we were 120 barrels.
Sierra Nevada, at the time, was probably around

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.990
half a million barrels -- or in that range.
And Anheuser Busch about a hundred million

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.270
barrels a year.
So we were extremely small.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.360
We started just doing exclusively Belgian
style beer.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.920
Our first beer was the Allagash White, which
is what I'm drinking now.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.400
And it's now become our flagship.
It's over 80 percent of our production.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.680
Since then, we've added a lot of beers, and
we have a pretty cool selection of them here

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.171
today.
And we're not volume-driven at all.

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:20.620
In fact, over the first ten years, we grew
really, really slowly.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:28.020
We grew from about 120 barrels to 2000 barrels,
probably over the first 10 or 12 years.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.430
And the last three or four years, we've grown
a lot more quickly from around 2000 barrels

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.540
to around 15 or 16,000 barrels a year production.
And we have 20 employees.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.730
I know that's not quite as fast as you guys
have grown, probably from the same amount

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:50.070
of time from two employees to 20,000 employees.
But we're not volume-driven, but the Belgian

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.580
category and kind of experimental beer category
 -- which you'll taste some of our more experimental

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.540
beers, which still fall in the Belgian beer
category.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.850
But that category's just taken off lately.
There's been a huge amount of interest.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.760
When I started, I used to walk into accounts,
even -- really, for the first ten years, and

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.780
I'd pour people a sample of the Allagash White.
And you know, the first thing bartenders would

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.080
look at, they'd be like you know, "Why is
it cloudy?"

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.200
And they taste it, and they'd be like, "Why
does it look weird? Why does it taste weird?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.199
What's wrong with this beer?" People had really
never had these Belgian style beers, never

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:31.880
really had unfiltered beers.
And so, it was a real education -- kind of

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:39.690
long, slow educational process.
But they've taken off lately, so.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.920
So this first beer, the Allagash White, probably
most of you have gotten a chance to try it.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.840
Like I said, it's the one we sell the most
of.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.790
It's the traditional Belgian style wheat beer.
It's unfiltered.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.520
The Belgians use a lot of unique ingredients
in their white beers.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.740
This is traditionally spiced with coriander
and orange peel.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.729
We use a secret spice in it as well.
I always say, "If you get me drunk enough,

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.490
I'll spill the beans on the secret spice."
But I don't think -- I don't know if that's

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.260
going to happen in the afternoon, so.
It's happened at some beer _____ events.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.669
But, secret spice in it.
A lot of unmalted and malted wheat in it.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:22.180
And it's not filtered, as you can see, or
it's very gently filtered.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.580
What that does is it leaves some of the yeast
and protein in suspension in the beer.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.740
And not only does that contribute to the kind
of nice, elegant, cloudy look to the beer,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.360
but it contributes a lot to the flavor and
mouthfeel of the beer.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.710
Over time, this will actually settle out,
and the beer will be bright.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.710
And if you decant it from the bottle and just
pour the bright beer, the beer tastes quite

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:50.110
a bit different, so.
Anyway, we got a few pictures.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:55.460
This is a picture of the outside of the brewery.
We started in a building next to this.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.710
I rented about 4,000 square feet of a warehouse,
and we outgrew that after about 12 years and

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:06.160
just built this facility.
So basically, this is what we're going to

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.160
talk about for the rest of the time. [laughter]
This is how yeast metabolizes.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.600
Sugar breaks down into carbon dioxide.
I'm going to go through each of these chemical

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.860
reactions.
No, I'm just kidding -- I'm not.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.990
I don't even -- I used to actually know a
little bit of that, but I have no -- so don't

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:28.770
ask me anything too technical.
So, they threw this picture in.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.870
That's me believe it or not.
A lot of people say, "Did you ever drink crappy

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.820
beer?
Or kind of bland beer in the old days?" That's

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.149
me with a Budweiser there.
I think I was outside of a Grateful Dead concert

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:45.550
like 20 years ago, so. [laughter]
Now that I have to go get bank loans, I cleaned

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.591
up my act a little bit.
But these are some early pictures of the brewery.

00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:56.330
The space I leased -- I basically did all
the, you know, 90 percent of all the work

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.870
in there.
Cut drainage trenches in the floor that allow

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:04.080
the plumbing, a lot of the electrical work,
did a lot of the welding.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.540
That tank, which is kind of all banged up
and dented, is our mash ton.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.720
It's actually still our mash ton.
We've done quite a bit of work on it.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.100
You'll see a picture of it later.
It's worked real well for us, but it's just

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.600
an old dairy tank.
It used to hold cream at a dairy somewhere,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.230
probably a 50-year-old dairy tank.
And there's on the left our first fermenter.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:29.760
We just stood those up with chain falls and
block and tackles.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.550
And there's probably a year-and-a-half -- two
years -- in the business.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:38.350
Our first employee, Ned White.
He was with us for five years; he's a great

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.940
guy.
We still stay in very close touch.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:47.010
Actually, you know -- do you guys?
Well, I'll show you a couple more pictures

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:52.029
and then we'll talk about some of the beers.
There's an early picture of us bottling.

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:58.700
The big bottles -- you guys notice some of
the -- a lot of the beers we do are in these

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.330
big bottles.
These are imported from France.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.090
There's only a couple plants in the world
that make this kind of traditional Belgian

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.970
bottle.
So this is how we used to bottle those beers.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.709
We just filled them four bottles at a time
on a little hand filler.

00:10:13.709 --> 00:10:18.100
And then, that's me I think, corking there.
So you had to put every single cork in, push

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.200
it into the bottle.
It was definitely very labor intensive.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.710
Then the guy on the right, who's doing the
hooder, is Jason Perkins.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.730
He's now a brewmaster.
So there's Jason again, our brewmaster on

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.660
the right.
And there's me -- looking like I'm working

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.690
 -- for a picture, so. [laughter]
I honestly don't get down -- I was brewmaster

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.040
for the first 12 years.
I handed that torch over to Jason about three

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.070
years ago.
He's much more capable than I am -- does a

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.250
great job.
I just found I wasn't -- I just didn't have

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.640
time to spend enough time down actually making
the beer in the production floor.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.820
So Jason's now in charge of that.
I still spend quite a bit of time down there,

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.190
but not a lot of time actually doing things.
They try to keep me away.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:09.980
I screw things up when I get involved.
And this is our brewery now.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:16.670
That tank on the left, up on the platform,
is actually that same old dented tank with

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.100
tons of -- we just retrofitted it and kind
of.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.680
We haven't automated it at all.
We've mechanized it, so it's got -- instead

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:30.420
of having to stir the grain with plastic shovels,
we got a machine that stirs it.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.160
And instead of hooking up hoses to each of
the tanks and rolling a pump around to move

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.470
the beer from tank to tank, a lot of it's
hard-piped.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:42.120
So a lot of changes that kind of make life
easier.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:48.230
But. And then as I talk here, definitely ask
questions you know?

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.170
Just raise your hand and ask a question.
I think there's a mic up here, but I'm sure

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.459
you can just ask.
So question?

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:54.850
Q [inaudible]

00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:00.310
Rob Tod: Yeah, it's good question. Using aluminum
cans?

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:06.720
I've actually thought about it maybe, especially
for going out in the boat.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.750
You know, we're right on the water.
By the way, I never even mentioned this -- we're

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:14.620
in Portland, Maine.
It's right on the water. Right on the water.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.680
You know, it's perfect for something like
that.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.913
But right now, one of the main reasons we
haven't done it -- and I think a can is a

00:12:20.913 --> 00:12:27.680
great package and there's a lot of craft breweries
in cans now -- we've just got so many balls

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.640
in the air.
We're growing really fast right now -- 25,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.060
30 percent a year.
Which, you know, but probably doesn't sound

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:40.560
like too much for the tech industry.
But in manufacturing, it gets tough to grow

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.640
that fast to be adding all that equipment
and there's constant change and process change.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.490
And we're really having to even pull out of
markets, because we're having trouble keeping

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.260
up with demand.
We just have too many balls in the air to

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.459
do a can, but down the line, we definitely
might do that.

00:12:57.459 --> 00:12:59.791
I think it would be kind of cool.
I think it would be cool to do our white beer

00:12:59.791 --> 00:13:06.779
in a can at some point, so.
So some of the beers we're trying -- I talked

00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:09.620
about the white.
Another beer -- which I don't think I've got

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.500
it up here, but I do actually pour myself
a glass luckily -- is the double.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.990
The Trappist monks traditionally brew a single
and double and triple.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.851
And we've got the double and triple here today.
These are the first two beers that we did

00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:30.399
in the big cork finish bottle.
The Trappist monks traditionally brew the

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:36.560
single for their own consumption.
It's usually low alcohol beer, maybe brown,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.740
light brown, or blond in color.
And that's what they brew for their own consumption.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:47.060
I always say, "If I abstained from anything
they abstained from, I'd probably drink heavily."

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.060
But sometimes they don't drink -- often they
don't drink.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.200
But if they do, they drink the single.
Their doubles and triples are their commercially

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.700
available beers.
Doubles are usually about seven, maybe six

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.230
to eight percent alcohol by volume.
So it's starting to get, you know, a little

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:09.120
higher alcohol than most of the kind of standard
domestic beers you're used to drinking.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.851
Not as high alcohol as some of the other beers
we'll talk about in a little bit.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:19.200
But they're usually maybe seven or so percent
alcohol, dark in color.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.260
And then their triples actually as you've
probably already seen.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.630
It surprises people, even though it's higher
in alcohol, they're lighter in color.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.240
The color really doesn't have anything to
do with alcohol.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:36.579
Guinness, which is a very dark beer, is actually
pretty low in alcohol -- just about four percent.

00:14:36.579 --> 00:14:40.230
And our triple, which is light in color, is
pretty high in alcohol.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.649
That's about nine percent.
So triples are usually eight or nine percent

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:47.310
by volume, light in color.
And really, the only thing that affects color

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.161
is generally how much roasted malt you put
in the beer.

00:14:51.161 --> 00:15:03.670
You have a question?

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.670
Q [inaudible]

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.529
Rob Tod: Yeah, they're pretty protective of
their secrets.

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:10.149
I've only been -- I've been to Belgium a number
of times.

00:15:10.149 --> 00:15:14.790
I actually only visited a Trappist brewery
on my last trip.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:22.350
I went to see Orval -- which I love Orval.
It's a great beer, and the monastery is like,

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.980
unbelievably cool.
It's really cool.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:30.220
We showed up there in the morning at like
eight in the morning, met the guy who runs

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.860
the business side of the brewery.
He's not a monk.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.959
He's not one of the brothers there.
But we showed up there at about nine in the

00:15:37.959 --> 00:15:39.649
morning.
There was like a dusting of frost and snow

00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:45.420
everywhere and it's this beautiful, old, stone
building.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.620
It's really impressive.
But we actually did get a tour of the brewery

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:56.540
there.
Some of the Trappist breweries are very protective,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:02.050
and they really don't want a lot of people
coming through the monastery or the brewery.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.940
Some of them are a little more open.
Orval, I think they only open their doors

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.811
a couple days a year to let people through
the brewery.

00:16:07.811 --> 00:16:13.190
But it was pretty cool.
And I went there with a bar owner in Boston,

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.360
Massachusetts -- David Cipollo from the Public
House.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.040
Which is -- if any of you are ever up in Boston,
it's a great spot to drink beer -- great food.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.820
But we're going to try to go back now every
year to go see another one of the Trappist

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.959
breweries.
We're going to see Chimay in about a month,

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:33.339
which I'm really looking forward to.
So, yeah, I've been to a lot of breweries

00:16:33.339 --> 00:16:39.339
in Belgium, but, you know, only been to one
of the Trappist breweries.

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:43.589
And Orval's an interesting one too, because
it's -- their beer doesn't really fall into

00:16:43.589 --> 00:16:45.630
one of the traditional singles, doubles, and
triples.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:52.540
They only do one beer in one package.
It's -- I guess it's its own thing.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.510
It's a little bit bitter, a little bit bready,
which you'll taste some brett character in

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.130
one of our beers.
So a little bit of a wild character.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:04.010
And they do do the petite Orval, which is
basically a watered-down version of Orval

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.790
for the monks, which I tried, which is pretty
cool. Yeah.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.799
Q [inaudible]

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:15.069
Rob Tod: The white is actually the lowest
alcohol beer we brew at five percent.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:19.730
The Belgian beers tend to be -- I mean, there
are definitely some lower alcohol Belgian

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.160
beers, and the white is about 80, 85 percent
of our production.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.680
But a lot of the traditional Belgian style
beers tend to be pretty high in alcohol.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:36.050
And in a lot of ways, they drink almost like
kind of a hybrid between beer and wine.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.490
Belgium's kind of sandwiched between Germany
and France, so their culture picks up a lot

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.720
of influence from beer culture -- of course,
from Germany -- but also, picks up a lot of

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.910
influence from wine culture.
I think the biggest part of the influence

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:54.490
is in the yeast strains. So.
We in some ways -- if you talk to different

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.180
brewers of Belgian style beers, they'll tell
you different things.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:02.299
Everyone has their own kind of opinions on
them.

00:18:02.299 --> 00:18:06.090
But we almost look at it as making beer with
wine yeast.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.210
And another one of those influences is the
higher alcohol content.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.790
But you'll taste some of these beers, especially
the Interlude.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.470
It almost tastes as much like a wine as it
does a beer.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.470
Q [inaudible]

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:21.990
Rob Tod: The Interlude? Yeah sure.
So this is actually one of the things that

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.070
is exciting us more than anything about Belgian
style beers.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:33.420
You know, one of the reasons we got into them
is, the Belgian beer culture is very experimental

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.650
by nature.
And they use -- you know, most brewing cultures

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:45.130
will use traditional ale or logger yeast -- the
Belgian brewers use just a huge variety of

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:50.940
ale and logger yeast, but they also use a
lot of bacterias to ferment with and a lot

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.450
of wild yeasts.
And you just can't get these flavors anywhere

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.610
else.
You can put additives in beer that give you

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:06.850
maybe some similar characters, but the character
these yeasts give you when they re-ferment

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:12.730
are really unique.
This particular beer -- we really kind of

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:17.290
stumbled into it.
It was almost basically a mistake or a problem

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:21.970
batch of beer.
We were doing a beer which was very loosely

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.290
based on a Cezanne, which was a traditional
style Belgian beer.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:33.480
And we brewed this beer, and Cezanne yeast
is notorious for -- and at some point I'll

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.230
talk basically about the basics of making
beer.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:45.120
I kind of skipped over that -- but the Cezanne
yeast, which was the yeast used in the Cezanne

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.419
is notorious for petering out during fermentation
about halfway through the fermentation.

00:19:49.419 --> 00:19:55.450
So the yeast will be eating the sugars, giving
off carbon dioxide and alcohol, and it'll

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:00.200
really slow down or peter out very commonly
halfway through fermentation.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.150
And that's exactly what happened to this.
The yeast basically fermented out the beer

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:08.840
halfway.
It was probably about four percent by volume

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.169
alcohol.
And then it just stopped.

00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:16.420
And you know, we were concerned, because we
had a 500-gallon batch of beer -- which at

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.630
the time was pretty big for us -- that just
basically wasn't fermenting, and we couldn't

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.940
get it going.
We did everything that we knew to kind of

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.600
start the fermentation again. We couldn't.
So we just kind of forgot about it. Left it

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.160
in the tank.
It was a dairy tank that we didn't need for

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.669
a couple of months.
So we just figured we'd leave it there.

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:39.390
Well, I came into work probably two weeks
after that -- or maybe even a little bit longer,

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:46.160
three weeks -- and it was fermenting again.
They're enclosed tanks, and we have a hose

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.540
that comes out of the tank.
We put in a bucket of water with a little

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.430
bit of chlorine.
And you can see it bubbling when it's fermenting.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:57.000
It hadn't been bubbling for two or three weeks,
and I walk by and I was like, "Oh wow, cool!

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.850
It's starting to ferment again."
So we went and tasted the beer, and we were

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.799
like, "There's definitely something in this
beer that we did not add." [laughter]

00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:12.150
The flavor profile was just -- it was totally
being transformed.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.880
So we have a pretty extensive lab program
for a brewery our size.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.360
Now it's even much more extensive than it
was back then.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.620
And sure enough, we ran it through the lab;
there was a wild yeast that was fermenting

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.919
this beer.
And it really -- it had a lot in common, we

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:34.800
think it is, with Brettanomyces, which is
a traditional yeast used in a lot of -- it's

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.210
a wild yeast used in a lot of traditional
Belgian beers.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:43.820
And it just gives you these funky -- and each
different strain of yeast is different, but

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:51.070
some of them give you kind of a barnyard character.
Some people say horse hair, or horse blanket.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.059
And you can definitely get some of that in
this beer.

00:21:54.059 --> 00:21:58.830
It ferments it out very dry, almost like a
wine.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:02.780
And after this beer was done, we fell in love
with the flavors.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.299
It took about three months or four months
to finish fermentation, which is very long.

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:14.070
Usually fermentations last a week to two weeks.
And we just fell in love with this flavor.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:19.059
It didn't have some of the more coarse character
you get in some Bretts, which can be real

00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:22.840
 -- have a lot of that kind of horse hair,
barnyard character.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.490
But it had just some refined subtle touches
of that.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:31.679
And then a lot of fruity characters, a lot
of Venice wine characters.

00:22:31.679 --> 00:22:37.520
And I've got a buddy that's a wine maker at
PlumpJack Winery in Napa.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:43.490
And I called up my buddy Tony and said, "Geez,
could we get some barrels you use for red

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.620
wine? We think this beer would be a real good
fit for it."

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.429
So he sent us eight.
We bought eight of these great French, oak

00:22:49.429 --> 00:22:52.980
wine barrels -- which really, they couldn't
use anymore, because most of the oak character

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.530
was out of them.
And we aged this beer -- aged half of it in

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.260
the French oak for eight months and then left
half of it in the stainless steel.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.669
And then blended the two together.
And this is the result.

00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:10.799
And you know, it's a real -- when we released
it three years ago, this was a really funky

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:16.260
beer.
Now, it's almost -- with some of these funky

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.760
Belgian style experimental beers that are
out there -- it's not even considered that

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.960
funky.
But it is real unique.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.010
It almost drinks as much like a wine like
a beer.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.660
Q [inaudible]

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:36.590
Rob Tod: There are. There are. Avery Brewing.
I think it's their 15th anniversary they used

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:42.720
a brett yeast.
Vinnie out at Russian River Brewing uses a

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.480
lot of wild yeast and bacteria, a lot of barrel
aging.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:52.370
He's doing some phenomenal beers.
Sam at Dogfish, Tommy Arthur in Southern California

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:56.900
in the San Diego area.
And in a number of other brewers, Ron Jeffries

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.471
at Jolly Pumpkin does a lot.
He's in Michigan with wild yeast and bacteria.

00:24:01.471 --> 00:24:05.880
And it's amazing.
Like kind of to circle back to the first thing

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.030
I mentioned with this beer -- This is something
that excites us more than anything in brewing,

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:16.429
because it's -- Outside of Belgium, no one
really had been using these bacterias and

00:24:16.429 --> 00:24:22.420
wild yeast to make beer for years.
And in fact, they were really considered a

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:26.850
defect in beers.
But in Belgian brewing, they're traditional,

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:32.220
and there are a lot of U.S. brewers that are
starting to use them to create these flavors

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.240
that no one's had before.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.429
Q [inaudible]

00:24:35.429 --> 00:24:44.200
Rob Tod: We did. Yeah, this wild yeast -- we
were so worried we'd lose it, that we sent

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.280
it to two separate yeast labs.
And now, they bank the yeast for us.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.299
And whenever we make this beer, we actually
have to ask them both to grow it -- it's kind

00:24:52.299 --> 00:24:56.800
of a finicky yeast.
And so, very often one of them can't grow

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:02.669
the yeast for us to add to the batch.
So we have to get it from both yeast producers

00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:06.990
just to make sure it comes in.
So they bank this yeast for us, and then our

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:12.169
proprietary yeast, which we use for the white
beer.

00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:13.820
Q [inaudible]

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:22.210
Rob Tod: There are no lactic bacteria in any
of the beers we're trying today.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:29.490
The lactic -- yeah, the yeast that's in this
 -- what we think is the Brettanomyces -- is

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:34.340
a wild yeast.
So the bacteria is lactobacillus pediococcus.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:40.700
A number of other bacteria the brewers use.
We're starting to experiment with and we've

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.659
got a number of beers.
And we've sold some beers on a very small

00:25:43.659 --> 00:25:47.760
scale that are just available at the brewery
 -- the Vagabond and Gargamel -- that use

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:53.480
some of those microbes.
But we haven't sold any on a commercial scale.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.850
And one interesting way to add some of these
wild yeasts and bacterias is just by adding

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.950
fruit to the beer.
So we've done a lot of beers with sour cherries,

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:10.700
raspberries, grapes, blueberries.
And those fruits naturally have these same

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.600
micro-organisms there.
They have wild yeast and bacteria all over

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.000
them.
So when you add those to a batch of beer,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.040
you can get some of these fermentations.
The lactobacillus -- the lactic acid bacteria

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.169
 -- gives the beer a real tart character.
This gets a little bit of tartness from the

00:26:25.169 --> 00:26:27.690
brett, but it isn't real tart.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.860
Q [inaudible]

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:39.419
Rob Tod: Yeah, this beer definitely does evolve
over time.

00:26:39.419 --> 00:26:44.940
The whole aging beer thing, we kind of are
torn with.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.140
Definitely, our white beer, fresher is better.
It's a lower alcohol beer.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:55.590
Don't let me forget to talk about bottle conditioning
a little bit, which does extend the shelf

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.490
life of a beer and make it pretty appropriate
to age.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:06.000
But I really think some of -- as you get into
bottle conditioned beers -- higher alcohol

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.350
beers -- their shelf life goes way beyond
six months.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:14.940
And our triple -- we've got bottles of the
triple that are seven, eight years old that

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.559
are still drinking great -- that we've stored
at cool temperatures, cellar temperatures,

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:22.370
in the dark.
And they're drinking great.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:26.850
They evolve quite a bit.
They pick up a big honey character, passion

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.900
fruit character.
The Interlude does the same thing.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.909
We haven't been brewing this beer for too
long, only a few years.

00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:38.750
We've got some of the original bottles and
they're drinking great.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:46.490
And actually, I think beer made with traditional
 -- and this is just kind of our opinion and

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:51.730
our take on it -- beer made with traditional
ale and logger yeast, the higher alcohol bottle

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:57.110
conditioned beers, they have a good shelf
life, like the triple and they can age fairly

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.390
well.
Once you start using some of the wild yeast

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.570
and bacterias, I think the beers start to
hold up a lot better.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.870
They don't tend to get oxidized, and they
don't get a tired taste.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.350
When beer oxidizes, it gets kind of a cardboardy,
papery character.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:17.100
And for some reason, these beers don't tend
to oxidize very much.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:22.440
So, they hold up pretty well.
So to answer your question, you know, this

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.250
beer drinks great right when it comes out
of the brewery.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:30.210
I think it drinks fine after a year.
Three to five years, it's probably going to

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:35.419
be drinking okay, but it's really not intended
to be aged beyond that like you would like

00:28:35.419 --> 00:28:39.460
a cab wine.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.159
Q [inaudible]

00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:52.660
Rob Tod: Yep. We'll open one of those. [laughter]
So, this is another beer and it's funny -- a

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:59.289
lot of the beers that we've done, we really
just kind of stumble across.

00:28:59.289 --> 00:29:04.799
This beer is called the Curieux; it's our
triple.

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:09.970
It's aged in Jim B. bourbon barrels for only
about two months.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.450
The bourbon barrels totally transform this
beer.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:20.110
So it goes in tasting like the triple, which
we talked about -- you guys have tried.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:24.730
The reason we came up with this beer -- Susan's
totally all rep'd in this area.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:28.140
She's sick of hearing this story, but you
have to listen to it again.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:34.370
So, it's a true story.
We had a -- as I mention, these bottles come

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:38.669
from Europe.
It's a very traditional bottle in Belgium

00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:41.320
for the Trappist breweries and a lot of the
other beers in Belgium.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.371
It's a heavy glass bottle which can withstand
high carbonation levels which these beers

00:29:46.371 --> 00:29:50.440
have.
And we need to get these bottles from Europe,

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:56.700
and there was a shipment that was delayed,
and we needed to bottle a batch of triple.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.340
It was in a tank; it was tying up a tank.
We had to brew into the tank two or three

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.660
days later.
So we needed to bottle this beer.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:08.030
We weren't kegging the triple at the time.
But we were going to be basically a couple

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:13.289
pallets of bottles short, which would have
left about 120 gallons of beer in the tank.

00:30:13.289 --> 00:30:19.710
So we also -- about two weeks prior -- had
gotten two Jim Beam bourbon barrels from Jim

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.929
Beam, which we were going to experiment with
a couple different kind of beers.

00:30:23.929 --> 00:30:29.390
We really thought that the darker beer would
be better suited for a bourbon barrel.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:36.150
I think it's one of those almost misconceptions.
A lot of people think that a darker beer is

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.980
higher alcohol.
For some reason, we thought that a darker

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.121
beer would be the only thing that would work
in a bourbon barrel.

00:30:41.121 --> 00:30:45.370
But we had this triple; we don't like to waste
beer.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:50.330
So we -- instead of dumping the beer that
didn't have a home in bottles -- we filled

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:54.860
these two bourbon barrels, bung the barrels
up very tightly for -- I don't know why we

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:59.350
seal these barrels so tightly -- with wooden
bungs, which will hold the pressure on the

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:05.240
barrel really well.
And basically put them in our warm room where

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.730
we re-ferment our beers.
And that was on a Wednesday.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:14.929
I came in on a Saturday, and it looked like
the barrels were about to explode basically.

00:31:14.929 --> 00:31:19.789
They were almost like shaking with pressure.
There was beer squirting out between the staves

00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:23.169
of the barrels. [laughter]
And the heads of the barrels were literally

00:31:23.169 --> 00:31:27.200
bulging.
And I panicked, because if one of those explodes,

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:34.440
it will be an unimaginable mess probably.
And so, I ran and got a hammer and a screwdriver.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.659
And I just tried to tap one of the bungs,
and I was going to gently bleed some pressure

00:31:38.659 --> 00:31:42.120
out.
And I basically just touched the bung and

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.370
it exploded, went up and hit the ceiling.
I got covered with beer.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:52.870
I couldn't see anything. [laughter]
So I took off my glasses and there was like

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.870
foam kind of geysering out.
It was calming down a little, but geysering

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.399
out of the bung and cascading down the side
of the barrel.

00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:03.610
So I got down on my knees and -- it was the
first thing I could think of doing -- and

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:09.679
just started like sucking the foam off the
side of the barrel. [laughing / clapping]

00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:14.340
So and I was like sucking the foam, and then
I pause, and I was like, "Wow, this stuff's

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:20.010
like really good." [laughter]
And it had totally transformed -- I forget

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.549
which one.
Did I pour one yet?

00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:24.520
No.
Oh, there it is.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.200
So, it had just totally transformed the beer.
Because it had been tripled.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:35.059
We put in the cask just a couple days before.
And it had these like huge coconut flavors,

00:32:35.059 --> 00:32:42.820
huge vanilla flavors, some herbal characters.
And I like ran to the phone and called Jason,

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.000
who's now our brewmaster.
And I was like, "Man, we've got to make this

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.610
stuff."
So that next Monday, we called Jim Beam and

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:53.950
ordered ten bourbon barrels, so.
We got a great relationship with Jim Beam.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.870
They're really good people.
I was just actually talking to them this week

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:03.230
about getting barrels from them next year.
We're probably the smallest customer they

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:05.809
have for buying.
It's pretty good business for them -- the

00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:11.010
used bourbon barrels.
If it says 'bourbon' on the bottle, they can

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.960
only use the barrel one time.
So they have all these barrels to sell.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:20.620
A lot of them go to single malt scotch distilleries.
Some of them go to make tequilas and rums

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:26.520
probably and other whiskeys.
But they're kind enough to only -- you know,

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.460
we only buy a couple hundred a year from them,
but they take good care of us.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.850
Q [inaudible]

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:37.130
Rob Tod: I don't know the exact number.
It's over a hundred bucks to get them to us

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.310
though.
By the time it's delivered, it's well over

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:43.039
a hundred dollars.
And so, it's a pretty big market -- the used

00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:47.971
barrel business.
But they're great people, Jim Beam.

00:33:47.971 --> 00:33:51.159
And I love Jim Beam.
I love Jim Beam, just the white label Jim

00:33:51.159 --> 00:33:52.159
Beam, so.

00:33:52.159 --> 00:33:53.559
Q [inaudible]

00:33:53.559 --> 00:34:04.860
Rob Tod: Yeah, okay. I'll go through those.
And how am I doing on time too? Just what

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.409
do we got?
We're good? All right.

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:13.450
Till the beer's gone -- that's when the thing
ends, right?

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:17.809
Basically, first of all, all of our bottled
beers go through a process called 'bottled

00:34:17.809 --> 00:34:21.369
conditioning'.
And it's a process that's traditional in the

00:34:21.369 --> 00:34:24.279
traditional breweries in Belgium.
Not all Belgium brewers do it.

00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:28.530
And very few breweries in the U.S. do it.
And basically what that process -- the beer

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:34.349
gets bottled with a little or no carbonation.
And just prior to bottling it -- just like

00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:39.129
the champagne makers do -- we'll add a fresh
dose of yeast and sugar to the beer, mix it

00:34:39.129 --> 00:34:42.569
up, and then bottle it.
And then the beer goes into our warm room

00:34:42.569 --> 00:34:46.269
 -- or our cellar -- and there's a secondary
fermentation of the bottle.

00:34:46.269 --> 00:34:51.269
The yeast will eat the sugar, give off carbon
dioxide and alcohol, and that process can

00:34:51.269 --> 00:34:57.059
take a week to a few months depending on the
beer, but it naturally carbonates the beer.

00:34:57.059 --> 00:35:00.880
So that's why these beers all have a yeast
sediment in the bottom of them.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:07.930
But that process gives you a huge amount of
additional layers of flavor and aromas and

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:10.559
complexity.
And it also increases the shelf life of the

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:14.829
beer by quite a bit.
So the basic run down of the white.

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:21.630
I mentioned traditional Belgian style wheat
beer -- five percent unfiltered and spiced.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:30.369
The double and triple are the Trappist style
beers we brew, which I described those.

00:35:30.369 --> 00:35:36.529
The next would be the Curieux, which is our
triple age in the Jim Beam bourbon barrels.

00:35:36.529 --> 00:35:37.880
And then, a couple beers we haven't tried
yet.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.539
I think the only other two are the Odyssey
and the Black.

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:47.450
The Odyssey is an interesting one. We brewed
that.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:52.630
And we have a real open culture at the brewery.
If anyone has an idea on a beer, we're open

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.920
to listening to it.
It's not just me -- in fact, I didn't come

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.900
up with most of these beers.
It's usually someone at the brewery that has

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.959
a cool idea for a cool beer.
And we'll all kind of look at each other and

00:36:02.959 --> 00:36:05.799
be like, "Yeah, let's try it.
Let's try brewing it."

00:36:05.799 --> 00:36:08.870
So, you know, anyone -- even if they work
in the office -- they can come up with an

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:12.260
idea for a beer.
And nowadays -- I mean, we used to just brew

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.650
it and dry it.
Nowadays, we'll be a little more methodical

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:19.640
and do it on a small scale, but.
A guy named Scott Abel came up with this recipe.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:27.619
And it's a dark wheat beer.
And it's very unlike most wheat beers that

00:36:27.619 --> 00:36:31.289
you usually think of as traditional wheat
beers.

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:35.579
A lot of roasted malts.
When we fermented it out the first time, it

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:39.519
really didn't have a whole lot of character.
It was kind of thin and dry.

00:36:39.519 --> 00:36:45.640
But we liked where the beer was going, so
we decided to take a small portion of it and

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:50.960
age it in new American oak barrels.
Kind of give it a real like vanilla, mocha

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.180
character.
So we took about 25, 30 percent of the beer,

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:59.450
got some new American oak barrels -- the same
ones they'd used if you were aging a wine

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:05.799
in an American oak barrel -- and aged the
beer for ten months in the oak, aged the remainder

00:37:05.799 --> 00:37:09.769
of the beer for ten months in stainless steel,
and then blended the two together.

00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:18.289
And again, just between the time in that oak,
it totally transforms the beer.

00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:22.369
You can get a big vanilla character in this
beer.

00:37:22.369 --> 00:37:27.049
This particular batch has got almost a little
bit of a smoky character to it and mocha.

00:37:27.049 --> 00:37:31.219
That's all from the medium and light toast
oak barrels.

00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:38.670
Something else I going to mention about this
beer but I forgot, so.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.890
It's interesting -- with the barrels, a lot
of people say, you know, "Why do you age in

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.819
barrels?
Is that just kind of marketing or gimmicky?

00:37:44.819 --> 00:37:49.579
Does it really do anything to the beer?" And
the answer is, "It absolutely transforms the

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:52.120
beer.
It becomes a totally different beer."

00:37:52.120 --> 00:38:03.890
If you were to take this same base beer -- age
the same beer in a bourbon barrel, a wine

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:09.150
barrel that's been used for wine, a new American
oak barrel, a new French oak barrel, you get

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.570
totally different beers out of those barrels
after a few months.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.690
Q [inaudible]

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:18.509
Rob Tod: Absolutely yeah. Yeah.
It picks up tons of flavors of vanillans from

00:38:18.509 --> 00:38:23.589
the wood, tannens from the wood, a number
of flavors.

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:30.959
And actually, and we use this with the Interlude.
A lot of these microbes, bacterias, and wild

00:38:30.959 --> 00:38:34.599
yeast can actually live in the wood.
The wood can support them.

00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:38.680
So you can empty a barrel, and those microbes
will stay in it.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.510
And then add another batch of beer, age it
for six months to a year, and those microbes

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:47.469
will start working away at that beer, transforming
it, giving you some nice tart characters,

00:38:47.469 --> 00:38:49.839
funky characters. So.

00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:51.380
Q [inaudible]

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:57.070
Rob Tod: Well, the normal triple and the Curieux.
Yeah.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.329
Q [inaudible]

00:38:59.329 --> 00:39:04.799
Rob Tod: That's a good point.
I mean you can put the triple and the Curieux

00:39:04.799 --> 00:39:07.349
next to each other and they're just totally
different beers.

00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:09.079
It really transforms the beers.

00:39:09.079 --> 00:39:12.709
Q [inaudible] [laughter]

00:39:12.709 --> 00:39:16.279
Rob Tod: Yeah, sure. The odyssey?

00:39:16.279 --> 00:39:17.359
Q [inaudible]

00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:25.819
Rob Tod: Oh, are you guys out of this one?
If you want, pass it around. No problem.

00:39:25.819 --> 00:39:34.150
Yeah, pass it around. Yeah.
It's a pretty cool beer.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:39.940
You get -- and there's just all kinds of -- with
the Curieux, it was funny.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:44.109
We had been making it for six or so months,
and I brought it to -- actually it was the

00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:50.450
Ommegang -- Belgium comes to Cooperstown brew
fest -- which if any of you like brew fest,

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:54.519
that's a phenomenal brew fest. It's great.
You get to -- you can camp out.

00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:57.469
They have really cool beers.
It's a really great setting.

00:39:57.469 --> 00:40:03.450
The Ommegang Brewery is beautiful.
And I was at that, and this guy Lew Bryson

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.900
 -- who's a good friend of mine and Philly
 -- who's a beer writer -- he takes a sip

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.509
of the Curieux and he's like, "Woe, there's
dill in this."

00:40:10.509 --> 00:40:13.619
And I'm like, "What? Dill?" And so I tasted
some.

00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:17.440
I was like, "Woe, I do get a dill character
from this."

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.420
I was like, "I wonder if like someone had
pickles in this keg before or something.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:25.170
It tasted like dill pickly.
And I kind of panicked.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.951
I was like, "You know, what's the deal with
these kegs?" And then I went back to the brewery.

00:40:28.951 --> 00:40:32.209
We tried some different batches of Curieux;
they all have this dill character.

00:40:32.209 --> 00:40:37.499
And a few months later, I was looking at a
flavor wheel that I had gotten from a barrel

00:40:37.499 --> 00:40:41.400
manufacturer that showed all these different
flavors you get from oak, and one of them

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.699
is like an herbaceous dill character.
So that's something you get out of the oak

00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:50.059
for this particular beer.
And interestingly enough, I mentioned, if

00:40:50.059 --> 00:40:54.710
you age the same beer in different oak barrels,
you get a different beer out of each of these

00:40:54.710 --> 00:41:00.000
barrels.
If you age different beers in the same type

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.731
of oak barrel -- so if you have five different
bourbon barrels, put five different beers

00:41:03.731 --> 00:41:07.401
in it, the beers take different flavors out
of the oak.

00:41:07.401 --> 00:41:11.489
Or at least the flavors that come out of the
oak express themselves differently in each

00:41:11.489 --> 00:41:15.539
of these different kinds of beers.
So it's really interesting.

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:17.650
The Curieux -- you get that dill from the
oak.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.140
We do another beer called the 'Musette' that's
aged in the bourbon barrels.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.339
You don't get that dill.
You get a lot of mocha character from the

00:41:25.339 --> 00:41:29.170
oak.
So it's pretty interesting. Yep.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.489
Q [inaudible]

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:42.190
Rob Tod: Good question. I totally stumbled
into the beer business, literally.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:46.480
I mean, you can see the picture of me.
That was like -- beer for me was the, you

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.150
know -- the cheaper, the better.
When I was living in -- I went to school in

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:54.579
Vermont, lived in Colorado for a couple years.
I was basically drinking 3.99 twelve packs

00:41:54.579 --> 00:42:00.739
of Hams and 3.99 twelve packs of pilsner club
and I was very happy.

00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:04.741
And I moved back to Vermont where I'd gone
to school, and I was going to go to grad school

00:42:04.741 --> 00:42:07.660
for geology.
And actually my parents were excited, because

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:13.640
they were like, you know, "Finally, after
four years of college, you got some direction."

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.979
And I wanted to be a geology teacher.
So they were all excited that I had some direction.

00:42:16.979 --> 00:42:22.469
And the day I got back to Middlebury, Vermont,
where I'd gone to school, I called a buddy

00:42:22.469 --> 00:42:26.779
of mine -- like found a place to live, got
on the phone, called a buddy of mine.

00:42:26.779 --> 00:42:30.499
I said, "Hey, dude. I just need a job. I'll
do anything.

00:42:30.499 --> 00:42:32.160
Just, I want a job. Do you know of anything
in town?"

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:37.329
And he was, "Do you want to wash kegs at a
brewery that I work at?"

00:42:37.329 --> 00:42:41.000
I didn't even know that was a job. [laughter]
And the lightbulb went off in my head.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.459
I was like, "Is there free beer involved with
this job?"

00:42:43.459 --> 00:42:46.989
And he said, "Yeah, there's free beer. You
get, you know, a half gallon of beer every

00:42:46.989 --> 00:42:50.099
day."
So I said, "I'll take the job." [laughter]

00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:57.469
So, I showed up that day, and I had done a
lot of jobs during college and high school

00:42:57.469 --> 00:43:01.400
 -- a lot of construction jobs in the summer.
And I've done a lot of that work in Colorado.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.209
And I love working with my hands. I love construction.
And I'd done a lot of plumbing and some welding.

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:10.269
And I walked into -- and I love just building
things and working with my hands.

00:43:10.269 --> 00:43:14.150
I walked in the brewery and I was like, "Wow,
this has got like everything." Electrical,

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.329
plumbing, and there's pipes everywhere, and
pumps and motors.

00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:21.219
And I worked there for two days, and I saw
that.

00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:25.660
I saw like the creative end of brewing.
I tasted these beers which I really never

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.069
tasted before.
I was like, "Wow, I didn't know that places

00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:32.660
like made these beers."
And I just fell in love with it in two days.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:37.630
And I remember, I called my parents.
And my mom and dad were on the phone and I

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:41.769
was like, "I've got news for you guys." And
they were excited that I was getting a grad

00:43:41.769 --> 00:43:45.990
school application.
And I said, "I've decided I'm not going to

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:50.140
grad school.
I'm going to be a brewer for a living." [laughter]

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.319
And it's like silence on the other end of
the line.

00:43:52.319 --> 00:43:57.650
And then, after like -- you know, it seemed
an eternity, my mom goes, "Rob, one of these

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.579
days, you're going to have to stop living
in a fantasyland." [laughter]

00:44:00.579 --> 00:44:06.869
So, but after awhile, they got behind it,
and they realized it was a legitimate business.

00:44:06.869 --> 00:44:09.999
So.
But I literally stumbled into it.

00:44:09.999 --> 00:44:13.469
I have no idea what I'd be doing now, probably
teaching geology, which I would have been

00:44:13.469 --> 00:44:15.550
happy with.
But I sure wouldn't have been able to drink

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:19.809
in the middle of the day if I was teaching
geology, so. [laughter]

00:44:19.809 --> 00:44:20.809
Q [inaudible]

00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:27.559
Rob Tod: What the Belgian beers.
One of the things that's always intrigued

00:44:27.559 --> 00:44:29.650
me.
When I was at -- I brewed at Otter Creek;

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:33.199
that's where I spent the first year, which
is a great brewery.

00:44:33.199 --> 00:44:36.650
The owner there was super-supportive of me
going off and starting a brewery which was

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:40.920
cool.
But every once in awhile -- during say, a

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:45.910
month's period, people would bring in beers
that they'd get at a liquor store maybe.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:48.699
Because at that time there was just all these
beers coming out in the market.

00:44:48.699 --> 00:44:53.279
Imports coming in.
And people would bring these beers in, put

00:44:53.279 --> 00:44:56.430
them in the fridge, and we'd accumulate maybe
ten or 15 beers.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.411
And then, after work, we just tried the different
beers.

00:44:59.411 --> 00:45:01.819
Everyone would try a little bit of each of
these beers.

00:45:01.819 --> 00:45:06.079
And whenever anyone brought these Belgian
style beers, and I was like, "Wow, what is

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:08.609
going on with this?" I mean, they were just
all over the map.

00:45:08.609 --> 00:45:16.130
There was sour beers and fruit beers and these
brett beers and the Trappist beers, Cezannes,

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:22.299
wheat beers -- it was just all over the map.
And I was just intrigued by -- it's almost

00:45:22.299 --> 00:45:29.079
like there's an unlimited palette you can
draw from with ingredients with yeast and

00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:34.910
kind of make whatever you want.
So I liked the fact that it was just so experimental

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:40.779
by nature and so much different.
And also, at the time, there were only a couple

00:45:40.779 --> 00:45:43.799
breweries in the country doing Belgian style
beers exclusively.

00:45:43.799 --> 00:45:48.630
And funny enough, there still are only a couple
breweries in the country that do exclusively

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:50.569
Belgian style beers. So.

00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:53.170
Q [inaudible]

00:45:53.170 --> 00:46:05.789
Rob Tod: It's funny -- a lot of our, you know
 -- knock on wood -- like larger-scale beers

00:46:05.789 --> 00:46:13.059
we've been pretty blessed with, I think.
One of the reasons I think we haven't made

00:46:13.059 --> 00:46:18.670
too many big mistakes with those beers -- and
there's a couple, I'll mention -- but we've

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:20.760
really been methodical about the way we've
grown.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.319
We've been in business 15 years.
A lot of breweries will start out with six

00:46:25.319 --> 00:46:30.380
or seven different beers and bottling and
kegging and multiple territories.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:38.790
We just started -- 4:00? Oh, how much time
do we have? Five minutes?

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:44.130
Okay -- we really tried to take the approach,
"walk before we run." We just did one beer,

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:48.569
draft only, just in the Portland market.
And spent a year doing that. And then added

00:46:48.569 --> 00:46:52.400
another beer.
So as we've gotten more daring with our beers

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.660
 -- we've only done it when we've had a lot
of experience under our belt.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:47:01.449
But there are definitely some beers -- like,
the first time we did the Grand Crew, we used

00:47:01.449 --> 00:47:06.549
anise in that beer.
And for our white beer -- back then in a batch,

00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:11.410
which was about 500 gallons/15-barrel batch,
we put sixteen ounces of coriander in it.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:14.640
So we're like, "sixteen ounces of coriander,
sixteen ounces of anise."

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:19.079
So we dumped it in. It was like drinking liquid
licorice.

00:47:19.079 --> 00:47:25.940
And just to give you an idea how much it was,
we worked that recipe all the way down to

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:29.420
a tablespoon of anise to give it a little
bit of that licorice taste.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:34.049
But that particular batch of beer just -- so,
we should have just dumped it, but we were

00:47:34.049 --> 00:47:40.400
cutting like one barrel of this one batch
into every single larger batch that year for

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:46.229
like months and months.
So we've had some issues like that for sure.

00:47:46.229 --> 00:47:47.229
Yep.

00:47:47.229 --> 00:47:48.229
Q [inaudible]

00:47:48.229 --> 00:47:53.670
Rob Tod: Oh, sure. Actually I'm going to hold
onto these, because I need.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.619
I don't know if this is enough for me to get
through the rest of the thing. [laughter]

00:47:56.619 --> 00:47:59.479
No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, pass the -- you
can definitely.

00:47:59.479 --> 00:48:01.599
Oh yeah, and I haven't even talked about the
Blacks, so.

00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:05.140
Here, I'll open the Black; pass that around.
And then I think we ought to finish up.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:09.589
So this -- last -- oh, I got to show you guys
the slides of the brewery too.

00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:14.280
Okay, we're going to bang through these.
Hops. I have this in there.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.199
People asked about the hop prices, whether
that was real.

00:48:17.199 --> 00:48:21.309
That pallet of hops a year-and-a-half ago
would have cost us about four, five thousand

00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:23.719
dollars.
Last year, we had to buy that on-the-spot

00:48:23.719 --> 00:48:30.119
market, it cost about $60,000.
So, yes, there was a hop crisis. [laughter]

00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:32.170
Here's pictures of the brewery.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:33.170
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:43.089
Rob Tod: You sure? Okay. Okay cool.
The hops are grown in the Pacific Northwest

00:48:43.089 --> 00:48:47.469
and also in Czechoslovakia for -- the bulk
of our hops. So.

00:48:47.469 --> 00:48:48.469
Q [inaudible]

00:48:48.469 --> 00:48:57.199
Rob Tod: It was a market worldwide crisis.
It was all kinds of things.

00:48:57.199 --> 00:49:02.109
It was like a perfect storm.
For years, hop prices have been depressed.

00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:05.180
Farmers weren't making money on it.
They were pulling their crops.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:09.670
And it takes a couple years for a hop crop
to really establish itself.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:14.519
So, they were pulling it out, and basically
supply was starting to go down, and it got

00:49:14.519 --> 00:49:19.369
to the point where supply dipped right down
to where demand was.

00:49:19.369 --> 00:49:24.229
And at the same time that happened, there
was a big warehouse fire.

00:49:24.229 --> 00:49:27.670
A bunch of hops burned in a warehouse -- couple
percent of the supply.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:32.459
There was a spidermite infestation in the
Pacific Northwest.

00:49:32.459 --> 00:49:36.229
And there's hailstorms in Germany that destroyed
crops.

00:49:36.229 --> 00:49:39.380
So all this stuff happened at once.
And there was a panic.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.700
Hops is one of those things that there's a
little bit of extra hops in the market, the

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:47.650
price goes way down, because you know, people
don't really do anything with hops except

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:53.890
make beer.
But, if you're two percent short on hop supply,

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:59.989
brewers will pay anything just to get, you
know, to not run out of beer or out of the

00:49:59.989 --> 00:50:03.739
ability to make beer.
Some other pictures of the brewery.

00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:05.999
This is the new brewery.
That's our bottling line with some tanks in

00:50:05.999 --> 00:50:11.410
the background.
This is Tom rinsing off some bourbon barrels

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:16.170
after filling them to make the Curieux.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:18.150
Q [inaudible]

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:25.079
Rob Tod: Off the record. Actually, we are
required to make sure we dump the barrels

00:50:25.079 --> 00:50:31.999
so there's no alcohol left in the barrels.
And we usually do get a little bit of bourbon

00:50:31.999 --> 00:50:38.289
out of some of those barrels. [laughter]
So, it comes out looking like this from the

00:50:38.289 --> 00:50:40.580
charcoal.
Then you pour it through a coffee filter,

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:44.089
it comes out crystal clear out the other side
of the coffee filter.

00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:49.680
And it is potent. It's uncut.
So there's some bourbon barrels there.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.489
A 2500 gallon foder -- French oak foder in
the background, which we've been aging beer

00:50:54.489 --> 00:50:57.920
in that for a year with some of these wild
yeasts that are in the Interlude.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:06.269
Should I pass this Curieux around too?
You guys -- is this? You might as well drink

00:51:06.269 --> 00:51:10.799
these beers, right?
There's Jason I think actually sampling some

00:51:10.799 --> 00:51:16.660
bourbon after it's been filtered.
Do you guys want this one too?

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:22.270
Going to pass that around.
So, here's Jason with a couple.

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:27.009
This is a real open business.
We have brewers from all over the country

00:51:27.009 --> 00:51:31.509
coming in the brewery.
You guys saw Sam Calagione speak here.

00:51:31.509 --> 00:51:34.479
I'm very good friends with Sam.
Everyone's real friendly in this business.

00:51:34.479 --> 00:51:38.209
Any brewer can always come in our brewery.
There's no secrets there.

00:51:38.209 --> 00:51:42.180
These are some brewers from Belgium that we
did a collaboration brew with.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:48.959
And this is actually that same day.
Jason is pouring a collaboration beer I did

00:51:48.959 --> 00:51:59.359
with Tommy, Vinnie, Adam, and Sam. Yep.

00:51:59.359 --> 00:52:02.140
Q [inaudible]

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:20.460
Rob Tod: Okay. Oh, yeah. Yep.
With the higher alcohol beers, we really haven't

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:26.789
gotten into doing -- our highest alcohol beer
is the Curieux at 11 percent.

00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:31.109
We really haven't gotten into those.
But those beers are really cool.

00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:36.759
I mean, Sam's got some really cool higher
alcohol beers, like the 120-minute IPA and

00:52:36.759 --> 00:52:40.160
what's the really?
The Worldwide Stout, yeah.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.329
Just that higher alcohol.
It's not just to have higher alcohol.

00:52:43.329 --> 00:52:47.579
That really gives you some cool flavors.
Sam Adams does the Utopias, which I love.

00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:51.910
You just get -- it almost drinks like a liquor,
as much as a beer.

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:55.059
Or like a port.
But we haven't really done anything over 11

00:52:55.059 --> 00:52:57.499
percent.
I don't think we will.

00:52:57.499 --> 00:53:01.249
We're more interested in messing around with
some of the wild yeast and bacterias.

00:53:01.249 --> 00:53:04.049
But those higher alcohol beers are pretty
cool.

00:53:04.049 --> 00:53:05.220
Q [inaudible]

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:10.979
Rob Tod: That's a very good lead in question
for this.

00:53:10.979 --> 00:53:17.579
I went to Belgium with that same group of
guys -- Sam, Adam, Tommy, Vinnie.

00:53:17.579 --> 00:53:25.150
And we really focused on visiting lambic breweries.
When I was over there, I got all excited about

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:28.459
lambic beers.
And then, towards the end of the trip, I was

00:53:28.459 --> 00:53:30.930
like, "You know what?
These are really -- let's leave these to the

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:35.109
Belgians."
These beers -- basically, what you do with

00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:40.369
these beers is, you brew a batch of beer,
and instead of cooling it after the brewing

00:53:40.369 --> 00:53:46.069
process, after the boil, in a sterile heat
exchanger and adding a single-cell yeast culture

00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:51.309
and fermenting the beer out with this controlled
yeast culture, you cool the beer in a big

00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:56.989
open vessel exposed to the outside air.
The outside air both cools the beer and it

00:53:56.989 --> 00:54:01.519
also adds natural yeast and bacteria to the
beer.

00:54:01.519 --> 00:54:06.289
And basically, all brewers -- really, in the
world -- have always been told that you can

00:54:06.289 --> 00:54:11.760
only really make these traditional lambic
beers in the Zenne Valley region in the Brussels

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:17.720
area -- in Belgium.
So, I just woke up one morning about a year

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.059
after going on that trip, and I was just like,
"Let's just try making these beers. Why not?"

00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:27.160
So, it'll probably be a huge waste of money,
but you can see -- we built -- this is a koelschip

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:34.589
that we built on the slide here.
This holds about 400 gallons of beer.

00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:41.289
The boiled wort goes into this vessel, cools
overnight, gets inoculated with natural yeast

00:54:41.289 --> 00:54:44.819
and bacteria from Portland.
We had no idea whether this would work.

00:54:44.819 --> 00:54:47.019
We didn't do any kind of experimentation.
We just did it.

00:54:47.019 --> 00:54:51.100
It was kind of stupid. [laughter]
But we were curious to see if it would work.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:58.349
And it actually did work.
The beer -- you can see this is the wort being

00:54:58.349 --> 00:55:03.329
pumped into this room.
The louvered windows let the air in.

00:55:03.329 --> 00:55:06.509
I don't know if we'll ever sell this beer.
We were more just curious to see if it would

00:55:06.509 --> 00:55:07.509
work.

00:55:07.509 --> 00:55:08.509
Q [inaudible]

00:55:08.509 --> 00:55:13.049
Rob Tod: No. No breweries outside of Belgium
really do it.

00:55:13.049 --> 00:55:18.599
Some breweries in the U.S. have done some
spontaneously fermented beers, but none that

00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:23.679
I know of have built like a commercial koelschip.
So.

00:55:23.679 --> 00:55:25.299
Q [inaudible]

00:55:25.299 --> 00:55:30.209
Rob Tod: Two years. We brewed this batch just
about two years ago.

00:55:30.209 --> 00:55:34.079
This is the next morning.
It's the smallest of the batches we did.

00:55:34.079 --> 00:55:44.660
This batch actually -- the Eves Spneel who
does a festival every two years in Belgium.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:49.249
It's one of the big lambic and sour beer fests
 -- was over at the brewery about two or three

00:55:49.249 --> 00:55:52.920
months ago, and tasted this first batch and
the second batch.

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:58.769
And he wants it at a brew fest he's holding
over there in December for traditional lambics.

00:55:58.769 --> 00:56:03.529
And a traditional unblended lambic is two
years old.

00:56:03.529 --> 00:56:06.410
It's not a combination of different barrels;
it comes from one barrel.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:11.269
It's basically uncarbonated, spontaneously
fermented beer.

00:56:11.269 --> 00:56:16.700
And we're bottling that beer I think Monday
 -- this batch -- two years old after fermenting

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:21.910
spontaneously in French oak.
And you know, it came out pretty well.

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:27.179
So we'll see what the reaction is.
We were just curious to see if it worked.

00:56:27.179 --> 00:56:31.991
That's that batch of beer fermenting in the
barrel just from natural yeast and bacteria

00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:36.219
from Portland.
It tastes like -- have you ever had some of

00:56:36.219 --> 00:56:43.569
the sour beers?
It tastes like a lambic beer. It's a little

00:56:43.569 --> 00:56:46.519
different.
It's definitely a little different, but we've

00:56:46.519 --> 00:56:50.819
also taken a number of those barrels and added
fruit to them.

00:56:50.819 --> 00:56:55.739
Some sour cherries, some raspberries, we've
added the barrels.

00:56:55.739 --> 00:56:59.420
And it's tasting pretty good.
We're actually kind of surprised.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:07.459
All right. I should probably -- I'll quickly
mention, This last beer is the Allagash Black.

00:57:07.459 --> 00:57:12.650
This is basically -- it's again another recipe.
It's loosely based on a Stout, but it's fermented

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:18.339
with a Belgian yeast strain.
So we call it like a Belgian Stout, for lack

00:57:18.339 --> 00:57:25.999
of a better description -- not really a stout,
but it's just the Allagash Black, so.

00:57:25.999 --> 00:57:27.939
Q [inaudible]

00:57:27.939 --> 00:57:33.349
Rob Tod: Definitely, and actually Susan who
reps us in the market can tell you the best

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:54.400
place to get it or where to get it.

00:57:54.400 --> 00:58:21.289
Q [long inaudible question]

00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:45.619
Rob Tod: That's the brewery crew there. We're
an interesting crew.

00:58:45.619 --> 00:58:51.190
&gt;&gt; Sadly guys, we have to stop.
I could listen to this stuff for hours.

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:55.549
But we do have another event in here at 4:30.
Thank you, everybody, for coming.

00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:56.549
Thank you, Rob Tod.

00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:57.619
Rob Tod: Thank you guys very much.

00:58:57.619 --> 00:58:57.799
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
