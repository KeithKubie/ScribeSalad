00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:08.160
This is the fastest man-made object ever created, racing to our Sun at 700,000 km/h.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.580
Built to withstand drastic changes in temperature,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.180
it will be the closest to spacecraft
has ever been to a star.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.820
So, how did NASA prepare this record-breaking mission

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.000
for its daring journey to the Sun?

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.300
There are three main questions
that Parker Solar Probe is going to answer .

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.200
The first really is, why is the corona so hot? Why is the solar wind continually accelerated?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.320
And what causes these very high-energy particles to be accelerated?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.620
Dr. Nicola Fox led five research teams to launch this scientific quest in August of 2018,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.460
and one of the biggest challenges started 
with the size of the spacecraft.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.680
With Parker Solar Probe, we had such a 
tight mass restriction

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.320
to be able to be thrown away from the planet with the launch energy that we needed.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.980
That was a continual battle. A lot of missions, 
you solve problems by adding mass.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.800
You can make it bigger. You can grow something;

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.200
we really couldn't.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.660
The design of the probe's heat shield is considered revolutionary, because it had to protect the instruments

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.640
from extreme heat up to 1,400 degrees Celsius.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.900
And that was only half the challenge.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.800
The Parker Solar Probe orbit goes very close to the Sun on one side of its orbit,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.540
and then out around the planet Venus on the other,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.860
taking that big temperature swing from incredibly hot to very cold out by Venus.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.700
As the temperature changes, the shape of the heat shield will change.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940
It might become elastic, or it could become brittle

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.120
but it's not going to be the same material
that you had in the beginning.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.460
It will kind of potato chip.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.760
So we had to develop attach points
that would be able to withstand

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.940
the stress of the change in shape of the heat shield, and also not allow any heat

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.780
that the heat shield is absorbing
to come into the spacecraft itself.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.420
The shield was plasma-sprayed 
with specialized alumina coating,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.960
in a shade referred to as whiter-than-white,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.020
designed to reflect most of the sun's energy before it even reaches the shield.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.880
The result keeps the research instruments at about 30 degrees Celsius.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.080
It is made of two carbon-carbon face sheets

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.740
that are very thin, and then there's about four inches of carbon-carbon foam

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.820
that is between these two sheets.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.240
That foam core is about 97% air, allowing the shield overall to only weigh 72 kilograms.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480
Then, it was put to the test.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.060
We vibrate it, we make sure that, 
you know, it will withstand

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.840
that very bumpy ride into space, 
but we also tested it to extreme heats.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.940
So we take coupons, which are like small 
sections of the heat shield,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.740
fully made up, exactly as the heat shield would be.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.980
and then we can actually illuminate it with the same amount of energy

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.600
that the Sun will illuminate on the full heat shield.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.700
So we know that these small samples will withstand

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.340
even greater temperatures than we will see on orbit.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.460
Another crucial phase of testing was
the spacecraft's autonomy system.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.520
It takes light eight minutes to travel 
from the Sun to the earth.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.660
And so, if Parker Solar Probe has a problem

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.220
there's no way we can kind of joystick 
the mission from here on earth.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.100
She has to be able to look after herself.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.820
It's almost like you think of every single thing that 
could go wrong on the mission,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.560
and you program her to deal with those problems.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.020
The probe has sensors built around 
the main body of the spacecraft

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.600
that are designed to never see the Sun at all.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.120
If one does, the probe will know 
what necessary steps to take to reposition.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.200
Onboard the spacecraft are four instrument suites carefully designed to collect data

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.780
and withstand not only intense temperatures, 
but also radiation.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.160
Most unique of all is the Faraday cup.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.760
I always say, 'the bravest little instrument 
on the spacecraft'

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.920
because it takes no shade from that heat shield.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.500
The Faraday cup takes measurements to determine velocity, density, and temperature of the sun's plasma.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.860
Made of refractory metals 
and sapphire crystal insulators,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.720
this cup was built to endure the full light, heat, and energy of the Sun.

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.509
It has a little mini heat shield 
that is made of niobium C-103;

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.749
it is a pretty exotic instrument when all is said and done.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.460
Dr. Justin Casper of the University of Michigan had the task of testing it for the mission.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.200
And so, they actually developed their own test chamber:

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.760
they took reconditioned IMAX projectors

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.560
as it turns out that that is the closest to all the light that radiates from the Sun that they could find.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.980
They put them inside a vacuum chamber and then basically illuminated the instrument

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.860
and shot particles at it. And they could
do that for as long as they wanted

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.800
and were able to fully qualify the Faraday cup for Solar Probe.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.840
Every time something happens on the Sun, 
that has an impact.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.260
It actually interacts with our planet's magnetic field,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.960
and drives beautiful aurora; 
it can also cause problems for technology.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.660
In 1859, a solar storm known as the Carrington Event produced a coronal mass ejection

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.560
that hit Earth's magnetosphere.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.220
It was one of the largest geomagnetic storms on record, shutting down the telegraph systems.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.580
Losing the telegraph system for a few days 
was inconvenient.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.740
Losing the internet and our entire way of communicating,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.620
losing power grids, losing all the technology
that we rely on now

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.420
is a much much much bigger impact.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.500
When we have flown Parker Solar Probe, we will make huge, huge improvements

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.820
in our ability to predict what is happening at our planet that is constantly driven by this star.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.619
It's not just about our Sun. It's not even 
just about our Sun's effect here on Earth;

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.939
it's really about how stars throughout the universe work.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.539
We are really kind of fitting 
the missing piece into a puzzle.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.580
You can now put a real piece of physics 
into this sort of area

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.880
where it's kind of like a black hole right now.
