00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.620
The first thing we need to do in order to simplify this and modify the equation

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.889
is to multiply out the product of these two binomials. That way, when we

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.721
subtract 750 from both sides we can very easily combine like terms and simplify.

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:18.342
You'll notice I've written the expression on the left in the standard form for

00:00:18.342 --> 00:00:23.113
polynomials but the highest degree term first. Great. So we have x squared plus

00:00:23.113 --> 00:00:25.498
35x minus 450 is less than or equal to 0.
