[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.300
MALE SPEAKER 1: Shanghai GDG
the is a very interesting

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.560
developer community.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.390
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.670
has asked this question.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.810
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.120
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.130
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.380
would like to ask questions.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.095
TODD KERPELMAN: And
we are live.

00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:30.420
WOLFF DOBSON: Bravo.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.200
TODD KERPELMAN: Hello.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.880
All right.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.420
Welcome to Google Games
Chat number

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.270
five, still not canceled.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.710
COLT MCANLIS: Alto cinco.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.670
TODD KERPELMAN: So I guess we
should start by apologizing

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.940
for last week's episode not
making it onto YouTube.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.120
WOLFF DOBSON: Our awesomeness
cannot be compressed.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.420
COLT MCANLIS: It was probably
for the better that that one

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.630
didn't make it on.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.190
TODD KERPELMAN: In retrospect,
I think we probably had a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.890
little too much gratuitous
nudity

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.680
that probably violated--

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.010
COLT MCANLIS: Todd.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.370
TODD KERPELMAN: I thought
it was artistic.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.000
I thought I was artistic.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.319
But apparently, those--

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.459
WOLFF DOBSON: We don't have
a release for those

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.210
parts of our bodies.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.360
COLT MCANLIS: The Supreme Court
will tell you what's

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.646
artistic and not.

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:09.790
TODD KERPELMAN: I know
it when I see it.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.080
I'm just saying, I thought it
was tastefully done, and it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.160
was a beautiful thing.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.900
But apparently those people at
YouTube just did not agree.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.070
And so those of you who missed
the last episode, episode

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.270
number four, it's been
lost in the ether--

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.890
WOLFF DOBSON: You missed out.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.710
That's what I'm saying.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.140
I don't think it'll
ever happen again.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.390
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: A whole
lot of Todd.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.770
TODD KERPELMAN: So we are going
to move off of this

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.360
uncomfortable topic and go
into some introductions.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.190
To my left is Daniel
Wolff Dobson, Dr.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.920
Daniel Wolff Dobson.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.050
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm a doctor,
and I play one on Google

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.160
Developers Live.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.730
TODD KERPELMAN: To my immediate

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.830
right is Colt McAnlis.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.730
Say hi, Colt.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.700
COLT MCANLIS: Hi, Colt.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.740
TODD KERPELMAN: And to his
right is John McCutchan.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.830
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Hey, everyone.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.010
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.670
So actually I want to start by
asking, you're a doctor?

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.340
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.040
TODD KERPELMAN: I did not
know this until--

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.590
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm not the kind
of doctor that does surgery,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.930
although maybe the occasional
unnecessary surgery.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.000
But no, I have a PhD in computer
science in artificial

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.770
intelligence.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.480
I worked on intelligent user
interfaces, so interfaces that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.370
had an idea of what it was
you were trying to do.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.500
And then because it had a model
of what you're doing, it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.140
could help you do it better,
more or less.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.990
Old AI PhDs are not awesome
reading, because a lot of it

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.070
is like, well, yeah, that
would be a good idea.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.200
And now, here, 10 years later,
it was a good idea.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.960
We should have done that.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.550
TODD KERPELMAN: Is there an
example of this put into

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.690
practice that you'd be able
to point to and say--

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.490
WOLFF DOBSON: You don't want
to ask a PhD to talk about

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.950
their thesis.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.920
TODD KERPELMAN: That
is probably true.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.900
WOLFF DOBSON: That
gets ugly quick.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.780
But I will say that after I did
some post-doc work doing a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.760
lot of interesting things,
rendering Mars Rover data and

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.710
things like that, I was like,
I think I'm done with this,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.350
and joined Sega Sports and
started working on basketball.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.030
TODD KERPELMAN: Sounds
way more fun.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.460
WOLFF DOBSON: Which was very
much AI, although it's

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.700
interesting, because so much
of the AI in console games,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.240
especially of that era, is very
much reactive planning,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.180
which is a classic theory that
came out of the University of

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.370
Chicago about control.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.000
And what it really was, was this
reactive planning from

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.460
the early '90s, but elaborated
to the n-th degree, where we

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.390
just had tons of code for every
possible situation,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.530
every frame, deciding
what should the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.160
basketball player do next?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.150
Well, is he doing this?

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.790
Hes' doing this.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.170
We have hundreds of heuristics
that are all watching what--

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.870
should he pass, should
he not pass?

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.490
If I had the ball, would I have
a better shot than if I

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.740
passed it to Colt and
he had the ball?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.930
If I pass the ball to Colt,
would it get intercepted?

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.926
All these things, and you're
calculating that every frame.

00:03:57.926 --> 00:03:59.050
COLT MCANLIS: If you
hand me the ball, I

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.184
generally take the shot.

00:04:00.184 --> 00:04:00.940
That's how it works.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.920
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, and
then, you know--

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.240
TODD KERPELMAN: Doesn't matter
where he is on the court.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.320
WOLFF DOBSON: I mean, you
actually put in emotion things

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.640
like that, where it's like,
a guy like Kobe, he

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.440
holds onto the ball.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.820
And it has some funny side
effects, which is if you have

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.290
one character who's really out
of balance, he'll never pass.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.700
Because no matter what, he is
the best guy with the ball.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.630
So yeah, I'm rarely a practicing
scientist now,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.520
although I still review papers
for the AAAI Conference on

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.160
computer games.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.650
TODD KERPELMAN: Wow.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.920
There's a whole lot about
you I did not know.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.820
Are neural networks-- like
are those passe now?

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.990
WOLFF DOBSON: No, no.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.736
People still do neural
networks.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:41.480
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Wasn't the cat
detector a neural network?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.590
WOLFF DOBSON: No, neural
networks are still very

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.190
interesting.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.990
There's lots of--

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.870
I mean, I had sort of good
old-fashioned AI kind of

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.600
stuff, where we are
doing symbolic

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.790
representations of things.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.730
But there is also--

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.920
machine learning
is really big.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.520
Machine learning in games is
very interesting because

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.240
machine learning is about
optimization.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.860
A lot of times, it doesn't
actually sell very well when

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.980
you're doing it in a game.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.190
So if you're playing a football
game and you're doing

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.180
machine learning on what kind
of plays the guy is doing or

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.770
something like that, it will
gradually start getting better

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.220
than you or being able to
predict every move you're

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.770
going to make.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.800
And that's not actually
that much fun.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.170
TODD KERPELMAN: It's not fun
to continually lose?

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.850
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, you--

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:24.430
COLT MCANLIS: Ask
the programmer.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.360
It's super fun.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.140
WOLFF DOBSON: You don't see
it, and you don't--

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.600
if you're doing this gradual
optimization process, you

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.530
don't have any place where you
can call attention to and say,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.510
this is the moment in which
I learned something, and

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.090
therefore, I will
tell you this.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.160
Which is why machine
learning--

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.260
so if you have a machine
learning thing, a neural

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.350
network that's driving your
car, you can't really tell

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.360
it's being driven by a neural
network unless you annotate it

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.290
with a whole bunch of stuff,
like, oh, he's missed the

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.670
curve, or something like this.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.270
So machine learning is
really interesting.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.760
It's really interesting
in games.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.570
But again, it tends to show up
in quiet ways that you can't

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.820
quite see it.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.930
You have showy stuff instead,
to like, look at this AI.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.870
It's being so smart.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.020
That tends to be more of
good old-fashioned AI.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.320
COLT MCANLIS: What do you feel
about modern games today?

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.710
Do you think that too much of
the AI isn't really AI?

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.543
Because I know a lot of it is
pretty much just pre-canned.

00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:19.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, there's a
whole discussion of what--

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.810
every time something gets
popular, a lot of times, the

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.270
AI establishment says,
well, that was never

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.280
really AI all along.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.170
That was an optimization
problem or

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.806
something like this.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:31.950
For a long time, it was
believable agents.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.070
You know, how could you make
sidekicks who were believable,

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.590
who seemed like they were
alive and things?

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.880
And then at some point, we
started making games then had

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.780
believable agents, dogs
that acted like

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.840
dogs, things like that.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.090
There's interesting research--

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.495
No, but like CatZ, C-A-T-Z, the
little pet cats that you

00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:53.000
could have from Broderbund.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.880
I mean, those were moments,
like, believable agents.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.655
Yeah, we can do that.

00:06:57.655 --> 00:06:58.850
Eh, that's not really AI.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.540
And it goes all the way back to
computer games learning, AI

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.330
learning how to play chess.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.820
At some point, oh,
that's not chess.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.500
That's just a search problem.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.120
Or that's not AI,
that's search.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.510
COLT MCANLIS: Well, that's
the goal, right?

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.430
I mean, chemistry is really
just physics,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.480
which is really just--

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.660
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.230
Well, what I would say about
games not really having real

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.370
AI, what I would actually say
about that is that you only

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.880
need to add as much AI to your
game to make it fun.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.960
So there are situations like
if you play Yakuza or

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.500
something like that, the AI for
the guys getting out of

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.810
your way as you're running
through the crowd is sort of

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.590
silly looking.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.110
They sort of stagger and they
pop to these weird animations,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.970
and all this other stuff.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.190
But you know what?

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.890
It's good enough.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.780
I can get through the crowd.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.660
They get of my way.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.350
And so I think a lot of people,
especially when I was

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.010
in grad school, I would play
these games and think, oh my

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.180
gosh, if they just used our
awesome super-advanced

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.440
algorithms, it wouldn't
do this.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.550
And then when you think about
it, it's like, it's not really

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.780
worth the money to get it
that beautiful or to

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.080
make it that seamless.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.980
And if it isn't perfect and
seamless, you don't even

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.210
notice how good it is.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.520
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Not just
the money, but also the

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.950
computation, right?

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.340
Like, how much computational
effort is it worth--

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.060
TODD KERPELMAN: How much
can you spend towards--

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.350
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, towards
crowd algorithms when you

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.640
don't really notice.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.900
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, exactly.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.305
I mean, if it's happening--

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:17.510
or a classic example
of this is playing

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.950
first-person shooters.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.910
If your sidekicks are not--

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.540
if you're playing a single
player game and your sidekicks

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.310
are not visible, they could
be doing anything.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.700
And in fact, they usually are.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.820
They're teleporting around.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.980
They're doing crazy stuff.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.289
Because it does not matter what
they're doing, because

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.496
you can't see them.

00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:34.289
TODD KERPELMAN: I have noticed

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.664
occasionally if some follower--

00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:39.110
I think this happens in Skyrim--
some follower isn't

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.700
able to path-find to where
I am, just keep going and

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.929
eventually they turn
the corner.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.210
WOLFF DOBSON: Yep, and
they're right there.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.460
And if you think about that,
it's good enough.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.270
If you're involved in playing
your game, and the guy is

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.485
there at the right moment, you
don't really think about, did

00:08:52.485 --> 00:08:55.050
he successfully path-plan his
way from point A to point B.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.510
COLT MCANLIS: Now there's been
interesting cases of that.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.840
Wasn't it Fable or Fable II?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.800
One of the two had a mission you
could send your horse on

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.830
or something like you could move
a zone, and move another

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.520
zone, and then the horse would
still try to follow you

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.390
through these zones and in the
process would of course take

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.750
damage and gain experience
points along the way.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.140
And there was this interesting
video on the net where someone

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.760
was like, OK, horse, stay.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.130
And then he went like two zones
away, and he whistled

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:18.850
for his horse.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.146
And the horse came back two
levels higher or something

00:09:21.146 --> 00:09:23.230
like that, because it had killed
mice along the way, or

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.660
some weird stuff.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.230
WOLFF DOBSON: That's beautiful,
and as an AI

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.880
developer, I think
that's so cool.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.790
As somebody who would be
budgeting that game, I would

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.900
say to myself, why did we
spend all this money on

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.980
off-screen horses?

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.840
If we could get three more good
horses on screen, I would

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.120
totally skip the horse playing
the game by itself.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.500
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, we're
going to move along to

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.500
our next topic.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:48.795
WOLFF DOBSON: Sorry

00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:49.420
TODD KERPELMAN: No,
this is totally--

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.600
well, this great, right?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.110
WOLFF DOBSON: Clearly, we
there's an AI episode.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.430
TODD KERPELMAN: We could
an entire episode

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.430
just on game AI.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.120
There's a lot more
to talk about.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.930
But we're going to move into
our five-for-five section--

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.510
WOLFF DOBSON: Five for five.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.490
TODD KERPELMAN: --where we--

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.440
yeah, we pick five topics that
we're going to talk about for

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.380
five minutes.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.890
I actually have my stopwatch set
for 5 minutes, 30 seconds,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.330
because I want us to have
a little extra time.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.620
And we always go over anyway.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.820
COLT MCANLIS: He's feeling
generous today.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.970
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes, I am.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.970
So I'm going to start with a
comment that Colt had made

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.530
right before this episode, which
is basically declaring

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.150
that 3D was dead.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.602
Why don't you back up this
claim, and then we'll all tell

00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:28.690
you why you're wrong.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.040
WOLFF DOBSON: Unlike our
completely uncontroversial

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.040
statements about game AI,
now we're going to say

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.890
whether 3D is dead.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.750
COLT MCANLIS: So let
me preface this.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.410
So I'm a graphics programmer,
traditionally.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.450
Before I came to Google, I spent
time in the industry as

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.930
a system and graphics
programmer, like hardcore.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.840
The question that I had today
was, where does 3D fit in our

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.010
modern gaming ecosystem?

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.970
We saw over the trend of a
couple console cycles that the

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:57.470
amount of cost to create these
movie production games

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.030
skyrocketed, mostly due to the
advances in 3D rendering.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.690
But what we've seen now is that
the move to casual mobile

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.170
social doesn't require the
same sort of Hollywood

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:08.910
backdrop, right?

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.850
We've seen better experiences
coming out of 2D environments

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.060
and more creativity coming from
low-cost development.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.440
In addition to that, with
the move to mobile--

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.030
your little stopwatch right
there-- we actually find that

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.355
these things aren't really
set up to do 3D well.

00:11:22.355 --> 00:11:23.480
It burns through the battery.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.230
It burns through the chips.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.230
It takes a lot more away
from the user.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.870
So the question is, besides the
console, is 3D really the

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.710
next step for tablet mobile?

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.560
Or is that really an ecosystem
that should be

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.090
dominated by 2D?

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.540
And the same thing for the
web, is there a spot

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.530
for 3D on the web?

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.180
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So production
values for 3D content are

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.490
extremely high.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.100
And mobile titles sell
for very little.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.480
You can't really sustain a
multimillion dollar game

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.520
budget when you're selling
your unit for $0.99.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.510
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, unless
you're making Infinity Blade,

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.410
and selling it for however
much it is now.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.360
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: $9.99 or
something like that.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.780
WOLFF DOBSON: It could be that
3D is the thing that persuades

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.710
people that this game is worth,
yeah, $4.99, instead of

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.020
$0.99, or instead
of free to play.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.000
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Sure, yeah.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.770
But I mean, I still think that
modern, really high-quality

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.800
AAA games sell for $70 a pop.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.930
And they are in development for
four years and have huge

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.710
armies of programmers
and artists.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:31.850
And even selling a game for $10,
it's hard to recoup those

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:32.790
costs, I think.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.160
WOLFF DOBSON: Well,
but some of that--

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.090
some of that is tools.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.030
If you have good tools, you
don't need that army of

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.640
programmers.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.770
What you need is an
army of artists.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:44.700
COLT MCANLIS: Unless
you're writing a

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.322
really good AI algorithm.

00:12:46.322 --> 00:12:49.330
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Then
it does it for you.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.170
TODD KERPELMAN: How
much of this--

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.150
WOLFF DOBSON: Actually, in all
seriousness, I read a paper

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:58.680
about that a while ago where
they were actually generating

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.670
buildings complete-- filled
with everything down to

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.450
pencils on the desk from
basically AI algorithms.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.040
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's great if
you want to have kind of--

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.160
if you have a whole bunch of
geometry, like a city, that

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.240
can very easily be procedurally
generated.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.540
We all kind of know what
a city looks like.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.630
But gamers of 3D games and
gamers expect very cinematic

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.210
experiences, which is
essentially like you are

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.190
scripting a movie scene
that the player

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.710
gets to play through.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.130
And in that case, it's difficult
to procedurally

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:30.790
generate that.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.860
Because the helicopter has to
come in now and blow this city

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.190
block up at that moment.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.070
TODD KERPELMAN: See, I don't
know all this has necessarily

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.010
anything to do with it being in
3D versus people just sort

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:46.290
of wanting big set piece
kinds of games.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.130
I mean, there's obviously--

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.095
if you take something like--

00:13:51.095 --> 00:13:52.620
why am I blanking on it--

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.090
Minecraft.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.870
Obviously, a 3D game, obviously
a still simplistic

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:03.220
stylized art style, was done
fairly inexpensively.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.070
It's not like there's anything
inherent in 3D that I think

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.440
sort of makes it more expensive,
so much as people

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.860
kind of want the big games.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.100
They want the big experiences.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.110
And if somehow 3D had never
been invented and we were

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.000
still doing 2D, we would be
complaining about the cost of

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.935
hiring all these animators
to hand draw all

00:14:19.935 --> 00:14:21.860
these cells and how--

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.480
I think we'd be talking about
resolutions are getting

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.760
bigger, so sprites are getting
bigger, and my god, everyone

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.905
wants to customize everything,
and we

00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:30.460
want 60 frames a second--

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.940
WOLFF DOBSON: I think there's an
alternate universe, like a

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.080
TV show, if 3D was
never invented.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.280
TODD KERPELMAN: Those guys
would be saying, if only

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.110
things were in 3D then we
would have to span--

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.260
WOLFF DOBSON: If only
I had a Z buffer.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.270
TODD KERPELMAN: --90 frames
drawing write this walk cycle.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.550
COLT MCANLIS: Let's
do it this way.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.920
Google fires you today.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.200
You start a game company.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.090
Is your game 3D or 2D?

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.410
Go.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.870
WOLFF DOBSON: Depending
on how this show goes.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:52.680
COLT MCANLIS: Is your
game 3D or 2D?

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.710
You start a game studio.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.470
Google fires you.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.430
Is your game 3D or 2D?

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.900
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh gosh, it
absolutely comes down to what

00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.400
I'm building.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:14:59.890
COLT MCANLIS: Well, no.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.310
Right now, is it 3D or 2D?

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.142
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: 2D.

00:15:02.142 --> 00:15:03.120
Done.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.470
TODD KERPELMAN: Eh,
2 and 1/2 D.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.450
WOLFF DOBSON: I would probably
do 3D because it would be a

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.700
differentiating factor.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.510
TODD KERPELMAN: Daniel Cook
had a really interesting

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.510
point, which was like, if
you're a small budget

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:20.550
developer, you can't compete on
massive art budgets, so you

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.770
go for the stylized stuff.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.180
And when you kind of stop and
think about it, every indie

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.910
game, whether it's 3D or 2D,
something like Fez, is still

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.350
kind of done in sort of
a stylized art style.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.480
So that you don't actually
care whether--

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.080
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's funny
that you bring that up,

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.980
because this week, Mike Acton
just asked his Twitter

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.340
followers, like hey, do you
think that the push towards

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.670
realistic graphics is improving
or harming the

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.650
quality of games?

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.680
And the very nonscientific poll
came back saying people

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.310
don't like it as much.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:55.380
They prefer the stylized
approach.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.190
I would have to say I often like
games that are stylized.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.950
I think one of the prettiest
games I've ever played was

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.540
Wind Waker.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.100
That game is just beautiful, and
it looks nothing like real

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.300
life, but it looks like
an awesome cartoon.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.140
WOLFF DOBSON: Going back a
little bit, about the tools, I

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.720
mean, this is--

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.300
like part of the reason why,
if I were starting my game

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.820
studio, I would think about 3D
because everybody can do 2D.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.270
And if I have the special
skills, and find the right

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.210
people, and invest in the
pipeline at the beginning, I

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.600
mean this is what makes--

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.520
why 2D is cheap and
3D is expensive.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.010
3D, you've got to set
up a pipeline.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.080
You've got to get a rig,
animation, all this stuff.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.650
And you have to figure out how
to get those into your game in

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.440
some sane way.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.080
And there are tools like
Unity where they do

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.050
some of that for you.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.610
But you still have to build
the pipeline from your

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.790
modelers to the motion models
and to the game finally.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.585
And that's very expensive.

00:16:48.585 --> 00:16:50.600
That's a big upfront cost.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.340
With a 2D game, dude, I've just
got to get some sprites

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.580
up there, and that's
all I need.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.070
But for every level I add onto
the 3D game, I have to do a

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.040
lot less work than for every
level I have to add on--

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:02.760
TODD KERPELMAN: That is true.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.730
WOLFF DOBSON: Each new animation
costs exactly the

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:08.920
same for a 2D game, but each
new animation in my 3D game

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.119
costs almost nothing,
because I'm just

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:12.359
moving the rig around.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.810
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, well,
we're going to move on.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:22.280
We're out of time Next topic,
Dart, Dart as a language.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:22.650
Obviously--

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.599
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
it's pretty sweet.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.220
TODD KERPELMAN: -we've been
chatting about it quite a bit

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.550
here at Google.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:27.802
COLT MCANLIS: It's exciting.

00:17:27.802 --> 00:17:28.590
It's a really cool language.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.870
TODD KERPELMAN: I mean, how do
we think it's going to affect

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.440
the game industry?

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.090
How do you think
game developers

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.900
could make use of Dart?

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.200
WOLFF DOBSON: You know who
really knows about this is JJ.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.880
TODD KERPELMAN: Shh, dude.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.620
Don't say JJ's name aloud.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.510
If you do, if you say it three
times, he appears.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.978
WOLFF DOBSON: Who?

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:42.446
JJ?

00:17:42.446 --> 00:17:42.914
TODD KERPELMAN: JJ.

00:17:42.914 --> 00:17:44.630
COLT MCANLIS: Ahh!

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.460
JJ BURNS: Did somebody
say my name?

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.314
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh jeez!

00:17:47.314 --> 00:17:50.670
COLT MCANLIS: How long have
you been down there?

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.230
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh my
god, he lives there.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.720
JJ BURNS: You really
don't want to know.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.350
TODD KERPELMAN: Dude, don't
look in that coffee can.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.542
We're going to start.

00:18:00.542 --> 00:18:01.340
TODD KERPELMAN: Hi, JJ.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:01.773
JJ BURNS: Howdy.

00:18:01.773 --> 00:18:02.206
TODD KERPELMAN: Hey buddy.

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:03.120
TODD KERPELMAN: How's
it going?

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.340
WOLFF DOBSON: Did
not expect that.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.690
JJ BURNS: Nice to be here.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.130
COLT MCANLIS: JJ, by the
way everyone, is--

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.000
introduce yourself
to the crowd.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.020
JJ BURNS: I'm JJ Burns I'm a
developer advocate for Dart.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:13.520
TODD KERPELMAN: Excellent.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.570
So why don't you tell us why
should game developers care

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.210
about Dart?

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.090
What do they need to
know about Dart?

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.130
COLT MCANLIS: Does it increase
your cloaking ability,

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.440
apparently?

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.340
JJ BURNS: Well, the thing about
building web games these

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.510
days is that it's hard.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.860
And the larger the game
is, the harder it is.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.020
Because JavaScript wasn't
really built for

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.050
coding in the large.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.560
When it first came out, web
apps didn't really exist.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.790
And so Dart tries to retrofit
and fix a lot of those

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.590
problems with optional
static typing.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.862
I like to say that it's kind of
a scalable language in that

00:18:51.862 --> 00:18:53.770
it scales with the size
of your project.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.320
If I wanted to build a game
with 100 developers and a

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.130
million lines of code, I'd want
to do it in Dart, not

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.000
JavaScript.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.880
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Absolutely.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.925
TODD KERPELMAN: And so--

00:19:05.925 --> 00:19:10.530
and I guess we sort of talked
about this before in previous

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.400
discussions, but Dart does
compile essentially into

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.895
JavaScript if you are on a
browser that does not support

00:19:15.895 --> 00:19:16.920
native client.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.420
JJ BURNS: That's right.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.670
There's a VM that's been
integrated into a fork of

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.400
Chromium, and that's
called Dartium.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.100
But since almost no one runs
Dartium, we have it compiling

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.230
down to JavaScript.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.700
And one of the interesting
things about is the Dart to JS

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.770
compiler can actually
compile JavaScript--

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.160
TODD KERPELMAN: Hold on, Jimmy's
telling us something.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.120
What's that?

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.380
Oh, you can pick it up, hey.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.540
That's why we had this mic
sitting here this whole time.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.360
In case some random person
living in our

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.520
studio popped up.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.600
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: In case somebody
has cut a hole in the

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.340
back of the studio and
crawled through.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:52.840
COLT MCANLIS: What
is this thing?

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:52.920
Why is this over here?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.070
Like I'm leaning away.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.110
I thought it was a stage mic.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.360
TODD KERPELMAN: Anyway,
let's--

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.110
JJ BURNS: The Dart to JS guys,
they're pretty amazing in that

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.270
they're not trying to do just
like straightforward

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:10.530
one-to-one translation between
Dart and JavaScript, but

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.560
rather, they're applying all
kinds of interesting

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.680
optimizations.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.790
So a lot of times, the
JavaScript that they can

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.180
compile down to is actually
faster than the JavaScript

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.180
that you could write by hand.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.010
Because they can do all
kinds of tricks like

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.320
in-lining and so forth.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.470
And so you'll see this
once in a while.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.080
If you end up looking at the
generated JavaScript, it's

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.360
like whoa, look at what they
did to me my code.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.550
That's not what I wrote.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.120
But it's kind of brilliant.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.660
COLT MCANLIS: So for game
developers out there who don't

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.680
have exposure to Dart, but come
from the web, what are

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.090
the big three things
they should know?

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.900
If they're an action script
developer or a Flash

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.390
developer, what are the three
things they should know that

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.630
make Dart awesome?

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.130
JJ BURNS: Let me see.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.790
I would think of it in terms
of the three types of

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:53.230
programmers.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.800
So if you're an ActionScript 3
developer, I think that you're

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.890
going to find Dart
very familiar.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.970
Because syntactically, it's
somewhere between

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.440
JavaScript and Java.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.680
It's got the optional
static types things.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.490
So I think that the ActionScript
3 developer will

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.330
find it very comfortable.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.050
Now if you're a JavaScript
guy, you might be used to

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:18.730
tools not helping you out
enough, not catching errors

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.710
early enough, not being able
to refactor in ways, not

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.550
understanding your
code well enough.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.690
And I think that the Dart editor
is going to really

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.220
surprise you in what
it can do.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.860
Now, the third way, if you're
from like a C# Java

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.990
background, you're probably used
to really, really solid

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.940
development tools like Visual
Studio and IntelliJ.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.220
And you might look at JavaScript
and say I just

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.170
can't do it.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.770
I know that John said
this before that--

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.510
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There are
no rules in JavaScript.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.470
There's no rules.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.400
WOLFF DOBSON: That's what
I love about JavaScript.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.890
There are no rules.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.470
JJ BURNS: If you can think like
a Lisp guy, or Python,

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.810
Perl, Ruby hacker, then
JavaScript makes a lot of

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.800
sense, but if you're coming from
a C# Java background, it

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.170
might be a little bit
frustrating, and I think that

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.730
Dart alleviates a lot
of that frustration.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.020
WOLFF DOBSON: Speaking as
somebody who has a PhD in AI,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.950
I frickin' love Lisp.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.750
Sorry, I'm distracting
from you.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:12.430
COLT MCANLIS: Quick
question here.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.870
So game development is
all the performance.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:15.170
JJ BURNS: Yes.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.920
COLT MCANLIS: And When it comes
down to the metal, we

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.360
care about how you can iterate
over the arrays, how we can

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.320
optimize for that.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.600
So what does Dart bring to the
table for games that care

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.700
about performance?

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.270
JJ BURNS: So actually, I think
John could talk about this a

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.700
little bit.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.490
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Absolutely.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.380
I've been working with the
Dart VM team to make this

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.370
fast, to make things like vector
math faster under the

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.120
Dart VM than is currently
possible

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.300
in any other language.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.660
So by extending access to
floating point arrays so that

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.860
you could do things like convert
a four-by-four matrix

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.300
that's stored inside an array
using the SIMD extensions that

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.540
your CPU has, these sorts of
algorithms can be greatly

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.150
accelerated.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:55.640
COLT MCANLIS: Fantastic.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.310
So we can do fast
linear algebra.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.145
We can do transforms.

00:22:58.145 --> 00:23:00.020
We can do processing.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.760
WOLFF DOBSON: Tell me about
debugging tools, like when I'm

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.500
trying to live debug Dart.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.180
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: This is
an awesome thing.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.300
Dart has an IDEA.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:06.880
It has tools.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.400
It has a type system.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.660
And you set breakpoints
in your editor.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.710
It's all the way there.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.190
That's awesome.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.050
You set breakpoints
in the editor.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.280
You launch your application.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.330
It's running in Dartium.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.740
The breakpoint hits.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.310
It goes back to the editor.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.760
There you go.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.960
You can fan out your
variables, look

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.640
at your call stack.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.840
JJ BURNS: Look at your
stack, yeah.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.660
Look at your variables, mouse
over a variable in the source

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.360
code, and it will show
you the value.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.660
COLT MCANLIS: And is the plan
to migrate that from Dartium

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.140
to Chromium?

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.280
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think that
in the future that's a

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.290
possibility.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.560
TODD KERPELMAN: So I'll end
with one final question.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.390
So obviously, in JavaScript
right now, there's a lot of

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:48.700
libraries, Box2D for physics,
stuff to kind of help manage

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.030
graphics, all of that.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.210
Like Dart, my impression
is it's just

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.380
starting as a language.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.970
Are those libraries available,
and can I use them just as

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:58.530
JavaScript?

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.090
How does that work?

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.510
JJ BURNS: I would break the
libraries into two categories.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.800
There's things like jQuery.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.970
And I always like to say that
Dart is its own jQuery,

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:13.340
because Dart provides a
nicer API for the DOM.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.655
As far as the Box2D,
there's a port of--

00:24:15.655 --> 00:24:17.590
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, actually
there's a port being developed

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.500
by Dominic Hamon, who
works at Google.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.410
And I've actually been working
with him on optimizing my

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.410
vector math library for
the Box2D port.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.570
TODD KERPELMAN: What
about graphics?

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.870
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I have a
graphics engine, which

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:35.010
presents something closer to
console graphics APIs and

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:39.430
DirectX 11 graphics APIs,
rather than WebGL.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.120
Then a demo, like higher-level
library that sits on top of

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.070
that allows you to have a
dynamically hot reloadable

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.550
scene graph and all kinds
of animations

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.230
and things like that.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.840
COLT MCANLIS: And this
is the public, right?

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.280
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, it's
all on my GitHub.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.920
JJ BURNS: Yeah that's the really
nice thing about Dart

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.070
is that it is fully
open source and

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.250
developed in the open.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.450
And so you could look at John
and I yelling at each other

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.495
over code reviews
and so forth.

00:25:05.495 --> 00:25:06.710
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Over breakfast
every day.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.870
WOLFF DOBSON: I actually can
frequently hear that.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:10.540
JJ BURNS: Yeah, well,
you know.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.300
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All
the way from 19--

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.160
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.379
I'm just sitting in 1900, and
I can hear you guys shouting

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:15.030
at each other.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:15.620
JJ BURNS: It's true.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.650
TODD KERPELMAN: So thank you
very much for dropping--

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:19.650
what you going to do now?

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.970
Are you just going
to hang out?

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.100
JJ BURNS: I've got to go
back to work, man.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.790
I can't pop up during
every GDL, man.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.770
I've got work to do.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.380
TODD KERPELMAN: We've got
to remember not to

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.170
say his name again.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.570
And he's out.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.980
Sh!

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:33.260
Careful.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.340
Don't say his name
three times.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.020
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah, he'll
have to come back.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:42.040
I'm going to let you finish
about your Dart talk, but that

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.920
VM was the best.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.740
That--

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.685
I did not know he
was back there.

00:25:48.685 --> 00:25:49.890
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm
frightened now.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:50.885
What's the next subject?

00:25:50.885 --> 00:25:53.250
Do we have more people
back there?

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.780
COLT MCANLIS: Next time, we need
to get Sergey back there.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.730
Have him pop up with
some Google Glass.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.250
TODD KERPELMAN: That
would be fantastic.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.060
I'll talk to him about that.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.430
COLT MCANLIS: Jimmy, can you
send an email on that?

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.902
JIMMY: Saying his name
three times does

00:26:01.902 --> 00:26:04.350
not make him appear.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.390
TODD KERPELMAN: All
right, next topic.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.900
We didn't really talk--
we sort of

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.270
missed this last time--

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.200
Valve.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.080
Big picture mode on scene.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.810
WOLFF DOBSON: The big picture.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:16.470
And presumably at some point,
some type of Valve-specific

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:17.310
hardware coming out.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.630
What do we think
about all this?

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think
it's pretty exciting.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.600
Valve has been investing heavily
in OpenGL and, in

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.040
particular, Linux performance.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.280
So if I were to take a guess,
I would say that whatever

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.420
Valve is producing is going to
be running Linux because of

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:38.410
how much they've been publicly
putting into R&amp;D on the Linux

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.820
OpenGL stack.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.750
It's really exciting.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.800
I, at some point in time, kind
of stopped gaming on my PC

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.820
because I like the idea of
sitting around on the couch.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.570
I missed that experience of
hanging out with friends in

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.210
the living room, playing the
games, and that seems to be

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:58.000
what the Steam Box Big Picture
mode is all about.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.010
WOLFF DOBSON: One of
the reasons why--

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.490
I mean, I'm a huge Steam fan,
and one of the things that's

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.380
great about it is
it just works.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.490
Like when you download a game
and you play it, it just works

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.460
as opposed to--

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.580
COLT MCANLIS: Have you tried
the Big Picture mode?

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.525
WOLFF DOBSON: No, I haven't
tried Big Picture mode.

00:27:12.525 --> 00:27:14.160
But I'm saying just in general,
they have this

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.090
experience that to me, as a
console developer, it felt

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.160
like console games.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.640
You just go, you click on the
game you want to play, you hit

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.790
play, and you're playing
the game, often.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:28.910
But when you're installing the
game off disks, I remember

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.380
there was this point where
I-- it took me--

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.810
I think I started Doom 3 seven
times, trying to get it-- like

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.860
the settings in some sane way
in which people's faces

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.015
weren't peeling off.

00:27:39.015 --> 00:27:40.180
Just like I'm never--

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.641
TODD KERPELMAN: That might have
been part of the game.

00:27:41.641 --> 00:27:43.490
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That
was intended.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.060
WOLFF DOBSON: No, but it was
during the opening cut scenes,

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.880
which they were clearly not.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.610
You were always seeing the back
of people and the back of

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:48.400
people's faces and stuff.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.210
And I was like, I'm never--

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.100
was it that?

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.790
Oh no, sorry, it just getting-
incredibly tarry, and I was

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:59.970
like, OK, I'm never playing
on a PC again.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.806
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I would love to
have all of the games that

00:28:02.806 --> 00:28:06.510
are on Steam in my living room
on my TV, holding some

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.650
kind of game pad.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.050
I would jump at that.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.260
WOLFF DOBSON: If they can agree
on the game pad layout,

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.210
then it's a wonderful thing,
because you can then code to

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.220
that, and it's a--

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.960
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And you actually
get to target PC

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:23.252
games and this new
meta console.

00:28:23.252 --> 00:28:24.750
COLT MCANLIS: Is that sort
of like-- so you

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.260
mentioned that, right?

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.490
If everyone can agree on a
controller layout, is that the

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:29.520
logical flow?

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.300
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, well, that's
pretty important.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.755
We have all agreed that
there's a keyboard

00:28:33.755 --> 00:28:34.840
and there's a mouse.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.160
And that the keys are in this
order unless you're like a

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.140
Dvorak person.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.740
Even those people when
they're sitting down

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.330
to play Team Fortress--

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:46.720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: With
Dvorak for WASC.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.310
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.890
It's like--

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:48.560
TODD KERPELMAN: You've got
to play like this.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.540
COLT MCANLIS: No, it's Dvorak.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.620
Just type Dvorak.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.310
Every game, you just type Dvorak
over and over and over.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.735
WOLFF DOBSON: But in all
seriousness, like controls are

00:28:58.735 --> 00:28:59.380
what makes games.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.880
And you need to make sure
that the thing you're

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.720
touching is the same.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.540
So if one guy is sitting there
like, yeah, I just press this

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.830
button, and it puts on the
handbrake, and I can spin

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:07.500
around turns.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.640
The other guy's like, I have to
the left trigger and press

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.330
the left joystick at the same
time, and I can't--

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:14.290
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Actually,
that's a great point.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.100
I mean, if they were to present
some kind of like

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.730
Steam Box home console,
the quality of

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.230
the game pad is key.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:26.740
I mean, if it's just take any
game pad off of the Best Buy

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.590
shelves, I don't think it'll be
that good of an experience.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:36.280
But if there is a, this is the
Steam Box game pad that--

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.100
COLT MCANLIS: We need to
go back to power glove.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.110
Make it happen, Nintendo.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.080
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Bring it back.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.640
WOLFF DOBSON: We gave
you the Wii.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.480
What do you want?

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.430
COLT MCANLIS: It's not
in glove form.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.250
So here's my question
for everybody.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.660
What's driving this?

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.280
In reality, I think we all
agree that Steam is a

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.030
fantastic product.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.300
It's been probably, in my
personal opinion, keeping

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.850
gaming on desktops alive.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.540
TODD KERPELMAN: I think they've
done a huge service to

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.430
the PC gaming industry.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.870
COLT MCANLIS: Absolutely.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.576
When we saw consoles
taking over, we

00:30:06.576 --> 00:30:07.490
saw a big trend there.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.230
Even the switch to mobile and
web now, I think it's safe to

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.620
say that Steam is still
standing alone.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.810
Why the move to console?

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:16.400
What's driving that?

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.440
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Gabe has come
out and said that he's very

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.780
unhappy with Windows 8.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.870
He doesn't think that's going
to deliver as good of

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.010
experience for gamers.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.220
TODD KERPELMAN: I think he used
the word "catastrophe."

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
it was very strong.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.500
TODD KERPELMAN: It was
very strongly worded.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.920
I mean, clearly some
of this is from--

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.710
it appears as though Microsoft
is going to put its own

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:41.660
version of Steam into the
operating system.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.310
I think it's going
to make it--

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:45.580
well, I don't exactly know
what they're doing, but I

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.420
think they want to make their
own app store that is probably

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.800
going to be a lot more visible
than whatever you would have

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.730
to do to get to Steam.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.900
I haven't used Windows 8.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.270
I don't know.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.430
This is all just speculation.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:58.960
COLT MCANLIS: Also, there's
kittens everywhere.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.360
TODD KERPELMAN: But
clearly, they're

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.270
saying, gee, we're awfully--

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:03.280
WOLFF DOBSON: That's YouTube.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.030
TODD KERPELMAN: --we're
awfully tied to--

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.790
they are kind of at the mercy of
one, possibly two companies

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:14.670
that are not them, running
these platforms.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.900
WOLFF DOBSON: I just think the
other thing is that it's the

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.400
continuous upgrade.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.670
I find this with car
electronics.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.850
My wife has a car that's got
a built-in Maps thing, or a

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:29.140
built in GPS in the
radio or whatever.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.120
And my incredibly old car, I
have an aftermarket thing that

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.820
I just put my Android
phone in.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.730
And every time I buy
a better Android

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.020
phone, my car gets better.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.570
I think the same thing goes with
the Steam Box experience

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:45.430
or this Big Picture experience,
which is it's been

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:49.360
how long since the Xbox
360 came out?

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.290
Waiting for these hardware
cycles for the console

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:56.380
industry, especially where we're
at this point where 3D

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.900
games with 3,000 polygons per
character look about the same

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.640
as games with 7,000 polygons
per character.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.770
At that point, eh, what's
the hurry to upgrade?

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.790
But if you're a hardcore gamer,
and I think Steam

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:14.410
definitely leans into that
hardcore market, you're going

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.440
to keep upgrading your PC as you
go along, which means your

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.850
console going to get-- your
console, your Big Picture, is

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.350
going to better and better
as you go along.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.070
TODD KERPELMAN: Well, that kind
of goes against the whole

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.710
dedicated Steam Box idea.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
I would really--

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.930
WOLFF DOBSON: But the trick
with that is that they can

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.610
keep releasing Steam Box 2,
Steam Box 3, Steam Box 4, and

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.386
since they're all PC games at
their heart, they're just

00:32:32.386 --> 00:32:33.570
going to keep getting better.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:34.910
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Sure, but I
mean I think one of the

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.680
biggest reasons why I moved
away from PC gaming was

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.310
because of that upgrade
treadmill, which was every

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.660
year a new game came that
required a new GPU and a new

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.970
faster CPU.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.850
TODD KERPELMAN: It made you
feel awesome when you went

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.770
down to the store and you're
like, put down your $600.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:53.050
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It was lot of
fun, but console games also

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:57.200
continue to look better and get
better as the life cycle

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.580
goes on because they figure
out a way to extract more

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.800
performance out of--

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.050
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.710
TODD KERPELMAN: It is nice
knowing that a console game is

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.290
coming out and I just know
it will work on my Xbox.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:10.550
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.300
TODD KERPELMAN: I have
to look at the specs.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:12.620
COLT MCANLIS: We've got to--

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.330
TODD KERPELMAN: We've
got to move on.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.500
We've got to move on to--

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.900
this is a question
from Dr. Dobson.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.600
Who's your favorite sidekick
in a game?

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.260
WOLFF DOBSON: That's
a real scientific

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.180
question right there.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.060
TODD KERPELMAN: Well, it's
a good one because we've

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:25.780
talking about AI.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.880
We talked about the
Fable horse.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.490
WOLFF DOBSON: I will give you
two favorite sidekicks.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:38.370
The first one is Alex from
Half-Life, Episode 2.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:42.130
Because there, they really spent
the time lingering on

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:45.930
her emotional state as part of
yours, like how she feels

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:46.710
about this world.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.830
I went through and played the
beginning of it again just the

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.300
other day, and I was like,
wow, this is really neat.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.200
I know what she's feeling
because I'm looking at her

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.690
face and sort of seeing
what's going on.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.430
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And Freeman
is blank, right?

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.250
WOLFF DOBSON: He's you.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:33:59.650
He's everyman.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:03.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So she's
reflecting emotions that you

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:07.540
should probably be feeling
back onto you.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.320
WOLFF DOBSON: I wanted
to go on an

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.360
adventure with her forever.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.630
I felt the same--

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:11.750
it was just like,
this is great.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.854
I mean, except that world is
sort of a horrible one to live

00:34:13.854 --> 00:34:15.480
in, but that's a different
problem.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.690
COLT MCANLIS: Besides all
the death and the

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:17.449
robots and the aliens.

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:18.690
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: But hey,
at least she's here.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:19.110
WOLFF DOBSON: Exactly.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.449
But at least I have somebody--

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:22.790
COLT MCANLIS: For some reason,
that tells me that should be a

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:23.940
Hallmark card.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.800
Besides the aliens and the
robots, thanks for being here.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.200
WOLFF DOBSON: You are
the girl for me.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.570
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Fascist
government system.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.170
WOLFF DOBSON: I also think that
the fact that she doesn't

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.889
go and get herself killed all
the time is super important.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:36.800
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.409
You don't get frustrated
with her.

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:40.840
WOLFF DOBSON: She takes
logical cover.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.449
She falls back which
she's supposed to.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:45.690
And she isn't clearly
invincible, but in practice,

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.630
it turns out she is.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.790
The other thing--

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:53.989
the other companion is the D
that you get in NetHack that

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.750
follows you around at the
beginning, who, if you play

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.640
like I do, when you finally run
out of food on level four,

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.030
you kill him and eat him.

He's like, not only a best
friend, but also a meal.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.200
And I just want to tell
you all that--

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.540
COLT MCANLIS: Why do I think
that Wolff is going to quit

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.410
Google one day and make a
Half-Life 2 meets NetHack

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.260
clone, where in level four,
he's really conflicted.

he's just like, what did I do?

out of food here.

of made it, because you're a

John?

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:48.950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Go to Colt.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:49.540
I've got to think about this.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:49.990
TODD KERPELMAN: Colt?

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.960
COLT MCANLIS: So I'm going to
go back to a Valve favorite

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.853
and actually say GLaDOS.

00:35:53.853 --> 00:35:54.980
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, I thought you
were going to go with the

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.220
companion cube.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.040
COLT MCANLIS: I was not going to
go with the companion cube.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:57.850
I think that's a little
overdone.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.790
A lot of people underestimate
the drive that GLaDOS brings

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:02.260
to the table.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.570
She motivates you.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.740
TODD KERPELMAN: Are you talking
about number one or

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.140
two, when she's in the potato?

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:08.800
WOLFF DOBSON: Spoiler.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.040
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
I'm sorry.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.940
COLT MCANLIS: What's
up with that?

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.437
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You
haven't played a

00:36:12.437 --> 00:36:14.540
two-year old game yet.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.880
No, in Portal 1.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.240
I think what they
did to bring--

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.150
WOLFF DOBSON: She is a wonderful
companion there.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.270
COLT MCANLIS: She
was an amazing

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.140
companion and sidekick.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.480
She got you where you
needed to go.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.940
She motivated you even if it
meant giving you the pointy

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.200
end of the stick.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.360
Even though she tried to kill
you, which I think that all

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.160
good sidekicks should
try to kill their--

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.870
WOLFF DOBSON: If you make the
dog mad in NetHack, he will

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.630
come after you.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.114
COLT MCANLIS: Well, that's
because he saw what you did to

00:36:36.114 --> 00:36:37.640
the D.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.340
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Kind of aloe the
same lines as Alex, I've

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.970
really enjoyed the sidekicks
that you get

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.320
in Uncharted games.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:42.970
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes!

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.580
Oh, Elena is another
example of a--

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.770
there was a wonderful moment
in Uncharted 3 where--

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.850
or 2, I guess it is, where
you're walking through Nepal

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.980
and your two ex-girlfriends
are fighting with--

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.840
are arguing and talking about
you, and you're just--

00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.890
the character is doing--

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.260
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It
feels so natural.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.000
COLT MCANLIS: When I'm walking
through the streets of Nepal,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.340
it brings back so
many memories.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.360
WOLFF DOBSON: But in all
seriousness, the fact that

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.010
they were having this wonderful
conversation that

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:11.305
was completely grounded in the
story that you're having, and

00:37:11.305 --> 00:37:12.390
it was bringing their
characters

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.250
forward, it was amazing.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.530
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm
going to go with--

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.730
I've got two picks.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:22.440
One would probably be the dog
or cat in Torchlight.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.245
Because they're useful.

00:37:24.245 --> 00:37:25.560
WOLFF DOBSON: You know that
dog is getting like

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.470
a 50% cut of every--

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.800
TODD KERPELMAN: I don't care.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.430
He's going back to town for me,
doing all the work that I

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:34.030
don't want to do.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.964
WOLFF DOBSON: This is what
younger siblings were for when

00:37:35.964 --> 00:37:36.710
you were growing up.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.000
COLT MCANLIS: Back
on the farm.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.605
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm sure he's
embezzling money from me, but

00:37:39.605 --> 00:37:40.590
I don't care.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.940
And number two--

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.980
WOLFF DOBSON: You have
to audit the dog.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.160
It's a really boring
video game.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:45.850
COLT MCANLIS: He's got
a great lawyer.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.842
Weird thing.

00:37:47.842 --> 00:37:48.960
Number two, I'll go with--

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.416
what is it, HK-47?

00:37:50.416 --> 00:37:52.370
WOLFF DOBSON: Ah, kill
all the meatbags.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.850
Ah, I love that.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.180
This was the best robot ever.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.730
He was the anti C-3PO.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.998
For those of you who haven't
played the game, in Knights of

00:37:59.998 --> 00:38:03.540
the Old Republic, you got
a Droid sidekick.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:07.760
And his thesis was kill
all the meatbags.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.800
He barely tolerated you, and any
human, he was just like--

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.000
he was the polar opposite of
every robot that had ever been

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.750
in Star Wars.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:15.770
It was wonderful.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:16.070
TODD KERPELMAN: Yep.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.780
An assassin robot, and
he was hilarious.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.200
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I like that
term "meatbag." I've never

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.080
really thought of us
as bags of meat.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.580
TODD KERPELMAN: You have this
whole conversation with him

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.980
about why do you call
me meatbag?

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.030
And he's like, well, it's
kind of what you are.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:29.330
You're bags, and you're
full of meat.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.075
COLT MCANLIS: It's sort of Fifth
Element style, like, are

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:31.740
you humanoid?

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.510
Identify yourself.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.910
Negative, I'm a meat popsicle.

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.610
TODD KERPELMAN: So let's
move on to--

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.070
we've got time.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:41.060
We're kind of running low.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.770
Maybe we just go into
what we're playing--

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:43.890
WOLFF DOBSON: I think we should
do what we're playing.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:45.490
TODD KERPELMAN: --and save the
fifth topic for next time.

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.240
So all right, we'll go--

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:48.780
we'll start with Colt.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:49.760
COLT MCANLIS: No, he
deferred last time.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.190
TODD KERPELMAN: We'll
start with John.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:51.820
You're right John, what
are you playing?

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.790
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All right,
so I am playing--

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:54.910
WOLFF DOBSON: We've heard your
trials with 100 Floors.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.710
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes, I've
been playing 100

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:56.670
Floors a lot lately.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.890
TODD KERPELMAN: Ha, ha!

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.650
Got ya!

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.850
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It is a
frustrating experience, but it

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:03.660
just keeps pulling me back.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.240
I keep going on my phone.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.090
I'm like all right, I'm going to
make it through this floor.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.010
WOLFF DOBSON: It's such a slot
machine of I got it, I got it!

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.080
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Some of
the stages, I just--

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.770
as soon as I see the layout of
the stage, I'm like, oh, doo,

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.590
doo, doo, and I'm onto
the next floor.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.790
And other ones, I'm
stuck for a day.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:24.580
And actually, in the end when
I succeed, it makes sense.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.230
I'm kind of like, yeah,
I see that.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.610
And there's just something
about--

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:33.760
the game has these rough edges
that drives you away from the

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.770
obvious answer, but the answer
is always obvious.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:38.380
WOLFF DOBSON: It's like
a programmer question.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.280
Like what are you
not assuming?

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.900
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.460
TODD KERPELMAN: All
right, Colt.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:43.930
What are you playing?

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:47.170
COLT MCANLIS: I'm actually
playing a handful of games

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.030
that are uninteresting.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:50.900
I'm actually-- if you've been
following my Twitter feed or

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.890
my G+ feed, then you're probably
aware that I'm

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:56.200
working on trying to analyze
streaming algorithms and how

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.270
to get large game worlds
streamed off of disk and

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.180
through the internet
and whatnot.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.650
And so I'm actually going
back to the table.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.530
I'm actually trying to play a
lot of different games that

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.630
have done streaming very well
and very bad and sort of take

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.600
a technical look at them.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.520
So I've been looking at
the elevator scenes

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:09.780
in Mass Effect 2.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.570
Effect I've been taking a look
at the streaming system inside

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:14.910
of the source engine
for Valve.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:16.400
I think they do a great
job of it there.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.220
A lot of open world engines with
low load times, like GTA

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.320
and Jak and Daxter, and
those sorts of games.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.420
WOLFF DOBSON: Run backwards
in Jak and Daxter.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.060
Daxter.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:24.750
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah,
exactly, right?

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.880
And so just taking a look at a
handful of these things and

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.470
see how people are solving
the problem, where is the

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:31.250
technical hurdles?

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:32.780
How did they solve them?

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.230
See if I can't grok any
information out of it.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.840
And if you're watching the show
and you've got a good

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.290
experience with streaming large
worlds, please send me

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:39.050
an email, send me a Tweet.

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.900
I'd love to talk with
you more about it.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.610
TODD KERPELMAN: As for
me, let's see,

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.640
I've got three games.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.380
On I'm still playing Skyrim,
and that will probably be a

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.420
standard answer for
quite a while now.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.370
COLT MCANLIS: Took an
arrow to the knee.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.900
TODD KERPELMAN: I am playing
The Walking Dead.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.340
WOLFF DOBSON: Really?

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.460
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.520
WOLFF DOBSON: Is it
working for you?

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:58.586
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:40:58.586 --> 00:40:59.780
Are you saying you had
technical problems?

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.540
WOLFF DOBSON: No, no, working
for you like I wasn't sure how

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.530
that would translate into a
point-and-click adventure.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:09.970
TODD KERPELMAN: So it works
really well as sort of a piece

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.030
of storytelling.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:12.060
The mood is really good.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.540
The setting is really good.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.850
The characters are
interesting.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:16.310
The dialogue is well written.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:22.340
You sort of play it, and it
really kind of gets you into

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.280
the feeling of like, I
am in a world where

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.270
zombies have taken over.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.955
Sometimes I'll finish playing,
I'm ready to go to bed, and

00:41:28.955 --> 00:41:30.490
I'm like, I'm going to lock the
door because I don't want

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:31.840
the zombie to come in.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.460
And then I realize, no wait,
that was just the game.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:39.360
The actual game play itself is
not particularly interesting.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.030
It's a fair number of
conversation trees that I've

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:47.550
realized now, looking at a
couple of game FAQs, often

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.460
don't seem to have an effect.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:49.590
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.810
You're entertaining yourself by
answering these questions.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.310
TODD KERPELMAN: And then the
standard adventure game puzzle

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.490
type of things that--

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:59.000
WOLFF DOBSON: Use skunk
with white paint.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.070
Use white paint on fence.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.180
Use fence to get splinter.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.220
TODD KERPELMAN: But
it is slight--

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.980
I will say their puzzles are
more logical than your typical

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.750
adventure games.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.880
COLT MCANLIS: Better puzzles
than 100 Floors or worse?

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.320
TODD KERPELMAN: Different.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.860
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: 100
Floors is very--

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.280
TODD KERPELMAN: That's
like hey, we're--

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.670
that's like Myst.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:24.100
And this is like Monkey
Island style.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:30.670
Yeah, but anyway, I would say
just as an interesting piece

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.330
of storytelling, it's
totally worth it.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.780
So, check it out
if you haven't.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.030
And then on mobile,
I am playing--

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.880
I picked this up in the
$0.25 sale yesterday--

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:44.840
Let's Create Pottery, which is
a sort of pottery-making game

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.500
that after playing it, I'm
like, this is so obvious.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.900
Why didn't anyone put a pottery
wheel on a mobile

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.280
touch device before?

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.890
You're just like, I'm going to
push it in here and pull it

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.310
out here, and you
get this vase.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:56.870
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There's
actually a really

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.170
awesome tech demo for--

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:01.840
that comes with Move
controllers for the

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.200
PlayStation 3 SDK where
it's essentially that.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.070
You hold one Move controller and
you use the trigger and it

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.930
spins this long tube
of something.

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:12.350
And then you use the other
one, and you kind

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.260
of lathe in, like--

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.510
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.320
COLT MCANLIS: --for the Move
controller which required to

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.750
like, dance around the base and
sculpt it with your hips.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.990
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Some of the
tech demos available to

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.770
developers with the Move
controller are the most

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:29.280
amazing usages of one-to-one
motion tracking

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:29.930
that you've ever seen.

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:33.690
Being able to spin this thing
and pull and have it come out

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.990
to and make all these weird
swords and clubs and things

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.440
like that, it's so
creative and fun.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.040
WOLFF DOBSON: So for my--

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.890
I'm also playing a zombie game,
but I'm playing Lone

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:51.530
Survivor, which is a 2D game
that was clearly--

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.570
it's very pixely, and you
shouldn't be frightened of it,

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:57.250
and I can only play it for about
half hour at a time.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.650
And then I'm like, I don't want
to go down that hallway.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.290
I think I'm going to go work
on something else.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:05.790
So yeah, I've been playing
like 31 minutes

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:07.270
a day of this game.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.190
COLT MCANLIS: What platform
is that on?

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:10.600
WOLFF DOBSON: It's on Steam.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.340
I'm playing on a Mac, but
it's on PC as well.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.790
It's tight.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:17.870
The sound design
is really good.

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:19.990
You hear the zombies far away.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.980
And you're like, oh god,
zombies are coming.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.790
And they don't groan.

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:25.130
They make this weird
staticky noise.

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:27.420
TODD KERPELMAN: It's more
Silent Hill, and it's--

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.740
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, I guess
it is more Silent Hill.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.850
I was getting kind of a Resident
Evil vibe off it,

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:34.590
because they give you the gun,
and it's totally ineffective.

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.560
COLT MCANLIS: It's been too long
since we've had a good

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.790
suspense style game.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.920
The first Bioshock was the last
really good one that I

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.530
think came out.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.520
We've been missing that
for a couple years.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.940
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, it's good.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.920
I'm like I said, I haven't
gotten all the way through it

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:53.025
because it's too scary.

00:44:53.025 --> 00:44:56.400
And on mobile, I'm playing
SteamBirds, which just--

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.080
I've been playing in my Nexus 7,
and it's exactly the right

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.510
size for a Nexus 7.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.420
And it's got this beautiful
touch interface.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.610
And it's just--

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:07.525
I'm sitting there, I'm at Go at
our cafe, with my sandwich

00:45:07.525 --> 00:45:09.735
in one hand and playing
SteamBirds in the other.

00:45:09.735 --> 00:45:11.316
It's totally fun.

00:45:11.316 --> 00:45:13.300
This is what touch
gaming is about.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.180
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, I
think we are out of time.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.645
We've got no one else
behind there.

00:45:17.645 --> 00:45:18.980
WOLFF DOBSON: No,
thank goodness.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.470
TODD KERPELMAN: So remember,
don't say

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:21.950
JJ's name three times.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:23.070
WOLFF DOBSON: Who, JJ?

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.810
TODD KERPELMAN: Shh.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.570
No one.

We will see you in two weeks.

I'd like to thank
my panelists--

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.090
COLT MCANLIS: Posse.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:34.330
TODD KERPELMAN: --posse
for joining us.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:34.810
COLT MCANLIS: Entourage.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.500
TODD KERPELMAN: And we
will talk to you--

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.420
WOLFF DOBSON: I walk around in
front of Todd opening doors.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.705
It's pretty much how we roll.

TODD KERPELMAN: Uh-huh.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.630
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I don't
watch the show, so--

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:48.330
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm probably
E. I'm the shortest.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:51.370
Anyway, we'll talk we'll
talk to you guys later.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:53.110
Billy, you can fade us out.
