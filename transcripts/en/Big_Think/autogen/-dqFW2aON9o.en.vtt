it and no one does there's such a

learning had to be boring and so we

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780
learning had to be boring and so we
 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.700
learning had to be boring and so we
started to think about how

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710
started to think about how
 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.470
started to think about how
we could rebrand school and make school

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
we could rebrand school and make school
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.080
we could rebrand school and make school
more fun specifically like if we wanted

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090
more fun specifically like if we wanted
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.490
more fun specifically like if we wanted
to go to school over the summer and we

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500
to go to school over the summer and we
 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.130
to go to school over the summer and we
were kids so we created a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140
were kids so we created a
 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.170

are just a few years older than the kids
 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.010
are just a few years older than the kids
who are working with um to give them a

when I was a child I didn't do bad

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100
when I was a child I didn't do bad
 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.560
when I was a child I didn't do bad
things because I wanted to be a bad kid

things because I wanted to be a bad kid
 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.330
things because I wanted to be a bad kid
I did it because the older kids were

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340
I did it because the older kids were
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.640
I did it because the older kids were
doing it so many times like the older

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650
doing it so many times like the older
 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.840
doing it so many times like the older
kids are the ones who are perceived as

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850
kids are the ones who are perceived as
 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.790
kids are the ones who are perceived as
being cool and kids are just looking for

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800
being cool and kids are just looking for
 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.520
being cool and kids are just looking for
an opportunity to be cool and fit in we

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530
an opportunity to be cool and fit in we
 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.080
an opportunity to be cool and fit in we
then paired them up with college

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090
then paired them up with college
 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.670
then paired them up with college
students who were aspiring educators

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680
students who were aspiring educators
 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.070

role model to look up to I remember for

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600
role model to look up to I remember for
 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.000
role model to look up to I remember for
me it wasn't until my freshman year of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010
me it wasn't until my freshman year of
 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.530
me it wasn't until my freshman year of
college that I built a relationship with

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540
college that I built a relationship with
 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.810
college that I built a relationship with
a college age student known in my family

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820
a college age student known in my family
 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.730
a college age student known in my family
had gone to college before and so as you

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740
had gone to college before and so as you
 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.130
had gone to college before and so as you
can imagine my college aspirations were

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140
can imagine my college aspirations were
 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.620
can imagine my college aspirations were
stunted or limited because of that and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630
stunted or limited because of that and
 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.420
stunted or limited because of that and
then obviously for our college students

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430
then obviously for our college students
 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.010
then obviously for our college students
they're looking for some meaningful

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020
they're looking for some meaningful
 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.270
they're looking for some meaningful

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
well and so we hire teachers from the
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.590
well and so we hire teachers from the
schools that we work with who can act as

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600
schools that we work with who can act as
 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.270
schools that we work with who can act as
role models and mentors to our college

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280
role models and mentors to our college
 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.860
role models and mentors to our college
students who one day want to be in the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870
students who one day want to be in the
 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.110
students who one day want to be in the
classroom and fill their shoes and so

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120
classroom and fill their shoes and so
 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.780
classroom and fill their shoes and so

this win-win-win situation for everyone

this win-win-win situation for everyone
making summer school a lot more fun and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410
making summer school a lot more fun and
 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.440
making summer school a lot more fun and
exciting when we first started our work

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450
exciting when we first started our work
 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.600
exciting when we first started our work
it was very structured we sort of said

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610
it was very structured we sort of said
 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.000
it was very structured we sort of said
this is what a six-week program looks

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010
this is what a six-week program looks
 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.500
this is what a six-week program looks
like in a low-income neighborhood or

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510
like in a low-income neighborhood or
 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.320
like in a low-income neighborhood or
community we quickly realized that no

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330
community we quickly realized that no
 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.170
community we quickly realized that no
two schools are the same and it's funny

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180
two schools are the same and it's funny
 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.120
two schools are the same and it's funny
we're primarily based in New York City

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130
we're primarily based in New York City
 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.430
we're primarily based in New York City
and as you think about like schools and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440
and as you think about like schools and
 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.660
and as you think about like schools and
school districts in that area there's

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670
school districts in that area there's
 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.510
school districts in that area there's
about 1.1 million kids and there's 1,700

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520
about 1.1 million kids and there's 1,700
 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.790
about 1.1 million kids and there's 1,700
schools and so schools are co-located

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800
schools and so schools are co-located
 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.190
schools and so schools are co-located
within the same building and so schools

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200
within the same building and so schools
 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.230
within the same building and so schools
are oftentimes serving the same exact

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240
are oftentimes serving the same exact
 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.450
are oftentimes serving the same exact
population of kids with the same per

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460
population of kids with the same per
 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.160
population of kids with the same per
pupil spend the same amount of funding

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170
pupil spend the same amount of funding
 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.110
pupil spend the same amount of funding
yet they have very different cultures

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120
yet they have very different cultures
 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.180
yet they have very different cultures
and they lead to very different outcomes

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190
and they lead to very different outcomes
 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.580
and they lead to very different outcomes
and so one approach in one school may

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590
and so one approach in one school may
 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.890
and so one approach in one school may
not work for an approach with a very

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900
not work for an approach with a very
 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.260
not work for an approach with a very
different school so I think one we need

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270
different school so I think one we need
 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.550
different school so I think one we need
to stay away from these like overarching

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560
to stay away from these like overarching
 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.379
to stay away from these like overarching
generalizations about what's good for

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389
generalizations about what's good for
 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.600
generalizations about what's good for
is good for all because that's no longer

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610
is good for all because that's no longer
 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.029
is good for all because that's no longer
the case as it relates to summer

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039
the case as it relates to summer
 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.770
the case as it relates to summer
specifically I don't think we need to

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780
specifically I don't think we need to
 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.629
specifically I don't think we need to
get rid of the summer gap I think

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639
get rid of the summer gap I think
 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.159
get rid of the summer gap I think
there's an opportunity to do something

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169
there's an opportunity to do something
 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.980
there's an opportunity to do something
meaningful and different I always think

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990
meaningful and different I always think
 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.689
meaningful and different I always think
back to like our own programs and what

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699
back to like our own programs and what
 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.790
back to like our own programs and what
we do and I recognize that if we didn't

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800
we do and I recognize that if we didn't
 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.839
we do and I recognize that if we didn't
come in there with a completely

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849
come in there with a completely
 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.189
come in there with a completely
different approach to learning over the

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199
different approach to learning over the
 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.409
different approach to learning over the
summer that learning or extending this

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419
summer that learning or extending this
 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.790
summer that learning or extending this
school year in that case actually may

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800
school year in that case actually may
 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.770
school year in that case actually may
not make that much of a difference you

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780
not make that much of a difference you
 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.149
not make that much of a difference you
may not have regressions but that

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159
may not have regressions but that
 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.020
may not have regressions but that
doesn't mean you're gonna improve

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030
doesn't mean you're gonna improve
 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.659
doesn't mean you're gonna improve
student engagement or help kids catch up

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669
student engagement or help kids catch up
 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.360
student engagement or help kids catch up
and so I think the summer time is also

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370
and so I think the summer time is also
 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.909
and so I think the summer time is also
an opportunity to help kids catch up to

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919
an opportunity to help kids catch up to
 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.920
an opportunity to help kids catch up to
their other peers who may have retained

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930
their other peers who may have retained
 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.119
their other peers who may have retained
everything that they needed to learn for

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129
everything that they needed to learn for
 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:08.860
everything that they needed to learn for
this for the school year and probably

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870
this for the school year and probably
 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.629
this for the school year and probably
won't have a hard time continuing to be

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639
won't have a hard time continuing to be
 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.360
won't have a hard time continuing to be
independent learners we know the status

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370
independent learners we know the status
 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.260
independent learners we know the status
and so many of our low-income

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270
and so many of our low-income
 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.269
and so many of our low-income
neighborhoods where they're being raised

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:16.279
neighborhoods where they're being raised
 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.980
neighborhoods where they're being raised
in single-parent households or immigrant

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990
in single-parent households or immigrant
 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.230
in single-parent households or immigrant
households like in my own household like

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240
households like in my own household like
 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.790
households like in my own household like
my mother not once picked up a book and

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800
my mother not once picked up a book and
 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.559
my mother not once picked up a book and
said hey you should be reading this book

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569
said hey you should be reading this book
 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.029
said hey you should be reading this book
because it's great level appropriate or

because it's great level appropriate or
 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.369
because it's great level appropriate or
challenge yourself by doing this and I

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:27.379
challenge yourself by doing this and I

think some of it is just she just didn't

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819
think some of it is just she just didn't
 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:29.189
think some of it is just she just didn't
know

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199
know
 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.110
know
and so being conscious of the fact that

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120
and so being conscious of the fact that
 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.329
and so being conscious of the fact that
there are certain disadvantages that

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:34.339
there are certain disadvantages that
 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.369
there are certain disadvantages that
kids of color or minorities sort of

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:36.379
kids of color or minorities sort of
 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.159
kids of color or minorities sort of
exhibit or deal with that their more

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169
exhibit or deal with that their more
 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:40.899
exhibit or deal with that their more
affluent peers just sort of don't have

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909
affluent peers just sort of don't have
 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.659
affluent peers just sort of don't have
to face does create an opportunity for

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669
to face does create an opportunity for
 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.579
to face does create an opportunity for
them over the summer and so I don't

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:45.589
them over the summer and so I don't
 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:46.749
them over the summer and so I don't
think the solution is to close the

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759
think the solution is to close the
 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.240
think the solution is to close the
summer gap altogether but I do think

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250
summer gap altogether but I do think
 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.800
summer gap altogether but I do think
there are opportunities to maybe narrow

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810
there are opportunities to maybe narrow
 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.050
there are opportunities to maybe narrow
it a slight bit I know there are some

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060
it a slight bit I know there are some
 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.119
it a slight bit I know there are some
states in some cities that have summer

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129
states in some cities that have summer
 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.029
states in some cities that have summer
breaks that are as long as 14 weeks long

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039
breaks that are as long as 14 weeks long
 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.439
breaks that are as long as 14 weeks long
it's just way too long I think a

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449
it's just way too long I think a
 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.809
it's just way too long I think a
meaningful summer break is six to seven

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:01.819
