00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World
History and today we're talking about one

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.800
of my least favorite subjects, the end of
humanity.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.700
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Does that mean that
you can see the future? If so, how do things

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.959
work out with Amanda Key?

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.039
Oh, me from the past, the phrase "work out"
implies that there was a relationship to work

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.719
out, which there wasn't, and there will never
be.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.920
However, you do currently know your eventual
wife. But I'm not telling you who she is,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.480
because if I do you will screw it up!

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.840
So we're not gonna look at the actual end
of humanity today. We're going to learn about

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.140
a theory about the downfall of civilization.
And unlike all the true theories, this one

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.600
doesn't involve aliens, or robots, or robot
aliens. But it is related to environmental

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.210
catastrophes of the man-made variety. Today
we're going to look at population and the

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.280
most persistent theory about population
growth and its effect on humanity.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.360
The one proposed by Thomas Malthus.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.260
And what's amazing about the persistence of
this theory, is it's complete lack of connection

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.390
to actual human history. All right so in 10,000
BCE fewer than a billion people lived on earth.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.550
Nearly 12,000 years later, around 1800 CE,
human population had grown to...

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.700
still under a billion.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.380
At about that time, an Anglican minister,
named Thomas Malthus wrote an essay on the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.190
principle of population. That explained why
this slow population growth was the way things

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.479
were always going to be. Malthus saw the growing
number of poor people on the English streets

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.140
and he did what any reasonable thinker would
do, he analogized them to rabbits. He reasoned

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.369
that the same forces that checked the population
of rabbits would limit humans too. Predators,

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.729
harsh weather, epidemics, and starvation.
Now it turns out that humans have ways of

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.020
dealing with predators, we killed all the
lions. And also we've got this amazing way

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.409
of dealing with harsh weather that rabbits
have never figured out called clothes. Not

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.759
to even get in to fire and housing.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.320
So that leaves us with alien predators, disease,
and starvation as the big obstacles. Okay,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.170
we're going to address these one at a time.
First, Arnold Schwarzenegger already took

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.880
care of the alien predators. Thank you Mr.
Schwarzenegger, in exchange we made you

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.140
Governor of California.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.720
Then we have disease. So around the time Malthus
was writing, disease was becoming less dangerous

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.900
to human populations. And then there's starvation,
right, well we've argued in the past that

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.430
starvation is generally a man-made problem.
But to Malthus, it was still a natural disaster.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.200
For Malthus, uncontrolled reproduction was the central
problem. Remember, he was, you know, coming

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.800
from the context of rabbits.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.540
He explained it through math. Humans could
reproduce geometrically, capable of doubling

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.200
population every 25 years, but land on Earth
is finite and at best, it could only be coaxed

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.260
into producing small, arithmetic, increases
in food. So you've got population growing

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.480
geometrically, food growing arithmetically,
all the people are gonna die. Now among simpler

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.660
creatures, the theory went food shortages
caused immediate famine. But humans would

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.920
continue to eek out ever more desperate lives,
as increasing demand raised the price of food,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.700
and clothing, and bread, and medicine.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.930
Powerful individuals and nations would seize
the assets of the weak, but even some of the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.720
strong would fall victim to hunger and disease.
Inevitably the population would then dip low

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.010
enough for the land to recover. Giving another
generation a chance to repeat the same mistakes.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.250
Over time then, human population would remain
roughly constant with the natural fertility

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.849
of the land. Because he was such a fun guy,
Malthus called this theory of history "The

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.319
Cycle of Misery." This essay is one of the
most influential pieces of writing in history,

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.780
along with a handful of other works, it established
the methods and importance of the modern field

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.300
of economics. It opened the door to the universe
of evolutionary science. And most immediately,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.879
Malthusian theory played a devastating role
in the Irish Potato Famine of 1846-1851. Let's

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.940
go to the sure to be depressing, Thought Bubble.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.599
Nearly 1 million Irish people died of starvation,
disease, and violence during the famine, which

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.209
was triggered when a fungus wiped out the
one strain of potato grown in Ireland. Had

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.860
Ireland's poor population had access to the
thousands of other varieties of potato or

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.970
aid to purchase more expensive crops, the
suffering may not have been as terrible.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.709
But official English policy toward Ireland,
as determined by its colonial master Charles

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.230
Trevelyan, was to give no aid nor allow anyone
else to give it either. He blocked American

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.909
ships filled with corn from reaching the island.
He allowed Irish farms that grew crops other

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.289
than potatoes to sell them straight to England.
Now hundreds of years of anti-Irish Catholic

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.629
hatred, were the roots of England's cruel
policies. But Malthusian theory also played

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:32.610
a role. In the century before 1846, Ireland's
population had grown significantly, and many

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.360
English thinkers saw the famine as an outcome
of Malthus' predictions. From this point of

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.189
view, providing food or aid to the Irish was
futile - it could only delay the cycle of

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:46.319
misery until it's downward swings scythed
down even more people.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.159
Trevelyan thus felt assured of pronouncing
that the only remedy for the starving was

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.969
for them to die, and let their corpses serve
to remind the survivors not to have sex. Quote,

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.649
"the judgment of God sent the calamity to
teach the Irish a lesson and that calamity

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:03.240
must not be too much mitigated".

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.789
Trevelyan reassured people upset about the
news of starving children, the real evil with

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.659
which we have to contend is not the physical
evil of the famine, but the moral evil of

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.360
the selfish, perverse, and turbulent character
of the people.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.520
Thanks Thought Bubble. So why did Ireland
want independence in the first place? Oh right,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.770
yeah that! So by 1852, emigration and starvation
had shrunk the population of Ireland from

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.029
about 6.5 million to 4 million. In 2010, the
islands population was still lower than at

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:37.069
the famine's start. So Malthusian theory seemed
to have it's airtight proof, right?

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.060
Well, no.

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.819
In fact, even as Malthus was writing, the
curve of human population growth was beginning

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:48.029
to slope upward. The increase in population
was so gradual that all Malthus noticed of

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.809
it, were the outliers, the poor clinging to
life. But the growth in the number of human

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:58.229
beings was far more permanent than Malthus
ever imagined. In fact, it was unstoppable.

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.789
From 1750 to 1850, right when Malthus was
alive, the number of humans on Earth grew

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.270
by half a billion people. From about 800 million
to 1.3 billion. By 1960, the population reached

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.249
3 billion. And since then, the world has added
a billion humans roughly every 15 years. Sometime

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:21.050
in 2009 or 2010, the United Nations estimates
that the Earth's 7 billionth person was born.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.999
Consider that contrast, at the very moment
that Malthus was writing that it was impossible,

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:30.139
human population was beginning it's rocket
like acceleration. So what did he miss?

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.830
Well, Malthus was like an A+ student in the
subject of human existence, he was right for

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.710
like 95% of history. But it turns out, grades
aren't a super accurate predictor of success

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.580
in life. Malthus should have looked past prominent
disasters like the potato famine and recognized

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.589
that two major revolutions in food production
were occurring while he was alive. One of

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:54.909
the reasons that he struck out so spectacularly
is that, like many Western thinkers,

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:56.680
he wasn't paying attention to China.

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.110
So Chinese farmers had altered the land, and
used a number of inventions like dykes, and

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.849
paddle wheels, and bicycle chains, to grow
rice in man-made paddies. It took a lot of

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:10.409
labor, but it paid off. Especially when they
discovered that by using the entrails and

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:15.779
bones of the fish that swam in the water,
they could get you know, fertilizer! And then

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:21.459
they could grow two rice crops in one year.
Thus, the secret of China's greatness: food!

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:25.869
And with the benefit of added surplus, fortunate
people in China were able to free up their

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:32.420
time to study and to invent. Yet, while the birth of this
system had begun in the ancient past, additions to it

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.720
continued throughout Chinese history and
progressed straight through the Qing dynasty.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.120
But agriculture was also changing in Europe
during Malthus' lifetime. Like there's Jethro

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:46.429
Tull's seed press, the crop rotation system
developed by Charles "Turnip" Townsend, and

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:51.050
animal husbandry practiced by scientific farmers
such as Robert Bakewell, who increased the

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.179
size of his sheep by selective breeding. So
it kinda seems impossible that Malthus could

00:07:55.179 --> 00:08:00.270
have missed this revolution, because he could
see it from his house in Surrey England. But

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:06.229
from his perspective, that agricultural revolution
had the opposite effect of what had happened

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:10.879
in China. Like instead of giving people more
food, and more comfort, it seemed to Malthus

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:14.819
that it was driving them to greater misery.
That's because, for lots of Europeans the

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:19.429
agricultural revolution was largely about
evictions. The most important innovation of

00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:25.600
Europe's agricultural was largely invisible. It was
the decision to treat land as private property.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.439
So for most Europeans, the concept that individual
humans could own, like, land was a foreign

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:36.829
concept. Even as late as 1500, most of Europe
conceived of land as rightly belonging solely

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:42.039
to its creator - God. And then God's anointed
on earth - kings and the Church - could parcel

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:47.259
out packets of land to people they chose.
But any land not specifically granted to a

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:52.569
land lord, remained open to anyone who wanted
to use it. This open land was called the commons.

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:57.490
And in parts of Europe it made up more than
half of the territory. But then around 1100

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:02.290
CE, British monarchs found themselves perpetually
strapped for cash and they needed new taxes.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:07.759
So in return for voting for tax increases
and gifts, the crown granted enclosure acts

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:11.949
to rich Englishman. Giving them the right
to fence off the commons and claim it as their

00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:16.629
own. So the people who'd used that land to
graze animals, or cut wood, or grow crops

00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:21.560
could be forced off of it. And for the first
time, richer people could maintain miles of

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.310
fenced in property to pasture their sheep
or dig mines. Meanwhile the dispossessed,

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.490
deprived of their opportunity to grow or hunt
their own food, turned to beggary and theft,

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.740
and to London. Where they hired out their
labor for wages.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:40.940
Wages?! That's not how humans should live!
Having to fill out time cards and punch clocks!

00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:43.340
Wait - Stan...don't you make wages?

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:48.780
Ugh, it's horrible. Myself, I live off the
land. If I can't grow it, I won't eat it!

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.800
So by the time Malthus was a young man, things
weren't great for the poor and dispossessed.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.120
So it's a small wonder that Malthus only saw
the downside of the agricultural revolution.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.800
Only through historical hindsight, do we know
that private property accelerated incentives

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.370
to experiment with new methods of food
production, which dramatically increased

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.040
the amount of food produced.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.800
Like before enclosure, it wouldn't have made
sense for someone to buy a seed press and

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.829
plant neat rows of seeds because anybody with
a cow could have trampled on them an hour

00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:22.959
later. The lower food prices created by more
food supply began to ease the cycle of misery

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:27.750
that Malthus described, although only just
barely. So in fact, agricultural innovations

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:33.509
proved that Malthus was almost entirely wrong.
So, why is he still influential? I think because

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:38.579
there's a very seductive logic to the idea
that resources, especially food, are finite.

00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:43.660
I mean, we live on one planet that has a certain
amount of arable land and surely at some point

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.500
humans will suck up all of the resources.
And this is especially true in the age of global

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.339
climate change. In 2014, the UN Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change issued a report that

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:58.149
warned of the potential for warmer temperatures
to restrict food supplies in the face of growing

00:10:58.149 --> 00:11:02.500
demand. In fact, it claimed that rising temperatures
had already diminished wheat production by

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:09.500
2% per decade. While demand for food was rising
at 14% over the same period. Food prices,

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.680
which had been declining steadily until 2007,
have been volatile since then. Sometimes leading

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:20.200
to famine other times to political unrest. And those
are real problems that may yet prove disastrous.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.019
But other doom and gloom scenarios regarding
population and food, most notably the 1968

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:29.550
book The Population Bomb, have proven wrong
at least so far. In fact fewer people will

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.170
die of starvation this year than died 500
years ago of starvation, even though we have

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.639
far more people on Earth. And there's still
lots of room to improve agricultural yields.

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:42.939
But simply knowing that Malthus was wrong,
isn't as interesting as thinking about why

00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:49.539
he was wrong. Malthus underestimated how successful
we would be at adapting to environmental constraints.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:55.340
And he underestimated the role that technology
and innovation could play in creating a world

00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:00.360
where more humans could live. Now of course that
hasn't come without its costs - including climate change.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.840
And that's why I think Malthus remains so
influential. Human existence is not a zero

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.829
sum game. It is possible for me to benefit
and other people also to benefit. But it's

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:14.129
also true that many resources that we imagine
as infinite - aren't.

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:15.920
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.520
