FLORIAN GSCHWANDTNER:
I think it's

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.387
necessary to push boundaries
to really change the rules

00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:08.220
and change the game.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.692
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.820
I grew up on a farm.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.050
It was a very cool
childhood, because you're

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.450
growing up next to your
dad, working on the field.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.809
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:23.350
One thing what I
really learned about

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.960
was what does work all
day long actually mean?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.900
I think as a farmer, you're
kind of an entrepreneur.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.910
And this is where
for me, my heart

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.320
to become an entrepeneur
somehow started.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.280
I decided to study
mobile computing,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.930
where I met my co-founders.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.770
I was running more often.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.500
And then we said, hey, we have
to do something in that area.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.070
We want to help people
change their life.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.360
And I think being
physically fit really

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.980
supports whatever you're doing.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.820
So we quit our jobs, and
we started Runtastic.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.622
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:58.622 --> 00:01:00.080
NINETTE GIARDINA:
There's something

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.760
about running that
connects you with somebody.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.116
So when it's your own
daughter, it was on for me.

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:07.420
You want to keep going?

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.800
ALEXIS GIARDINA: Yeah, we can.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.300
NINETTE GIARDINA: I was 40 years
old when I started running,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.110
and it all started
with a challenge.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.780
I signed my daughter
up for a 10k.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.090
She was very upset
with me, so I told her

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.120
that I would run a 5k
to show her my support.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.060
She said, like you're going to
get off the couch and run a 5k?

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.192
And I took the challenge,
and I ran the whole 5k.

00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:28.650
ALEXIS GIARDINA:
The first marathon

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.237
she ran was the
one in Nashville.

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:32.820
NINETTE GIARDINA: I
used the Runtastic

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.767
How to Run a Marathon in 3 Hours
and 30 Minutes, and it worked.

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:38.850
It was really fun when my
daughter was cheering me

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.319
on about every 30 minutes.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.860
ALEXIS GIARDINA:
Keeping up with her,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.025
seeing where she's at,
how far until she's done.

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:45.900
NINETTE GIARDINA: Since
I've started running,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.820
I've been doing
all kinds of races.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.030
I am currently training
for my second marathon.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.350
What running has taught me is
that I can achieve so much.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.200
ALEXIS GIARDINA: I feel very
proud to say, that's my mom!

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.340
That's my mom!

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.410
She's the reason
I'm still running.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.120
Otherwise, I probably
would have quit.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.578
NINETTE GIARDINA: Alexis started
looking up half-marathons.

00:02:05.578 --> 00:02:08.139
I'm like, you pick any place
you want to go to, and we'll go.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.330
That'll be our thing.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.074
So we've got that that I
don't have with somebody else.

00:02:13.074 --> 00:02:14.490
FLORIAN GSCHWANDTNER:
Our business

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.940
has evolved so much
over the past years,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.340
and now having more
than 200 employees

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.657
and 220 million downloads.

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:22.490
But this is not all.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.150
Now being part of
the Adidas family,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.910
together, we want to
get to the next level.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.635
It's incredible what is
possible through technology.

00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:32.930
Google Play has been the
perfect partner for us.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.380
With their
technology, they allow

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.350
us to iterate in a very
innovative and quick way.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.510
This is exactly what
we need for our users

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.860
to build a perfect product.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.020
And it helps a lot to
really push boundaries.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.590
Just cool to see that people
really transform themselves.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.410
People are able to do things
they couldn't have done years

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.062
before.

00:02:52.062 --> 00:02:53.270
And this is the game-changer.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.620
