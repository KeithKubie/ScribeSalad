00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is 92,000.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You can see this because 80 is exactly 4 times as much as 20.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If you took 23,000 and divided it by 20% and multiplied the result by 80%,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That is the same as just multiplying 23,000 by 4.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You get that number over here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What's remarkable about this chart is it's invariant to the total number of votes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What it really depicts is the relative number of votes.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It shows that A got many, many more votes than B.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It shows it graphically, so you can see this without even studying the numbers.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's practice this one more time.
