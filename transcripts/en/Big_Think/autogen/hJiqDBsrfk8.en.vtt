by dust inhalation or something but I do

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810
by dust inhalation or something but I do
 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.210

think there are some issues that we need

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220
think there are some issues that we need
 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.010
think there are some issues that we need
to pay attention to and so I actually

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020
to pay attention to and so I actually
 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.779
to pay attention to and so I actually
went around and interviewed all these

went around and interviewed all these
 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.609
went around and interviewed all these
various robotic scientists and said you

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619
various robotic scientists and said you
 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.350
various robotic scientists and said you
know is this something that is a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360

and there are basically three answers

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030
and there are basically three answers
 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.530
and there are basically three answers
one was know that silly it will not

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540
one was know that silly it will not
 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.690

happen these are systems for example

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700
happen these are systems for example
 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.090
happen these are systems for example
that don't have a survival instinct and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100
that don't have a survival instinct and
 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.950
that don't have a survival instinct and
in all of science fiction the story is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960
in all of science fiction the story is
 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.660
in all of science fiction the story is
always that the machine gets scared and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670
always that the machine gets scared and
 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.370

is the future of war but there is
 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.660
is the future of war but there is
another side of the future of war that

another side of the future of war that
 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.810
another side of the future of war that
is the enemy has a vote and so you have

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820
is the enemy has a vote and so you have
 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.359
is the enemy has a vote and so you have
these continual global insurgencies and

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369
these continual global insurgencies and
 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.310
these continual global insurgencies and
that's these two trends coming together

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320
that's these two trends coming together
 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.149
that's these two trends coming together
both the unmanned of war but also the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159
both the unmanned of war but also the
 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.460
both the unmanned of war but also the
flattening of war that is it's becoming

the challenge for all of us is that both

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
the challenge for all of us is that both
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.860
the challenge for all of us is that both
robotics and insurgencies and terrorism

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870
robotics and insurgencies and terrorism
 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.250
robotics and insurgencies and terrorism
are things that one we don't understand

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260
are things that one we don't understand
 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.550
are things that one we don't understand
very well and two we really haven't yet

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560
very well and two we really haven't yet
 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.670
very well and two we really haven't yet
figured out how to deal with them

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
figured out how to deal with them
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.990
figured out how to deal with them
you have these two trends coming

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
you have these two trends coming
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.119
you have these two trends coming
together and that's a challenge for us

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129
together and that's a challenge for us
 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.370
together and that's a challenge for us
all
