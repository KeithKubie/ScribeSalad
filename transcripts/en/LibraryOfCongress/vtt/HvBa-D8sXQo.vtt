00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.530
My name is Mathew Barton.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.340
I am the curator of
recorded sound here

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.720
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.970
Actually I don't, I'm not
usually here in this building.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.020
I'm usually down in , oh okay.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.690
It's easier said than
done [brief laughter].

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.750
There's more than
one way to be heard.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.220
Alright, how's that?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.090
Can you hear me now?

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.720
Alright, great.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.080
Yeah, so usually I'm
down in Culpeper,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.800
Virginia at a building
called the NAVCC,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.130
the National Audiovisual
Conservation Center which is

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.040
where we store all of
our audiovisual materials

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.920
which amount to at this point,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.970
I believe 3.6 million sound
recordings and another 1.1

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.040
or maybe it's 2 million moving
image items, video and film.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.960
And it's, speaking as the
curator of recorded sound,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.510
and our recorded sound
collection includes a great deal

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.190
of radio.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.410
It really warms the cockles
of my heart when people come

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.050
out for an evening of radio,
that they actually come,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.360
leave their homes, come to
the Library of Congress,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.130
sit in a place like
this to listen not

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.270
to watch so much as to listen.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.420
And when I was thinking
about what to say tonight

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.560
to introduce Jim, I
remembered something

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.020
that Fred Allen said
about radio.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.590
Fred Allen, great
comedian and satirist

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.060
of what we call the Golden Age
of Radio in the 30s and 40s

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.950
who never quite recovered
from the assent of television

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.230
in the 50s had this to say, "The
radio listeners saw nothing.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.530
He had to use imagination.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.310
It was possible for
each individual

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.120
to enjoy the same
program according

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.070
to his intellectual level
and his mental capacity.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.660
With the high-cost of living and
the many problems facing them

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.920
in the modern world, all
the poor man had left was

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.340
his imagination.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.150
Television has taken
that away from him."

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.250
So, obviously he didn't
think too much of television.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.290
I'm okay with television.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.700
I'm sure you are too,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.150
but a really interesting thing
happened about the same time

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.550
that Fred Allen wrote that as
television was becoming ascended

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.200
which is that the portable
tape recorder became something

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.390
that was in reach, not to
everybody, but it was something

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.290
that if you thought that
what's you wanted to do

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.850
and you save some money for
a while, you could get one

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.870
and you could go out in world
and record what you wanted

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.850
and bring it back and find a
way to program it to present it

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.340
and people did that, beyond
the obvious applications

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.270
for recording music and
political speeches and things

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.970
like that, innovators like Tony
Schwartz whose collection is

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.990
here at the Library of Congress,
went out and collected sounds

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.390
and thoughts and dreams, and
gave them back to the world

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.020
as a means of not only

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.590
of communication but
also inspiration.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.530
And I see tonight's guest,
Jim Metzner very much

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.470
in the tradition of
innovators like Tony Schwartz

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.390
and Jim you actually,
you knew Tony Schwartz.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.690
You interviewed him didn't you?

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.650
Yeah. So, there's a direct
connection there and,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.170
but at the same time, you
know we're also in touch

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.520
with the Golden Age of Radio

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.280
where there was always a very
busy person doing sound effects

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.780
and [brief laughter] without
Eileen here, it's all just talk.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.510

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.470

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.510
this is the Pulse of the Planet.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:54.430
[ Music ]

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.160
Our theme music, for those of
you who may not be familiar

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.300
with the program, was written
by Tommy Eyre [phonetic]

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.360
and the title "Pulse of the
Planet" after 30 years still,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.750
I think, has merit and still
resonates with the idea

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.390
that the world is alive,
it's pulsing, it's speaking

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.380
to us all the time if we
know how to listen to it.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.390
And there are actually
hints about that idea,

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.910
the world speaking
to us from the past.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:41.890
So, for example, in Imperial
Japan, the emperor dressed

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:51.270
in full regalia with his entire
court would go out to Kyoto

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.170
to Arashiyama which is a
sacred place near Kyoto

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.370
and they would go for
one purpose, to listen.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.760
And what where they
listening for?

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.440
Well, here's a clue, there's
a poem written in honor

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.980
of what they were tuning into,
"If a jewel of dew could sing,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.910
it would tinkle with such
a voice" anybody want

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.160
to guess what that might be?

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.700
[ Cricket Sounds ]

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.000
It's a cricket.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.770
Whose emotions homoeogryllus
japonica, the bell cricket

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:48.090
and the members of court

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.840
of the emperor's court
would collect them

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.970
and they'd take them
back and they would judge

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.770
which one was the best singer
and even today, until today

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.190
and in this time, in Japan
the collection and the keeping

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:04.130
of crickets as pets is still
very much a tradition in Japan

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.670
with keeping little cricket
cages and they release them

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.620
around this time of year.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.150
But the idea as I was preparing
this talk and thinking about it

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.990
and reminding myself about
that sound and that practice

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.790
that was, in fact, one of the
Pulse of the Planet programs

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.510
from the 30-year history of
the series, was I was trying

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:34.150
to think and maybe you could
too, are there any examples

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.820
in our society that you can
think of concerts aside,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.570
so you know not besides
going to the JFK Center

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:47.120
to hear somebody fabulous
singing and play some music,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.190
aside from music, do we
ever go to places to hear,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:57.580
to listen intentionally
anything come to mind?

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.880
Yeah.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.180
&gt;&gt; The beach.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.480
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: The beach
to hear the ocean for sure.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.780
Anybody else?

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.960
If we have any other, if you
have any other thoughts on that,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.270
maybe towards the end we'll
come back and I had a,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.630
as I was thinking
I couldn't think

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.940
of that many quite frankly
places where you might go

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.770
to listen intentionally.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.950
But if it's true that we're
living in a world of vibration

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:26.730
and that sounds are, in fact,
informing us all the time.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.310
I mean, frankly the
sounds aren't stopping,

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.880
but we may not be
paying attention to them,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.390
but if we are being bombarded
with sounds all the time

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.910
and they're speaking to us, well
let's try and experiment and see

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.530
if that really might be true.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.920
We're going to play
two sounds and see

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.210
if you can tell now just very
simply what are these sounds

have on her feet?

are telling us that.

know, decipher it in a way.

all relatively subtle,

our attention.

and they say, "Remember me.

there are some folks here

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.960
who know Minor was
a photographer

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.520
who my very good friend who is
in this audience, Mr. Lee Ewing

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:16.250
and I many moons ago in
1972, were Minor's assistants

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.350
on a photographic trip that
he took across the country

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:22.390
and it was an amazing trip.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.460
We hung out with Ansel Adams,

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.550

the zone system

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.070
of photography with Ansel.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.780
Well, we would spend the whole
day photographing things.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.730
We would be photographing
rock walls you remember?

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:40.180
And Minor had this big camera
and we had these little Leicas

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.660
and he would be there and wall
would be full of moss and we,

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.850
he would just be standing there
photographing this rock wall

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.830
and people would come by
sometimes and you'd sort

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.500
of see a guy photographing
a rock wall

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.720
and then some guy would come up
and maybe pluck up his courage

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.230
and saying, "You
photographing a rock wall?"

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.200
And we go, "Yeah."

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.160
That's what we've been up to.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.750
But one day Minor
came to me and said,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.810
and he had a very deep voice.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.170
I don't know if can do it, but
it was something like "Well,

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:19.780
Jim something out
there is waiting for me

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:26.950
to record it, to photograph it.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.960
Something out there is waiting
for me to photograph it.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:35.800
I don't know what it is,
but it will find me."

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:42.810
And, I spent the better
part of my life recording

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:47.930
and Minor's words have come back
to me because there are sounds

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.660
that really find you,
had it not been for you,

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:58.680
it would have never have been
remembered or heard or shared.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.280
It would be like that tree
that fell in the forest

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.890
and nobody was there to hear it.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:10.320
This is one of those sounds and
it was completely unexpected

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.780
and I'll give you a little bit
of prep; first of all, this is,

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:20.960
well I went to Brazil
in 75 and this is

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.390
like the first thing I
recorded it was a little town

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.240
of [foreign word spoken]
which is in Salvador in Bahia,

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.100

there was this church service

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.730
that was just ending
and you'll hear

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.410
as the service begins the
choir master is having a slight

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.000

and everything that you're

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.540

exactly as it happened.

I got in this moment

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:59.270
and then the recording just sort
of I was carrying my recorder

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.090
so we sort of followed
the crowd out,

Well to witness and
record a moment like that,

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.300
you really feel like
you've been given a gift

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:18.570
and you become very still,
attentive to the sound

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.930
and that's partly technical

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.700
because if there any
sound recorders out there,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.000
there are people here I'm
sure who record sounds,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.670
Tom we know you're
one of them, yeah.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.460
But you know that if you make
too much noise you just ruined

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.760
your recording.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.990
So, you have to be still
so it's partly technical,

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:43.600
but really every
act of listening,

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:50.290
really listening demands this
quality of attention doesn't it?

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:55.440
It reminds us that like the
world that we're listening

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:51.170
but as an experiment
we're going to go

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.800
through a series
of vowels together.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.940
We'll find a note and
we're going to say the word

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.650
"why" except we're
going to really,

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.210
if you want to participate
why not, I mean you know,

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.710
close your eyes no one, no one
will see you, and we're going

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:10.470
to say "why" but it's going to
go w-i-e and we'll pick a note,

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.660
I don't know, let's
somebody find a note,

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.720
ooo is that a good note for you?

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.000
Ooo, so oo-why, you ready?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:34.730
Ooo-i-e. Now we're
going to go backwards,

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.850
ee-i-ow, ee-i-otherwise.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:53.990
Even in that you could hear that
just the taste of the overtones,

00:25:53.990 --> 00:26:02.110
the parts of our voice that
are there all the time,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.190
but if you go and
you try that at home,

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.670
you don't have to
be a professional.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:11.180
You can try this at home
in a very reflective place

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.020
like your car or the shower,
try that and you'll start

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.710
to hear the overtones
that are present

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.940
in your voice and
in every sound.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.530
There are just certain places

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.200
where the environment makes
it a little bit more possible

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.300
for you to hear them.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.770
So, right now whether we're
making sound together or not,

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:38.820
we're all breathing together
in a silent chorus creating

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.670
at the same time
with our listening,

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:47.410
that we're doing together
by default, an atmosphere

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:54.110
of listening and if you don't
believe that, tell me the truth.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.660
If you're in a conversation
with somebody,

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.440
can't you tell intuitively
whether

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.860
that person's listening
to you or not?

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.160
You know it.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.460
Alright, sometimes
it's body language,

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.360
sometimes it's just this you
know when somebody's tuning out

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.500
and you know even better
when they're tuning in.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.530
Now, what is that all about?

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.830
So, when you have a group

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:19.800
of people listening
together we are creating

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.720
between us an amplified kind

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.280
of listening that's maybe
only possible when a group

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.660
of people are together listening
on behalf of something else

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.960
and nay actor, any
performer knows that.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.080
You get a good crowd and you
say, "Wow, great crowd tonight"

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.220
and it helps brings up
the level of the music.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.280
Why? Well, maybe the
performer was knowing that he

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.940
or she was being listened to,
it's like a feedback loop.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:51.380
Well, we're not alone, we
have lots of other entities

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.790
on the planet that are engaged
in the process of listening.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:57.710
We've got company,
a lot of company.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:02.300
So, over the course of my career
I've interviewed many scientists

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.640
and we do have scientists,
there are scientists

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.140
in the house tonight and I've
interviewed, I don't know,

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.390
hundreds maybe even thousands,
really thousands of scientists,

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:16.310
but hundreds of bio-acousticians
whose job it is to sort

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:21.290
of monitor the pulse of the
creatures there are in the world

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.400
and you get this sense,
I've gotten this sense

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.230
after interviewing
them, that my golly it's

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.370
as if every living thing
on earth is some form

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:35.580
of receptivity or
listening or communication

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.580
and we humans are only privy
to small portion of that.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:44.820
So, for example, bats and rats
are in the ultrasonic range

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.910
above the range of
human hearing.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.970
Elephants are infrasonic,
they're below the range

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.620
of human hearing and
they actually communicate

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.320
to each other.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.850
Yeast cells actually vibrate.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:03.430
Leaf hoppers which are
an insect, I promised,

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.000
I promised you that
there would be some wild

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.150
and crazy animal sounds,
this is one of them.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.900
Leaf hoppers make a
sound to each other

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:18.100
that we humans can't hear,
but if you were a leaf hopper

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.360
and were on the surface
of a plant you'd be tuning

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.660
into these vibrations.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.580
Well, somebody had
the very clever idea,

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.420
it was a Japanese
scientist I believe,

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.850
had the very clever idea taking
what's called a transducer

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.420
which just translates
vibrations to sound.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.590
In fact, he used a
phonograph believe it or not,

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:38.890
he stuck it on the plant,
the substrate of the plant,

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:44.180
the mass of the plant, and these
are the highly amplified sounds

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:49.510
of leaf hoppers, tiny insects.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:30:34.140
[ Insect Sounds ]

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.440
That's two of them.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.160
That's the call and
response of the leaf hoppers,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.550
it was the mate calling on
"who" that was the mate.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.110
So, transduce sound.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:51.300
If you want an example of
transduce sound you could

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.660
if you put your palm of your
hand against your ear and tap

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.660
on your elbow, you
can hear that.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.960
Do you hear that?

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.840
Now how are you hearing it?

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.140
If you tap with your knuckles

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.360
on your elbow you're
hearing it right?

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.660
So, how are you hearing that?

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.250
&gt;&gt; Bone-to-bone vibrations.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.550
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Pardon?

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.850

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.150
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Bone-to-bone,
yeah.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.430
It's being conducted transduced
through the same principle.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.760
So, of course, there
are plenty of insects

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.270
that we do hear all
the time like cicadas

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.720
and crickets they are
among the voices of nature

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.420
that we hear many evenings
along with amphibians

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.310
and this is a taste

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:37.050
of a nighttime chorus
in Brazil's Pantanal.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.650
It's actually not only Brazil,
there's a number of countries

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:46.740
around this the largest
wetland in Brazil, excuse me,

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.640
the largest wetland in the world
of which Brazil is just one

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.650
of the countries
in the, on the map.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.600
I think Paraguay is another
and I'm trying to remember,

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.040
there are four countries
in the Pantanal.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.830
Anybody know off the
top of their head?

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.540
I don't remember what they are.

Largest wetland in the world

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.070
and at night the
chorus sounds like this.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.790
Now, when we're listening
to it you might try

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:18.350
as maybe an exercise
or just an experiment,

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.540
to hear the spatiality
of the sound.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.360
In other words, well there's
a different sound over here,

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:29.750
there's three sounds are in 3D;
we're getting a spatial effect

of where the different sounds
are and sounds also have a kind

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.750
of a texture and they
may even have a kind

of an image not the
necessarily the image

I don't know why, but
there's something,

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:32.680
kind of the sounds remind
me of the surface sort

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.030
of like the walls of
the ceiling, you know,

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:42.530
there's something rough and
amazing about it [inaudible].

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:50.390
Well, most mornings there are
a few other sounds of insects

00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:55.070
and amphibians and insects
cross-fading with the sounds

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.280
of a dawn chorus of birds.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:06.370
This dawn chorus was
recorded in the Grampians

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:09.430
which is a park outside of
Melbourne West of Melbourne,

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:13.450
Australia and it's a park
run by Aboriginal peoples

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.940
and as I was recording this the
crack of dawn, I was surrounded

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.820
by birds and many other
creatures including kangaroos

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.680
which you won't hear, they
weren't making any sounds.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.440
I doing think kangaroos make
a sound, but just the fact

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.410
that knowing that
there were kangaroos

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.710
around I think is cool.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:37.570
Anyway, this is one of my
favorite dawn choruses and,

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.430
but another experiment of
another kind of listening

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:48.210
to imagine you can try this also
with a musical sound as well,

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:53.650
as you're listening try
to imagine a mountain

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.910
or visualize a mountain of
sound the lows are at the bottom

00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.700
of a mountain and the
highs are at the top,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.920
and as you're listening it's
as if you become the mountain

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.070
and you're sort of [audio
issues], you're sort of reaching

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:09.340
for the higher notes and that
even affects your posture

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.570
so that there's a kind of a
posture, a more erect posture

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:14.870
of listening or a
posture that's conducive

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:16.170
to listening especially
reaching for those highs.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.470

it's something that belongs

is life studying and listening.

that every, I've listened

to that recording
countless times

and every time I hear it it
just brings a smile to my face,

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.360
so it's one of these things.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.840
So, you've made a
memorable recording.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.620
You've been given this gift,
this little nugget of audio gold

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.380
and now you're dying
to share it,

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.680
because this active sharing
is imperative that we have

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.080
in common with virtually every
other living thing on earth,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.500
this need to connect
and to commune.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.020
In this case, to share
what you tuned into,

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.740
this thing that touched
you deeply.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.200
So, now you search for a context
that you can grab somebody

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.500
by the ears and say, "Hey,

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.220

what would it be?"

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.250
Is it going to be a CD?

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.550
Well, it may be.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:11.910
In fact, I have two CDs right
here that you're welcome to buy

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.600
if you want to later on.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.090
I only got two of some of
the sounds you've heard,

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:23.390
but what I have done
mostly is not sell CDs,

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:27.320
it's to make radio
programs and now podcasts.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:33.280
And you make it and you
cross your finger or fingers

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.750
as the case may be, and you hope

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:38.240
that somebody will
actually pay attention.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:46.590
Well, one approach is to
frame a sound in a story.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.100
So, here's an early Pulse
of the Planet program

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.910
which demonstrates that
possibility of framing a sound

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.430
within a little story.

beach themselves and now

is the Pulse of the Planet.

out and these animals are going

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.640
to be high and dry for
the foreseeable future

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.020
that is either until
the next tide comes

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.730
up to float them
12 hours from now

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:22.660
or until we can pick
them up and move them.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.790
We're checking out the area
right now looking for pools

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.360
that remain after the tide
goes out and we may be able

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.260
to move them and keep
them in those pools,

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.470
that would be the best scenario.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.770

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.680

Wildlife Coalition,

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.250

groups

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:38.920
that come together
during a whale rescue.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.810
&gt;&gt; Right now we're covering
them with blankets and sheets,

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:43.990
one to keep the sun off
them and keep them moist,

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:47.320
and also in some degree
to help them control their

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.620
body temperature.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.830
They can quickly overheat
in a situation like this,

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:55.750
so we'll keep the water
on them to keep them cool

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:59.920
or in some cases if they go

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.300
into shock they can
start getting cold.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:09.900
In that case, we'll use other
things and put more blankets

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.050
on them and try to
keep them warm.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:19.500

expand all this effort

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.050
for these stranded whales?

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:28.770
Why not let nature
take its course?

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.530
&gt;&gt; Well, we don't know
what nature's course is

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:34.180
and so it's very
difficult to stand back

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.170
and just say well
this is nature's way.

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:41.370
It's like when people in India
they say well somebody's karma

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.590
to drown, well maybe it's
you time to save them

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:48.910
and that's kind of a roundabout
answer, but right we're doing

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:50.670
so many negative things to
the planet that it's nice

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:51.970
to have one thing
that you can do

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:53.270
that has maybe a
positive influence

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:54.570
and this certainly does.

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:55.870

Looking into the eye of a whale
close up and hearing it breathe

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.070

only payment that any

the life of a fellow creature.

so my dad split wood
for our woodstove

and so he taught me how to
split from when I was really,

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.240
really young and you can tell
when a mull hits a piece of wood

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.690
where it's all the way through,

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:53.620
the mull would just
kind of split it.

He wouldn't be looking,

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.430
but I could as I was practicing
he could tell me whether it was

01:13:58.430 --> 01:14:00.340
going to split or
not from the sound

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.180

from the outside.

releasing.

a great sound,

in all the places that you

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:02.400

was this a few years ago,

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.670

and I above a tree line

in Central Colorado probably
about 11,000 feet high

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:13.240
so we were above the tree
lines, so there were no trees

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.940
and you know I could
see, see all around me.

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:21.350
There was a big horizon and
there was very, this one part

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:25.070
of the sound environment was,
I mean, it was mostly quiet,

01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:28.590
but you could hear very
subtle movement of the air.

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:29.890
It wasn't really a breeze.

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:33.230
It was just kind of very
subtle movement of the air

01:15:33.230 --> 01:15:36.010
and then every now and
then there would be a sound

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:39.630
of an animal doing
something or a bird

01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:42.790
that was mostly near silence,

01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:45.550
but still there was a
little sound there and it's

01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:48.920
so interesting to think about
the fact that, you know,

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.430
when we go through everyday
life, I mean, I think one thing

01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:54.740
about everyday life in the city
and now everywhere there's a lot

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:57.090
of kind of manufactured sounds

01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:00.220
like you have a soundtrack
every time you go shopping or go

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.410
into a restaurant or something,
and so [audio cuts out] same

01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:06.250
when you're in an environment
where you can when there's not,

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:09.650
you know, a cacophony
of sound but there are,

01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:12.650
there's still subtle sound
going on and then every now

01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:15.530
and then more characteristic
sounds.

01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:20.140

in a place like that which,

you know, it's relatively rare,

certainly in the city except
maybe in the morning in cities

01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:30.760

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:19.160
You could hear this cicadas
outside and the crickets

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.430
and it was just that sudden
switch and [audio cuts out]

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:24.730
and it was so loud you
couldn't hear anything

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:27.200
and then so quiet you could.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.160
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Huh, great.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:33.310
Did, there was a moment like
that in the piece did that sort

01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:34.610
of trigger the memory?

01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:37.130
Huh. Cool.

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:38.430
Any others?

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:39.730
Yeah.

01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:42.470
&gt;&gt; After the riots in
Baltimore three years ago,

01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:46.120
[inaudible] who made it to that
baseball game with no crowd

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.100
in attendance, so
we would some of us

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.290
who were season ticket
holders were used to the noise,

01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:55.150
the cacophony, the constant
mirage of jumbo trons

01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:58.310
and hotdog races and
all this nonsense

01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:02.120
and you could go stand the
outside of the stadium in some

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.760
of the public accessible
places that listen

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.010
to professional baseball game
being played with no crowd noise

01:18:09.010 --> 01:18:11.780
and no PA and no announcers.

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:13.080
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Wow.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.010
Twilight zone.

01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:20.170
&gt;&gt; And Orioles catcher
actually came out and then

01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:24.330
to gage batting practice and
he waved to [inaudible] crowd.

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:26.050
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Well, it's
also you're reminding me

01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:27.980
that it's another one of
those sounds, a wooden sound,

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.040
but you talk to an outfielder

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.900
and I have interviewed
outfielders or baseball players

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.540
and they can tell by
the crack of a bat.

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.000
It's one of the things that
informs them, well is it going

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.210
to be like a line drive,
aside from the visual,

01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:42.460
they hear that sound and
they know it's going to,

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.760
oh it's a high pop or whatever.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.060
It's one of those things

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.860
that has a different
sound quality of sound.

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.160
Yeah, Tom.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:53.080
&gt;&gt; When I was very young,
we lived on a street

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.360
that had a park at
the end of the block

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.650
and every Saturday morning

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:02.170
in the fall the local high
school marching band would go

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:04.860
past my window on the
way to the football game

01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:06.970
and so I would wake up I
would hear the distance sound

01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:09.930
and they played out of tune,
because they weren't very good.

01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:11.230
It would get louder and louder.

01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:13.450
It was something like a
Doppler shift I guess,

01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:18.050
but with volume instead of and I
always knew when they were right

01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:20.230
in front of the house
it would pick up

01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:23.820
and then it would slowly fade
out as they would come pass.

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.730
I always remembered that.

01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:27.900
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Yeah,
It sounds emotion, yeah.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:32.180
&gt;&gt; I have a very similar one
actually it's a marching band

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.570
one, It's from Minneapolis a
few years ago I was on a run

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:41.710
and I stumbled on I guess it
was like, like the meeting time

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:44.240
for a competition of marching
bands [audio cuts out].

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.730
So, I was moving with
the marching band.

01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:50.650
They were all stationary
and they were in the bubble

01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:53.200
so I was running
through basically a field

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.330
of marching bands
practicing with the big band.

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:57.630
They all [inaudible].

01:19:57.630 --> 01:20:01.030
I tried to record it, I'm not
very good with sound recorders,

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:04.040
but something about that
[audio cuts out] capture.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.860
I wanted to share another one.

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.160
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Please,
please go on.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.520
&gt;&gt; When I was, I was brought
at my grandparent's house

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.620
and always wanted to
walk to a sand hill.

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:16.020
We called it a sand hill,
but you know there were a lot

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.090
of small pebbles
[audio cuts out] sister

01:20:19.090 --> 01:20:23.830
and I would make piles and
we'd spend you know an hour

01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:28.660
or two throwing rocks down
the sand hill, so the sound

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:30.160
of rocks [audio cuts out].

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:35.780
And I haven't even mentioned,
you know, until you're talk

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.270
on listening to some
of the sounds,

01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:44.250
but I live in a modest area now
and after the evening prayer,

01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:49.050
there's usually like a period
of meditation and we had

01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:53.730
to go break the silence with
small stone that he cracks

01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:57.480
against the pews when
they sit [audio cuts out].

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.610
I've always found
it very pleasant

01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:03.560
and it's strange you know why
I thought that was so pleasant

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:07.050
and I look forward to it.

01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:11.000
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Can you say what
kind of monastery it is, which?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Benedictine.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.860
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Benedictine.

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.150
&gt;&gt; Say it sometimes.

01:21:16.150 --> 01:21:17.570
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: In, I
think Saint Benedicts said

01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:20.640
"Incline thy heart's ear"
is one of the things he said

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.080
and so chanting, do you chant?

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.380
&gt;&gt; No, we [inaudible].

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.890
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Well, that
then when I was mentioning

01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:31.300
about Tomatis before, he was
a Alfred Tomatis was famously

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:36.040
called to a group of
Benedictines monastery

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.520
where all the, where they had
stopped, somebody had seemed

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.560
like a good idea at the time
that they would stop chanting

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.150
and have more time
for other stuff

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:47.420
and in his words he found
them in their cells "lying

01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:51.210
like a bunch of limp dish rags",
that was his description of it

01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:56.580
and he basically his remedy
was to get them chanting again

01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:01.230
and that energized the sound
of the chant which he went

01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:03.420
on to thinking that that
particular frequency

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.720
which is heard in the
middle of Gregorian chant

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.870
which about one K, one
thousand cycles per second.

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:13.590
He felt energized the brain.

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:15.460
Now, I don't know if
that's true or not.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.210
He also felt Mozart
in particular,

01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:20.160
the music of Mozart was
prominent in those frequencies,

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.060
but that, that quality
of music he felt helped,

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.940
well as he put it,
"Energized the brain"

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.550
which is an interesting
idea and he also felt

01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:31.350
that there were certain
kinds of sounds in music

01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:33.780
that did the opposite.

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:38.060
So, luck you to be in the midst
of that sound environment.

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:40.950
And a lot, so many
traditions have that sound

01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:45.580
in Greek orthodox
there's a sound of a,

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:48.530
it has a particular name
which I've forgotten,

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:53.600
but it's also the sound of
you know hitting something

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.120
and then getting more rapidly.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.650
Any others?

01:22:58.650 --> 01:23:05.080
&gt;&gt; Just because I
have now been saved.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.380
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Yeah.

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:11.860
&gt;&gt; I find the many sounds
of water [audio cuts out].

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.830
The rain starts to be heard.

01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:17.130
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Yes.

01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:18.430
&gt;&gt; On the roof.

01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:19.730
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: Yeah.

01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:26.010
&gt;&gt; Or it may be a stream,
[inaudible] of the beach before.

01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:37.510
It has the way of bringing
me this impression of nature.

01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:42.530
[ Inaudible ]

01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:44.330
&gt;&gt; Jim Metzner: And we
are touched by the sounds

01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:45.850
of water and, in
fact, that was one

01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:47.270
of the sound memories
you don't hear it,

01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:50.150
but it was the last one
there was rain on the roof

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:54.030
of a tin roof and many, many
people had mentioned that

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.900
and if we listen to the end

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.500
of the piece you would
hear somebody talking

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.760
about that sound memory he
had of a very particular place

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.840
and the evocative
sound of water.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.560
So, absolutely.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:10.090
So, we live in a world of
vibration that we mostly take

01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:14.610
for granted and we also carry
within us this inner archive

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:18.370
of sounds and complete with all

01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:22.740
of the associated relentless
associations that come with them

01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:26.650
and somehow our lives are lived

01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:30.760
between these two
realms of sound.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:34.460
The outer and the inner and this

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:39.260
in between place is
a little mysterious,

01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:45.230
it's a little unknown,
it's quiet, it's still,

01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:49.220
it's sensitive, it's a
bit like being in the eye

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:53.730
of a storm attuning to
something very subtle.

01:24:53.730 --> 01:24:59.450
It may be a vibration
that is more sensed

01:24:59.450 --> 01:25:02.710
than felt than heard.

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:06.090
It's like if you've
ever had the experience

01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:09.890
of someone asking
a question and all

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:12.940
of a sudden you're
hearing the question

01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.910
that was behind that question.

01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:16.210
Do you know what I mean?

01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:17.690
Not the words that came
out of their mouth,

01:25:17.690 --> 01:25:19.290
but you're hearing what was,

01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:21.620
what inspired them
to ask that question.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.060
Do you know what I mean?

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:27.870
Sometimes it's like an intuition
and that's I think similar

01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:30.350
to what we're speaking about,

01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:35.830
the idea that whenever
we're listening attentively,

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:38.990
we have the possibility
not only of being nourished

01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:46.040
by this swirling microcosmic
galaxy of sounds and vibrations,

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.650
but also what lies behind them.

01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:53.910
So, the thought I'd like
to leave you with is

01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:59.960
that by becoming quiet
enough inside, perhaps it's

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:03.160
in that realm that
we can become,

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.430
we can rediscover the
magic of listening.

01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:09.510
Thank you.

glad you asked that question.

It has a lot of sounds on
it and these two CDs have,

01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:52.330
they're not programs but they
have a lot of great sounds some

01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:55.700
of which we've heard tonight, so
that's another way you can hear,

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:58.910
not so much the stories
but the sounds themselves

01:26:58.910 --> 01:27:00.580
