00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.360
Joelle has two after-school
jobs, babysitting and working

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.990
at her parents' grocery store.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.290
Working at the grocery pays
her $12 an hour, and

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.740
babysitting pays her
$9.50 an hour.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.170
Last week she worked
19 hours in total.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.800
That looks like a
statement that

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000
could lead to an equation.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.320
Last week she worked
19 hours in total.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.320
And she earned $56 more at the
grocery store than she did

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.850
babysitting.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.390
That looks like another
statement

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.620
that could be an equation.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.090
She earned $56 more at the
grocery store than she did

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.200
babysitting.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.220
And then they ask us, how
many hours did she

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.440
work at each job?

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.330
So they want to know--
so let's define

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.410
some variables here.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.490
Let's define time babysitting,
so t sub b, as equal to hours

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.740
babysitting.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.476
And let's define t sub g as
hours at the grocery.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.640
So they want us to figure out
what was t sub b and t sub g,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.400
what were the hours of
babysitting and what were the

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.700
hours at the grocery?

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.150
Now, they tell us that she
worked 19 hours total.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660
So that blue statement says that
the sum of these two is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.310
going to be 19.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.940
So the time she worked
babysitting plus the time she

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.900
worked at the grocery store is
going to be equal to 19 hours.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.890
Now the other statement.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.000
This by itself obviously we
can't solve for these.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.370
We need another constraint.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.770
They said that she earned $56
more at the grocery store then

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.480
she did babysitting.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.880
So let me define two more
variables here.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.020
So this is the pay babysitting,
her total pay

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.910
babysitting.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.940
And let's say P sub g
is equal to the pay

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.370
at the grocery store.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.220
Now, what are these terms?

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.570
I mean, if we just look at this
second statement right

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.160
there, we'll just say, OK, the
pay at babysitting, she earned

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.320
$56 more at the grocery than
she did babysitting.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.350
So this second statement tells
us that, well, I guess the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.960
pay-- let me write it over
here-- the pay babysitting,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.260
she earned $56 more at the
grocery than she did

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.780
babysitting.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.500
So if we take babysitting and
add $56, that will get us to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.910
how much she earned at
the grocery store.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.690
That's what that second
statement is telling us. $56

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.260
more at the grocery
than babysitting.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.160
So if you add these two,
you get the grocery.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.700
Now, this still isn't cool.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.370
We have one, two, three,
four unknowns

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.410
and only two equations.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.580
That's not going to help us.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.970
But what will help us we can
express these two variables in

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.360
terms of these two variables,
and then we have two equations

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.300
with two unknowns, so we can
solve them the way we've

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.670
solved all systems
of equations.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.340
Now the other information they
give us is the rate, how much

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.750
she earned per hour.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.950
Working at the grocery, she
makes $12 per hour.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.290
Babysitting, she makes
$9.50 per hour.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.890
So what is going to be
her pay babysitting?

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.150
Let me write this over here.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.320
Her pay babysitting-- I'll do
it in this color-- her pay

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.570
babysitting is going to
be equal to the time

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.370
babysitting, right?

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.620
The time babysitting times how
much she gets paid per hour.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.090
The time babysitting is how many
hours, times how much she

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.900
gets paid per hour.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.030
It tells us right there.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.040
She gets paid $9.50 per
hour babysitting.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.830
So times $9.50.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.150
That is what her pay
babysitting is.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.870
And then, same argument, what's
her pay working at the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.370
grocery store?

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.970
Her total pay working at
the grocery store.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.320
Her pay at the grocery is going
to be equal to the time

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.910
at the grocery times the rate
that she gets paid at the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.050
grocery. $12 per hour.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.630
So times $12 per hour.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.320
And this hopefully
is intuitive.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.430
If I'm making $12 per hour and
I work for, I don't know, 3

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.900
hours, I'm going to make $36.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.390
I would just multiply
these two.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.460
If I worked 2 hours at $9.50,
I'm going to make $19.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.150
That's all this is.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.280
A total pay.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.060
So now we can take these two
expressions-- we could take

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.040
this expression and this
expression-- and substitute it

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.779
back into that equation right
there, and then we'll have an

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.190
equation that's only in terms
of the time babysitting and

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.400
the time at the grocery store.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.510
So let's do that.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.940
So this first term right here,
her total pay babysitting,

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.710
that is this expression
right there.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.200
So let me write it right here.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.420
So $9.50 times the
time babysitting.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.130
So I'll just write 9.5 times
time babysitting-- that's this

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:48.670
term right here-- plus 56 is
equal to the pay that she got

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.460
at the grocery, which is 12
times the time at the grocery.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.980
And now we need to solve for
both of these variables.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.680
We have two equations
and two unknowns.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.670
This is just straightforward
algebra at this point.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.060
So let's do it.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.950
So the easiest way to do this
might just be to do straight

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.750
up substitution cause we have
all these crazy numbers here.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.870
Let's just solve for the time at
the babysitting in terms of

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.330
the time at the grocery.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.140
So if you take this top
equation-- let me write it

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.210
over here-- so the time
babysitting plus the time at

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.800
the grocery is equal to 19.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.250
If you subtract the time at the
grocery from both sides,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.680
you get the time babysitting
is equal to-- these cancel

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.920
out-- 19 minus the time
at the grocery.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.700
So we solved for the time
babysitting in terms of the

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.570
time at the grocery.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.063
So everywhere we see the time
babysitting, we can substitute

00:05:46.063 --> 00:05:49.540
it with this expression
right here.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.250
That's what t sub b is.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.370
That is what the time
babysitting is.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.290
So let's do that.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.900
So this equation becomes 9.5
times the time babysitting,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.780
which we just figured out from
this top equation is 19 minus

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:11.290
the time at the grocery, plus
56, is equal to 12 times the

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.010
time at the grocery.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.890
And now we just have to solve
for the time at the grocery.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.650
So 9.5 times 19.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.770
That's a little bit of hairy.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.470
Let me just do it over here, on
the right side right here.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.430
So if I have 19 times 9.5.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.320
5 times 9 is 45.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.440
1 times 5 is 5, plus 4, is 9.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.420
And then we have a 0 here.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.410
9 times 9 is 81.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.520
9 times 1 is 9, plus 8, is 17.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.160
So 5 plus 0 is 5.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.110
9 plus 1 is 10.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.980
1 plus 7 is 8.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.290
You just have a 1 there, and you
have one number behind the

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.030
decimal point.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.130
So it's 180.5.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:11.350
So 9.5 times 19 is 180.5 minus
9.5 times the time at the

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:18.830
grocery, plus 56, is
equal to 12 times

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.380
the time at the grocery.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.780
Now what's 180.5 plus 56?

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.060
So 180 plus 50-- let's add just
those two terms-- 180.5

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.410
plus 56, just to simplify it.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.300
180 plus 50 would be 230.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:46.810
So this'll be 236.5 minus 9.5
times the time at the grocery,

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.400
is equal to 12 times the
time at the grocery.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.740
Now we can add the time at the
grocery to both sides of this

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.270
equation, or the 9.5.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.000
So let's do that.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.800
Plus 9.5 times the time at the
grocery is equal-- or plus 9.5

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.820
times time at the grocery.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.470
Just adding it to both sides
of that equation.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.030
And we are left with-- the
left-hand side, that cancels

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:17.830
out-- we just have 236.5 is
equal to, 12 plus 9 is 21, so

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.880
this is going to be 21.5.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.810
It's equal to 21.5 times the
time she spent at the grocery.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.500
So now we can just divide both
sides of this equation by

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.970
21.5, and we've figured
out how long she

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.970
spent at the grocery.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.230
Let's do that.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.309
Divide both sides by 21.5.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.460
So that cancels out.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.309
The time she spent at the
grocery is going to be equal

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:43.940
to that thing.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.440
And let's see what that is.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:56.420
We get 21.5 goes into 236.5.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.860
Let's multiply both of
these numbers by 10.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.165
So this is the same thing
as 215 going into 2,365.

00:09:04.165 --> 00:09:06.200
The decimal goes right there.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.270
215 goes into 236 one time.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.060
1 times 215 is 215.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.730
And then we can subtract-- let
me scroll down more-- this

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.910
problem is hairier than
I thought it would be.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.000
So 36 minus 15 is 21.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.400
So 21-- bring down the 5-- and
lucky for us that's pretty

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:24.890
straightforward.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.290
215 goes into 215 one time.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.890
1 times 215 is 215.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.660
Subtract.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.030
You get no remainder.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.590
So the time at the grocery
store is 11, or 11 hours.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.260
Now we can go and substitute
back to figure out her time

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.250
babysitting.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.050
We know that the time
babysitting is equal to 19

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.510
minus the time at the grocery.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.210
In this case, it's
19 minus 11.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.500
We just figured that out.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.790
19 minus 11 is 8.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.880
So her time babysitting, she
spent 8 hours babysitting.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.190
And we are done.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.490
They both add up to 19, and you
could make sure that they

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.700
also verify.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.230
That also works out for
the second equation.
