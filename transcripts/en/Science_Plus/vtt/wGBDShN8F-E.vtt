00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Hey there internet, I'm Trace Dominguez for TestTube Plus.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.040
This week we're talking about humans, and everything that I could muster about them.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.400
We take big topics on this show and we break them down into smaller topics.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.000
So, if you never watched before make sure you go back and watch the two episodes we've done so far this week.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.380
Of course you can also just watch this one if it's the one you're interested in.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Make sure you subscribe for more videos.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.240
This week, today, we're talking about how humans got to where we're now.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.240
But...

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200
I think it's messed up. We keep changing.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.900
Our human story keeps changing because we humans keep changing.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.020
Evolution kinda forces adaptation.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.460
So 1.9 million years ago the genus homo was all over Africa and Asia.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.400
The modern humans started to move out of Africa,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.180
specifically East Africa where they started

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.500
as really tiny little squirrel things all way up to the point you see now

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.100
which you can watch in an early episode.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.020
Modern humans moved out of Africa into Arabia about 125,000 years ago.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.740
We know this because anthropologists have found stone hand axes.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.180
They found scrapers. They found what's called a perforator.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.800
They did all of that and they found it in the UAE (United Arabe Emirates).

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.780
Previously was thought the we move out of Africa about 60,000 years ago.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.580
So 125,000 years, that's a huge jump.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.120
And what happened is...

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.380
we found these tools.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.860
And that's how hard it is to really determine the history of humanity.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.460
It's not like there was a big drone flying and filming all of these people.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.320
You know, there was no camera crew.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.700
This is all being found by stuff buried under the ground.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.680
We have to dig in the right place. We have to dig at the right time of year.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.340
We have to be able to get to it and save it.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.460
So that we can study it and figure out what it is.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.560
Not easy!

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.300
After that we moved into Europe, about 46,000 years ago,  that's why we met the Neanderthals.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.040
And of course - like humans do - we bred with them.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.500
We mixed our genes.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.640
We also found new climates in Europe.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.560
Africa's a very different climate than Europe.  Europe is a little colder,  the weather is a lot different.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.960
And because of that we had to adapt.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.800
We started learning to make more clothing. We started learning to make tools

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.460
that could hunt different animals that we had found in Africa.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.400
Europe is more mountainous as well, so we had to learn how to get over and around these giant mountains.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.720
And unlike Africa, which in parts can be desert, can be grassland Europe doesn't  really have a lot of that.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.280
So we had to learn new ways to find our food and not a lot of animals can do that.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.200
Humans are really good at picking out new ways to do things.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.700
Modern humans, like us, probably learned to deal with these changes using tools,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.460
domesticating animals, and changing how they lived their whole lives.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.460
Which is pretty incredible.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.960
We went from being nomatic to hunter-gatherer. We went from being hunter-gatherer to farmers.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.180
And this was all over tens of thousands of years.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.460
We moved to Asia between 46,000 and 63,000 years ago.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.720
We know this because literally we found 1 skull in a cave in Laos.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.380
The skull was not actually put in that cave by a human.
It wouldn't've died there.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.840
They actually think that it was washed into that cave via a rainy season monsoon perhaps.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.920
But they found it there and they used what they knew about that cave,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.680
and about that region, and about that skull, 
to determine that humans had migrated there at some point.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.420
Again, 46,000 to 63,000 years ago.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.180
So the story keeps getting updated every time we find something.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.280
North and South America were populated by humans when a land bridge existed

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.260
across the Bering Strait between Northeast Russia and Alaska.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.820
But unlike what you may be picturing right now, which is really like a skinny little bridge,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.880
they do think that the land bridge was really huge, 
like it was hundreds of miles across.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:12.660
And people moved onto the land bridge from Northern China - what would be Northern China, 
Mongolia and Russia

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.400
and into this land bridge area.
They lived there for a while

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.160
and then eventually (13,000 years ago) they were forced off the land bridge as the water started to rise

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.620
and they moved into the United States.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.320
This means that unlike some theories that Native Americans were essentially just Asians

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.860
that had walked across the land bridge and set up camp over in Canada,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.840
there was instead a cousin of the Asian human

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.100
because they'd bred for so long on the land bridge.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.560
It was actually a whole separated group

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.220
and over time things changed.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.140
Here's an example of how things changed:

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.860
Cow's milk. We domesticated cows 10,500 years ago probably in Iran

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.080
or what would be considered Iran today or the Persian Empire area.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.940
They've determined actually there was 80 original female cows

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.740
That all domesticated cows descend from.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.820
Who were very difficult to domesticate, actually. According to people's research.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.540
And it turns out some people couldn't drink cow's milk.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.240
We can drink human milk for a very short amount of time

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.560
and then our genes turn off the ability for us to drink  milk.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.920
Usually.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.780
Some people on the other hand have a gene mutation where the gene never turns off.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.920
And since mothers don't make milk our whole lives we supplemented that, because is very nutritious, with cow's milk.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.540
This didn't extend to everywhere in the world but only certain groups of humans

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.820
who got this genetic adaptation.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.080
For example: In Southern Sudan 17% of people cannot drink milk.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.820
Most of them can, but the people of the Southern Sudan were cattle farmers.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.220
So chances are they adapted.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.000
That is to say people that couldn't drink milk didn't get as much nutrition

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.900
and couldn't compete with the people that could drink milk.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.380
The ones that could adapted and were able to survive. The ones that couldn't, died.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.460
Native Americans didn't have domesticated cow. They would drink milk as babies and then they didn't.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.420
So Native Americans 100% cannot process lactose.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.380
99% of the Ebo (Igbo) in Yoruba tribes, in Nigeria, cannot digest milk.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.020
90% of people who originated from Japan and Thailand cannot process milk.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.220
Whereas in Sweden only 4% of people can't process milk.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.640
So I guess you can tell who was drinking milk just by looking at lactose intolarence.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.280
Who was doing well by drinking this milk.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.060
In Switzerland, Spain and Finland it's about 20% of people who are lactose intolerant.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.160
And to combat this in some parts of the world they started learning to make cheese

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.540
because cheese actually has a different or a lower level of the protein or the enzyme lactose.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.020
So 11,000 years ago people coped with that increase in lactose in cow's milk by learning to make cheese.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.300
They found anthropological evidence - cheese strainers.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600
Very funny.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.520
Actually, you should look those up. They're pretty cool.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.520
You can find them on discoverynews.com

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.660
The genes eventually didn't shut off and now we are left with their legacy.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.640
Where some of us are lactose intolerant and other are not.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.380
These nutrition changes allowed people to adapt and live in other places. And it wasn't just milk.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.680
For example the Inuit people, who live far north in North America,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.600
they may be able to digest fats better than, say, people from Western Europe.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.060
Native Americans may not be able to drink milk that well

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.180
but the Native Americans of Arizona could eat corn, beans and squash

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.140
as an entirety of their diet and still have very slender bodies

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.360
but Western Europeans can't.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.440
So it really dependant on where you lived and as the time went by things changed.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.080
We needed more or less height depending on what we could compete with.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.920
We needed lots of different foods.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.660
Some tribes around the world, some small human groups, didn't eat a lot of varied food.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.560
Some ate very specific foods.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.920
So people who couldn't eat the things that needed to eat...

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.660
died.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.340
Because that's how evolution works. That's how adaptation works.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.340
Think of those in Southern Sudan with the cattle farming.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.380
They'd also learned to hunt different animals.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.020
Some theorize, like Christopher McDougall in his book "Born to Run"

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.520
he also has a TED talk about that from the pen TEDx, I think.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:35.320
He believes, and other researchers as well, that humans, we don't have claws or sharp teeth, but we can run really well.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.660
We can run for a long time because we're good sweaters, we run fast but not too fast

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.800
and we can run for a long, long time.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.100
Think marathon runners. How many other animals run for 20 miles or more straight?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.560
Very few, if any.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.940
Tools plus running, that makes us good hunters.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.660
So maybe that's how those people, and maybe all people, adapted to their surroundings.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.760
But honestly again, there are no camera crews. There are no storytellers.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.020
We don't really know.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.880
Some different skin tones also started to come about as an adaptation to certain humans.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.700
A study in Nature found the about 7,000 years ago European skin started to lighten .

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.940
And of course as is the theme with evolution a lot of people probably died.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.840
But over time we slowly got lighter skin because of our cereal rich diet of these Neolithic farmers

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.920
That cereal rich diet, which means grains that lacked vitamin D,

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.840
did with Europeans rapidly lost their dark skin pigmentation.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.940
So they could get a different level of vitamin D into their bodies.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.220
And that happened only once we switched to agriculture.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.860
Although it was originally thought it had to do with UV radiation in Europe versus Africa.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.060
But turns out it was a way earlier than that.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.240
Oh, or way later than that. It would have happened a way earlier if was about UV radiation.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.540
The end, the moral of the story is: We learn lots of things about humans over time

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:59.440
Through small discoveries made in caves, buried for thousands, millions of years underground.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.940
And those give us little clues as to where we got to where we are now.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:12.780
The overarching theme of evolution is in the end, a lot of people have to die for us to adapt on a global scale.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.620
What are we going to learn about ourselves next?

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.300

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.680
which talked about  how we got to be human in the first place.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.760
We started as squirrels, more or less.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.720
You'll see. Go watch.
