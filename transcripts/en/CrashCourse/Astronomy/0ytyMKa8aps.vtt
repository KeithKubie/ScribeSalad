00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.080
Welcome to our Solar System.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.900
Below you will find our sun. Our star is 2
octillion tons of hot hydrogen gas emitting

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.650
400 septillion joules of energy every second.
The hottest part of the sun is its 15 million°C

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.360
core, where it's been fusing hydrogen into
helium for the past 4.6 billions years. Despite

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.820
that, it's only considered a middle aged star!

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.620
Now let’s check out the closest planet to
our sun, Mercury. Orbiting the sun in just

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.729
88 days, Mercury also has the most elliptical
orbit of any planet. It spins very slowly,

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:57.700
once every 2/3 of its orbital period. Despite its
surface reaching a blistering 430°C, it still has

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.360
water ice in permanently shadowed craters near its
poles, where the temperatures stay below -170° C.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.180
The next planet in our solar system is Venus.
It’s the planet with the hottest surface

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.880
temperature; at 460°C it’s hot enough to
melt lead. Its air is almost entirely composed

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.670
of carbon dioxide, with a thick layer of sulfuric
clouds. Its rotational axis is flipped upside-down,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.890
which means that the planet spins backwards.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.860
The third and best understood planet is Earth.
Our home planet has a dense metal core, a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.770
thick viscous rock mantle, and a thin crust.
It's unique in the solar system for having

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.250
humans and permanent liquid water on its surface.
Other planets may get the former soon.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.030
At 3470 km in diameter, our Moon has the largest
moon-to-planet size ratio. It's thought to have

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.860
formed when a small planet impacted Earth
at a grazing angle billions of years ago.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.700
It’s heavily cratered, and has huge flood
plains on it called maria.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.520
Next up in our system is Mars. Its iconic
red color comes from its rusty rocks and dust.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.460
In the past Mars was once very wet, with oceans,
a thick atmosphere, and a warmer climate.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.900
But its lack of a magnetic field meant no protection
from the solar wind, which eroded its atmosphere away.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.760
Between Mars and Jupiter is a large asteroid belt.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.120
It’s a ring shaped region containing rubble leftover
from the formation of the planets.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.800
Past the asteroid belt we find our systems
Jovian planets, starting with Jupiter.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.320
A gas giant, it’s the largest planet in our solar
system. It has a dynamic atmosphere, including

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.740
belts, zones, and a gigantic red spot created
by a persistent hurricane. The Great Red Spot

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.879
is a persistent anticyclonic storm. The spot
is large enough to contain three Earth-sized

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.159
planets. It’s still unclear what exactly
gives the spot its red color.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.220
The next planet in our system is Saturn. It’s
a gas giant with a broad set of rings.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.860
It has a hexagonal cloud pattern on its north
pole. It's the least dense of all the planets,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.820
even less dense than water! Made up of ice
particles, Saturn’s rings are 250,000 km across,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.880
but only 10 meters thick! Gaps in the rings are created
the gravitational tugging of the moons orbiting Saturn.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.940
Uranus is an ice giant with a small rocky core and
a thick mantle of ammonia, water, and methane.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.020
It also has thirteen distinct rings. Uranus
has a huge tilt -- 98°, with respect to its orbit.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.660
A massive glancing collision long ago is one
hypothesis to explain the extreme tilt.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.980
Technically considered the last planet in
our solar system, Neptune is an ice giant,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.810
with a similar composition to Uranus. It’s
the most dense of the outer planets and the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.140
only planet found by mathematical prediction
rather than by empirical observation.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.340
At the outer edges of our solar system we find the
Kuiper Belt, filled with smaller rocky and icy bodies.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.560
Pluto is in this region. It was originally discovered
in 1930 and categorized as a planet,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.100
but it was recategorized as a minor planet in 2006.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.160
And there you go -- a crash course on our solar system.
Even though we've explored a lot of it, there's still

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.260
a huge amount left to discover. And that's the beauty
of science: there's always more to learn.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.020
