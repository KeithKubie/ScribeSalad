00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.660
This is Radiolab. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.670
I'm Soren Wheeler and this

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.600
[inaudible]. Alright, if you want to sit there. Okay.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.720
If you stick the phones on and start saying I to someone and I don't know,

5
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.200
can you hear anyone? Can I hear anyone? Oh No. Can you hear anyone? Oh my God,

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.020
sorry. And Hi. Yes I do.

7
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.620
I do this a Sally 80 she's an old friend of mine. How are you?

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.270
We went to school together long time ago,

9
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.830
but these days she's an editor at New Scientist in London and the reason I

10
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:35.370
called her into the studio is because of something that happened to her when she

11
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:37.350
was working on the story for them. Yes.

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.380
This was a story that I'd been chasing for years and years again for her in 2007

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.860
at DARPA Tech,

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.250
which is a big gathering of like weapons developers and researchers.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.210
It's like 5,000 guys. I'll, you know, looking like agent Smith from the Matrix,

16
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:55.560
you know, looking at the, the latest war toys, drones, Bazookas. Anyway,

17
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:59.430
at some point she starts talking to this woman and she was telling me about her

18
00:00:59.431 --> 00:00:59.971
program,

19
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.320
which was that they had figured out how to apply sort of electrical current to

20
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.490
the brain in order to accelerate the learning process. And I was like,

21
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.683
<v 1>nope.</v>

22
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.200
So what Sally had stumbled into with something called PDCs scans for

23
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:17.750
transcranial direct current stimulation.

24
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.900
The idea is you take a couple of little electrodes,

25
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:24.050
you place them on your scalp, connected with wires to a battery,

26
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:27.140
you send a little bit of electricity into your brain and then

27
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.010
<v 0>all kinds of things happen if you believe the claims. But um, for Sally,</v>

28
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.460
it started with a casual afternoon of sniper training.

29
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.580
So after that conversation at the conference,

30
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.400
she tracked down a group in Carlsbad, California.

31
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.660
It's about an hour and a half south of La who are using this brain zapping stuff

32
00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:47.620
to train snipers.

33
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.600
And I actually got new scientists to agreed to send me to La from London,

34
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:55.480
which is not an insignificant expense.

35
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.870
After a late night international flight and some la traffic, I haven't slept,

36
00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.711
I'm sleep deprived.

37
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:03.490
Sally found herself at a place called advanced brain monitoring where they have

38
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.130
a little room,

39
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.360
this little room where they've set up a little sort of 360 degree training

40
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:13.750
simulation. So it's kind of like a video game, but um,

41
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.680
it's like the full kind of like the full room in front of you.

42
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.640
And so wall is a screen. Yes. Not only that, she says,

43
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:26.530
but all around you in this room are these props. You're behind real sandbags,

44
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.240
you know, in proper position.

45
00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:30.670
They teach you how to hold the rifle properly and the rifle,

46
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.880
except for the fact that it shoots blanks, it's basically the real deal. Yeah.

47
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:37.330
And then it's got a laser laser site and they tell her, you know, okay,

48
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:39.250
before we do this brain stimulation thing,

49
00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.260
we're actually going to have you do some training without it.

50
00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:45.940
So they get her all set up, they put her behind the sandbags and they hit go.

51
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.540
You know, at first it starts out with really easy stuff.

52
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:53.070
Like you're shooting virtual targets that aren't people. Then it's quite,

53
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.101
it's realistic.

54
00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:57.550
You get the kickback from the CO2 cartridge and then you get this like sound

55
00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:58.384
from when you hit,

56
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.870
you know the metal target and then it starts getting harder so there's people

57
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:06.190
instead of targets and then more and more people until the highest level is you

58
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.510
are at a checkpoint,

59
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.500
like an Iraqi checkpoint and everything's fine and then all of a sudden

60
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.290
the Humvee in front of you blows up and then from all over the place does people

61
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.270
in suicide bomb fast start running at you with their rifles shooting you and I'm

62
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.840
just being blown up. I can't,

63
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.540
I can't make the decisions fast enough.

64
00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:33.920
She said there were just too many of them.

65
00:03:33.921 --> 00:03:36.890
She couldn't figure out who to shoot first. It was so, oh God.

66
00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:41.891
And I was so tired and I was so jet lagged and I was so bad at it and it's funny

67
00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:44.030
because you think like, oh, whatever, that's a video game,

68
00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:47.960
but it's amazing how stressful that gets. In a certain point,

69
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.350
stress started getting to her. It was like, all right, stop,

70
00:03:51.351 --> 00:03:53.120
let's just end this. She started thinking like,

71
00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:55.610
what the hell am I doing here anyway? Like, oh my God,

72
00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:56.750
this isn't going to be a story.

73
00:03:56.751 --> 00:03:59.480
And really you just flew out to California for this.

74
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.060
She was not very good at it and it kind of stressed her out.

75
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.920
And then this guy walked in the room. Yes, Mike Weissen. Mike Weisen,

76
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.850
he's a neuroscientist. It looks like Greg Allman.

77
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.690
He's got that like super long hair. Fairly clean cut at the moment.

78
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:13.640
But I had hair down to my belt buckle.

79
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.120
So Mike Wisen has put together this contraption.

80
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.010
What is the big box is sitting in your lap there?

81
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.940
This is a big red toolbox that we got literally from Sears.

82
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.950
Mike was actually passing through New York City,

83
00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:28.370
so we invited him into the studio and we have electrodes, uh,

84
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.500
that allow us to deliver current.

85
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.680
You have a bunch of wires I saw in a whole bunch of batteries.

86
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:35.990
So we take a set of electrodes.

87
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.050
One electrode is attached to my right temple and the other electrode is attached

88
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:46.420
by a different wire to my, uh, left arm.

89
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.480
We turn on the juice. Did it hurt?

90
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.820
It wasn't so much that I suddenly tasted metal in my mouth. It tasted,

91
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:58.580
it tasted like I had like the inside of an aluminum can. And then he's like,

92
00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:00.230
all right, try it again. I'm like, ah,

93
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.270
I'm not exactly expecting different results. So they, they start me out again,

94
00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:09.860
right at the really hard check 0.1, the thing blows up and then, um,

95
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.950
people start coming from all over the place and I feel like they must've put it

96
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:21.550
on an easy setting. Everything is just a little more straightforward.

97
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.180
It's more obvious who I should pick off first.

98
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.750
And I'm thinking to myself a little bit like, you know,

99
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:32.250
when is this going to get really hard again? And then the [inaudible], well,

100
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.180
you know, intern or whoever comes in and turns on the lights, she's like, okay,

101
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:38.310
you're done. I'm like, well wait, that's not,

102
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.550
that's not what I fully been here for like three minutes. She's like, no, no,

103
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.610
no, no. That was 20 minutes. I'm like, no, that's not true.

104
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.380
And I look up in the clocks of all shifted by 20 minutes and I swear to God it

105
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:50.011
was three minutes.

106
00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:54.000
Almost every person that we put this on says they get into what they call a

107
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:58.040
state of flow where they don't recognize that time has gone by.

108
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.320
<v 3>They're just boom, boom, boom, boom. And I was like,</v>

109
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:04.580
did you guys make it easier? They're like, no. Same, same, uh, level.

110
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.390
I'm like,

111
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.010
I think you guys made it easy when Sally did it with brain stimulation,

112
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.630
she performed at 100% accuracy. 100%.

113
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.030
I didn't leave anyone alive. And how, what was she before? Uh, I don't know,

114
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:23.930
but she wasn't very good at roughly three out of 20 the first time in 20 out of

115
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.580
20 in second. Yeah. So wait, so you're saying with just a little electricity,

116
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:33.380
she went from being like totally inept to like a trained killer? Well,

117
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.110
it's an n of one so we can't go too far.

118
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:39.650
But I mean this was just Sally's experience during this one demo.

119
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:41.180
So it's not like a controlled study,

120
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.420
but Mike has now used this device in a bunch of studies for the military.

121
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.380
For example,

122
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.220
you had one study with people looking at those grainy black and white radar

123
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:53.300
images trying to pick out, you know, what's an enemy vehicle and what isn't?

124
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.560
And if he puts this device on their head while they're trying to learn how to do

125
00:06:57.561 --> 00:07:02.510
that, we can double the rate of learning really well. How, I mean,

126
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:03.920
what is it doing? Okay,

127
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:07.580
so what I think is that early on when you are learning something,

128
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.880
Mike says that when you're trying to learn how to do something that's kind of

129
00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:13.340
tough. What's happening is that you're trying a bunch of different things.

130
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.660
You try all kinds of different ways to solve the problem and occasionally your

131
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:22.370
brain is stumbling across an ideal sequence of neurons.

132
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.090
Every so often as you're practicing, all of a sudden your brain is like, oh,

133
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:28.310
this then this, then this and this. Okay, that's it.

134
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.540
But then it struggles to find that again and it keeps messing up and whatever.

135
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.160
And if you look at an expert brain,

136
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:38.180
you'll actually see that preferred circuit dialed in.

137
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.280
Like they just do that over and over and over again. No more stumbling around.

138
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.510
And so what Mike does is he figures out where that circuit is and he gives it a

139
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:48.344
little extra

140
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.780
juice to an in essence prime the pump so that that expert circuit is more likely

141
00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:59.300
to fire and you're more likely to stumble into it.

142
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:02.300
And when you do stumble into it, you're more likely to stick with it.

143
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.870
That's right. That's how we think it works. But are you,

144
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.550
are you sure of what you're hitting?

145
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:11.390
I mean like you're putting electricity on the outside of people's heads.

146
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:16.391
So are you able to target just a small cluster of brain cells or is it a region

147
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:19.650
that you're hitting or like a thousand cells? What I'm bragging,

148
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.370
what I'm talking about is millions of cells. That's how, that's a lot. Yeah.

149
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.770
Is that precise enough to,

150
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.580
to target the place where a task is being done in a brain? If it's a million,

151
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.910
uh, in our work, yes. And Mike claims that even though it's a blunt tool, yeah,

152
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:40.250
this is not a scalpel. This is sledge hammer.

153
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.330
If you know the right group of neurons or region of the brain to target,

154
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.520
this can work with almost any task.

155
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.050
If you want to target a visual spatial learning,

156
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.910
for example, searching an image,

157
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.960
you'd put this on the right side of your head roughly near the temple,

158
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.120
but if you wanted to learn textual material,

159
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:03.210
you can put this on the left side of your head and it will have a similar

160
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:06.930
effect. If you wanted to learn textual here, be true. No,

161
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.820
I mean I'm, if I want to learn irregular verbs in French,

162
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.720
I get one of your things. I stick it in the part of my hair,

163
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.840
but as good as for grammar,

164
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.300
we haven't tested it in with learning foreign languages,

165
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:22.230
but if a native English speaker is learning a long English sentence,

166
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:24.510
they can recall it with greater fidelity.

167
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.380
If they have this on their head while they study those sentences and if you go

168
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:32.790
right parietal back over just behind your ear and up above your ear,

169
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.410
you can learn math better.

170
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.870
<v 4>We were all Kinda like, Eh, I don't know.</v>

171
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.410
But since Mike had his device there with them, should we try it? Sure,

172
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:44.900
I'm ready. We thought, no, let's try it and see for ourselves.

173
00:09:44.901 --> 00:09:48.740
Do you want to do it right? I mean,

174
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.900
I had Robert Actually pretended he has an appointment.

175
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.500
He left but me taking them to the team here, I don't do fear,

176
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.550
<v 5>right. Don't need to be seated for this or yes, you should be seated. All right,</v>

177
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.010
<v 3>stick around because we are going to put electricity right into the man's head</v>

178
00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:03.970
and I'm talking about Chad

190
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.680
<v 5>All right, so you've got here in front of me, you have two little circles.</v>

191
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.680
Electrodes is that these are, Yup. Red Wires and black wire.

192
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:08.420
So I get two of these on my head. One on your upper arm,

193
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.980
one on my upper arm

194
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.220
<v 4>for the demo call. My, uh, Mike showed me a bunch of stereograms. Alright,</v>

195
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.941
so what am I doing here?

196
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:19.360
I'm looking at a bunch of marbles and million of them in some kind of repeating

197
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.180
patterns. Like, you know, these things forever.

198
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.300
Like where are you staring at this two d picture of like, uh, I don't know,

199
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.250
the repeating pattern of marbles or something.

200
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.000
And you're supposed to unfocus your eyes and just the right way so that a three

201
00:11:31.001 --> 00:11:34.510
d picture will surmount merge from the background. Yeah. Excuse me.

202
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.140
We need make me, my eyes go batty. So the idea of this demo was like,

203
00:11:38.141 --> 00:11:42.880
let's see if I can train my eyes to figure out how to pull the three d picture

204
00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:43.220
out.

205
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.900
<v 5>You see it? I didn't get it. I ain't getting nothing.</v>

206
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.570
<v 4>I have never been good at these. I mean,</v>

207
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.990
I get headaches when I go to three d movies and it took me like 10 minutes to

208
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.100
one Ah,

209
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.790
<v 0>butterfly. There he is.</v>

210
00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.490
<v 4>Whoa, that's cool too. To see like just one. Wow. Look at this. All right,</v>

211
00:12:01.491 --> 00:12:06.200
so now you can juice me. Use this system. All right, I'm going to turn it on.

212
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.580
Okay. Okay. I don't feel anything yet. Oh yeah. Okay. There it is. Ah,

213
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:11.920
what is it feeling?

214
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.300
It feels like a bunch of mosquitoes are biting me in my temple. It's slough.

215
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.700
I could taste it now too,

216
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.460
<v 0>so people would get that, huh? All right, so now I'm gonna,</v>

217
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.680
I'm gonna look at the stereoscopic images one more time. Here we are.

218
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:24.730
We've got a green and pink

219
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.690
<v 4>that just became the world that suddenly a 3d globe just pops out of the</v>

220
00:12:31.671 --> 00:12:33.800
background. Okay, next one.

221
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.730
<v 0>All right. So now I'm looking at a big green grass</v>

222
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.560
<v 4>blades of grass repeating, repeating, repeating. Let's see. Well,</v>

223
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.260
swans, IC, swans, Origami, swans, 3d swans. Next one.

224
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.640
<v 0>Now I'm looking at a good sort of a trippy Paisley background and</v>

225
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.500
<v 4>Sandy 3d Bambi. Next one.</v>

226
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.330
<v 0>Right now we have flower background. Should have the yellow and pink flower.</v>

227
00:12:58.331 --> 00:12:59.500
Thailand background.

228
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.850
<v 4>Whoa. Boxes, boxes floating in space. Next. Whoa.</v>

229
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.930
A little ballerina doing a handstand on the balance beam. Robots.

230
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.230
Little Hershey's cases popping right now. Yes.

231
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.290
<v 0>They're coming out really fast.</v>

232
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.000
<v 4>[inaudible] big pretzel yeses. Awesome. Coiled snake.</v>

233
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.720
<v 0>Cool. Anyway, wow. That's the,</v>

234
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.630
that's what it feels like to get your brain juice stuff. Okay.

235
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.840
I definitely felt like I couldn't, you couldn't give them to me fast enough.

236
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:27.000
I was like, oh, it's like another one, another one, another one.

237
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.760
So maybe that's a flow state like you were describing. I don't know.

238
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.920
<v 4>I feel very, very awake. Okay.</v>

239
00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:38.460
So in the end I ended up doing something like 50 stereograms in a really short

240
00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:42.240
amount of time. Great. Wow. So I definitely think something was going on,

241
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.540
but I have to be honest. I mean I was skeptical.

242
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.200
You were skeptical even when you were flying free. Well, it's like it's,

243
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.160
I don't entirely trust the experience I had cause it could simply be like a

244
00:13:53.161 --> 00:13:57.820
placebo could be adrenaline. I Dunno. Yeah, I mean that's the thing. It just,

245
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.410
no matter what it just seems like the next flavor of new age.

246
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.520
Well, Hey, I started calling around.

247
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:06.821
<v 9>Uh,</v>

248
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:10.360
my name is Peter Reiner and I'm professor at the University of British Columbia.

249
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.080
<v 4>Cool. So, so Peter Reiner actually studies this whole field.</v>

250
00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:16.450
He looks at public perception and the quality of research.

251
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:19.210
And I just basically asked him, you know, is this for real?

252
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.450
Like if you have a healthy brain, you put a little electricity into it.

253
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.070
Has it been proven that that will enhance learning or whatever else they claim?

254
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.290
<v 9>Well,</v>

255
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.940
maybe the best way to answer that is that part of the reason that there's all

256
00:14:31.941 --> 00:14:36.650
this interest is that tdcs appears to be relatively effective.

257
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.580
<v 4>And he says this is based on a lot of different studies and a lot of different</v>

258
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:40.210
areas. The

259
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:45.210
<v 9>key to what I just said is relatively and so the caveat that I have to add is</v>

260
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:51.271
that pretty much all of the studies that have been done to date are relatively

261
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:52.410
small.

262
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:56.460
<v 4>He says it's early days and the studies have been done have only been done with</v>

263
00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:57.294
a few subjects,

264
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.690
<v 9>maybe 20 people, larger studies, 40 or 50</v>

265
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.920
<v 4>now, a lot of these studies do find a positive effect,</v>

266
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.900
but if you're a hard nose scientist,

267
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:09.580
you know those small sample sizes aren't enough to make a very big claim.

268
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.230
Even so sure

269
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.833
<v 3>the truth,</v>

270
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.490
the cats kind of already out of the bag because if you go on youtube,

271
00:15:17.491 --> 00:15:21.240
white flash really brief, really quick, that's cool.

272
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.680
You can find a surprisingly large number of videos of people experimenting with

273
00:15:25.681 --> 00:15:26.490
these devices.

274
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:31.230
<v 10>I instantly feel very good, very calm,</v>

275
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.040
very safe, not really worried about anything.

276
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.420
<v 3>A lot of the videos show you how to make your own course.</v>

277
00:15:37.421 --> 00:15:40.960
We'll start with the circuit diagram and you just go to radio shack and buy a

278
00:15:40.961 --> 00:15:41.890
few simple parts.

279
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.790
There's the battery that's going to be your nine volt and here's a few alligator

280
00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:47.440
clips. Since I don't have any solder with me,

281
00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:49.450
although I have a switch in the circuit.

282
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.020
I mean youtube just seems to be filled with people. Yeah,

283
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.170
<v 4>we're trying to Hotwire their own brain.</v>

284
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:59.150
So for the past year I've been wanting to increase my brain power since I have

285
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:01.880
probably below average a brain power compared to the old beetle.

286
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.970
<v 3>I want to study neurosciences, but as many of you,</v>

287
00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:08.520
I don't have the resources to go to this school right now.

288
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:13.530
So what I'd like to do is I like to use tdcs while I'm learning my vocabulary

289
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.131
lists. All right,

290
00:16:15.131 --> 00:16:19.240
so I want to give you an update on using tdcs to learn a foreign language.

291
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.560
People are using this for a whole range of thanksgiving,

292
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:24.980
how flexible the technique is. That's Nick Fitz. He works with Peter Reiner,

293
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:26.780
the guy we talked to earlier, and he says,

294
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.470
not only can you do a lot of different kinds of things with this device on top

295
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:32.420
of that, it's dirt cheap.

296
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.170
So let's say in the time that it takes me to listen to one of your episodes,

297
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.700
I could probably go to the store,

298
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.650
come back and build a tdcs device for around $20 for $20. Right.

299
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.060
And so I'm, as I said, I mean, is that something that makes you nervous? Um,

300
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.210
I'll say first. I think the DIY community is quite thoughtful,

301
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.930
but it does make me nervous.

302
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.530
But there are some people who are that report loss of consciousness after using

303
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:57.320
it. And there are people that are reporting feeling burns.

304
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.730
<v 4>There's actually one report of somebody going temporarily blind.</v>

305
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.140
This guy on youtube.

306
00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:09.030
So a young Asian kid I've been experimenting on where, where,

307
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:11.070
which places on my head would improve memory.

308
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.980
If he talks about how he spent a year kind of experimenting with it,

309
00:17:13.981 --> 00:17:17.070
he put it in one place and after about five minutes, um,

310
00:17:17.071 --> 00:17:19.830
I felt really like really angry and depressed,

311
00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:24.390
but in another place that's a gummy, a really high score on Lumosity.

312
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.600
And I have only been stimulating my brain for about five.

313
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.400
It's like he's playing Russian roulette with that thing. Oh yeah. Yeah.

314
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.020
Which brings up the larger point, you know,

315
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.940
that this devices kind of impossibly hard to regulate because a kid like this

316
00:17:35.941 --> 00:17:39.690
can put it anywhere he wants in his head and if he moves it just a couple of

317
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.600
inches browse, it could have a drastically different effects.

318
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.630
<v 9>And that's really what is, uh, a concern. Yeah.</v>

319
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.370
<v 4>Because according to Peter Reiner, while we might like think of the brain</v>

320
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.050
<v 0>as being a bunch of separate circuits that do separate tasks, really</v>

321
00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.160
<v 1>ecosystem, every part affects every other part in some way.</v>

322
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.600
<v 9>And when you put your electrodes on the head,</v>

323
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:09.160
you effect in theory a small area of the brain right under the electrodes.

324
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.160
But it's already been shown that that affects,

325
00:18:12.161 --> 00:18:16.180
can then multiply and spread throughout the nervous system.

326
00:18:16.181 --> 00:18:17.980
Even down to your spinal cord.

327
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.740
<v 1>I mean, there's a theory out there,</v>

328
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:24.150
it's called the zero sum theory of the brain that some people use as a framework

329
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:26.880
for thinking about all this, which is like, you know, one part goes up,

330
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:29.760
another part goes like, there's only so much juice in the brain.

331
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:33.660
So if you send juice one direction, there's less juice somewhere else.

332
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:38.580
So then if you are enhancing one part, you're by definition diminishing another.

333
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:39.863
Maybe

334
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.440
<v 0>to be honest, there was definitely an after effect.</v>

335
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.740
This is kind of why I ended up talking to Sally about this,

336
00:18:45.741 --> 00:18:49.640
why I got so interested in this piece in the first place is because of what

337
00:18:49.641 --> 00:18:51.860
happened to her after the sniper training.

338
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.920
So driving down from La to Carlsbad to go do this was an absolute nightmare.

339
00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:03.320
I hadn't driven in like a year cause I've been living in London where I just do

340
00:19:03.321 --> 00:19:07.220
public transportation, but on the way up, uh,

341
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.600
it's kind of like, I mean I hate to compare it to Mario Kart,

342
00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:13.760
but it's just this extremely pleasant experience.

343
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.410
I feel like I drove better that day than I ever drove before.

344
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:23.830
Like it was very obvious where I could pass people without irritating them and

345
00:19:24.891 --> 00:19:29.530
just, I dunno, it's a weird, it's a weird memory. But I think, um,

346
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.770
I had more fun driving that day than I ever did since.

347
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.310
And at some point she realized it wasn't just about her driving ability.

348
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.980
So I would say that, I mean,

349
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:44.030
I dunno how much I want to get into sort of in public on the radio about,

350
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.360
you know, being, I'm a bit anxious. I mean,

351
00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:49.860
I guess that's not particularly controversial. Uh,

352
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.420
probably all writers like are sort of riddled with anxiety, but you know,

353
00:19:53.421 --> 00:19:57.170
I have this constant struggle with all the little

354
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.920
angry gnomes in my head, you know,

355
00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:04.280
populating my head and telling me like all the things that I don't do right.

356
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.190
You know, all the things that I've done wrong that day.

357
00:20:07.191 --> 00:20:11.960
They just keep this incredibly like comprehensive tally of them. And then,

358
00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:15.230
you know, the ones who worry about the future. And then, you know,

359
00:20:15.231 --> 00:20:18.020
the ones who tell me I'm going to be living in a cardboard box in a year.

360
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.520
I mean, it's just like an amazing cacophony, but she says sitting in that car,

361
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.850
they were, they were just completely turned off. Um,

362
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.630
I think for a couple of days. And it was a really, you know, really,

363
00:20:29.631 --> 00:20:33.320
I'm sure for a couple of days, for a couple of days. And to tell you the truth,

364
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.580
it's kind of like everything just,

365
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.600
I was just this person that I hadn't experienced before and I thought maybe this

366
00:20:41.121 --> 00:20:44.990
is the actual sort of core person who I am when I'm not,

367
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.890
when all my baggage isn't just weighing on me.

368
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.580
<v 4>It was like somebody had a wiped,</v>

369
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:56.581
a really steamy window and I was just able to look at the world for what it was

370
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.660
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

371
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.660
<v 4>and I was curious whether like there's a connection there that like to be a good</v>

372
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
performer of some task that goes along with shutting down the parts of yourself

373
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:18.850
that say, I don't know, I don't sync, maybe I can't, maybe I shouldn't.

374
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:23.520
And that like there's actually a real connection between amping up one and

375
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.080
tamping down the other. I mean it makes sense cause you're taking,

376
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:29.390
giving one circuit more power. You might be taken away from other places. Yeah.

377
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.690
It's funny. I mean it does. I find this like, you know,

378
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.170
since you and I are just been on stage for our [inaudible],

379
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.160
one of the things I struggle with most during the performances is I'm sitting

380
00:21:40.161 --> 00:21:41.060
there, we're both sitting there,

381
00:21:41.061 --> 00:21:44.120
we've got our scripts and I have this box of buttons and I have to remember

382
00:21:44.121 --> 00:21:46.160
which buttons do what things and I,

383
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.310
there's like the musicians and it's figuring out where they come in and out and

384
00:21:49.311 --> 00:21:52.640
all of these things. They become competing voices. Yeah.

385
00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:56.450
They become these little chattering gnomes that Sally puts it in my head and I'm

386
00:21:56.451 --> 00:21:58.880
like, wait, wait, what does that, hey, okay, now when does that come in?

387
00:21:58.881 --> 00:22:02.780
Where are we? What? What's happening? Oh my God, you're messing this up, Jack.

388
00:22:02.781 --> 00:22:04.940
Come on. Oh, why did you keep doing it?

389
00:22:04.941 --> 00:22:07.880
And I get like kinda crazy sometimes during a show.

390
00:22:07.881 --> 00:22:12.530
I can't actually even focus on what you're saying. It's not a good feeling.

391
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.440
And then there are other times where something happens almost like commode and

392
00:22:16.441 --> 00:22:20.430
suddenly it's like right there. I know I'm right with you.

393
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.770
It's the easiest thing in the world to listen to what you're saying when respond

394
00:22:23.771 --> 00:22:28.650
instinctively and in the moment and they literally feel like different chemical

395
00:22:28.651 --> 00:22:32.520
modes or maybe electrical modes. You know what I mean? That's really,

396
00:22:32.521 --> 00:22:33.600
that's that I,

397
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.560
that's very interesting to me because I mean going back to the performance

398
00:22:37.561 --> 00:22:40.740
stuff, you can't really make it happen.

399
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.190
I mean I guess you could I suppose, but it doesn't feel that way.

400
00:22:44.191 --> 00:22:49.020
It feels like it's somehow feels like it's a gift, you know? Like,

401
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:54.030
Oh thank you universe. I feel really awake and present right now. Thank you.

402
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:58.710
What happens when it's an expectation, you know,

403
00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:01.650
what happened to where are the way in which we move through the world?

404
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:06.180
If we can just leave, we can create that on demand and order it up. Yeah,

405
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:06.931
I mean it's,

406
00:23:06.931 --> 00:23:11.931
I think the gift versus ordering it up probably has,

407
00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.750
that's pretty deep to me. I mean I don't,

408
00:23:14.751 --> 00:23:17.210
I feel like in a world where you order things up,

409
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.180
then you're in a world where you think you deserve things or you think you've

410
00:23:20.181 --> 00:23:23.570
earned them or you think other people haven't. I agree with that completely.

411
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.940
That's a, it's a word that's a world that's empty of true gratitude.

412
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.440
To tell you the truth. Um,

413
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.040
one of the really worrying things to me was afterward,

414
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:44.830
how, how much I craved doing it.

415
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.940
<v 0>It felt like a drug with no side effects. I mean,</v>

416
00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:54.050
I don't know if I'm going to get addicted to electricity.

417
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:55.760
Seems Unlikely

418
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.760
to get some man shoplifting batteries, some of that going on

419
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.490
in the supermarket corner and licking.

420
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.170
Thank you, sir. No problem. And thanks a lot to Sally [inaudible].

421
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:21.240
So time to say goodbye. Krulwich Rod, thanks for listening.

422
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.160
Okay.
