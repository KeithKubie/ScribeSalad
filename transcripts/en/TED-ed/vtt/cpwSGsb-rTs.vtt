00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.438
So you're stranded in a huge rainforest,
and you've eaten a poisonous mushroom.

00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:19.072
To save your life, you need the antidote
excreted by a certain species of frog.

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:23.734
Unfortunately, only the female 
of the species produces the antidote,

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:25.474
and to make matters worse,

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:30.395
the male and female occur in equal
numbers and look identical,

00:00:30.395 --> 00:00:32.519
with no way for you to tell them apart,

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.325
except that the male 
has a distinctive croak.

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:38.254
And it may just be your lucky day.

00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:41.350
To your left, you've spotted a frog
on a tree stump,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.469
but before you start running to it,

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.240
you're startled by the croak
of a male frog

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.367
coming from a clearing 
in the opposite direction.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.167
There, you see two frogs,

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:54.130
but you can't tell which one 
made the sound.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.249
You feel yourself starting 
to lose consciousness,

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.498
and realize you only have time to go
in one direction before you collapse.

00:01:02.498 --> 00:01:05.704
What are your chances of survival
if you head for the clearing

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:08.444
and lick both of the frogs there?

00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:10.633
What about if you go to the tree stump?

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.535
Which way should you go?

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:15.364
Press pause now
to calculate odds yourself.

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:16.336
3

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:17.242
2

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:18.041
1

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:20.646
If you chose to go to the clearing,
you're right,

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:24.159
but the hard part is correctly 
calculating your odds.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.503
There are two common incorrect ways
of solving this problem.

00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:30.140
Wrong answer number one:

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.622
Assuming there's a roughly equal
number of males and females,

00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:38.475
the probability of any one frog being
either sex is one in two,

00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:41.471
which is 0.5, or 50%.

00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:44.042
And since all frogs are independent
of each other,

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:49.557
the chance of any one of them being female
should still be 50% each time you choose.

00:01:49.557 --> 00:01:52.424
This logic actually is correct 
for the tree stump,

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.315
but not for the clearing.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:55.630
Wrong answer two:

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.986
First, you saw two frogs in the clearing.

00:01:57.986 --> 00:02:00.754
Now you've learned that at least
one of them is male,

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:03.142
but what are the chances that both are?

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:07.773
If the probability of each individual frog
being male is 0.5,

00:02:07.773 --> 00:02:11.665
then multiplying the two together
will give you 0.25,

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:14.785
which is one in four, or 25%.

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:19.257
So, you have a 75% chance 
of getting at least one female

00:02:19.257 --> 00:02:21.447
and receiving the antidote.

00:02:21.447 --> 00:02:23.316
So here's the right answer.

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:27.344
Going for the clearing gives you
a two in three chance of survival,

00:02:27.344 --> 00:02:29.950
or about 67%.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.590
If you're wondering how this 
could possibly be right,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.652
it's because of something called
conditional probability.

00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:37.509
Let's see how it unfolds.

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.439
When we first see the two frogs,

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.889
there are several possible combinations
of male and female.

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.539
If we write out the full list,

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.041
we have what mathematicians call
the sample space,

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:49.356
and as we can see,

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:53.993
out of the four possible combinations,
only one has two males.

00:02:53.993 --> 00:02:57.324
So why was the answer of 75% wrong?

00:02:57.324 --> 00:03:00.565
Because the croak gives 
us additional information.

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:03.223
As soon as we know 
that one of the frogs is male,

00:03:03.223 --> 00:03:06.262
that tells us there can't be 
a pair of females,

00:03:06.262 --> 00:03:10.095
which means we can eliminate
that possibility from the sample space,

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:12.953
leaving us with 
three possible combinations.

00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:15.557
Of them, one still has two males,

00:03:15.557 --> 00:03:21.317
giving us our two in three,
or 67% chance of getting a female.

00:03:21.317 --> 00:03:24.351
This is how conditional probability works.

00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:28.883
You start off with a large sample space
that includes every possibility.

00:03:28.883 --> 00:03:33.679
But every additional piece of information
allows you to eliminate possibilities,

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.252
shrinking the sample space

00:03:35.252 --> 00:03:39.509
and increasing the probability 
of getting a particular combination.

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:43.336
The point is that information
affects probability.

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:48.129
And conditional probability isn't just
the stuff of abstract mathematical games.

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.648
It pops up in the real world, as well.

00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:53.897
Computers and other devices use
conditional probability

00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:57.848
to detect likely errors in the strings
of 1's and 0's

00:03:57.848 --> 00:04:00.427
that all our data consists of.

00:04:00.427 --> 00:04:02.523
And in many of our own life decisions,

00:04:02.523 --> 00:04:06.314
we use information gained from 
past experience and our surroundings

00:04:06.314 --> 00:04:09.411
to narrow down our choices
to the best options

00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:10.757
so that maybe next time,

00:04:10.757 --> 00:04:14.297
we can avoid eating that poisonous 
mushroom in the first place.
