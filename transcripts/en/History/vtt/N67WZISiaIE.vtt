00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.970
- Also hard to deal with for you
when you were out there

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:02.870
was mice.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.100
You don't like them, do you?

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.200
No, I do not like mice.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.870
- I mean, not at all.
- No.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.500
Why don't we take a look
at the mice in Larry's house?

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.600
They were getting really bold.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.330
They were like, crawling
right out of my shelter,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.800
and just basically
flipping me the paw.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.730
And I'm like, you know what?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.700
I'm gonna get you.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.730
[bleep] mouse.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.430
If you stick around, I
will stab you in the throat

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.670
with my knife, and eat you.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.100
That [inaudible] definitely
given me a few calories.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.900
It's been fun making,
been fun improving upon.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.700
Boo-yah!

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.700
Lighter than a pancake, baby.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.700
[shouting] Mice are all gone.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.370
Yeah!

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.270
All right, you gotta tell
me-- what did they taste like?

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.330
Just-- like victory.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.170
[laughter]

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.930
Like victory?

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.930
Over, and over, and over again.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.330
All right, so take me--

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.500
the breaking point how to be the
bear spray in the house, right?

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.200
I mean, that's a-- that's
a pretty drastic measure,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.770
I would think.
How did you get there?

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.870
These mice keep crawling into
my grass bed, which was fine

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.970
if they were down by my feet.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.000
But they were right
under my head.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.300
And I actually thought--

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.770
I mean, there was a couple
of times I thought they were

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.930
crawling up, like,
going to get in my head,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.470
or gnaw on my ear, or something.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.670
And it was-- it was stressful.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
I didn't-- I didn't want that.
