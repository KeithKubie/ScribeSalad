00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.890
If you're watching this video then I'm pretty sure you love to travel, and you probably

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.890
love to eat.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.700
Is there any better combination than traveling
for food?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.190
Let me just quickly tell you who I am.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.760
My name is Mark Wiens, I am a full time travel
eater, and right now I'm on a round the world

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.880
trip for food with Star Alliance.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.039
I'm going to be traveling to nine different
cities, eating incredibly delicious local

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.609
food, and sharing all of the videos with you.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.240
Welcome to Mumbai!

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.920
This has to be one of the most fascinating
street sandwiches I've ever seen made.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.629
We have stopped by to order some mishkak.

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.020
Spicy sauce.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.559
This is the camel hump.

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
That was a very good flight.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.489
The view from the outside is spectacular.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.239
The aroma of that meat and just the expertise
of how he is grilling it.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.760
Right at the exit of the Metro.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.340
In Rome we say, cheese like it rains.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.340
Ok.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.719
We just made it to the airport.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:03.920
These shrimp are amazing.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.520
I don't know if anything could get better
right now in the world.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.920
Welcome to Lisbon.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.180
This is definitely the biggest prawn I've
ever seen in my life.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.650
Just check this!

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.260
Welcome to New York City!

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.220
It's almost breathtakingly beautiful.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.330
And by the way, welcome to Hong Kong.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:39.560
This has been one of my favorites since I
was a kid.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.080
We just landed back at home in Bangkok.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.420
That was the food trip of a lifetime.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.700
Thank you to Star Alliance and their round
the world trip tickets for making this happen.
