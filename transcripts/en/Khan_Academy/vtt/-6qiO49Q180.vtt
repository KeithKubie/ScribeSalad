00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.974
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.974 --> 00:00:04.098
is give ourselves some practice

00:00:04.098 --> 00:00:06.931
at critically looking at how folks

00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:09.090
manipulate polynomials.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.377
And the reason why this
is useful is because

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:13.676
it's useful to be able
to do this to yourself

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:15.731
as you manipulate polynomials to say wait,

00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:17.309
what did I exactly do there?

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.074
Or a lot of times if you're reading a math

00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:20.688
or a science book they're going to do

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:22.278
some proof or something like that,

00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:23.082
and they're gonna say oh well you know,

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:24.336
it's obviously from
this step to this step,

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:25.520
and you're gonna try to follow it and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.238
you're just like, well
does that make sense?

00:00:27.238 --> 00:00:29.502
So it's a really useful
muscle to be able to see

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:33.797
do these steps, or whoever
manipulated the polynomial,

00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:35.670
does it make sense to you?

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.504
And especially if it's
you, it's super useful

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.222
to be able to find if there are errors,

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:40.685
and to correct them, it'll just

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:43.065
give you a better critical
eye for this type of thing.

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:44.446
So let's just start with this one.

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:47.824
We have 4x minus three
times x minus two squared.

00:00:47.824 --> 00:00:50.262
And it looks like this
person over five steps

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:52.166
tries to expand it out.

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.165
And so what I encourage you to do,

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:54.685
pause the video right now,

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:56.520
and see if they did it correctly.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.646
And if they didn't do it correctly,

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:00.339
try to identify on what
step they messed up.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.798
All right, so assuming you had a go at it,

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:05.598
let's do this together.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.523
So as we go from the first expression to

00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:10.868
the second, to step one, what do they do?

00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:13.306
Well, they just expanded
out x minus two squared.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.464
X minus two squared is just x minus two

00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:18.217
times x minus two, they haven't done

00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:20.422
anything to the 4x minus three yet.

00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:22.245
Now what do they do in this step,

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:23.905
so that seems correct.

00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:26.436
So in step two, it looks
like they're just trying

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:28.456
to multiply x minus two times x minus two.

00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:31.846
So you have x times x,
which would be x squared.

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:34.620
You have x times negative two,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.406
which would be negative 2x.

00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:39.740
You have negative two times x,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.702
which would be negative 2x.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:44.174
Then you have negative
two times negative two,

00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:45.881
which would be positive four.

00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:48.147
So it looks like they
multiplied this out correctly,

00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:50.574
so step two we're still doing good.

00:01:50.574 --> 00:01:52.605
All right, now what do
they do in step three?

00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:54.010
And this whole time, 4x minus three,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.414
they haven't really touched it yet.

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:56.610
So they're just trying to simplify it,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.048
and all they did is they
added these two middle terms.

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:02.136
Minus negative 2x minus 2x is going to be

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:05.317
negative 4x, so this still,

00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:07.035
this still looks correct.

00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:08.776
The x squared didn't change,
the plus four didn't change,

00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:10.750
they just added these middle two terms.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.327
Now as we go to this next step four,

00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:15.880
well now they're trying to multiply

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.264
these two expressions,
so they're doing some

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:20.180
algebraic multiplication.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.968
So let's see if we can figure this out.

00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:24.301
So we have 4x times,

00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:25.485
let me do this in a new color,

00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:27.366
I'm getting bored of that magenta.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.885
All right, so we have,

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:34.041
we have 4x times x squared,

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:37.257
which is indeed 4x to the third power.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:40.565
Then you have 4x times negative 4x,

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:43.583
which is gonna be negative 16x squared,

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:44.965
so they did that right.

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.763
Then you have 4x times four,
which is going to be 16x,

00:02:47.763 --> 00:02:49.783
and they wrote that right over there.

00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:53.149
Then, you're going to have negative three

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.551
times x squared, which
is negative 3x squared,

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.234
we see that right over there.

00:02:58.234 --> 00:03:00.370
Then you're going to have negative three

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.924
times negative 4x, which is going to be

00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:05.594
positive 12x,

00:03:05.594 --> 00:03:08.926
and they wrote negative 12x.

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:11.584
So they forgot, they saw
a negative, negative,

00:03:11.584 --> 00:03:13.186
but they still put a negative there.

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:15.311
Negative three times negative 4x,

00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.470
a negative times a negative
is gonna be a positive.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.165
Positive 12x.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.512
So they made an error here, and then

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:23.402
they said negative three
times positive four,

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:25.852
which is indeed negative
12, so this part is right.

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.371
So the error, this thing should read

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:31.064
positive 12x.

00:03:31.064 --> 00:03:33.723
So the error they made is in step four.

00:03:33.723 --> 00:03:36.265
Step four is the error,
and then that ended up

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:38.088
giving them the wrong answer here,

00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:40.305
because they did a minus 12x instead of,

00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:42.429
if this was a negative
12x, then negative 12x

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.728
plus 16x got you this 4x.

00:03:44.728 --> 00:03:47.270
But we know it's supposed to be plus 12x.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.981
So it really should be 28.

00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:56.812
This should be 28x right over here.

00:03:56.812 --> 00:03:58.449
But they really messed up.

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.794
If you take that error,
they did this step right.

00:04:00.794 --> 00:04:03.011
But step four is where they
actually made the error.

00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:04.718
So let's keep going, let's give ourselves

00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:07.133
a little bit more practice at

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:10.720
looking at ways to manipulate polynomials

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.252
and see if they're valid.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.713
So here, this comes from an
exercise on Kahn Academy.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:17.929
Let's see which of these
are valid identities.

00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:20.634
Which of these are valid statements?

00:04:20.634 --> 00:04:23.757
So this first one, 2x plus y, times 4x,

00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:26.311
2x plus y times 4x minus 2y is

00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.110
all of this business right over here.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.049
Le'ts just multiply it out.

00:04:30.049 --> 00:04:35.029
2x times 4x is going to be 8x squared.

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:39.127
2x times negative 2y is going to be

00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:42.755
negative 4xy.

00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:46.120
And then, let me switch colors,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.279
y times 4x is going to be

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.886
plus 4xy.

00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:54.771
And then y times negative 2y

00:04:56.493 --> 00:05:01.119
is going to be minus 2y squared.

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:04.578
And so let's see, these
two, did I do that right?

00:05:04.578 --> 00:05:07.571
Let's see, 2x,

00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:09.976
times negative 2y is negative 4xy.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.559
And then I had 4x times y is positive 4xy.

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.013
So these two are gonna cancel out.

00:05:16.013 --> 00:05:19.507
So this is already, this is looking shady.

00:05:19.507 --> 00:05:21.794
So all we're left with is 8x squared

00:05:21.794 --> 00:05:24.255
minus 2y squared, if we factor a two out,

00:05:25.702 --> 00:05:27.486
it's going to be two times

00:05:27.486 --> 00:05:31.314
4x squared minus y squared.

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:35.991
So this is not a true
statement right over here.

00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:37.874
Now let's try this one.

00:05:39.828 --> 00:05:43.484
N plus two squared minus n
squared is equal to this.

00:05:43.484 --> 00:05:45.528
But what's n plus two squared?

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:48.000
That's going to be n squared plus

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.599
plus 4n, it's gonna be 2n plus 2n,

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.583
it's gonna be plus 4n plus four,

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:57.020
and then we're gonna
subtract out an n squared,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.818
these cancel, so we're
gonna have 4n plus four,

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:02.883
which is equal to four times n plus one.

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:05.205
So this one right over here works out.

00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:07.596
This is a true, I guess in
the language of this question,

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:10.046
it is a valid identity, or you could say

00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:12.484
it's a true statement,
this equation is true.

00:06:12.484 --> 00:06:14.898
And then we have this
last one right over here.

00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:17.255
And once again, let's see
if we can multiply it out.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:19.484
Let me go down here into the black space.

00:06:19.484 --> 00:06:23.942
So if I have a times 2a,
that's going to be 2a squared.

00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:26.798
And then a times one,

00:06:26.798 --> 00:06:29.676
is going to be plus a.

00:06:29.676 --> 00:06:33.530
And then if I have b times 2a,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.769
it's going to be plus 2ab,

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:39.810
and then finally if I have b times one,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.923
it's going to be plus b.

00:06:41.923 --> 00:06:45.394
And then out here, we are subtracting a b.

00:06:45.394 --> 00:06:47.507
So over here we're going to subtract a b.

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.293
These characters are going to cancel out.

00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:52.987
And then we're left with 2a squared

00:06:52.987 --> 00:06:55.285
plus a plus 2ab.

00:06:55.285 --> 00:06:56.783
And it looks like they factor out an a,

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:59.012
so let's see if we can
factor out an a ourselves.

00:06:59.012 --> 00:07:01.647
So if we factor out an a,
we're gonna be left with

00:07:01.647 --> 00:07:05.018
this first term is going to be 2a,

00:07:05.018 --> 00:07:07.360
this right over here,
if we factor out an a,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.227
is going to be plus one, and
this if we factor out an a

00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:12.332
is going to be 2b.

00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:16.197
And that's exactly what
they wrote over here,

00:07:16.197 --> 00:07:17.335
they just wrote it in a different order.

00:07:17.335 --> 00:07:21.946
A times 2a, plus 2b plus one.

00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:25.398
So this is legit.

00:07:25.398 --> 00:07:27.522
So hopefully that gave
us some good practice

00:07:27.522 --> 00:07:29.542
at critically looking at whether

00:07:29.542 --> 00:07:31.202
people are making valid statements.

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:32.398
And this is going to be the most useful

00:07:32.398 --> 00:07:35.035
to figure out if you are
making valid statements.

00:07:35.035 --> 00:07:37.053
All right, hopefully you enjoyed that.
