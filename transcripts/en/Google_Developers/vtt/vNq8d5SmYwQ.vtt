JENNY MURPHY: At Google I/O two
weeks ago, we had a lot of

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.940
important, exciting stuff happen
then, so we have a lot

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.190
of cool stuff to discuss.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.930
And I guess we'll start
with introductions.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.790
So joining me here in the new
Google+ platform office at our

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.160
studios, we have--

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.180
WOLFF DOBSON: Google Office
Hours Worldwide.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.760
JENNY MURPHY: Worldwide.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.300
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.290
Worldwide Studios.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.970
I'm Wolff Dobson.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.910
I'm a developer programs
engineer.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.400
I'm on Google+, mostly
on Hangouts.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.710
JENNY MURPHY: I'm Jenny Murphy,
developer programs

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.200
engineer on Google+, and I focus
mostly on Publisher and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.880
the new Google+ History API.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.913
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi.

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:42.280
I'm Timothy, also developer
advocate, or I guess, the only

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.910
developer advocate
at the table--

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.530
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, I
was going to say.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --working
on Google+.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.850
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And can I just
say I'm so excited to be here?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.610
JENNY MURPHY: It's good to
have you here, Timothy.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.635
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is fun!

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:55.390
Haven't done one of these.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.702
Look, we're on TV.

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:57.575
Hi, TV.

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:00.610
JENNY MURPHY: Hi everyone.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.540
But the introductions don't stop
there, because people are

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.970
joining us through the magic
of the internet.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.710
And in no particular order, if
you'd guys like to introduce

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.880
yourselves--

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.050
WOLFF DOBSON: I think
they should be in

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.500
display index order.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.410
JENNY MURPHY: The display
index is different for

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.670
different people, though.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.990
My display index order.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.390
So the order on our screen that
we're looking at right

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.350
now, starting with
you, Abraham.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.930
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: Hi, I'm
Abraham Williams.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.270
I have a new startup
called Advocate.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.510
I'm based in San Francisco, and
I've been exploring the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.160
History API a lot recently.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.470
And actually, on my YouTube
channel, there's an about an

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.840
hour presentation I gave at
I/O Hack last weekend if

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.900
anybody is interested
in learning more

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.300
about History API.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.680
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.905
And as far as my screen can
tell, next to you is Alan.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.390
ALAN: Hey, guys.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.200
JENNY MURPHY: Hi, Alan.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You're
muted, Alan.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.540
JENNY MURPHY: And then just
joining us, Charles.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.662
And a developer who just
commented on the post, and I

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:15.350
just invited--

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.940
I don't know how to--

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.890
I'm going to butcher
your name--

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.950
uh, Diwa?

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.220
DIWA: Yeah, hi.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.950
You got it right.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.050
JENNY MURPHY: Oh, awesome.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.460
WOLFF DOBSON: Cool.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.680
JENNY MURPHY: Continuing
along--

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.470
Fraser?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.940
FRASER CAIN: Hi, everybody.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.820
I'm Fraser Cain.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.300
I'm the publisher of
Universe Today.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.865
We'll be doing cool
hangouts with

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:34.870
telescopes here in Google+.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.000
JENNY MURPHY: And definitely
last but not least, Gerwin.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.700
GERWIN STURM: Yeah, hi.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.560
I am Gerwin from Austria.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.010
I'm developer of Hangout Comment
Tracker, and I'm

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.030
really looking forward
[INAUDIBLE] the new APIs, or

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.110
what I will do with them.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.360
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.060
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.150
Well, this show is about Google
I/O. It was a great

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.940
event, and a lot of you, a lot
of the people who are here

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.860
with us, actually attended the
event, or were involved in

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.810
some other way.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.610
So I thought we'd just get
started by going around and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.092
saying some of the things you
enjoyed about Google I/O, or

00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:12.470
that you thought were pretty
cool that happened there.

00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:18.130
CHARLES: It was nice to meet all
these people in real life,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.750
for a change--

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.456
to meet Alan and Abraham
and Gerwin and you.

00:03:25.168 --> 00:03:25.620
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.325
Or as we often call it, Hangout
In Real Life, or HIRL.

00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:32.600
It was great to HIRL with
a bunch of you.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.610
It was a great opportunity.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.280
It was a lot of time.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I like
the continued

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.820
verification of existence.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.800
We're all real.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.440
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.480
We're not just elaborate
Google automatons.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.752
Well, I am, but--

00:03:44.752 --> 00:03:46.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And the
developers, right?

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.320
There's real people out there
that are also not automatons--

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.640
automatons--

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.310
WOLFF DOBSON: I never thought
they were automatons.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.850
That was only you.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.270
CHARLES: Plus, I think if you
guys were automatons, you guys

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.960
would be more manga, anyways.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.690
WOLFF DOBSON: Hey, I'm working
on combing my hair up, and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.940
Jerry does have green hair,
and he has blue hair.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.710
So I think we're pretty
freaking manga.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.670
FRASER CAIN: Didn't you find
that a year of Google+ has

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.820
totally kind of changed your
interaction with the people

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.640
that use the Google products
and services?

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.769
I mean, a year ago, I didn't
know the names

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.740
of very many Googlers.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.240
Now I probably know the name
of 20 people in Google.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.370
So it's kind of thanks
to Google+, right?

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.990
You know, I've noticed that as
well, that when we were doing

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.020
developer relations prior to
Google+, it did seem like

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.860
there was a forum between
us and everyone.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.260
And we still have the forum,
and it has a great use, but

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.610
now we can sit face-to-face
with people and talk about

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.880
developer issues in a really
casual setting, much like we

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.180
do when we travel
and do events.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.200
And I think that's pretty cool,
to be able to do that so

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.800
casually and easily
whenever you want.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.330
FRASER CAIN: I'll bet you that's
going to be one of the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.510
unexpected benefits of this
for Google itself.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.690
You guys weren't anticipating
this, but just how much direct

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.190
connection that people in Google
are going to have with

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.890
the people who use Google
services at various levels,

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.610
and how much relationships are
actually happening inside the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.930
company and outside
the company.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.975
Mark my words.

00:05:13.975 --> 00:05:15.500
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You know,
right before we launched

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.730
Google+, we were dogfooding
hangouts all the time, for

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.877
example, and we had a pretty
good idea how big a deal this

00:05:21.877 --> 00:05:23.345
was going to be.

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:26.530
I mean, all it took were a
couple drunk hangouts on a

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.470
Friday night to realize that
this is more than just another

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.030
feature, right?

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.150
This was something that was
really going to let us connect

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.010
with people.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.280
The way it was allowing us to
connect with each other in

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.660
ways that we hadn't before.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.890
WOLFF DOBSON: I think Google+
had the unexpected thing, at

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.900
least to me, that it really
helped us, because of the

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.620
circles and everything, sorted
some of my Google+ followers

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.870
and people I'm following into
interest categories.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.015
So I now have a whole pile of
people who are comic artists,

00:05:58.015 --> 00:06:00.770
and a whole pile of people
who are astronomers,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.310
and things like that.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.350
And so I can follow these
people, and learn about them,

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.280
and join hangouts with people I
don't know, but who turn out

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.200
to be really cool, rather
than just hanging out

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.250
with people I know.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.610
Which I think is really fun.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.420
Like you guys.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.530
CHARLES: So in answer to your
question originally, what did

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.340
we all get out of I/O--

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.970
on the plane ride back,
I had all these ideas.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.090
I think the thing that I got
most of it was I went to a

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.870
bunch of different sessions on
a bunch of different APIs,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.060
ones that I had been using and
ones that I had been using

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.150
kind of peripherally, and I
spent a lot of time talking to

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.000
people, and I kind of got it
all mashed up in my head.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.270
And on the plane ride home, I
realized that I had a couple

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.040
clients who could really, really
use a bunch of tools

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.200
that I'd been thinking about,
that we'd be discussing.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.280
One in particular is a charity
that works in Zambia, and for

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.970
them, it's perfect fit of
connecting together all these

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.360
different free services
for them to reach

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.050
their audiences, and--

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.190
well, you guys know that we've
just gone through the

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.450
Kickstarter project,
so I'm all big on

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.860
raising funds right now.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.440
So it was amazing to just have
all of those ideas in my head,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.990
and I think being in a sling
and being unable to do much

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.710
actual detailed coding kept my
head up in the clouds and let

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.320
me see the big picture, which
was really, really handy.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.740
I think Google has got so many
different tools that if

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.240
they're mated properly,
you can make some

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.560
really powerful stuff.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.350
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.210
Well--

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: If I
could just say--

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.760
I love that kind of experience
coming out of something like

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.300
Google I/O. Because I think
a lot of people go for the

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.130
sessions, which are History
API, or Hangout Apps, or

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.170
whatever it is.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.800
But then it's that extra
experience you get at

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.600
something like Google I/O, when
everything sort of comes

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.750
together, or the conversations
that you have in the hallway,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.640
I think really make it.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.333
And one of the things that I
noticed at our Google+ booth

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:00.360
is that the office
hours were--

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.440
there were always people around
hanging out, asking

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.950
questions, and in those couches
we provide as well,

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.125
just sitting down, every once
in a while coding, or coming

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:10.000
up with new ideas for people.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.600
Is that what you all experienced
as well?

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.750
GERWIN: Yeah, definitely.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.107
So it's definitely a lot
different just to watch the

00:08:18.107 --> 00:08:21.000
sessions on YouTube compared
to actually being there and

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.990
being able to talk to people
after the sessions and

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.140
comparing what you
experienced.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.810
So it's just a totally different
feeling than just

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.799
attending the sessions.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:38.220
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, I ended up
spending the entire day in the

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.799
Sandbox just answering
questions.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:43.100
Like I wasn't supposed to be
the entire time, but I just

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.750
was having so much fun talking
to people that were there just

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.580
hanging out.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.100
And occasionally drawing
dinosaurs, but you know,

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.480
you've got to do that.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.660
JENNY MURPHY: At least
we have to do that.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.870
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, yeah, I was
going to say, G+ has to

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.540
have dinosaurs, or we don't
function correctly.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.438
FRASER CAIN: So if you guys are
interested, I think one of

00:08:57.438 --> 00:09:00.530
my astronomers has a live view
of this monster sunspot on the

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.500
sun right now.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.760
So if you want, we could invite
him and sort of be in

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.100
the side of the hangout.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.880
If you're interested.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.526
Or I might have to drop
out and work with him.

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:12.270
But I just want to give
you that option.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.870
JENNY MURPHY: Sure, that
that's definitely--

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.620
WOLFF DOBSON: I think having a
sunspot join our Hangout would

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.340
be pretty cool.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:17.820
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.670
I think we all agree
with that.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Like, Hangouts are
sort of an international

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.600
phenomenon, and apparently
also an intersolar

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.620
phenomenon as well.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.480
FRASER CAIN: All right.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.380
I'll give him the link,
but I'll tell

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.560
him to come in muted.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.270
So yeah.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.540
Cool.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.040
WOLFF DOBSON: We don't want
to hear a sunspot.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.600
We just want to see it.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.918
FRASER CAIN: I'll see
what I can do.

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:37.670
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.550
Awesome.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.550
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What's
next, Jenny?

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.700
JENNY MURPHY: Well,
what's next?

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.440
Funny you should have mentioned
the History API just

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.380
a moment before.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.100
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh my goodness!

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.780
Tell us more.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.080
JENNY MURPHY: Because I
thought I'd take this

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.600
opportunity to talk a little
bit about one of the big

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.810
features we launched at Google
I/O, which we launched as a

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:57.830
developer preview, which is
called the history API.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.780
So mind if I hold your
phone for a sec?

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.450
I just realized there's a prop
right here, Timothy's phone,

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.950
which he's never let
me hold before.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Don't
turn it on.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.560
JENNY MURPHY: I won't.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.260
It might explode.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.600
But there's a really cool
Google+ feature that a lot of

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.710
people have used.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.170
It's called Instant Upload.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.020
And as you're at events,
you take a lot of

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.650
photos of your adventure.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.430
And what's happening is in the
background, your phone is

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:30.820
uploading photos as you take
them to Google+, so that later

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.460
when you are back at home and
in the mood for sharing, you

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.655
have instantly accessible all
those photos that you took so

00:10:40.655 --> 00:10:43.710
that you can share them with
the right audiences.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.200
And the kind of philosophical
course of this is we've

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.160
separated out the burden of
creating the content and the

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.850
experiences you've had with the
sharing you do later on,

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.562
when you're in the right
mood for that.

00:10:56.562 --> 00:10:58.750
And we thought this is a really
cool feature, and we

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.100
got a lot of great feedback from
people, so we decided to

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.800
expand it to include not just
photographs, but everything

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.660
that happens, all of those
little moments that make up

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.460
people using applications--

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.370
applications that you write.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.400
And we also decided to open
it up to everyone.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.960
So it's an open API for
application developers.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.510
And that is the idea behind
the History API.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.600
It is just entering
developer preview.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.860
And what this means is that
it's not ready for release

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.480
into your products yet.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.570
So your application, you can't
release it with the History

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.260
API yet, but you can start
banging on the API today to

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.195
experiment with how you'd use
it, and really importantly to

00:11:45.195 --> 00:11:49.030
us, you can give us feedback for
how you want the API to be

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.490
when it's ready for production
release.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.550
So it's a really good
opportunity for you as

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.320
application developers to have
a lot of influence on the

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.240
direction of an API as
we're developing it.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.380
So we're very excited
about this.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:11.150
So I am going to show you a
quick demo of the History API

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.720
in action through the magic
of screen sharing.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.880
So let me switch the
cameras on over.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.160
Actually, that one's already
toggled to me.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.740
Switch screen sharing to my
web browser, make sure the

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.990
right window is up.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.440
So here we have it.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.090
This is a simple example
application that we created so

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.880
that you can start developing
right away.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.640
It has another feature that's
part of the same developer

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.710
preview called the sign-in
button, which is really useful

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.360
for authenticating users.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.270
It makes OAuth, which is a
really cool standard for

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.620
accessing data that your users
have created on Google, and it

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.740
makes the OAuth connection
process a whole lot easier.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.555
So go ahead and hit the button,
and authentication

00:13:12.555 --> 00:13:15.330
flow happens.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.380
And then this sample application
has a bunch of

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.470
different activity types which
are used to represent the

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.080
different kinds of moments an
application could create, like

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.680
an application you're writing,
into moments that the History

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.460
API can understand.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.670
So since it's just a bunch of
buttons in a panel, they

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.570
should probably be called push
button activity, but they're

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.910
just proxies for other kinds of

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.360
activities that could exist.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.880
For example, right here in the
upper right is a button called

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.250
check-in activity that simulates
checking in with a

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.710
location-aware application.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:54.400
So I hit the button, and I can
see API traffic down in the

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.200
little debugging panel.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.070
And what's happened here is
this little JavaScript

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.960
application has pretended to
communicate a moment about me

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.870
checking in to the Googleplex,
which is actually accurate,

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.310
because it's where I actually
happen to be right now.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.670
And we can see this moment
inserted into Google+.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.110
So switching tabs over,
I can see our

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.320
plus.google.com/history, which
is a feature made available to

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.650
you as part of the developer
preview.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.590
So you can see that the moments
have been inserted

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.910
into your Google+ history.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.020
Here I can see the moment that I
just inserted with a picture

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.820
of me at an earlier time
checking in at some other

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.070
place in the Googleplex.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.980
And the History API is about a
lot more than just check-ins.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.050
There's a whole bunch of
different kinds of moments

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.390
that your application
can create.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.560
You can use it to model moments
like when someone buys

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.410
something, like a book or a
movie or something like that,

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.220
when someone creates content,
like creates a blog post oa

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.970
tweet, when someone reviews a
restaurant, for example, and a

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.310
whole bunch of other stuff.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.730
And for now we even have kind of
a catch-all activity called

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.720
Add Activity, which you can use
when no other activity is

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.460
appropriate for the kind of
action your user is taking in

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.580
your application.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.290
And this list is one of
the big areas we're

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.080
interested in expanding.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.200
So as you develop and play
around with this API, please

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.490
tell us what kinds of other
activities you think would

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.290
make the API more useful to you
and your application and

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.540
your users.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:32.710
So--

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.470
ALAN: Jenny, what's the best
way to provide that kind of

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.990
feedback to you?

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.415
JENNY MURPHY: That's a
great question, Alan.

00:15:38.415 --> 00:15:40.670
I was just about to show you.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.560
So let me switch over to the
last half, where I'll show you

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.950
how to learn a little bit more
about the History API and how

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.590
to get feedback, like how to
tell us what kind of activity

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.840
types you might want.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.970
So before I dig into the places
where you can send us

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.440
feedback, let me just show
you how you can sign up.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.132
So if you go to developers.googl

00:16:01.132 --> 00:16:07.780
e.com/+/history, you'll find all
the documentation on the

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.440
History API.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.460
This includes that sample
project I just showed you.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.950
You can download it and
start modifying it.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.470
Reference docs, everything you
need to get started with the

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.740
developer preview.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.620
And the top link in the left
side menu is to sign up for

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.870
the preview.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.440
So what you'll do is you'll
come here and you'll enter

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.480
your email address into this
form, and we will add you to a

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.460
Google Group.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.260
Being a member of that Google
Group will give you access to

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.190
the ability to create projects
that use this API.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.740
It will allow you to submit
moments for your user, your

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.200
profile, and it will also
give you access to that

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.480
plus.google.com/history
beta UI I showed you

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.020
just a moment ago.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.880
Once you're signed up, you can
download one of the projects

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.000
like the one I just demoed to
you and learn a whole bunch of

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.250
details about the API and the
different kinds of moments you

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.069
can send on our reference
docs.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:14.880
And down at the bottom of our
reference docs is instructions

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.069
on how to request a new
type of moment.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.050
We're using our issue
tracker for this--

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.760
and this is the same place
where you would submit

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.450
feedback on any other changes
or ideas you have for the

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.959
History API.

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:31.980
So you just click on over to
that and create a new issue,

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.620
and this is how you
would go ahead and

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.850
send us that feedback.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.960
And that is History
API in a nutshell.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.170
So let me kill the screen
sharing so we can

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.420
discuss it a bit.

00:17:46.436 --> 00:17:48.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Do you all
have questions about the

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.590
History API?

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.370
Have you started using the
History API for anything in

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.620
particular?

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.930
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: Well at I/O
Hack last weekend after Google

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.160
I/O, it was [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.350
sponsored by the GDGSF.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.260
The weekend project I did there
was actually doing a

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:13.140
little app engine aggregator
that initially called in

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:19.890
GitHub activity, I Can Has
Cheezburger activity, Twitter

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.420
activity, and something else,
and it pushed that all onto

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.960
the History API.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.230
Actually, it turned
out pretty cool.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.610
I'm working on open
sourcing it.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.630
I have to make it so
that secrets aren't

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:33.360
hard-coded and whatnot.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.130
But it was pretty fun.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.790
There was a couple of issues
like there was

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.270
conflicts with scopes--

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.980
you couldn't use any other
scopes with the History scope,

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.980
and so that kind of threw
a wrench in some of the

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.280
debugging, because if you wanted
to access somebody's

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.320
email address, then you couldn't
do that unless you

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.690
had them authorized twice.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.150
But other than that, actually,
the developer experience was

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.830
pretty nice.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.020
It was a little difficult
explaining it to some people,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.010
because they'd be like, "so if I
put all my history in there,

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.870
then what can I do with it?" And
I'd be like, well, it's a

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.410
preview, so give Google
a little more time.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.625
But other than that, it
was a lot of fun.

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:17.875
WOLFF DOBSON: We're working
on that part.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.710
JENNY MURPHY: This is another
area where feedback from you

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.000
as you develop your
application is

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.160
really useful to us.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.660
What are your visions for what
we can do with all that

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.480
information that's been loaded
into the history?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.380
FRASER CAIN: Are people seeing
this as a way to get around

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:40.110
the no write access on the API,
to be able to queue up

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.520
things that they would want to
be able to then bring into

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.210
their feed?

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.140
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's important
not to think of this as a way

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.200
to get around it, but maybe
a better way to

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.420
do it, in most cases.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.240
The problem with sort of a
write API is that then

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.930
developers might just push a
whole bunch of data into your

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.480
stream, and that's not really
good for the user that's

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.610
apparently producing that
content or the users that are

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.770
reading that content.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.900
But with History, you can put
all sorts of data into this

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.990
private area, and then the user
can keep that just for

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.760
themselves, which you couldn't
get with just a basic write

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.200
API, and then they get to choose
what they do want to

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.630
share, and with who.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.110
Which is a very Google+-y
way to do things.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.550
It's that natural sharing that
we've been going on about for

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.020
a year now, where there's some
things I want to share with my

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.435
family, and some things I want
to share with my friends, and

00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:30.110
there's some things I just
want to keep for myself.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:33.410
FRASER CAIN: Right.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.070
So you see it as a sort of--

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.050
over time, there will be a whole
bunch of these apps that

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.390
I will be connecting up
into the History API.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.470
They will be dropping things
like photographs, videos, or

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.320
other pieces of data, songs I've
listened to, whatever,

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.050
and then I'll be able control
which of those actually get

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.130
pushed down into the feed, as
opposed to another site,

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.600
perhaps, that does it in a very
invasive, creepy way.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.125
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I think that
would be a way to put it, yes.

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.210
FRASER CAIN: That
would be ideal.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.800
Yeah.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.060
Perfect.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, before we
get to the next question, I

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:11.030
just want to take a moment to
ask the sun, how are you?

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.320
FRASER CAIN: So this is so
this is Chris Ridgeway,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.440
who's-- you're in Indiana,
right, Chris?

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.710
CHRIS: Right.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.395
FRASER CAIN: And so this is
actually a monster sunspot

00:21:20.395 --> 00:21:25.330
that's currently on
the sun right now.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.260
Man, what's its number?

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.350
A--

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.800
CHRIS: AR1520.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.840
FRASER CAIN: AR1520, which is
actually one of the largest

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.280
sunspots that's been on the
surface of the sun in a couple

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.300
of years now.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:39.410
And it's actually just rotating
to perhaps shoot a

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.520
flare or two off at the earth.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.170
So we might get some auroras at
pretty southern latitudes.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, well, let's
keep an eye on that!

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.370
WOLFF DOBSON: If it happens to
do that during the hangout,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.185
that would be pretty cool.

00:21:48.185 --> 00:21:49.575
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That
would be OK.

00:21:49.575 --> 00:21:50.990
FRASER CAIN: Yeah,
unfortunately, I don't think

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.510
Chris has the right filters
on his scope to be

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.650
able to detect it.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:59.580
You'd need an x-ray
telescope working.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm learning
so much just by staring at

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:02.900
these blurry spots.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.750
Why do they appear blurry?

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.050
Can I just ask that one
astronomy question of you?

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.095
FRASER CAIN: Why do the sunspots
appear blurry?

00:22:11.095 --> 00:22:17.780
Well, you're seeing the sun
through the atmosphere, and

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.890
you're seeing the atmosphere
kind of

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.430
wobbling back and forth.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.080
And so that's why you're seeing
things kind of blurred.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.066
It's video of the sun seen
through the atmosphere, and

00:22:27.066 --> 00:22:29.940
the atmosphere distorts
the sun.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.710
The sunspots themselves are
actually-- they're still

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:37.460
super-hot, they're still 5000
degrees Kelvin, but they're a

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.340
little cooler than the rest
of the sun, and that's why

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.720
they're are a little
bit darker.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.320
And they're actually the points
of the solar atmosphere

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.890
where the magnetic field lines
from inside the sun are poking

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.260
outside of the sun, and so
usually there's matched pairs

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.870
where these magnetic field lines
are piercing the surface

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.080
of the sun and coming
back down.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.360
And what happens is these lines
will get all twisted up

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.840
and tangled, and then they kind
of snap, and that's when

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.890
we get these flares that come
off the surface of the sun.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well,
OK, then.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.240
FRASER CAIN: There you go.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.165
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you so
much for that explanation.

00:23:08.165 --> 00:23:10.130
I really appreciate it.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.880
ALAN: I think it's the first
time I've ever had that

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.160
properly explained to me.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.620
FRASER CAIN: So this is what
we do every Sunday night.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.025
This is our virtual star party,
so I thought I'd give

00:23:18.025 --> 00:23:18.400
you guys a--

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.750
WOLFF DOBSON: No, this
is totally awesome.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:24.690
We should invite the sun
to all of our Hangouts.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:25.455
FRASER CAIN: Well, sometimes
it has to

00:23:25.455 --> 00:23:27.570
be the moon or Saturn.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I would be
fine with a different

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.760
celestial body every week.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.820
WOLFF DOBSON: Not
Pluto, though.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.290
That guy has fallen off.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.920
JENNY MURPHY: We'd need a really
powerful [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, if we're
going to accept the moon, we

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.470
have to accept Pluto every
once in a while.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.190
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.820
He used to be cool--

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.900
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: I think
this is a feature

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.586
request for Google Fx.

00:23:43.586 --> 00:23:46.080
WOLFF DOBSON: Is to add Pluto?

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.080
We need to have a telescope
strong enough

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.510
to see Pluto clearly.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.762
We'll work on that.

00:23:51.762 --> 00:23:54.530
FRASER CAIN: We could do that.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:54.720
WOLFF DOBSON: All right.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.860
So before we move onto the
next thing, any other

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.890
questions and comments about
the History API?

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.030
CHARLES: Yeah, I've got
two quick questions.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.010
The first is kind of
directed at Wolff.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:09.050
During the code lab there, we
were having some problems

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.330
getting History working
with Hangouts.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.260
Is there any further word
on that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.780
WOLFF DOBSON: The issue that
Abraham was talking about

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.130
earlier was with the scopes, the
History scope not getting

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.780
along with the other scopes.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:29.300
That's a broad problem with
all the Hangout--

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.590
Hangout scopes are just other
scopes, so that was the

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.940
disagreement that was
happening there.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.630
So I think when that issue's
cleared up, the Hangouts will

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:36.430
get resolved as well.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.270
I don't know what the
ETA is on that.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.730
JENNY MURPHY: It's one of our
top priorities right now, so.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.870
WOLFF DOBSON: That's
what I'm saying.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:49.510
So yeah, it was a specific case
of a generic problem.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.310
CHARLES: OK.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.430
The second is a question that
I've been asked a couple of

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.110
times now--

00:24:54.110 --> 00:25:01.022
if pages will be able to add to
their own history, and will

00:25:01.022 --> 00:25:03.410
there be a way to do that as
part of the developer preview?

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.946
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It is not
available now, and the preview

00:25:07.946 --> 00:25:12.331
is on right now, so I don't
think you'd expect that any

00:25:12.331 --> 00:25:14.705
time terribly soon.

00:25:14.705 --> 00:25:18.310
But yeah, it's a question that
was asked at Google I/O, and

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.760
we've been thinking about
it, but we don't have an

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.630
answer right now.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.330
CHARLES: That would be really
useful to have.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.880
FRASER CAIN: Do you have any
plans for any differences

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.160
between the history
between personal

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.695
pages and brand pages?

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I think
that's sort of the same

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.890
question, and at the end of the
day, where it is right now

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.949
is Google+ History is available
for profiles, and

00:25:40.949 --> 00:25:43.400
it's not available for
Google+ pages.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.390
And there's a number of both
technical and conceptual

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.970
issues to sort out before we
would make any other change

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.504
there, and as I understand it,
the product team doesn't have

00:25:54.504 --> 00:25:55.754
anything to announce yet.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.850
JENNY MURPHY: So before we move
on to the next thing,

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.340
does anyone have any
other comments or

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.590
questions about history?

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:10.570
Great.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.100
OK.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What's
the next thing?

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.340
JENNY MURPHY: Well,
the next thing--

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.860
I see that Diwa has been
patiently waiting.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.770
You commented on the
announcement post mentioning

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.915
you had a question, which we'll
do our best to answer.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.080
DIWA: Well, you guys
seem so advanced.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.350
I'm just a newbie web programmer
probably boring you

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.540
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.780
JENNY MURPHY: Well, what's
your question?

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.290
DIWA: Can you hear me?

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.760
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, we can
hear you loud and clear.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.650
DIWA: So I'm just starting
out with my web

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.260
app, which uses Google+.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.550
And one of the things I'm trying
to figure out is, is

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:52.370
there a difference in using the
Google's own client for

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.430
Ruby versus Omnia?

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.430
I'm not sure what the
difference is.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.680
JENNY MURPHY: I'm not all that
familiar with Omnia.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.990
But we produce client libraries
for several

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:16.720
languages that we strongly
recommend you use, because we

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.320
have a lot more control over
them, so we can put more

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.660
effort into making sure that
they are very compatible with

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.580
our APIs, especially as our
APIs change and new

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.000
features come out.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.880
Which could, for example,
provide performance

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.410
enhancements, integrate that
into our API client libraries

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.510
much faster than a lot
of third parties

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.630
might be able to.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.570
So all that being said, all of
our APIs are restful web

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.170
services and use other internet
standards, like

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.420
OAuthentication.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.200
And that means that you can use
the endpoints directly if

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.890
you wish, if you have a strong
reason to, or if there's

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.220
another client library that just
makes more sense for your

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.850
application for whatever
reason-- maybe it integrates

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.750
better with some other
frameworks you use, or

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.300
something like that-- you
are welcome to go

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.770
ahead and use them.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.490
Just be aware that they may not
be as performant, they may

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.710
not take advantage of all the
advanced features we have,

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.490
like for example etags,
or they may not

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.440
respect cache headers.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.580
And also, it's a little bit
more difficult for us to

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.140
support you if you're using a
client library that we're not

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.700
as familiar with.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.050
So I would take a look at the
features of both, and just see

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.300
the one that's better for
your application.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.850
And if in doubt, use
our library,

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:29.720
especially the Ruby one.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.250
It's really cool.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.940
Right, Wolff?

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.490
WOLFF DOBSON: Definitely.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.450
I like the Ruby library.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:38.350
I'm not just a developer.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.160
I'm also a client.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.480
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.040
Wolff and I both have
spent some time

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.760
in that client library.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.700
DIWA: Thanks.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.230
The second question I had is
that if I'm trying to store

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.380
the refresh tokens in my local
database, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.660
decided which would be better to
index it by, or would they

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.630
email the user or the Google+
handle or the ID.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.560
Do you guys have any
input on that?

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.240
JENNY MURPHY: That's another
really good question.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.750
What is the unique identifier
of the person?

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.580
And we recommend that you use
the numeric profile ID.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.070
WOLFF DOBSON: Although you
should not assume that it will

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:21.380
stay a 20-digit number or
whatever it is right now.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.580
That is, the IDs are strings,
and you should

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.230
treat them as strings.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.600
JENNY MURPHY: Very specifically,
you'll notice

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.590
that the current numeric ID is
just slightly too large to fit

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.150
in a lot of integer
representations, so it may

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.890
unexpectedly overflow those
representations today.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.050
So treat it as a string, please,
an opaque string.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:40.341
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:42.958
Absolutely as a string.

00:29:42.958 --> 00:29:44.330
DIWA: Thanks.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.090
JENNY MURPHY: You're welcome.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.340
Those are some great
questions.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.040
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.020
So let's talk about Hangouts.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:30:00.600
So we were featuring a whole new
set of apps that came out

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.880
near or around I/O. The ones we
talked about in the session

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.100
with the Google Art project,
which we're

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.680
really excited about--

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.060
it's all of these beautiful,
high-res scans

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.910
of worldwide art--

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.140
famous paintings, nearly famous
paintings, paintings

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.190
that should be famous,
sculpture, all that stuff, all

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.760
in a way that you can actually
hunt through our database,

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.070
share it with friends, and you
can go on virtual tours with

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.840
each other.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.800
So you really have a shared
museum experience while you're

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.415
in a hangout.

00:30:36.415 --> 00:30:39.210
And we're looking forward to
people coming up with fun

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.460
things to do with that.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.810
I had a lot of fun coming up
with amusing keywords to send

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.310
into it to see what I
can come up with.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.650
I particularly liked--

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.030
"Pirate Isle" turns out to have
a really cool bunch of

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:56.880
pirates left over from some
old painting, which

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.970
I thought was neat.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.620
But some of the detail on some
of the scans is ridiculous.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.980
You can get all the way in and
see individual brushstrokes.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.550
And with the hangout
functionally, we actually have

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:12.050
the ability to drag other people
into that same level of

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.190
detail and look at the
same pieces of

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.260
information at the same time.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.440
Really excited about it.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.600
We also had "Story Before Bed,"
which is great if you're

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.290
talking to kids.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:26.930
And one of my favorites is the
mini-clip 8-Ball Pool, which

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.590
turns out to be really fun.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:32.610
We got together and played a
whole bunch of games right

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:37.020
before it launched, and we had a
lot of people playing all at

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.720
the same time.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.620
And one of the things that was
neat is that the audio from

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.930
the game was actually leaking
into the Hangout, so it sort

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.450
of felt like you were actually
in a pool hall.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.143
You could hear all the balls
clicking against each other

00:31:45.143 --> 00:31:45.970
and everything.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.820
It was an unexpected benefit
that we really liked.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.730
It's a very tight game.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:51.310
It's a lot of fun.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.730
You should try it.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:32:01.360
And we also have a couple other
apps, like Symphonical

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.780
and Panoramio.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.860
There was a lot of
excitement--

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.945
we actually our partners there,
Goko, who had Dominion

00:32:09.945 --> 00:32:10.800
in a hangout.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.630
And those of you who are gamers
know that Dominion is a

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:17.210
very popular card game.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:20.800
Maybe a little nerdy, but.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.680
But it's an amazingly fun game,
and we're really looking

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.510
forward to seeing that out.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.530
But it was playable I/O, and
there's a screen shot.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:32.570
It was reshared widely.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.650
It was neat.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:35.210
It's cool.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.772
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That
integration was

00:32:35.772 --> 00:32:37.220
really neat to see.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.330
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:45.950
They have a lot of fun little
details, like when you buy

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.050
certain things, they actually
have overlays that appear on

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:48.930
you while you're doing it.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.220
So if you buy gold, you
get little gold

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.250
coins over your eyes.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.770
If you buy Jack-of-all-trades,
you get this big hat and

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:55.500
everything.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.790
And the funny thing about that
is, not only is it fun just to

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.650
see the things, but it's
actually really useful.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.070
Because you can kind of, while
people are playing, especially

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.363
if you turn the animation speed
up because you know how

00:33:05.363 --> 00:33:07.330
to play the game, you actually
track people by what they're

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.020
buying by looking at their
faces as they're playing.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.760
Really fun.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.960
And we had our code lab, and
the code lab is neat.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.130
Some of you were there.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:25.720
It addressed the thing that I
felt was very important about

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.620
when you're watching, like,
space fiction, which is that

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.240
whenever the two ships kind of
arrive in space and one of

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.580
them says, "Onscreen!" and
it shows the other guy--

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.180
they're in a hangout at
that very minute.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.610
They're actually talking
to each other.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:46.650
And so I wanted to have people
build the software that you

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.020
would need on a bridge of a ship
to have everybody talk to

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:49.370
each other.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:53.120
So that was the goal.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:53.910
It's neat.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.350
We're hopefully going to get
it up for everybody at some

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.600
point in the future.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.400
So yeah.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.610
That was Hangouts at I/O.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:05.860
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Do we
have questions,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.530
comments about that?

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.449
WOLFF DOBSON: Questions,
comments from

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:14.699
our friends in Hangouts?

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:19.989
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All questions
on Hangouts have

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:21.489
already been addressed.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:24.920
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, a lot
of them were there.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.139
We answered a lot
of questions.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:29.940
ALAN: I'm still amazed
by the sunspot.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.750
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, it's
pretty awesome.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.570
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, that was
definitely an accomplishment

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.889
[INAUDIBLE], having been in a
Hangout with a celestial body.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:39.730
WOLFF DOBSON: I was going
to say, with a star.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:40.739
JENNY MURPHY: With a star.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.280
It's a really big thing
to have at a Hangout.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.170
ALAN: A real star.

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:47.659
I think I need to save this
moment to my History.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:49.730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
full circle.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.000
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.400
Well, we have a few moments
left, so I thought I'd address

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.080
some of the questions that I'm
seeing on the comments thread.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.790
So Sid asks, "Is there any
desire for History to work

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:05.170
with Gmail in the future?

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.410
We already have Google
Account Reports.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:11.230
What is the anticipated
integration going to look

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.470
like?"

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:17.180
And this is an example of some
of the constant feedback we're

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.580
interested in hearing.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.710
So in addition to the feedback
about how you as a developer

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.360
would like to integrate with the
History API, we would also

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.180
very much like to hear how you
think we should use the

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.500
history API internally to
communicate between other

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.560
different applications that
you use at Google.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.830
So just tell us what you
think it would be like,

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.490
and just let us know.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.430
If you were here you could tell
us in person right now,

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.800
but maybe next time.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: + mentions and
forum comments are a great way

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.400
to get that information to us.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.350
We'll see that.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:50.760
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.080
Let me look at the thread.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.560
I don't see any other questions
that are that

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.440
developer-y on the
thread right now.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.100
So does anybody have any final
thoughts before we wrap it up

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.870
for the week?

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.700
FRASER CAIN: I've got a couple
of quick questions, one, I

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.155
guess, for Gerwin, or for
Gerwin's sake, which is, right

00:36:11.155 --> 00:36:15.320
now Gerwin's comment tracker
doesn't work with events.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:15.770
And so--

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:16.740
GERWIN: Oh, it does now.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:17.320
FRASER CAIN: It does now?

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:17.880
Never mind.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.770
It does now.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.520
WOLFF DOBSON: Gerwin's
all over that.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.080
FRASER CAIN: OK.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.480
And then, I've been getting a
lot of people complaining from

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.550
other countries, certain
European countries, that they

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.600
can't partake in our
live events.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.145
Any sort of information
I can give them?

00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:43.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you're asking
about release timelines

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.990
globally for products
features.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.920
FRASER CAIN: No.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.810
People in Germany can't access
Hangouts on Air.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.540
That's what I said, isn't it?

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.040
I don't know.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.340
Nobody at this table,
I don't--

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.260
unless, you guys correct me--

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.280
knows when those things
might be launched.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:01.610
WOLFF DOBSON: "I don't
know" is the correct

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.020
answer for this question.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: In general,
we, especially as DevRel,

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.230
don't comment on future
releases.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.540
And so the point at which
Product is ready to announce

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.560
anything is when they'll
let us know.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.875
And of course, we understand
that that's a concern, and

00:37:15.875 --> 00:37:18.690
have communicated that
to the team.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:19.560
FRASER CAIN: No workarounds?

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.810
All right.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.700
ALAN: My big question I asked
when I was noticed there is

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:32.760
the History, the moment seemed
really great for HIRL for us

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.340
in our app.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:39.010
Because it's a gaming app, we
want to screen capture moments

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.120
inside the Hangout.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.630
So we could use HTML5 to grab
most of the DOM, but we can't

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.880
grab the video or the thumbnail
or the film strip,

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.710
which is really the key.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.450
And for us, it's the moment
where somebody really blows a

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.370
role, or somebody really
succeeds [INAUDIBLE]--

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.340
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, you want
the reaction face.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.000
ALAN: Yeah.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.910
And we want that stuff to get
caught, because you can't

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.310
catch that manually.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:03.900
But those are the
moments, right?

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.060
Those are the moments.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.350
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.820
That's excellent feedback.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.820
Again, that's a future-looking
sort of thing.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:17.720
But yeah, capturing moments
in Hangouts--

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.180
that would be cool.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:18.430
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.000
Especially the [INAUDIBLE]
moment.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.870
That would be pretty cool.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:25.980
WOLFF DOBSON: In the foosball
game that one of the agencies

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.850
made, they had, every time
somebody scored, they actually

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:31.780
popped up an overlay that was
the person who had just been

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:37.380
scored on, so you could see
their face going, "aw!" Which

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.900
was, again, surprisingly fun.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.830
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: You could
almost build that in

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.800
automatically, like roller
coasters, when you go past a

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.950
certain point on the roller
coaster and it catches a

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.400
picture of everybody--

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.700
every time a bad die
rolls, you just

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:49.840
automatically get a picture.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:55.750
You begin screenshotting as
soon as that happens.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.010
ALAN: Yeah.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.530
Most games could

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.845
programmatically predict the moments.

00:38:59.845 --> 00:39:00.400
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.800
When all the sad faces
are going to happen.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.190
WOLFF DOBSON: Absolutely.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.035
It has to watch the chat
and everything.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:08.110
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.500
That's a great idea.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:14.150
WOLFF DOBSON: Actually, many
years ago, there was an MIT

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:17.600
Media Lab project where they had
a thing that would capture

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.040
30 seconds of video whenever
your heart rate went up.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.570
And so the example video they
had was this woman hunched

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.570
over this computer, and this
guy comes up behind her and

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:29.650
goes, "Boo!" And you
can see the video

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.470
of her looking surprised.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.876
JENNY MURPHY: Pretty cool.

00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:36.940
The possibilities are endless
with biometric integration

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.080
into hangouts and History.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.065
FRASER CAIN: I had one more
question, but I get the

00:39:41.065 --> 00:39:43.260
feeling that all my questions
were answered by all the

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.940
people that were actually
at I/O.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.380
ALAN: Next period you've
got to come to I/O.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.910
FRASER CAIN: Yeah, clearly.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:53.500
But like right now, I'm only
able to run one hangout app at

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.480
a time, right?

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.110
WOLFF DOBSON: That's
not entirely true.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.130
You can run an extension in a
hangout app at the same time.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:01.830
FRASER CAIN: Yes, yes.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.500
One of each.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.030
Is there any plans to figure
out a way that I

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.990
could not do that?

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.540
Or do more?

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.690
How can I have the lower third
and the comment tracker?

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:12.810
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.072
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:40:15.072 --> 00:40:16.992
The answer to that is that--

00:40:16.992 --> 00:40:18.760
I just lost my microphone.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.950
The answer is, I'm
so surprised my

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.080
microphone fell out.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.350
JENNY MURPHY: Unfortunately
we're running out of time, so

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.150
we'll answer this
pretty briefly.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.310
Again, this is a
future feature.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:31.200
We can't really talk a lot, or
we can't really comment on it,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.590
because we don't know.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:37.280
FRASER CAIN: You're aware it's
an issue that multiple apps

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.375
and extensions at the same time
will create a very rich

00:40:40.375 --> 00:40:42.360
video experience?

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.650
JENNY MURPHY: Exactly.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:44.170
WOLFF DOBSON: Multiple
extensions.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.360
JENNY MURPHY: And we think
it would be really cool.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.150
There's a lot of issues we'd
have to overcome to get

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.980
something like that
implemented.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.290
It's on our radar.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:53.900
We think it would be cool, and
that's all I really have to

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.780
say about that.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.620
So we are actually completely
out of time.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.170
WOLFF DOBSON: We're
being waved at.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.580
Time is up.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.880
JENNY MURPHY: So we are going
to be leaving you now.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.520
WOLFF DOBSON: Thanks so much
for coming, everybody.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:06.730
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.660
Thanks a lot for joining us for
this week's session of the

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.150
Google+ Platform Office Hours.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.520
Bye everyone!

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.360
WOLFF DOBSON: Bye!

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.610
ALAN: Bye.
