00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.780
The neat thing about linear
algebra in general is some

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.630
very seemingly simple concepts
can be interpreted in a bunch

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.740
of different ways, and can be
shown to represent different

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.540
ideas or different problems. And
that's what I'm going to

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.260
do in this video.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.660
I'm going to explore the
nullspace, or even better, I'm

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.990
going to explore the
relationship-- if I have some

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.900
matrix A times some vector
x, and that that is

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.560
equal to the 0 vector.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.890
And we, of course, saw on the
last few videos that the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:38.520
nullspace of A, is equal to all
of the vectors x in Rn.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.840
So this will have
n components.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.375
This would have to be
an m by n matrix.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.490
If this was an m by a matrix,
I'd say all of

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.330
the vectors in Ra.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.800
So this number right here has to
be the same as that number

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.530
in order for the matrix vector
multiplication to be valid.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.490
But the nullspace of A is all
of the vectors in Rn that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.110
satisfy this equation.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.280
Where if I take A and I multiply
it times any one of

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.600
the vectors in the nullspace,
I should get the 0 vector.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.640
And this is going to have m
components, and we've seen

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.680
that in previous-- this is going
to have the 0 vectors.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.270
I'll put it this way, the
0 vector's going to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.170
be a member of Rm.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.280
So that's what our
nullspace is.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.080
Let's explore it a little bit.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.930
We know already that our vector,
our matrix, can be

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.250
rewritten like this.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.410
We could just write it as
a set of column vectors.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.410
I could say this right here,
that's v1, then I'm going to

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.640
have v2, and I have n columns.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.980
So this last column right here
is going to be v sub n.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.210
So if I define my vectors this
way, that's the first vector,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.870
that's the second vector, than
I can rewrite my matrix A.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.780
I could say A is equal to just
a bunch of column vectors.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.120
v1, v2, all the way to vn.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.850
And multiplying this matrix
times a vector x, so times x,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.840
so times x1, x2, all
the way to xn.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.100
We've seen in the past on the
matrix vector product

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.790
definition video that this can
be interpreted as, this has

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.400
actually just coming straight
out of the definition.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.820
This is the same thing as x1
times vector 1, times the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.760
first column, plus x2 times the
second column, times that

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.500
column, all the way to, and you
just keep adding them up,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500
all the way to xn.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.490
Times the nth column.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.110
This just comes straight out
of our definition of matrix

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.740
vector products.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.200
Now, if we're saying that Ax is
equal to 0, we're looking

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.170
for the solution set to that.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.990
If we're looking for the
solution set to Ax is equal to

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.080
0, then that means-- is equal
to the 0 vector, that that

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.840
means that this sum, we're
trying to find a solution set

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.020
of this sum is equaling 0.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.090
We want to figure out the x1's,
x2's, x3's, all the way

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.130
to xn's, that make this
equal the 0 vector.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.090
What are we doing?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.040
We're taking linear
combinations

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.860
of our column vectors.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.820
We're taking linear combinations
of our column

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.120
vectors, and seeing if we can
take some linear combination

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.180
and get it to the 0 vector.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.310
Now, this should start ringing
bells in your head.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.480
This little equation, or this
little expression right here,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.390
should start ringing bells.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.590
This was part of how we
defined what linear

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.690
independence was.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.050
We said that if this was the
definition of linear

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.730
independence, or we proved
this fell out of the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.920
definition of linear
independence, and if I have a

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.720
bunch of vectors, v1, v2, all
the way to vn, we say that

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.325
they are linearly independent.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.500
There's kind of the
non-mathematical way of

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.360
describing it, I guess this is
mathematical as well, is that

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.200
look, none of those vectors
can be represented as a

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.540
combination of the other ones.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.440
And then we show that that means
that the only solution

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.520
to this equation would be
that x1, x2, all of the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.240
coefficients on this, has
to be equal to 0.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.450
That this is the
only solution.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.490
Linear independence means that
this is the only solution to

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.300
this equation right now.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.540
If the only way that you get
the 0 vector, by taking

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.170
combination of all of these
common vectors, the only way

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.400
to do that is to have all
of these guys equal 0.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.040
Then you are linearly
independent.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.370
Likewise, if v1, v2, all the
way to vn are linearly

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.750
independent, then the only
solution to this is for these

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.930
coefficients to be 0.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.920
And we saw that in our video
on linear independence.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.590
Now, if all of these
coefficients are 0,

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.570
what does that mean?

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:14.670
That means that our vector
x is the 0 vector,

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.080
and only the 0 vector.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.050
That's the only solution.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.220
So we have something
interesting here.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.890
If our column vectors are
linearly independent, if v1,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:35.960
v2, all the way to vn, are
linearly independent, then

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:50.370
that means that the only
solution to Ax equals 0, is

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.670
that x has to be equal
to 0 vector.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.380
Or put another way, the solution
set of this equation,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.410
which is really just a
nullspace, the nullspace is

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.770
all of the x's that satisfy
this equation.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:08.480
So that the nullspace of A has
to only contain the 0 vector.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.690
So that's an interesting
result.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.300
If we're linearly independent,
then the nullspace of A only

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.010
contains the 0 vector.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.870
Which is another way of saying
that-- let me write this--

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.280
well, I already wrote it down,
that x1, x2, all of them, have

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.810
to be equal to 0.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.610
Now if I were to multiply this
equation out and get it into

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.530
reduced row echelon form,
what does that mean?

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.090
We saw in a previous video that
the nullspace of A is

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:44.260
equal to the nullspace of the
reduced row echelon form of A.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.110
And that's-- the nullspace of
A is 0, because its column

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.500
vectors are each linearly
independent, and that means

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.960
that the nullspace of the
reduced row echelon form of A

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.030
must also equal the 0 vector.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.150
And that means that if I take
the reduced row echelon form

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.050
of A, times-- maybe I'm being
a little redundant-- the

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.390
reduced row echelon form of A,
and I multiply that times x,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.900
or I want to solve this
equation, the only solution

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.530
right here is x is equal
to the 0 vector.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.790
And if you think about what
that means, if this is the

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.840
only solution, that means that
this reduced row echelon form

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.530
has no free variables.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.390
It literally would just have
to look like this.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:38.920
So this is x, x1, x2, all the
way to xn, the reduced row

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.840
echelon form of A, in order
for this to have a unique

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.640
solution, and that unique
solution being 0, the reduced

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.640
echelon form is going to
have to look like this.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.200
1 times x1 plus 0 times all
the other ones, so you're

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.530
going to have just a bunch of
n0's, and you're going to have

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.150
1 times x2, plus 0's times
everything else.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.170
And those 1's are going to go
all the way down the diagonal,

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.250
so it's going to look like that,
and then that is going

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.860
to be equal to the 0 vector.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.910
And this is going to be a square
matrix, where this has

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.840
to be n, and this has to be n.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.300
How do I know that?

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.570
Because I said that x1, x2, and
all of these have to be

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.780
equal to 0.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.580
So they have to be equal to 0.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.380
If I just write them as a system
of equations, if I

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:36.809
write x1 is equal to 0, x2 is
equal to 0, x3 is equal to 0,

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:41.419
all the way to xn
is equal to 0.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.860
This system of equations, if
I wrote it as an augmented

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.370
matrix, remember this is
x1 plus 0, x2 plus 0.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.860
This as in augmented matrix, and
we've done this multiple

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.160
times, it would look
like this.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.780
1, you just have a bunch of 0's,
n0's, and then the 1's

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.850
would just go down the diagonal,
and then you'd have

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.220
n0's right there.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.220
So that's where I'm
getting it from.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:11.130
If we are linearly independent,
the nullspace of

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.980
A is going to be just a 0
vector, and if the nullspace

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.040
of A is just a 0 vector, then
the nullspace of the reduced

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.430
row echelon form is
only the 0 vector.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.320
The only solution is all
of the x's equal to 0.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.420
Which means a reduced row
echelon form of A has to

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.870
essentially just be 1's down
the diaganol, with 0's

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.330
everywhere else.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.040
So anyway, I just want to make
this-- this is kind of a neat

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.310
by-product of an

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.950
interpretation of the nullspace.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.200
Let me write that.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.830
Let me summarize our results.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:48.660
The nullspace of A, if it just
equals 0, then that means, you

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.210
can go both ways, that's true
if and only if the column

00:09:53.210 --> 00:10:03.240
vectors of A are linearly
independent.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:13.366
And all of that's only true--
this is true, I was going to

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:18.240
do a triangle, it might turn
into a square-- if x1, x2, all

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.780
of these have to be equal 0.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.030
This is the only solution.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:31.060
And then that implies that the
reduced row echelon, and I

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.600
didn't do it as precisely as
I would have liked, but the

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.300
reduced row echelon form of A
is essentially going to be a

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.080
square n by n matrix.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.880
And, by the way, this can only
be true if we're dealing with

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.560
an n by n matrix
to begin with.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.990
And maybe I'll do that a little
bit more precisely in a

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.640
future video.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.210
But then the reduced row echelon
form of A is going to

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.020
have to look like this, just
a bunch of 1's down the

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.200
diagonal, with 0's
everywhere else.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.420
And these all imply
each other.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.990
Now, what if the nullspace of A
contains some other vectors?

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.520
Well, then we would have to say
that the column vectors of

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.480
A are linearly dependent.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.240
And if they're linearly
dependent, then we wouldn't

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.230
have a reduced row echelon form
of A that looked like

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.570
this, you would have something
that would have some free

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.880
variables that allows you to
create more solutions there.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.660
But anyway, I just wanted to
give you this angle on how you

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.120
can interpret the nullspace and
how it relates to linear

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.370
Independence.
