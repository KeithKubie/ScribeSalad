00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
Welcome back.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.250
I thought I'd do a couple of
centripetal acceleration

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.250
problems. Some of the more
common ones that you

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.300
maybe see in school.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.015
So let's say I have a, well it
could be a hot wheel, or it

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:11.640
could be a car, a real car.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.195
And say it's on a track.

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:15.520
So we draw the track.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.550
What's a good color
for a track.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.390
I don't know, yellow.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.480
It's a yellow track.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.770
So this is going to
be a side view.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.160
And we all remember this from
our Hot Wheels days.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.840
And the track does a
loop-d-loop, like that.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.840
And then I have a car, and
let's say it's going at a

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.700
constant velocity.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.980
We're not going to worry about
the car's, or at least a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.270
constant speed, right, cause
the direction of velocity

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.080
might change.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.410
Just not the magnitude.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.460
So this is the car.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.120
And my question to you is, how
fast does it have to be going?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.580
What's its speed have to be
for it to not fall when it

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.800
gets to this point in
the loop-d-loop?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.950
So it's going to go like this.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.960
This is going to be the
path of the car.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.800
How fast does it need to go?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.180
So let's just think about it.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.340
Of course, I have to give a
little bit of information.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.590
Let's say the radius of this
loop-d-loop, I don't know,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.790
let's say it's 20 feet.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.930
I'm making this up on the fly.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.760
I hope the numbers
work out well.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.020
So what we have to figure out
is essentially, what is the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.260
centripetal acceleration going
to be on this car?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.980
And if we know the centripetal
acceleration and we know the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.370
radius, we can figure
out the velocity.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.710
So let's just think about what
happens to the car as it goes

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.400
up the loop-d-loop.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.950
At this point, let's say when
the car's right here-- so this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.490
is the car-- what is making
the car's velocity change?

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.170
Cause at this point the car's
velocity is like this.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.820
And then at this point, the
car's velocity is like this.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.750
At this point, the car's
velocity is like this.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.720
It's always going to be tangent
to the loop-d-loop.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.950
Well, this point, down here,
is actually going to be the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.580
normal force of the
loop-d-loop right?

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.650
As the car is kind of driving
into the slope, the slope is

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.590
putting upward pressure on the
car that's making it go in the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.280
circular path.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.460
But as we go beyond this
point, we see something

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.820
interesting happening.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.639
There's going to be the normal
force of the loop-d-loop

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.949
itself, of the surface.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.030
And then we're also going to
start having gravity pulling

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.050
down on the car.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.590
And some portion of the gravity
will kind of pull to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.350
the center.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.440
And it's a little complicated
at this point.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.400
But at this point-- let me draw
the car, let me draw the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.540
upside down car-- what
are the forces?

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.630
Well, if we want the car to just
not fall, right, the only

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.480
force is going to be the force
of gravity, or the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.380
acceleration of gravity.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.110
If the car is going fast
enough to offset the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.060
acceleration of gravity, it'll
stay on the loop-d-loop.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.310
So let's figure out how fast it
has to be going to offset

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.060
the acceleration of gravity.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.620
Well, we know from the previous
video, that the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.020
centripetal acceleration is
equal to the magnitude-- I'm

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.800
going to put an absolute value
around that so you know it's

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.180
not V for velocity
vector, it's the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.850
magnitude of the velocity.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.870
I know I keep changing
conventions, but that's good

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.720
for you cause you'll see
different things-- divided by

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.200
the radius.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.260
Velocity squared over radius.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.250
Remember, this isn't
the vector.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.140
This is just the magnitude.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.710
And once again this is also
just the magnitude of the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.680
acceleration vector.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.780
So we know what the
acceleration

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.030
vector is at this point.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.340
Well, we're just worried
about the magnitude.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.670
We'll say it's 32 feet
per second squared.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.890
That's the acceleration of
gravity on the surface of the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.910
earth, at sea level.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.300
30 feet per second squared.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.860
And that equals the velocity
squared-- I'll get rid of the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.410
absolute value sign, or the
magnitude sign-- divided by

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.270
the radius, divided by 20.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.380
And so multiply both
sides by 20.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.645
I get 640 is equal to
velocity squared.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:04.170
And so 640 square
root is 25.3.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.366
So the car has to be going
25.3 feet per second.

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:12.780
So now I'll ask you
a question.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.500
What happens if it's going
at 20 feet per second?

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.640
Well, if it's going 20 feet per
second, some place around

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.470
here, let me draw the path of
the slower car going 20 feet

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.240
per second.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.830
If the car's going 20 feet per
second, it'll probably make it

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.870
pretty far, and then some place
around here, it's just

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.870
going to start falling and
then it'll fall down.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.490
That's a car going 20
feet per second.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.390
I'll ask you another question.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.590
What's going to happen if
the car goes faster?

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.950
Let's say what happens if the
velocity is-- and I'll do it

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.990
in a different color-- I don't
know, 50 feet per second?

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.750
So this is a super fast car.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.800
So if this was just
a simple orbit

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.080
problem, what would happen?

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.550
We have this centripetal
acceleration from gravity, but

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.600
that alone isn't enough to
offset its velocity.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.120
So if we have no other forces
other than gravity, the car

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.520
would kind of exit its orbit,
you could kind of say right?

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.620
It would actually go
out of its path.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.190
It might do something
like this.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.160
Whoops, its path might look
something like this.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.390
I know I draw these very messy
things, but it might actually

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.170
fly out, right?

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.700
So what's keeping it
from flying out?

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.430
Well, the actual surface of
the loop-d-loop right?

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.150
So we have something very
interesting going on here.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.300
Well, let's figure it out.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.580
What is the centripetal
acceleration have to be?

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.630
Well, if the car's going 50 feet
per second, in order to

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.840
keep it going in a circle, the
acceleration has to be 50

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.860
squared over the radius,
which is 20.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.630
50 times 50, so that's
25, two 0's over 20.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.020
The 0's cancel.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.960
So the acceleration is
going have to be

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.490
125 feet per second.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.090
The inward acceleration, the
centripetal acceleration has

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.980
to be 125 feet per second.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.340
So what's going on?

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.930
Gravity is only going
to provide 32 feet

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.220
per second of that.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.330
So the rest of it is actually
going to be the normal force

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.740
of the surface of the
loop-d-loop or of the surface

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.690
of the road, cause the
car is going to push.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.020
The car is going to want to
kind of exit its orbit.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.570
It's going to do something
like that.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.610
And what's keeping it from
doing that is the road.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.630
The road is keeping
the car contained.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:34.530
And so it's essentially putting
enough extra normal

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.050
force onto the car and so that
force will kind of be applied

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.850
to the tires to offset that.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.580
And there you have it.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.680
So think of it this way.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.380
If you were tied to the
loop-d-loop on the inside,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.700
right here.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.930
If this is some kind of western
movie where the

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.130
heroine is about to die, and
there's a car coming that's

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.780
going to roll her over.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.950
If that car is going at exactly
25.3 feet per second,

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.130
it'll probably just
kind of bump

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.140
over the heroine actually.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.780
The heroine probably will cause
the car to fall and she

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.500
probably won't die.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.120
But if that car's going at 50
feet per second, then there's

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.750
enough normal force so the road
is pushing on the car,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.720
and of course is an equal and
opposite force, so the car is

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.600
pushing down.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.410
And that amount of the
car pushing down

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.030
would squish the heroine.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.240
So I don't know if that was
disturbing or useful or

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.060
confusing, but this is
just another way

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.000
to think about things.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.550
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
