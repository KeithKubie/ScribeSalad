00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.285
Can you imagine a party
where every movement,

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:15.535
from the slightest gesture
to walking across the room,

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:17.207
and every visual detail,

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:19.529
from furniture to hemline length,

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.380
were governed by a complex system
of rules and procedures?

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.774
For centuries, such rituals
were commonplace for European nobility.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.628
And while they've gone out of fashion,

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:34.398
we recognize the components
under a familiar label:

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:36.997
ballet.

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:40.187
Ballet, from Italian "balletto,"
or little dance,

00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:44.599
originated in Renaissance Italy
as a combination of social dance

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:49.561
and choreographed display
at aristocratic gatherings.

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:53.347
In many aspects, it was a way
of controlling people in court

00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:55.762
with acceptable forms of behavior,

00:00:55.762 --> 00:01:00.660
such as the manner in which people
stepped, bowed, or took someone's hand.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.780
It also involved rules governing
everything from attire

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.163
to where one could walk or sit
in relation to the King.

00:01:08.163 --> 00:01:13.090
Over time, the study of ballet became
a central element of court life,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.334
and proper grasp of the etiquette could
make or break one's success as a courtier.

00:01:19.334 --> 00:01:24.541
Many of these court gestures can still
be seen in modern ballet techniques.

00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:27.501
Ballet was brought to France
in the 16th century

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.498
by Catherine de' Medici,

00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:32.494
the Italian wife of King Henry II.

00:01:32.494 --> 00:01:36.160
As celebrations became more lavish,
so did the dance,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.866
with dancing masters teaching
elaborate steps to young nobles

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:44.721
and story elements providing
a unifying theme.

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.747
The focus shifted from participation
to performance,

00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:51.033
and the form acquired 
more theatrical trappings,

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:53.060
such as professionally designed sets

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.794
and a slightly raised platform or stage
with curtains and wings.

00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:02.813
But it was in the 17th century court
of Louis XIV

00:02:02.813 --> 00:02:07.134
that ballet was refined into the art
we know today.

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:10.537
Louis himself had been trained
in ballet from childhood.

00:02:10.537 --> 00:02:14.306
His early role as the sun god
Apollo at age fifteen

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:18.843
cemented the central role ballet
would play during his reign.

00:02:18.843 --> 00:02:21.260
It also earned him the title
of Sun King,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.473
with his splendid golden costume
and choreography

00:02:24.473 --> 00:02:29.336
that promoted the idea of the king
as a divinely ordained ruler.

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:33.522
Louis would go on to perform
80 roles in 40 major ballets,

00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:35.383
either as a majestic lead,

00:02:35.383 --> 00:02:37.962
or sometimes playing minor 
or comedic parts

00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:41.499
before emerging in the lead role
as the end.

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.332
He trained daily in ballet,

00:02:43.332 --> 00:02:44.947
as well as fencing and riding,

00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:46.111
and through his example,

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:51.062
dancing became an essential skill
for all gentlemen of the era.

00:02:51.062 --> 00:02:55.534
But Louis XIV's main contribution 
to ballet was not as a performer.

00:02:55.534 --> 00:02:59.942
His founding of 
the Royal Academy of Dance in 1661

00:02:59.942 --> 00:03:04.932
shifted control of ballet
from local guilds to the royal court.

00:03:04.932 --> 00:03:06.227
As director,

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:10.212
he appointed his personal ballet master 
and frequent performance partner

00:03:10.212 --> 00:03:12.019
Pierre Beauchamp,

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.554
who codified the five main positions 
of the body still used today.

00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:20.197
Through is collaborations
with Jean-Baptiste Lully,

00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:22.467
the director of the Royal Music Academy,

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:24.511
and famed playwright MoliÃ¨re,

00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:28.401
Beauchamp helped establish ballet
as a grand spectacle.

00:03:28.401 --> 00:03:32.586
And in 1669, a separate ballet academy
was founded.

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:39.798
The Paris Opera Ballet survives today
as the oldest ballet company in the world.

00:03:39.798 --> 00:03:42.986
Ballet moved away from the royal court
to the theater

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:46.299
and survived the democratic revolutions
and reforms

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.027
that followed over the next century.

00:03:49.027 --> 00:03:51.122
With the advent of the romantic movement,

00:03:51.122 --> 00:03:55.374
fantasy and folklore themes 
became common motifs.

00:03:55.374 --> 00:03:58.303
And though the influence of ballet
in France would decline,

00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:00.141
other countries, such as Russia,

00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:03.234
would play a major role 
in its further development.

00:04:03.234 --> 00:04:07.577
Fortunately, today most of us don't
have to learn a complicated set of steps

00:04:07.577 --> 00:04:09.764
just to socialize at a wedding.

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:13.128
Instead, we can go to the theater
to see professionals

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.588
who spend their lives training rigorously

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:20.635
to perform feats that would have been
unimagineable in Louis XIV's day.
