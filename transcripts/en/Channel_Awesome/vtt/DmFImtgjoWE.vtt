00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.000
*Chewbacca noise*

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.780
I know your family's waiting.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.320
*Angry Chewbacca noise*

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.000
I know it's important day!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.980
* Whining Chewbacca noise*

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.780
For God's sake, use your adult words!

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.640
*Sigh*

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.700
I'm sorry, Cinema Snob, it's just I'm so excited!

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.180
It's the Star Wars holiday sequel and we're totally retconning the problems of the last one!

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.480
We're not going anywhere unless we outrun that giant slice of pizza!

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.980
Why don't you just jump to light speed? That's always the answer.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.000
Oh yeah.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.400
Why does it always take me so long to remember that?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.680
Critic, we're home.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.020
Yup.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.080
[Critic]: The same old coloring book cover that we're used to.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.560
Come on, I want you to meet my extended family for HUAAAnukka.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.180
Oh god, they're not a bunch of Wookies like in the last special, are there?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.440
No, I told you Snob, we're doing something completely different this time!

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.040
OH HELLOSA

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.180
Sir Jarjar!

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.220
HONEY WESA GOTSA COMPANY!

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.660
WESA GOTSA COMPANY!

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.940
*Chanting* WESA GOTSA COMPANY! WESA GOTSA COMPANY!

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.140
WESA GOTSA COMPANY!

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.180
[Snob]: I could use a Jefferson Starship cameo about now.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.440
[Sir Jarjar]: Now yous sitsa here

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.920
and watch things while I go and makes the dinners.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.420
*splorch*

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.520
OHH PEEEYEWSA

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.620
PEEEYEWSAAAA

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.500
So what do we watch?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.440
Holiday specials?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.440
Ohh, no no no

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.180
We partake in the most classic of HUUUAAnukka traditions.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.460
We just sit around and watch stuff that has absolutely NOTHING to do with the holiday whatsoever.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.700
Oh look! The Force Awakens is on!

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140
I see what you did there

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.800
It's very subtle.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.980
[Critic]: The highly anticipated sequel to the now poorly named sci-fi trilogy is here.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.060
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.020
[Snob]: Can it make up for the siths of the past?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.260
Will there be a special edition where CG characters are replaced with puppets?

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.120
[Critic]: And most importantly, will it lead to even more holiday specials?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.360
More?!

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.720
Come on; Halloween, Easter

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.500
Wouldn't you love to see how Jarjar celebrates Black History Month?

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.400
I'd rather drive with Jake Lloyd.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.780
This is The Force Awakens!

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.540
[Snob]: So it starts off with- ah hold on a second

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.900
*SLAP SLAP SLAP*

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.040
*SLAP SLAP SLAP*

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.520
[Critic]: So unless someone out there can't read

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.080
[Snob]: Then how would they know to click on the video?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.580
[Snob]: It starts off with a rebel spy giving secret information to a little droid

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.500
just before Storm Troopers come in and separate them.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.440
[Critic]: Wait

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500
That sounds eerily familiar.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.920
Road Chip has the same plot.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.480
Really?

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.480
PFFFFT

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.460
Who knows? You'll never see it to find out.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.660
[Critic]: Instead of the Empire this time, it's the First Order

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.420
[Snob]: Which is just another name for Empire, isn't it?

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.180
[Critic]: Pretty much.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.120
As one of their leaders, named Kylo Ren

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.520
tells them to put the pilot, named Poe, on the ship and kill everybody else

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.780
[Kylo Ren]: Put the pilot named Poe on my ship and kill everybody else

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.960
ESPECIALLY Max Von Sydow!

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.600
AAAAAAHHHHHHH

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.580
This would be zero-zero-one

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.620
DUGGHH

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.800
What's Harvey Korman doing in this?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.880
Oh, he's a robot that let's us know when a good actor is completely wasted in a role

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.200
Number two-six-five

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.240
Gone but not unforgotten.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.660
[Snob]: Does that happen a lot in this movie?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.520
Does the Jedi menorah have nine light sabers?

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.880
*BWOO*

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.060
[Snob]: But one Storm Trooper, named Finn, is SHOCKED that being a psychotic killer

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.180
means being a psychotic killer

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.180
So he breaks Poe out but gets shot down to planet not-Tatooine

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.960
where Finn presumes Poe's dead as the ship sinks into the sand.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.760
...and blows up

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.760
*BOOM*

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.700
[Critic]: Perhaps it was allergic to sand?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.180
It is very coarse, rough and irritating.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.260
And it gets everywhere.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.480
[Critic]: This is when we meet Rey

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.760
a scavenger waiting for her family to return

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.260
who comes across the droid named BB-8

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.240
Well, aren't you an adorable soccerball with a Storm Trooper's butt cheek on top

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.020
*Pew!*

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.420
[Critic]: But the not-Empire finds the droid too, causing her to run into Finn

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.720
and the two of them team up trying to escape

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.960
They come across the Millenium Falcon, which is confused for scrap metal

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.120
It belongs in a museum!

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.600
[Critic]: And they take off in it, seeing as how apparently none of these ships require keys of any kind

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.060
[Snob]: Of course, all the tie fighters ditch them because only the drunkest of soldiers pilot those things

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.760
and they escape into space

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.120
Well, because the galaxy is such a "small" place, they bump into Han Solo's and Chewbacca's ship

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.620
*CHOMP*

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.900
[Snob]: Hnyur wait a minute

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.180
What's with the animation all the sudden?

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.620
Well, through certain camera lenses, some people look like poorly animated cartoon characters

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.600
Nuh-uh not happening

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.480
*snap*

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.060
*POOF*

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.160
*TA-DA!*

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.380
[Critic]: Wait a minute, how is that possible?

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.520
You're watching the special with me.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.540
THAT'S your biggest question?

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.200
You're not concerned why the Jarjars are watching gay acrobatic holograms?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.000
OOOOHOHOHOHO

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.500
*splorch*

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.500
EW PEEYEWSA

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.160
[Critic]: You just don't understand HUAAnukkah.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.080
Yes, because you've never explained it to me.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.580
It's not something you explain

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.920
it's something you feel

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.540
*exasperated sigh*

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.160
I feel like a Scotch right now

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.660
*off-screen splorch*

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.660
[Sir Jarjar]: *unintelligible* PEEYEWSA!

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.040
[Critic]: So Rey and Finn explain their situation as Solo agrees to help them

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.820
to get the droid to the not-rebels

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.700
*DING DONG*

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.140
...aaafter he's attacked by some people he owes money to

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.220
Just hide here until this pointless detour blows over

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.920
Pointless detour?! That ties in perfectly with-

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.060
HOKAY TIME TO WATCH THE HUMAN PORNOGRAPHIES I HAVE FOR SOME REASON

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.560
*splorch*

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.040
OH PEEYEWSA

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.120
How is that even possible?!

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.360
Well, this should fittingly explain how pointless this scene is.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.660
MMMmm, angry men wanting their money back

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.180
ooohhh

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.900
Giant octopuses that come out of nowhere MMMM

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.780
None of it... ties into the story

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.100
oh yeahh

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.060
But it's still shorter... than the opening of The Return of the Jedi

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.560
*SNIFF*

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.580
MMM

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.740
*vaguely sexual grunt*

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.980
ALL RIGHT

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.480
[Snob]: Are you sure this isn't the porno version of Star Whores?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480
No, I think the plot would actually be more focused

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.500
[Critic]: So Kylo Ren talks to Supreme Leader Snoke and-

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.680
HOLY SHIT

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.100
What the hell is that?!

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.980
Oh my god that's the new Emperor?!

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.780
He's gigantic!

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.380
HOLY SMOKES imagine the possibilities you can do with this!

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.900
[Kylo Ren]: SUPREME LEADER

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.280
I am sorry we have to talk to you via non-cost effective gigantic hologram

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.720
*In unison* BOOOO!

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.880
That's for making me think you were awesome!

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.740
Well- who knows! Maybe it still has a pretty good design

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.040
*dramatic build up*

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.080
[Snob]: I thought I said no more cartoons in this

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.900
...Actually, I think that's supposed to look realistic

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.360
[Critic]: Yyyeeah, remember that cheap-ass alien from Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls?

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.980
He's your Emperor now!

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.260
Except somehow he looks even... faker

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.340
Not to mention a whopping seven lines from the actor you're never allowed to see act

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.020
Ouch.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.740
Even the name Snoke, it sounds like an eighties' cartoon

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.200
about a bunch of colorful creatures that live underwater!

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.380
[Critic]: But he does at least let out this important bit of information:

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.340
[Snoke]: BY THE WAY HOW IS YOUR FATHER HAN SOLO?

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.820
*DUN DUN DUNNN*

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.520
Are you all right?

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.740
Anyone else get a "you're so dead" vibe right now?

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.540
N-not really.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.600
In fact, I'm getting more of a "two more movies" vibe to be honest.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.220
Yeah, it's probably just you.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.220
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.900
*DUN DUN DUNNN*

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:18.460
*Outro sting*

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.720
*And we're back sting*

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.200
[Critic]: So after finding out that the villain has a father-son relationship with one of the good guys

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.140
we go to a cantina where a ton of weird aliens hang out-

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.640
OKAY

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.620
None of this if ringing a bell as having been done before?!

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.540
Oooohhhh, I see where you're going with this

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.600
*flatly* I'm Bea Arthur

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.040
welcome to my watering hole

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.780
Please tell me no more about your watering hole

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.100
I wouldn't talk, eraser head

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.020
ALL RIGHT settle down

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.720
[Bea Arthur]: You're not even a real fighta

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.320
You wanted to always run

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.380
So what if I do?

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.120
Finn! Don't let her think that

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.120
Only fools and cowards run

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.320
Now, we hear you might have something that'll lead us to Luke Skywalker

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.260
Sure do

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.260
*oh nooo*

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.600
Go to run

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.820
*SWEET CATCH*

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.420
[Background character]: Typical Mary Sue

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.700
[Kylo Ren]: Huh, that was easy

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.780
Uh, blow 'em up

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.780
*PEW PEW PEW*

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.600
Anyone want ton ton for dinner?

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.100
*UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT*

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.240
*PEW PEW PEW*

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.300
The Empire is shutting us down!

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.140
Lousy ANTI-JEDITES!

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.840
*BOOM BOOM POW*

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.720
*To upbeat music* It's not the end, friends

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.680
Don't say goodbyyye, friends

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.680
Is that a teearrr, friend?

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.120
In your eeeyyyyyyeee

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.640
*GOODBYE*

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.760
I'm all right, kid.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.320
So, Rey is captured and interrogated by Kylo Ren

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.640
...only to have Rey interrogate him

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.320
[Kylo Ren]: Why do you seek Skywalker?

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.740
Why do YOU seek Skywalker?!

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.320
[Kylo Ren]:  He's a jerky uncle who didn't let me play with the dark side!

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:02.960
*Deep breath*

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.020
You have the Force!

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.120
I do?

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.280
Well, then

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.560
you will leave me with a weak-minded Storm Trooper so that I can escape

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.180
[Kylo Ren]: HA

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.380
Joke's on you, that's what I was going to do anyways

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.160
[Weak-minded ST]: Hey

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.000
Release me

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.560
[Weak-minded ST]: 'Kay

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.280
[Snob]: Meanwhile, Finn meets up with his old friend Poe

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280
HEY!!

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.520
Surprised I'm alive?

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.120
No, I saw the trailer

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.360
[Snob]: While Solo meets up with his old flame, General Leia

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.440
Leia, I saw our son

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.980
Han, I know there's still good in him

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.480
He just Jackson Pollock'd a cantina with a bunch of space Nazis

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.840
He's a little past grounding at this point

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.880
Please promise me that you'll try to win him back

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.640
PROMISE

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.860
...All right, I'll try to win him back

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.780
Also, can you fill out these insurance forms?

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.620
Okay

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.580
And close up these bank accounts

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.300
All right

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.620
Also wear this red shirt, I really think it screams "you"

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.000
Abrams movie, why not

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.420
OOOHH I know you can do it! *giggles*

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.440
*Suspenseful music*

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.620
[Critic]: So then Finn sneaks aboard their base and forces the Captain of the Storm Troopers

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.960
to lower the shield

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.620
Lower the shield

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.480
*DING*

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.180
Into the garbage chute, I haven't seen Gwendoline Christie performin'

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.400
I think this one speaks for itself

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.920
[Critic]: They run into Rey but also into Kylo Ren

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.340
who Solo decides he's going to confront

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.540
I decided I'm going to confront

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.560
Have I ever told you that you're like a mentor to me?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.500
...Christ, I've no chance

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500
[Critic]: So Solo approaches his son

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.900
who takes his mask off to reveal that he's actually a pretty good looking guy

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.000
Then why the hell does he wear a mask?

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.180
...Well, the dark side does seem to be anti-pretty people

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.040
Son, I know we haven't seen each other in years

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.920
and there's people pointing guns at us and

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.860
I know I haven't given you any new reasons to come back

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.320
But... I would like you to come back

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.900
Um, before I answer

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.660
could you take another few steps forwards?

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.920
Oh, sure

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.760
Your mother misses you, son

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.600
I miss you too

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.160
And if you forget for a minute that both the writer and I

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.580
wanted me to die in Return of the Jedi

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.100
Well, it would be great if you could-

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.600
HEE

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.520
*UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT*

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.460
*Dully, in unison* What a surprise.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.060
I love you

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.020
*softly* I know

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.880
[Han Solo]: Great shot kid that was one in a million

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.880
*THUD*

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.860
[Critic]: So after the old mentor is killed

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.600
a bunch of ships fly in to stop the giant planet-destorying ball

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.240
that's about to blow up the base where Leia is

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.580
while a lightsaber duel takes place with a villain

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.460
who seems torn between good and evil

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.980
NONE OF THIS IS SOUNDING FAMILIAR IN THE SLIGHTEST?!

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.160
LIKE, AT ALL?!

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.460
Hey, you're the one who keeps living in the past

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.320
having Harvey Korman in drag teach the dreidel

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.340
Spin! Turn! Spin! Turn!

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.920
Spin spin turn HUAAAAH

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.180
3,000 years of beautiful tradition from Moses to Sandy Koufax

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.440
you're GOD DAMN RIGHT I'M LIVING IN THE PAST!!

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.600
Oh come off it Critic, you're not even f**king Jewish, man

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.120
I converted to Jewbacceyism the minute I married Mrs. Jarjar!

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.460
[Jarjar, off-screen]: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.600
I made you out of HUAAAAAAH

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.060
[Critic]: This does bring up a good point though

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.320
As similar as these scenes are to the past

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.820
there's not as much investment in them

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:06.340
We cared for the Death Star battle in the other films because we knew Luke Skywalker

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.040
We knew Lando Calrissian and we knew the emotional stakes

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.980
Here, we have Poe in this space battle

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.500
who hasn't had a lot of screen time

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.640
And we don't really know the consequences of either base blowing up

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.280
The bad guys always seems to make a bigger base after one is destroyed

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.400
and we're not sure if the majority of rebels are on the planet this time

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.420
or if they're spread out

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.600
Even the lightsaber duel seems kind of underwhelming

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.200
We only have one scene where these two have any real connection

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.920
and while it's a good scene, it's not really enough for a climax

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.140
With the other ones, they talked and discussed their history while fighting

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.460
"Your powers are weak, old man."

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.480
"I was the student, but now I'm the master."

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.760
"You are not a Jedi."

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.620
"Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father."

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.160
Here, it's:

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:50.700
Join me!

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.200
Mnah

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.060
And that's it!

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.280
You get more dialogue out of a mime screenplay!

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.920
Oh, please! When has J. J. Abrams ever repeated anything in his sci-fi franchise-

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.000
I can't even finish that

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.880
[Snob]: The fighters destroy the base

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.280
causing Kylo and Rey to be separated

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.540
Here's to figuring out how we're related!

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.440
I say cousins!

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.540
And I say siblings!

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.120
OOHHH can I be related to Lando?

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.080
No

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.760
Wha-- come on! Everyone else is related!

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.620
[Critic]: So the not-Death Star is blown up

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.500
Rey travels to see Luke Skywalker

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.520
and she meets him on top of a mountain where she hands him back his lightsaber

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.860
*triumphant, swelling music*

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.240
So... it was good!

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.120
But did it really have to be so similar to the other movies?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.620
Aww, come on, if you honestly see a connection between

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.980
an evil dictatorship

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.200
chasing a droid with secret plans

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.600
landing on a desert planet

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.640
where a wide-eyed youth comes across it

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.600
follows in the footsteps of a mentor

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.380
who has a connection to the villain

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.400
being controlled by a shadowy overlord

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.400
only to lose that mentor

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.140
while discovering a surprise father-son relationship

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.660
leading to a battle against a giant, round weapon

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.200
that destroys planets

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.300
and is about to destroy the base of a heroic resistance

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.000
but is stopped just in time

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.780
resulting in our main character leaving to train

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
with an old wise master from the past

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.880
Well then that's just silly

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.200
I just don't get it!

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.440
Why would they, after all these years, do something this similar?!

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.740
EXSQUEEZE ME

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.600
BUT MESA GOTSA KNOWHA

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.400
*AHEM COUGH COUGH*

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.800
*Sophisticated voice* Thank heavens, that finally passed.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.460
Whuh... that's not your real voice?

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.340
Ohoho nonono, that's just a phase my race goes through

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.580
You see, we all start off whiny and annoying

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.520
but then we hit a certain age where we become quite charming and brilliant

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.560
The rest of my family will hit it soon enough

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.800
but until then, I thank you for indulging in all my insufferable antics.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.120
um

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.860
No problem?

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.540
Now, let us prepare for our wonderful holiday.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.440
Oh, ohoho dear

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.480
There appears to be feces on the floor

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.940
Let us step around that

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.220
Wow, that actually made things a lot better.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.880
Well, yeah. I'm trying to make up for the sins of the past holiday special.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.660
So that's why you did so many things that the other one did?

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.500
Exactly!

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.880
If I want to move forward with more specials, I have to prove that I can do a regular one okay.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.240
So I stick to the formula, only this time I do it a lot better.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.360
SHIT this is a metaphor, isn't it?!

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.240
Pretty much!

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:10.960
*frustrated growl*

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.380
[Critic]: I guess it does kind of make sense when you really think about it

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.560
After so many years of people hating the prequels

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.720
the filmmakers had a lot to prove

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.220
so they had to demonstrate that  they could do something that looks and feels like Star Wars

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.420
before they could forwards with anything different

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.220
Sure, a lot of it's on repeat

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.100
but it's done in such an entertaining and whimsical way

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.500
that it's still really enjoyable

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.420
And who knows? Maybe the new stuff that should've gotten more attention in this film

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.960
will get attention in the next film

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.520
[Snob]: And besides, they've done practically every other plot thread the other movies have done

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.980
there's not many left

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.420
leaving it open to new ideas in upcoming films

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.320
It's not a classic but it doesn't need to be yet

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.940
It's the reintroduction of an old friend

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.480
who've taken a beating

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.920
and just needed to show that he's gonna be okay

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.120
before he accomplishes better things

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.860
Well said, Snob

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.120
Well said.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.080
But Critic, I still don't understand!

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.160
What is the true meaning of HHNRKKnukka?

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.200
Well

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.060
Just touch the magic ball and I'll show you.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.180
*slurring* You're all... like family to me

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.820
just touch the goddamn ball

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:28.460
*woooo wow wow wow*

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.760
Leia! You made it!

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.060
Oh, I wouldn't miss this holiday for the world.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.600
Leia, my friend here would like to know the true meaning of HUAAnukka.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.760
Would you kindly explain it to him?

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.560
Of course.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:18:08.780
*sentimental piano music*

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:09.980
We-

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.700
Are you gonna take it, or

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.220
You need to hold it for a month.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.720
A month? But next month is January.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.400
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?!

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.920
SHYAMALAN MONTH!!!

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
*party music*

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
KEEP IT UP

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.140
*party music*

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.480
*stilted acting from The Happening* What? No!

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.040
At the end of the day you're still not as big a disappointment

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.040
as Smut Williams

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.820
*outbreak of laughter*

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.680
HUAAAAnukka

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.760
Hey! Doug Walker here doing the charity shout-out

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.400
and this is one that I've known about for a while

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.660
given them money too and it's really, really good

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.240
and for some reason I've never bought it up before

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.800
and I don't know why but I'm doing it now

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.140
'cause it definitely deserves the acknowledgement

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.300
It is Mercy Corps

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:40.020
Uh, this is a humanitarian global organization

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:45.800
that goes around and specializes in saving people in every meaning of the word

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.080
They feed people, they go fix infrastructures that need fixing

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.600
They get people water, they rebuild places that have been destroyed

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.940
whether from war or natural disasters or whatever

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.960
They'll do tech start-ups, they'll fix bridges that are broken

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.020
Even land rights. This is an organization that does everything

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.900
Everything they do is just focused on making people better and trying to help them out

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.160
and going to places where they have a ton of disadvantages

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.480
and making it so that they can be strong again

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.500
And the nice thing is is that they just don't stick to one location

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.780
They travel everywhere, all around the world

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.180
42 countries altogether

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.640
It's amazing how much work they put into this!

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:31.140
It's kinda like a team of Supermans, all they do is go around and just try to help people

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.680
by any means necessary

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.760
I have no idea how they do it or how they can get all these people together

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.280
to do all these various things but they do and it's phenomenal.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.920
Definately, definately take the time to check out their website

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.260
look at their YouTube page as well

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.920
See all the good that they're doing and see if you're willing to donate

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.980
'Cause man, they do it all and all that they do

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.120
is amazing

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.520
