00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:11.111
Narrator: FROM 100-BILLION STARS
RACING TOWARDS US...

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.750
...THE ANDROMEDA GALAXY.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.356
SCIENTISTS HAVE LONG SUSPECTED
IT WILL ONE DAY

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.960
CRASH INTO OUR GALAXY,
THE MILKY WAY.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:32.131
TONY'S PRECISE MEASUREMENTS
ALLOW HIM TO PREDICT

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.001
HOW THIS CLASH OF THE TITANS
WILL LOOK.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:42.475 line:0%
TO ANYONE ON EARTH,
IT WOULD BE A SPECTACULAR SIGHT.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:43.977 line:0%
Sohn:
WE'LL SEE THE ANDROMEDA GALAXY

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.512 line:0%
GETTING BIGGER
AND BIGGER IN THE SKY.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:49.415 line:0%
AND THEN EVENTUALLY, IN ABOUT
FOUR BILLION YEARS FROM NOW,

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.984
WE'LL SEE THE COLLISION
OF THE TWO GALAXIES.

Narrator: ON IMPACT,

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.228 line:0%
CLOUDS OF DUST WILL BE
CRUSHED TOGETHER

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:06.099 line:0%
WITH SENSATIONAL RESULTS.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.004 line:0%
WHAT WE'LL SEE IS A LOT
OF STARS GETTING FORMED.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.905
AND THIS WILL LOOK
SOMETHING LIKE

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:15.575
STELLAR FIREWORKS IN THE SKY.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.550
Narrator:
TONY CAN EVEN CALCULATE THE ODDS

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.918
THAT OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:28.654
WILL CRASH INTO ONE
OF ANDROMEDA'S BILLIONS OF STARS

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:31.424
DURING THE COLLISION.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.596
SURPRISINGLY,
THE PROGNOSIS IS GOOD.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:39.198
Sohn: GALAXIES
ARE ESSENTIALLY EMPTY SPACE.

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:42.868
SO THE CHANCES OF STARS
COLLIDING WITH ANOTHER STAR

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.203
IS VERY SLIM,

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.939
BECAUSE THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN THE STARS IS VAST.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.508 line:0%
SO WHEN THE COLLISION HAPPENS,

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:51.077 line:0%
THE SOLAR SYSTEM WILL PASS
THROUGH AN EMPTY SPACE

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.179 line:0%
BETWEEN THE STARS.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:02:00.152 line:0%
Narrator: AFTER PASSING
LIKE GHOSTS IN THE NIGHT,

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:03.789 line:0%
THE IRRESISTIBLE PULL OF GRAVITY
WILL DRAW THEM BACK TOGETHER

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.325 line:0%
OVER THE NEXT TWO-BILLION YEARS

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:11.798 line:0%
TO FINALLY SETTLE AS A NEW
SUPERGALAXY NICKNAMED MILKOMEDA.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.439 line:0%
OUR GALAXY WILL NO LONGER EXIST.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.611 line:0%
YET CALCULATIONS SUGGEST
THE SOLAR SYSTEM WILL SURVIVE.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.048 line:0%
Sohn: IT WILL MERGE INTO
ONE BIG GALAXY,

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.684
AND IT WILL LOOK LIKE
A GIANT BALL IN THE SKY.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:37.089 line:0%
Narrator: SADLY, IT'S UNLIKELY
ANYONE WILL BE ON EARTH

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.927 line:0%
TO WITNESS THIS COLOSSAL
GALACTIC COLLISION.
