00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.330
We're now on problem
number seven.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.100
Problem number seven says x
equals 1/2, or if x equals

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.780
1/2, what is the value of 1 over
z plus 1 over x minus 1?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.620
So 1 over x, well that's just
1 over 1/2 plus 1 over--

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.580
what's x minus 1?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.740
What's 1/2 minus 1?

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.050
What's minus 1/2, right?

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.180
So this is x minus
1 is minus 1/2.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.960
And you could evaluate it.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.280
Or you could immediately see
that these would cancel out,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.150
because you could take this
minus and put it right here

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.130
and make this a plus.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.740
Or you could evaluate it and say
well, this is equal to 2

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.530
minus 2 and that equals 0.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.880
So this is just kind of a speed
question to see how fast

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.840
you can do it.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.830
How much time do you
waste on this?

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.330
OK, problem number eight.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.370
I'll do it in green.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.400
Let's see, let me draw that.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.940
So we've got a coordinate
axis.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.390
Oh, my god.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.910
Edit, undo.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.300
It's a coordinate axis.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.630
I didn't have my line tool on.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.550
And then that's the x-axis.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.800
This is the y-axis.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.565
Then let me draw some
points here.

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:23.960
I have the point right here.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.870
They say this is 1, 0.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.300
Let's see, x-axis.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.530
That's the y-axis.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.210
So then I still use
the line tool.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.202
They have this going straight
up like this.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:44.452
It goes like that.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.680
Right angle there.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800
Right angle there.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.300
This is point s.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.326
This is point t.

00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:04.530
This is point r.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.340
They say in the figure above
r, s is equal to s, t.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.960
That's just saying that their
lengths are equal.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.185
And the coordinate of s,
right here, is k, 3.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.460
So what does that tell us?

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.140
That means that the x value,
right here, this point

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.790
right here is k.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.570
And that this y value, right
here, is 3, right? k, 3.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.560
That's not t, 3.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.410
I'm just saying the y value
right here is 3.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.720
What is the value of k?

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.300
Well we know that this length
and this length

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.850
are the same, right?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.100
What is this length?

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.770
Actually, that was a very
ugly curly bracket.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.850
But we know the y value
here is 3, right?

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.560
This intersects the y,
intercepts at 3 right here, so

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.550
we know that distance is 3.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.950
We know that this
distance is 3.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.530
That's also 3.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.800
And we also know that this is
equal to this, so we also know

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.940
that this distance is 3.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.040
And if that distance is 3, we
know that this distance is 3.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.900
But we're 3 to the left
of the y-axis, right?

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.350
We've gone 3 units in the
negative direction.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.090
So the value of k, or the
x-coordinate here would be

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.970
negative 3 because we
went 3 to the left.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.910
If it was out here it'd be
positive 3, but since it's

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.760
here it's negative 3,
and that's choice A.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.970
Next question, number nine.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.760
OK, let's see.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.355
So they drew a table and
I'll just write it the

00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:48.880
way they did it.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.690
So they did x and f of x.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:02.390
And then they say 0, 1,
2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 10.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.680
The table above gives the
values of the quadratic

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.320
function f for the selected
values of x.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.980
Which of the following
defines f?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.730
So it's a quadratic function, so
we know it's going to have

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.339
the form-- f of x is going to be
something like x squared--

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:23.810
well it could be ax squared
plus bx plus c.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.240
My suspicion though is it's
going to be something fairly

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.900
you-- simple.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.580
So let's see.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.730
The way I would do it is I would
play around with it.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.910
So if I squared this x value and
I still end up with a 1--

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.940
and this is actually the biggest
clue right here,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.140
because when x is
0, f of x is 1.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.340
So we know that this constant
term is going to be 1.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.190
It's going to be something plus
1 because when x is 0,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.250
these things are equal to 0,
this ax squared plus bx.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.600
And we still have
it equal to 1.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.900
So we know c is 1.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.210
So we know that already,
that's ax squared

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.370
plus bx plus 1.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.160
And then let's see.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.390
We know that we have a
plus 1 here, right?

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.670
So we know that this whole term
is-- you can put it in

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.870
here, but when you get a plus
1-- well I'm explaining it in

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.590
a very confusing way.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.950
But your brain might just say
hey, if I square this and add

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.350
this plus 1, I get 2.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.990
If I square this and
I add 1, I get 5.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.540
If I square 3 and I
add 1, I get 10.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.960
And you would say well, f
of x must just equal x

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.230
squared plus 1.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.050
If your brain doesn't
just stumble on

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.050
that-- although it should.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.375
You should probably just say
well it's probably just

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:38.070
something simple like I
squared and I add 1 or

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.460
subtract one, because they're
never going to give you

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.200
something really complicated.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.710
But if they did, or I guess if
you're not doing this on the

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.660
SAT, hopefully you see how I
immediately got that the y

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.380
intercept is 1, because when
x is 0, f of x is 1.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.670
And then you could have
said well, when x is

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.360
1, f of x is 2.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.570
So you could have substituted
here.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:04.660
You could have said 2 is
equal to ax-- sorry.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.920
You could say 2 is equal to a
times 1 squared plus b times 1

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.870
plus 1, right?

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.560
Because I just substituted 1 for
x, and then I put f of x

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.920
is equal to 2.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.620
And then you would get-- if
you subtract 1 from both

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.670
sides, you get 1 is equal
to a plus d, right?

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.820
And you know on the SAT they're
not going to give some

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.470
crazy fractional thing.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.460
And I'm actually hesitant
to even go in this whole

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.660
direction, because
I think it's just

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.730
overcomplicating the thing.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.560
Because you could then do the
same thing with 2 and 5, and

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.410
then get a system of equations,

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.020
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.070
And you would have wasted
a lot of time.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.280
The big discovery here is that
most of these on the SAT are

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.740
going to be really
simple equations.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.310
And frankly, more than doing
this-- this is just multiple

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.600
choice, I just realized-- you
could just try out the

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.210
equations that they give you.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.370
And it's lucky that the
first one works.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.650
Actually, you should just
try out all of them and

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.450
see which ones work.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.700
Next problem.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.870
Write me a message if you found
that last explanation a

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.560
little confusing.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.810
I just didn't want to show you
the correct way to do it,

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.660
because that would take you
forever and it's not really

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.670
the correct way to
do it on the SAT.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.960
Problem number ten.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.840
How old was a person exactly
one year ago if, exactly x

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.120
years ago, the person
was y years old.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.770
So this is just something
to confuse you.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.020
So x years ago the person
was y years old.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.840
So let's put it this way.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.740
Let me think of the best
way to write this.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.535
So let's write their
current age.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.670
Well let's just write
it as equal to a.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.380
So we know a couple of things.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:11.320
We know that a minus x is equal
to y, or we know that

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.800
their current age is equal
to x plus y, right?

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.280
This is their current age.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.570
And what do we want
to figure out?

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.940
We want to figure out their
age 1 year ago.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.810
So we want to figure out their
current age minus 1.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.290
So the current age minus 1?

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.780
Well their current
age is x plus y.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.559
So you just substitute that back
in, and you get x plus y

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:40.612
minus 1 is how old they
were 1 year ago.

00:08:40.612 --> 00:08:45.520
So x plus y minus 1,
that's choice E.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.140
Next problem.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.890
Actually I only have a minute
left, so I'll do the next

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.730
problem in the next video.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.130
I'll see
