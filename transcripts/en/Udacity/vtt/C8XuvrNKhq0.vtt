00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We have talked about three methods of lifting a rock of 100 kg by 1 m.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If we just want to lift the rock, well our force has to balance the weight,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which means you're going to need a 1000 N force,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we're going to have to exert that force of a 1m, exactly the height of the table.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If we use the pulley, we had a few options. One was a simple pulley with one connection point.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We'd have to exert a force of 1000 N over the full distance of 1 m.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It was a double pulley, we have to exert half that force, but over twice the distance and so on.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If we use an incline plane, well if the angle is 30Â°,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we have to exert a force of 500 N over a distance of 2 m.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
There's a deep and fundamental pattern emerging here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
1000&lt;i&gt;1, 500&lt;i&gt;2, 250&lt;i&gt;4, 333&lt;i&gt;3 and so on and now it's time for the breakthrough.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
For all of these seemingly entirely different ways of moving this block up by a height of 1 m

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
something is constant, the force times the distance is always equal to 1000.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
1000&lt;i&gt;1, 333&lt;i&gt;3, 500&lt;i&gt;2, it doesn't matter. These are all giving you a value of 1000.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This quantity force times distance is so important that we're going

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to give it its own name--we're going to call it work.
