00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.250
&gt;&gt;Christina: For every one that's here in
the room today, and everyone that's in VC

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.740
offices around London, thank you very much
for coming to today's Authors@ series.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.390
My name is Christina Smith, I'd like to introduce
you to three fine gentleman.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.710
Well two fine gentleman, one guy I just met
a few minutes ago so we'll see how that goes.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.800
[laughter]
From the illustrious Pub Quiz team that I've

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.600
been fortunate enough to know for the past
few years you've got Richard Moore, Daniel

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.600
Freebie.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.600
They're gonna walk you through.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.030
God I feel like I'm doing like a client presentation
right now.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.640
We're gonna walk you through a few samples
today.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.650
[laughter]
They're gonna talk to you today about their

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.360
best-selling books that have been out for
awhile.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.540
"Slaying the Badger," and what is the Eddy
Merckx cannibal.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.540
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Cannibal.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.940
Something like that, OK.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.769
And then also joining us today if two is not
enough, we're very very fortunate as well

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.160
to have Mr. Ned Boulting here.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.750
Ned's book, "How I Won the Yellow Jumper",
has been out for probably three years now?

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.750
&gt;&gt;Ned: No no, 10 months.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.750
&gt;&gt;Christina: 10 months, god it feels like
it's been out longer.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.750
You write for the—
&gt;&gt;Ned: I get to use a microphone now.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.439
&gt;&gt;Christina: And you write for "The Guardian"
is that right?

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:09.439
&gt;&gt;Ned: No I broadcast for ITV, it's television
but yeah.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.439
&gt;&gt;Christina: Okay, close enough.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.439
You can tell I really, I'm just completely
winging it.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.439
Sorry, not "The Guardian".

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.439
&gt;&gt;Richard: You got him confused with someone
else.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.439
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Christina: Daily Mail?

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.439
&gt;&gt;Ned: You can just, you've googled me.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:16.610
&gt;&gt;Christina: I did, actually I google everything.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:25.720
I should have just read what I wrote a couple
moments ago.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.170
Alright with that embarrassing last comment,
I'm gonna shut up and just let these guys

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.170
take it away.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.980
All right, this is gonna be a really fun hour
so I'm excited about what's gonna happen.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.980
Alright.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.440
&gt;&gt;Richard: Thank you, thank you Christina
for that wonderful introduction.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.200
These are the three books she mentioned.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.470
We were gonna sort of basically talk maybe
10 to 15 min. about each one

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.310
&gt;&gt;Ned: 10 Minutes
&gt;&gt;Richard: With the author being quizzed on

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.370
his book.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.100
And we thought we'd start with Ned's, "How
I Won the Yellow Jumper."

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.960
Which is a kind a great introduction to the
sport.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.310
Because it covers your own introduction to
the sport.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.759
You were a highly competent experienced professional
broadcaster who was parachuted into the.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.239
[Loud Siren Noise]
Ned, is that you?

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.620
&gt;&gt;Ned: [slap] got it.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.540
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Richard: You were parachuted into the.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.060
[loud sirens stopped]
[laughter]

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.219
Tour de France in 2003.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:30.150
The title of the book comes from a pretty
embarrassing encounter you had on the Champs-Elysees

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.810
after the first stage of Prague time trial.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.969
Can you tell us?

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.430
&gt;&gt;Ned: In very brief summary it was the first
bike race I'd ever seen of any description.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.219
I'd never ridden a bike, raced a bike, seen
a bike race.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:48.510
So my first introduction to it was the prologue
of the 2003 Tour de France which cycling fans

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.609
here will remember, turns out to be one of
the most epic in modern times.

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.189
The prologue was in Paris which is unusual
in itself, so the setting was extremely grand.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.540
Not only that, to compound the importance
of the occasion.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.829
But a British rider David Miller pre-doping
ban was actually the hot favorite.

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:07.840
&gt;&gt;: Daniel: Mid-doping.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.180
&gt;&gt;Ned: Mid-doping was for good reason the
hot favorite to win that day.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.969
[laughter]
And so he should've done actually had it not

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:23.510
been for the fact that in the final bend onto
the final home straight his chain bounced

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.950
off his chain ring and he lost time and just
missed out.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.450
Anyway, this all sort of, we were broadcasting
live on ITV 1 actually then, not on ITV 4.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.090
So on the big network to a big audience.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.010
And all this chaos ensued where we thought
we had this British winner and in the end

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.400
he missed out by a fraction of the second,
rode over the line, disappeared and we had

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.590
to find out what had happened to him because
we couldn't get an interview with David Miller.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.109
And it's one of those broadcasting situations
where television is in desperate need for

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.849
information to relay home but more often than
not you haven't got it.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.430
So you start kind of making stuff up.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.689
And the director without really warning me
just suddenly made the presenter Gary Imlach

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.269
run out of things to say.

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.120
Cause he had used up all the scanned information
he had.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.269
He kind of threw across to me to say what
I knew about the situation.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.739
And I was in a complete state of confusion,
so the only thing that came out of my mouth

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.269
was, "David Miller's just blown his chances
of winning the yellow jumper."

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:28.680
Not realizing that of course it's not a jumper,
it's a jersey, it's an iconic sporting trophy

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.940
and I just made a bloody fool of myself.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.030
I didn't realize I'd done that until much
later when some people told me how much of

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.620
a tit I'd made out of myself.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.180
So that was it.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.699
So that's, in terms of that book that's the
starting point.

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.639
That's the ignorance in which I could only
improve my knowledge.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.639
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.380
You'd worked in other sports, football most
notably before then.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.800
You covered that whole tour.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.479
What was it about the tour that fascinated
you and what surprised you about it as well

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.400
as you kind of got to know and love it?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.380
&gt;&gt;Ned: Well I guess, firstly the scale of
the event.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.919
Because, Daniel you been on the Tour de France,
you've done it many times and I'm sure amongst

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.320
our audience here.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.599
And that bloke sitting over there on his own,
hello mate.

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.060
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Where is that guy?
&gt;&gt;Ned: I don't know where he is, it doesn't

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.060
matter don't ask.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.780
Anyway I'm sure amongst us all, we've all
been and seen the Tour de France.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.259
And it's only when you actually see it face
to face you realize quite the scale of the

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.259
operation.

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.210
So in terms of what I do, broadcasting for
a television network what's called the zone

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.160
technique which is the TV compound area that
you guys occasionally are allowed access to,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.160
you print journalist.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.199
But you know.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.009
Just the size of that, the number of big TV
trucks and the amount of cabling and different

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.130
countries represented there is comparable
only I think.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.590
I mean its way bigger than a World Cup Final
in football which would be way bigger.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.590
&gt;&gt;Richard: Really?

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.690
&gt;&gt;Ned: It's much bigger than a Champions League
final, probably the doubles the amount of

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.690
trucks.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.970
I think it's comparable to just gonna maybe
US presidential race in terms of the.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.250
&gt;&gt;Richard: Wow, that surprises me.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.289
&gt;&gt;Ned: It's just staggering.

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.069
So in terms of the television side, I just
went my God.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.509
German television turns up year after year,
apparently they're not interested in it anymore

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.909
so they've kinda scaled back their presence.

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.340
They had 85 television vehicles on the race
every year.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.280
I mean we don't we've got three.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.960
[laughter]
So the scale was just breathtaking.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.270
Lance Armstrong of course in 2003 that was
his fifth win.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.219
So his stock was possibly never higher than
then.

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.629
And the interest in him was vast.

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:38.590
And everywhere he went he was just descended
upon by hundreds and hundreds of journalists.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.319
I mean it was as if David Beckham had signed
for Real Madrid every day of the week three

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.319
times.

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.479
You know, it was kind of, that blew me away.

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.670
And then there's sort of a flipside of that.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.670
And it's perhaps contradictory.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.819
But the access I got to these riders having
worked in the very sanitized world of football

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.860
where you can't get near the buggers.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.620
Just amazed me that you could go and knock
on their door, find out which hotel room they

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.930
were sleeping him because they'd tell you
at the reception.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:07.930
What room?

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.930
Oh well there's a list.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.080
&gt;&gt;Richard: Well there's some curious things.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.080
&gt;&gt;Ned: Just nuts.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.849
So all that thrilled me and excited me
And over the years, the penny dropped that

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:21.180
actually as a broadcast journalist and obviously
is a written journalist.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.379
Not only are you granted huge access to this
great occasion but you can actually drive

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:29.430
the agenda and even determine the outcome
of the race.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:35.090
When I think of the way we persecuted Michael
Rasmussen in 2007.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.080
We ultimately were the motor that got him
booted off the race.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.770
If we hadn't been doing our job in the way
that we did it, someone else would've won.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.069
And so that doesn't happen in football.

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:46.129
You can't step on the pitch and get involved.

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:48.210
But in cycling, you kind of can.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.360
&gt;&gt;Richard: The lines are far more blurred
aren't they?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.360
&gt;&gt;Ned: The lines are blurred, it's fascinating.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.219
&gt;&gt;Richard: And there is that paradoxical element
to the scale on one hand and the access on

00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:57.219
the other.

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:00.810
And one of the things that comes out in your
book is your relationships with the riders

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.229
as they develop.

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:03.469
&gt;&gt;Ned: Or not, yeah.

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:04.469
&gt;&gt;Richard: Or not.

00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:05.469
Or appear to develop and then.

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:10.360
I mean it's very much like your story of your
dealings with Mark Cavendish for example.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.680
It's like a courtship.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.680
You know where we.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.510
&gt;&gt;Ned: It's quite one sided.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.189
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Richard: Unrequited love.

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:17.189
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:19.970
&gt;&gt;Richard: But you feel it-
&gt;&gt;Ned: I've got a huge crush on him.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.970
&gt;&gt;Richard: On occasions yeah.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:27.229
But it's fascinating how, and it's a very
interesting kind of study of how journalists

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:28.760
interact with those athletes.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.500
I think you probably got some thoughts on
that as well Daniel cause you obviously.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.400
For those of us who don't know, Daniel is
Mark Cavendish's ghost so to speak.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.580
&gt;&gt;Ned: "Boy Racer", Mark Cavendish's book
was actually written by this fella.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.580
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I collaborated.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.170
I dotted a few "i's"
&gt;&gt;Ned: "Boy Racer", was written by.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.381
&gt;&gt;Richard: He sorted out the grammar and the
spelling and stuff.

00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:50.520
[laughter]
But yeah, you know Mark very well.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.100
But what comes across in the book is your
crush on Cavendish.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.690
[laughter]
And there is this kind of, and then it's followed

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:02.310
up in your follow-up book, a mini book which
is called "How Cam Won the Green Jersey."

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.850
Which was an e-book published last year.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.080
You know, so it's a fascinating, like can
you tell us a little bit about how you and

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080
Mark?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.390
&gt;&gt;Ned: Well no let me just, very briefly I'd
like to you know come to you in a second.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.400
But I, I have repeatedly,
Mark and I have this game where I ask him

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.140
for his mobile phone number and he says no.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.150
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I've got it actually.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.592
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ned: Well that's the interesting thing,

00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:27.420
so I've, I mean every time I've seen him I've
gone, "Can I have your mobile phone number?"

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.810
And he goes "No."

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.910
And then I'll say, "Well I'll it again in
20 minutes, see what you say."

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.200
So I, "Can I have your mobile phone number",
he'll go, "No you can't."

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200
This goes on and on.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.560
&gt;&gt;Richard: But things seem to be going very
well for you at certain points.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.400
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah, but that's a funny thing about
Mark, he does kind of.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.490
&gt;&gt;Richard: Lead you on.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.490
&gt;&gt;Ned: Blow hot and cold.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.720
And you know, he never gives you anything
other than compelling television I think,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.720
whether he's.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.590
In fact he's at his most compelling when he's
got a right ass with you.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.820
Because that's when you see the true.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.680
You know it makes my job slightly uncomfortable.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.760
But I'm not there to be his mate, I'm there
to kind of be the lightning conductor and

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.150
the filter through which we experience what
he is as a person.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.150
What drives him.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.950
And I think that across most when he's got
the ass with you, which is quite often.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.810
&gt;&gt;Richard: how uncomfortable are those moments?

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:05.810
&gt;&gt;Ned: Oh, hideously.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.150
It sucks the air out of the room.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:11.220
I mean it's just, when Mark doesn't want.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.580
You know I'm interested in your take on this.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:17.640
When Mark doesn't want to cooperate or when
he thinks you are letting yourself down or

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.700
not paying him enough respect or failing to
understand him or just being daft which is

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.700
quite often.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.800
He just has a way of shutting down the communication,
doesn't he?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.720
It's quite unique.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.900
I mean did you find that, even when you're
you know, when you're writing the book with

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.900
them?

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.900
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I think he's very fickle.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.940
He tends to make up his mind about people.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.950
And, he's obviously made up his mind about
you.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.100
[laughter]
If he likes you he tends to be fine.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.400
I mean I remember about a year or two ago
you know I'd done the whole book with him

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.850
and we got on pretty well.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.580
I wouldn't call us friends, but we had a good
professional relationship.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.520
And I had to do a magazine feature.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.530
And I called him up and asked him to couple
questions.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.220
And I asked him one question, I think it was
about a race.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.250
Milan-San Remo last year or the year before.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.220
And there was a pause on the end the phone.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.220
It was a phone interview.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.240
He said, "Daniel, I don't think I've said
this to you before, that was fucking stupid

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.240
question."

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.220
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Daniel: And I mean that's kind a typical

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.490
of him, like you say even when he's pissed
off it can be very compelling.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.850
&gt;&gt;Ned: Incidentally I've got his mobile phone
number now because another journalist gave

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.270
it to me and said by the way here.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.270
But I've never used it.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.600
I'm far too proud to use it now it, because
it hasn't come from him so I'm not gonna use

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.600
it.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.290
But, I'll sell it to anyone in this room for
about a tenner.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.430
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Richard: Or anyone in the googlesphere.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.640
&gt;&gt;Daniel: That's just us then.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.320
&gt;&gt;Ned: The other guys disappeared.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.770
&gt;&gt;Richard: But, you know that's one very interesting
aspect.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.490
And these characters are kind of a big part
of the story that you tell in the book it.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.360
Lance Armstrong being another one.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.100
I mean you've obviously covered lots of major
sports, how does Lance Armstrong compare to

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.000
some of the kind of A-listers in football
for example?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.280
&gt;&gt;Ned: Armstrong's in the same way that Cavendish
is a bundle of contradictions, so too is Armstrong.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.680
But I mean Armstrong, I've lost interest in
him a bit now.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.680
But that's only quite recently.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.520
I mean I found him absolutely compelling in
all sorts of different ways.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.860
Because he, you know I found tussling with
him on the finish line a different kind of

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.860
experience.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.310
Cause he was quite even-tempered.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:22.570
But he had this way of fixing you with a little
glare.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.200
And lying through his teeth to you like that.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.030
And you kind of knew it was a lie and he knew
that you knew it was a lie.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.980
But we were playing this game and it sort
of dancing around that.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.580
But it was such fun with him.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:39.270
I did, for all we think of his record as an
athlete, good and bad, he was compelling I

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.070
think to watch in all situations.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:47.520
&gt;&gt;Richard: Shall we kind of segue very smoothly
from talking about Armstrong to talking about

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.420
the rider to whom Armstrong was perhaps--
&gt;&gt;Ned: Lifetime champion, yeah.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.620
&gt;&gt;Richard: compared the most.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.280
"The Cannibal", Eddy Merckx, the greatest
cyclist of them all.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.570
Who quite strangely enough for Merckx and
Armstrong were kind of rivals through history

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.570
in a sense.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:08.880
Merckx is generally acknowledged as the greatest
cyclist of all time, and Armstrong though

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.350
during his reign was regularly kind of mentioned
as perhaps the greatest cyclist of all time.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:17.500
Can you maybe just tell us a little bit about
your approach to this book?

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.640
Because Merckx didn't cooperate as such with
you did he?

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.530
&gt;&gt;Daniel: No he told me pretty much from the
outset that he wouldn't collaborate.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.900
I don't think that's that unusual with biographies.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.330
I think, and it kind of freed me up really.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:38.530
I didn't, he's one of these people, he's really
dehumanized and demystified himself over the

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.200
last 30 or 40 years since he's been retired.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.810
Kind of disappointingly, like Pele you know
with his Viagra adverts and you know the nonsense.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.810
&gt;&gt;Ned: MasterCard.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.830
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, MasterCard and the nonsense
he talks about the current Brazilian footballers.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.700
So Merckx is quite a disappointing character.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.600
But when you juxtapose that with his achievements
which are just extraordinary and the person

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.160
he turned into when he was on a bike, that
in itself was fascinating.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.590
But it was really that that I wanted to concentrate
on.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:10.510
Because, we're not that interested in, I mean,
it goes back to what you are saying about

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.580
your interactions with these guys.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.060
We're not that interested in them as human
beings, we're interested in them because they

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.680
can do things that we can't.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.130
And that was very much the case with Merckx.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:26.460
And another thing that I really wanted to
tell was the story of all the people's lives,

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.460
careers he ruined.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.170
I mean he sounds like a despot and he kind
of was on a bike.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:35.350
And there was this whole generation of guys
who could and probably thought when they were

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:41.820
19, 20, 21 that they were gonna be you know
Mohammed Ali on a bike, or Pele on a bike.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.190
And that didn't happen.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.330
And it was interesting really looking at how
that shaped them as characters.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.590
It actually made the more complete characters
than Merckx.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:55.780
And Merckx sort of remained this kind of Peter
Pan never grew up, because you know losing

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.090
is an inexperience, we all have setbacks in
our lives.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.110
But Merckx managed to keep a lid on everything.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:08.560
And kind of remain in his own mind immortal,
invulnerable until the age of about 32, 33

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.450
when he finally lost for the first time.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.740
And then couldn't deal with it, he found it
very, very difficult to deal with.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:19.110
&gt;&gt;Ned: Can I just ask Daniel, I mean having
to learn about cycling history in the way

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.631
that I have to because I didn't watch it first
time around.

00:15:21.631 --> 00:15:23.700
And anyway, Merckx was before my time.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.940
But what I really got from your book was a
sense of a rider who could do it on all terrains.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.920
And that's kind of remarkable in the modern
era to think back to a rider who did that.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.140
So he could time trial like no other.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.270
He could win rolling intermediate stages.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.780
He won in the high mountains and he could
win up on sprint.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:47.070
If you chucked Eddy Merckx on to a carbon
fiber bike and stuck him in a modern peloton,

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.230
where would you find his, what would he do?

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.230
What would he achieve?

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.530
And where would that take him?

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.440
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It's a good question.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.320
I actually just wrote a magazine feature about
this.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.790
I think the way cycling has gone, it's become
so specialized, kind of disappointingly so.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:09.840
To the extent where a guy now will literally
dedicate six months if not a year to one race.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.120
And he will be thinking about that race the
whole time.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.650
He'll be developing his bike with a view to
that race.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.900
He'll be getting coaching with a view to that
race.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.690
And that really wasn't the case.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:27.290
And that kind of falsifies Merckx's achievements
when you compare them to achievements nowadays.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:32.770
Is he probably wasn't as good pound for pound
in the Tour de France as you know whoever

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.520
wins it this year would be.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.520
He would lose.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.160
Because he was never as fit I don't think
as the guys are now.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.200
But he, he was good enough throughout the
years to beat those guys cause they didn't

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200
have access to those things.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.410
&gt;&gt;Ned: So the modern sport would force him
if you like to specialize, to choose one of

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.410
those routes.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.610
And what would be that route do you think?

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.930
What was his single greatest strength?

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.990
Was it – –
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I mean I think.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.920
&gt;&gt;Ned: Would he be [Migar Linderhine]?

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.090
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I think he would be a one-day racer.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:02.950
I mean he's a fairly big guy, six-foot and
weighs 75 kg.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.799
I would imagine that he would concentrate
on the classics, the one-day races in springtime.

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:10.350
&gt;&gt;Richard: He'd be a far more limited rider
then wouldn't he?

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.680
And he probably wouldn't have the respect
that is his due?

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.089
I mean he's not.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.250
Because you couldn't imagine him really going
head-to-head with some of the great climbers.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.970
Why were those great climbers not able to
put him on the ropes back in the day?

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.300
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It's not were.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.650
But again I think there's another aspect of
it was this aura.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:36.650
And he, particularly the first year when he
won the Tour de France in 1969, he really

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.650
traumatized people.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:42.700
There was actually a quote from a guy, one
of his old team managers in my book saying,

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.640
he actually, you know, they were shell-shocked.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.780
Not just for a few weeks, but for years afterwards.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.340
And one of the things he said to me was, "They
would never, they would not dare to attack

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.300
because it was like literally dangling bait
in front of him."

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.930
And as soon as you attack, that was literally
like lighting.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.230
&gt;&gt;Richard: Tell us the great story about the
wine.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.480
Zandegù and the wine.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.480
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:12.641
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I remember the tour with him, [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Daniel: No I mean you know races, the Tour

00:18:12.641 --> 00:18:16.480
de France, now you get the hotspot sprints
for points for the green jersey.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.400
Whereas it used to be very common for the
spot prices to be up for grabs, like bottles

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.470
of wine.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.220
On this particular case in the Tour of Italy,
they went past this famous Italian singer's

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:32.340
Château kind of castle manor house that he
had.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.510
And he was putting up 50 bottles of Chianti
for the winner of this sprint.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:42.080
And this Italian rider Dino Zandegù who became
a bit of a folk hero because he was just,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.320
he was a circus act.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.340
You know he would, appear holding birthday
cakes in the middle of the race and singing

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.420
"Happy birthday."

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.400
[laughter]
So this one day he resolved that he was gonna

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.400
win this Chianti.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.570
He said whenever there was wine up for grab,
and this is something that I kind of picked

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.570
up when I interviewed him.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:04.070
Because you could kind of tell he was fond
of a glass of Chianti or two

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.760
&gt;&gt;Richard: He got drunk during the course
of the day, didn't he?

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.100
&gt;&gt;Daniel: But he was particularly motivated
for this kind of sprint.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.360
So on this one day, he described it in perfect
detail.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.950
You know coming around a bridge and there
it was the banner.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.560
And he could see it, and off he went.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.850
And he was a sprinter anyway, so on this particular
he managed to beat Merckx.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.850
Completely meaningless, Merckx was gonna win
the race.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.150
He was minutes ahead on the general classification.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.770
And when he saw Zandegù cross the line, he
was screaming at you, "You bastardo, you'll

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.970
never race again."

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.710
Or "I'm gonna kill you", and, "That Chianti's
mine."

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:44.940
Anyway that night, they were all staying in
the same hotel, all the teams up on Copper

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.940
Mountain.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.720
And Merckx knocked on his door and demanding
half of the Chianti otherwise he was gonna

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.820
see to it that this guy never race again.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.930
That's kind of, I'm sure there's a degree
of truth in that.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.360
But I'm not sure –
&gt;&gt;Richard: The other day he beat Merckx again

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.980
and had to hide in somebody's house.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.020
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Beat Merckx again and he pulled
off the road just after the finish line, and

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:11.560
he burst into this little wooden shack near
the finish line to a completely deserted house

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.820
and he went upstairs.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.270
And there was an eighty-year-old woman asleep,
and she started screaming.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.750
He said "Granny, granny don't worry, I'm not
gonna do anything to you, but Eddy Merckx

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.220
is chasing me and he wants to rip my head
and face off."

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.520
[laughter]
He actually saved it now, I mean I didn't

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.830
believe a word of it.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.420
[laughter]
But hope I present it in the book in such

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.420
a way that.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.110
&gt;&gt;Richard: You get a sense that Zandegù is
a circus act.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.980
It's interesting because paradoxically Merckx,
you know the way you describe him there he's

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.260
sort of a mafia boss or a bully.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.390
And yet he's quite gentle guy as well.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:50.280
He's got this, and he's racked by the insecurity
and doubt himself.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:57.270
You know, which in contrast to this marauding
bullying bike rider and racer that he was.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.490
&gt;&gt;Ned: That's no different from lots of bike
riders is it?

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:00.490
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Same with Cavendish.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.570
&gt;&gt;Ned: There's a life on the bike and there's
a life off the bike.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.710
&gt;&gt;Richard: Apart from Lance Armstrong who
kind of had that.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.840
&gt;&gt;Ned: took his on bike persona and turned
it into his off bike.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.190
&gt;&gt;Richard: And you know Armstrong was probably
well you know and then Armstrong was the next

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.190
guy.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.520
[Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Richard: That was completely accidental,

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.660
that was totally accidental.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.430
&gt;&gt;Ned: Should we ask him about that?

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.950
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Let's ask him about that.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.460
&gt;&gt;Richard: Oh goodness, if you must.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.480
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Daniel: So you've written a book called

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.480
"Slaying the Badger."

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.760
Now "the badger" is Bernard Hinault.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.870
Which you want to explain first of all how
he got this nickname and why it's appropriate?

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:37.270
&gt;&gt;Richard: I don't think the reason why he
got the nickname owes to the person he became

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.270
in a way.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:45.600
It's kind of odd, the origins of it were apparently
when he was a young cyclist, a teammate from

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.370
Brittany used to greet him "Hey badger, hey
blairo."

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.372
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It's quite common in France isn't
it?

00:21:50.372 --> 00:21:55.710
&gt;&gt;Richard: Apparently in Brittany it's a common
form of greeting, "Hey badger.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.190
" [chuckles] So with Hinault this kind of
stuck.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:03.900
And then I think I had this image of a badger
as this cuddly kind of toy.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.500
And a badger is really pretty vicious apparently.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:13.820
And the jaw kind of, once it clamps, you can
only get it off by dislocating the jaw apparently.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.370
And that sums up Hinault to a T. He grew into
that nickname, and it caught on.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:25.951
And you know, when, when I went with a good
friend/translator of mine and Daniel to interview

00:22:25.951 --> 00:22:26.951
him.

00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:30.300
You know we asked him, he quite liked it,
didn't he?

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.940
And he goes, "Yeah."

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.780
And I think it kind of suited him.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.100
He said, "Badgers a little bit nasty like
me."

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.590
So it does kind of sum him up, yeah.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.200
&gt;&gt;Ned: In terms of what happened on a bike,
sorry Daniel.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.440
When I read your book a while ago, when I
had been reading Daniels.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:53.200
The way in the general classification Merckx
would make decisive moves that would nowadays

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.390
in the modern era be considered suicidal.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.120
Cause they just go off with 100 km to go on
their own and just kind of wing it.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.290
"Let's get this done, let's just do it."

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.690
Hinault was the same right?

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.470
I mean repeatedly that would be his modus
operandi.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.380
&gt;&gt;Richard: To a point, in the early part of
his career certainly.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.781
And it's interesting cause Hinault retired,
I'm sorry, Merckx retired in 78', the year

00:23:11.781 --> 00:23:14.250
that Hinault won his first Tour de France.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:19.740
And I think Anquetil retired the year that
Merckx also won his first tour.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.230
Or there was some neat cut off between these
eras.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:29.270
And there was the Anquetil era, followed by
the Merckx era followed almost directly afterward

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.200
by the Hinault era.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.891
And Hinault was, he was so physically capable
I think that early on in his career, you know

00:23:37.891 --> 00:23:42.470
he realized he could win big races and he
was quite aggressive.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.770
He suffered a bad knee injury in 1980.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.850
And it caused him to withdraw from the tour
midway through when he was wearing the yellow

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.010
jersey.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:55.750
And in the dead of night, after the Germans
had done their stories for the next day Hinault

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:59.890
orchestrated this exit which didn't go down
very well for journalists.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:05.000
And after that, he was a slightly different
kind of rider.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.559
He did go to the world championship that year
and won it in that style, that buccaneering.

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:12.460
But he was more calculating afterwards.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:19.780
And that calculation extended to individual
races but also to his career.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.360
He became far more selective.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.400
Not quite as selective as Lance Armstrong
who only went to the tour to win each year.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.360
But far more selective than Merckx had been.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.900
You know he set his sights on, he had appointments.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.809
And when he turned up for an appointment he
won it every time.

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:40.309
He would say, "I'm gonna win that race", and
he would go and win it.

00:24:40.309 --> 00:24:45.170
And at other races he would sort of become
this incredible teammate to his, to lesser

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.380
riders who he would help and act as this incredible
domestique.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:56.180
And speaking to his former teammates, they
were, they spoke so kind of warmly even lovingly

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.180
of him.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.900
Which again is in stark contrast to the image
that we had of him and the image that his

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.900
rivals had of him.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.320
Because he was a brute and a bully.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.500
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Particularly in this Tour de France
that your book is about.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:14.160
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah the books about the 86' tour
where he and the American Greg LeMond lined

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.860
up in the same La Vie Claire team.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:21.070
The previous year in 85', Hinault had won
his fifth tour.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.860
But he'd done so with the help of LeMond.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.970
I mean he probably wouldn't have won that
tour had LeMond not helped them.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.730
He had a terrible crash Saint-Étienne and
sort of finished the race with a broken nose

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.400
and bronchitis, two black eyes.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.410
It looked brilliant.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.730
[laughter]
But he struggled to the line and LeMond had

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.070
helped him.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.710
And LeMond probably had his chance to win
that tourney, he held back on team orders

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.130
in order to help Hinault.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.910
And Hinault allegedly promised him that he
would help him the following year which was

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.780
Hinault's final tour in '86.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.470
And he made this pledge to help LeMond to
win it.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.550
And he made it to several people LeMond himself
and to journalist.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:26:00.220
But of course as the '86 tour approaches,
people are starting to question whether Hinault

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.220
will honor the pledge.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.150
And he has, you know the President of France
urging him to forget about it.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:12.170
The whole French media and people really you
know forget about the American.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.700
You know go for the sixth tour which would've
been historic.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:19.100
You know in front of Merckx and Anquetil as
a six-time winner.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.460
So the temptation was huge.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.110
And really as the tour began it seemed to
be very much open.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.290
And as it began, and as it went into its first
week and then hit the tourneys, it became

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:33.991
very very obvious to everybody, especially
LeMond that Hinault was not going to help

00:26:33.991 --> 00:26:36.490
LeMond, he was out to try to win it himself.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:41.440
So what followed was this fascinating kind
of internal battle between them and their

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.500
own team.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.929
And the team you know ended up being split
and down the middle really, with the Swiss

00:26:46.929 --> 00:26:49.420
riders in the middle as neutrals.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.250
And it was fascinating.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.790
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Two very contrasting characters,
but you had two very contrasting experiences

00:26:55.790 --> 00:27:00.660
of Etienne, talk a little bit about them
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, I mean Hinault.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.510
LeMond is very open and friendly and warm.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.970
Whereas Hinault is very cold and coarse and
short.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:15.470
And I went into LeMond, you know the book
is, it's funny because the book is about LeMond

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.470
and Hinault.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.160
But Hinault is the person that really seems
to fascinate people.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.510
But LeMond is equally fascinating in his own
way.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:28.370
He was this kinda young prodigy who wasn't
streetwise in the way that Hinault was, he

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.150
was just hugely, hugely talented.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:34.490
But he was wracked by insecurity, by doubt,
by fragility.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.560
And it was not just a physical.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.250
&gt;&gt;Ned: Wracked by diarrhea at one point.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.250
&gt;&gt;Richard: Wracked by diarrhea.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.010
It was not just physical battle between them,
it was the psychological battle.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.170
Are you trying to get me to read it?

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.220
&gt;&gt;Ned: No, no.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:51.100
&gt;&gt;Richard: And LeMond you know went into LeMond
and he was just.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.880
He'd been very hard to pin down initially.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.650
You know 9 months it took me to arrange an
interview with him.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.110
And to go and see him.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.490
And once I was face-to-face with him, he couldn't
have been better.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:01.910
I mean he was brilliant.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:07.059
And just the stories that will come out of
him were just incredible.

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:08.890
Such a contrast to Hinault.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:16.360
He's become more, because Hinault you know
did subject him to a very horrendous experience

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.400
during that tour.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.920
You know I think it was pretty, it was pretty
hard and pretty harrowing.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.540
But he's kind of softened to Hinault over
the years.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.760
He's kind forgiven him in a way.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.830
Because I think he understands now why Hinault
did it.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.490
Why it was important to him.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:35.702
I don't think, I think for Hinault to have
been seen to be just basically riding in the

00:28:35.702 --> 00:28:39.550
service of LeMond I think it would've damaged
Hinault 's legacy.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:43.059
And I think Hinault kind of on some level
realized that.

00:28:43.059 --> 00:28:47.500
And so the only way for him to help LeMond
or to be beaten was to kind of go down all

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.570
guns blazing in the way that he did.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:53.870
I think if Hinault can rationalize that, I
think that's probably what he did.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.020
&gt;&gt;Ned: And still the last French winner of
the tour which is--

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.590
&gt;&gt;Richard: 85'
&gt;&gt;Ned: --just extraordinary isn't it?

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:04.090
Is that a way of bringing things up to date
and maybe just sort of throwing it open to.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.929
I mean, there may be no questions in which
case were happy to ramble on.

00:29:07.929 --> 00:29:09.549
We can ramble on all day.

00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:11.310
&gt;&gt;Richard: And I can give the diarrhea story.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.310
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah, go for it, yeah.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.310
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male 1: A question for Daniel about the

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.800
ghost writing process.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:22.800
You said it was very different from Merckx
and LeMond.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:30.560
Could you describe how [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Oh Merckx is not a ghost, it's not

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.560
an autobiography.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.560
It's a biography.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.850
No,
&gt;&gt;Ned: He said no.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.620
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Daniel: No not at all.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.010
m&gt;&gt;Male 1: [Inaudible]?

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.750
&gt;&gt;Daniel: How'd it work?

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.450
So, I mean, I think people do it.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.929
Rich has done a couple of ghost writing jobs.

00:29:42.929 --> 00:29:43.929
&gt;&gt;Richard: One, yeah.

00:29:43.929 --> 00:29:44.929
&gt;&gt;male 1: Oh OK.

00:29:44.929 --> 00:29:48.620
&gt;&gt;Daniel: But we, I think they work broadly
the same way.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.670
So I spent about a week with Mark.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.970
Yeah, it's too long to do like the whole day.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:00.020
So you do maybe two hours in the morning,
two hours at night.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.160
You know that gives you a number of hours,
and then you.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.030
We probably did 20, 25 hours in total.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.470
He was really fine.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:14.130
The most alarm, well there were a lot of alarming
moments in the process I would say.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.929
The one that sticks in my mind will always
be and you probably heard this story, I've

00:30:17.929 --> 00:30:19.460
told this story to so many people.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.270
But when I finished the manuscript, and his
girlfriend, and how that overlaps with the

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.870
book you know that's another good story.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.600
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male 2: Can we get that story?

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.520
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, we can get that story.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:37.920
&gt;&gt;male 1: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Might be it might be, bear with

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.920
me.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.960
Yeah so I finished the manuscript and I went
to see Mark.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.520
And Melissa his girlfriend at the time was
you know I knew her because I'd been in that

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.670
house a lot.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:51.080
And she was, and she would generally be my
point of contact when I couldn't.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.530
He was sometimes a nightmare.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:56.549
I remember one day saying , I was at the end
of my tether.

00:30:56.549 --> 00:31:00.540
I couldn't get a hold of him and she sent
me, I sent her a message "Can you please get

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.540
him to call me?"

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.350
She sent me one back, "That lying little git.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.100
I've had just about enough of this."

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:11.140
But anyway, we finished the manuscript and
I went to meet them in Manchester.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:16.090
And, just to get a bit of feedback from them
about what they thought about it.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.560
And you know, we ordered drinks in this bar
and we're sitting there.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.809
And Melissa's there and Mark's there and I
said "So guys how was it?

00:31:22.809 --> 00:31:24.230
What you think of it?"

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.710
And Mark is saying oh yeah yeah yeah great
manual, great work.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.410
And I turned to Melissa and said "What about
you Melissa?"

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:36.480
And she said "Well you know, there are a few
things that happen that you describe them,

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.030
it wasn't exactly the way they happen.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.320
Like the Way, Mark proposed to me."

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.179
And these days I could see the fury that Ned's
probably familiar with Mark eyes.

00:31:45.179 --> 00:31:49.000
And he turned to her, and there was a pause
of about 10 seconds.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.500
Then he went, "Melissa, it's a fucking story."

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.540
[laughter]
And I said, "Hang on Mark, it's not fictional."

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:00.870
[laughter]
And yeah generally it was fine.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:05.150
[laughter]
The thing about the girlfriend, I'm not sure

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.420
I want to go into it really.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.970
I mean he happened to dedicate it to Melissa.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:17.270
&gt;&gt;male 3: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Daniel: You're right, actually I do remember

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.270
now.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.270
Yeah.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:27.780
I mean, he happened to split up with Melissa
just as the hot bite came out, which was unfortunate.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:44.660
&gt;&gt;male 4: Do you think he's gonna be able
to cope at Skye without having the team, the

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.032
full support of the team?

00:32:46.032 --> 00:32:47.032
&gt;&gt;male 5: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Ned: Well I think it is something.

00:32:47.032 --> 00:32:51.710
We talked about this haven't we briefly, but
I think it's, there's only one answer that,

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.030
it's thoroughly compromised isn't it?

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.559
But whichever way you look at it, is compromised.

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:56.530
If they pulled it off it would be astonishing.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.770
I don't, I don't know if they will pull it
off.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:02.140
&gt;&gt;male 4: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah it's a different era, they were

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.620
all doping for a start.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.740
[laughter]
You know.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:12.429
And then, for all that they did pull it off,
they also didn't put it off as well.

00:33:12.429 --> 00:33:14.929
It wasn't like the recipe that worked every
single time.

00:33:14.929 --> 00:33:21.030
Let's not forget how Jan Ullrich kind of used
to try throw down his opposition to Lance

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.490
Armstrong in this kind a team full of chiefs.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:29.010
There were 30 Indians and no chief.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.340
It's frustrating to me because the more and
more I think about this year's Tour de France

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.790
and the way that the tour has been designed
with two longtime trials.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.290
And the absence of Alberto Contador.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:42.049
The more I think that this is Bradley Wiggins'
only and best chance of winning the Tour de

00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:43.049
France.

00:33:43.049 --> 00:33:48.400
And if Dave Brailsford when he calls Team
Sky into existence, if his stated aim of producing

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.830
a British Tour de France winner within five
years had any credibility than this is the

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.830
moment.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:58.010
And I think that they should really be throwing
the kitchen sink at Bradley Wiggins and his

00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.740
tour.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:05.321
Where the desire and the impulse and the motor
actually came from to sign Mark Cavendish

00:34:05.321 --> 00:34:07.690
on this multimillion pound contract.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.830
Which in one sense seems entirely obvious.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:14.440
But where that came from I don't know, how
high up within the organization of Skye you

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.440
have to go.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.069
Whether it actually came from Dave Brailsford
himself or someone above him I don't know.

00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:25.059
&gt;&gt;Richard: The irony I think is that it was
almost the end of the, the move was engineered,

00:34:25.059 --> 00:34:30.129
or came when there were serious doubts about
whether aim of winning the tour was actually

00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:31.129
achievable.

00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:33.639
&gt;&gt;Ned: Absolutely, so like a very solid Plan
B.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:41.169
&gt;&gt;Richard: The move was basically done in
the first part of last year on the back of

00:34:41.169 --> 00:34:43.879
Wiggins having quite a spectacular failure
at the 2010 tour.

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:47.879
When it really didn't look at that point like
he was ever gonna actually become a tour winner.

00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:50.659
And if somebody did emerge as a potential
tour winner, it would be a bit further down

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:51.659
the line.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:55.359
You know Cavendish is your banker for lots
of wins, lots of publicity.

00:34:55.359 --> 00:35:00.619
And then, the same Cavendish and Wiggins than
you know finishes third in the Vuelta with

00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:02.089
Chris Froome second.

00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:04.420
And suddenly, you know.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.739
But I can see, I can understand why they retained
Cavendish.

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:11.390
The most bankable name and world cycling really.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:16.869
And there's still an element, momentum seems
to be building towards Wiggins certainly starting

00:35:16.869 --> 00:35:18.859
to tour as a favorite.

00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:21.829
And you know some people are already talking
about it being his to lose which.

00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:23.210
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I'm not sure about that.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.359
&gt;&gt;Ned: You're not overstating it.

00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:25.359
&gt;&gt;Richard: I think so.

00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:27.979
&gt;&gt;Ned: Cadel Evans is still probably the favorite
given his experience.

00:35:27.979 --> 00:35:31.599
&gt;&gt;Richard: I think you know you can, with
someone who's, with Lance Armstrong, there

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:33.319
was an element of certainty.

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:35.010
Because, you know.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:40.640
But with Wiggins he's finishing third in the
Vuelta last year I don't think it's enough

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.039
solid proof that he can win the tour.

00:35:43.039 --> 00:35:45.920
Winning Pyrenees is not enough solid evidence
that he can win the tour.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.420
But I think he's definitely capable of doing
it.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.290
And I think you're right, that it has to be
a concerted effort.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:59.990
I think that the way it's coming out they
might you know, Cavendish might be winging

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:04.170
it a little bit and not have the lead out
train and be left to his own devices.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.380
I don't know if you.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.630
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I think the big problem could be
groups within the group.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:13.491
I think basically the problem is, and what
the guys at T-Mobile use say is they had to

00:36:13.491 --> 00:36:14.880
do two jobs.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:21.450
And what ended up deciding who they worked
for that day or in that particular moment

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.710
when they felt you know pulled in two directions
was often who they like more.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.609
And that is another issue.

00:36:26.609 --> 00:36:31.089
I think Mark's probably more of a natural
leader then Bradley.

00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:37.529
At Mark also pisses people off, can piss people
off, although he is a great leader.

00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:43.380
So that's another thing they've got a guard
against whether you know just in terms of

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.380
morale in the team.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.430
If all these guys who are doing the kind of
worker bees, if they get really tired and

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.539
they get down in people's moods are kind of
fickle in the Tour de France because they're

00:36:52.539 --> 00:36:53.539
so tired.

00:36:53.539 --> 00:36:54.880
Then I think it'll be difficult to manage
maybe.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.520
&gt;&gt;Ned: And the other factor, I'll come to
you in a second.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.249
Just to throw in, you may be preempting your
question here.

00:37:00.249 --> 00:37:02.660
But you mentioned his name briefly is Chris
Froome.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.950
He might end up being the story of the summer.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:08.500
We're focusing on Wiggins and Cavendish, but
he's a big unknown.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.210
You know his bilharzia, his recurrent bilharzia.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:14.809
And then he came down with pneumonia.

00:37:14.809 --> 00:37:17.800
And then he got rid of that and he went off
to Kenya to his brother's wedding came back

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.800
with typhoid.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.000
So he's been wiped out for months, but he's
in full training now and he's off on the tour

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
of Romandie.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.050
So he could be capable of anything or nothing.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.480
But if he's capable of anything, that anything
just might be winning the Tour de France.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.150
&gt;&gt;Richard: If it's like the Vuelta last year
where he was stronger.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.630
&gt;&gt;Ned: He was the stronger of the two.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:38.760
Let's sorry, a question in the blue shirt.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:59.559
&gt;&gt;male 6: [Inaudible]
Recently it hasn't really got my interest.

00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:09.559
I think it's because I thought everybody was
using drugs or doping.

00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:17.170
So my question to you is [Inaudible] because
right now I feel after 6 months [Inaudible]

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:23.229
&gt;&gt;Ned: That's a big one.

00:38:23.229 --> 00:38:27.799
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I mean, there's no doubt that drugs
have been in cycling from the start pretty

00:38:27.799 --> 00:38:28.799
much.

00:38:28.799 --> 00:38:33.569
I mean strychnine, caffeine from the start.

00:38:33.569 --> 00:38:34.799
&gt;&gt;Richard: Morphine, alcohol.

00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:36.859
&gt;&gt;Ned: There's various different kinds.

00:38:36.859 --> 00:38:37.859
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:38:37.859 --> 00:38:42.599
And I mean one misconception, one of the things
I talk about in my book is that it used to

00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:43.599
be.

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:48.849
Now they refer to it as light doping i.e.
like stimulants and caffeine whereas now it's

00:38:48.849 --> 00:38:49.849
heavy doping.

00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:54.099
Because I think people of made a leap in their
minds because now it's syringes, and it kind

00:38:54.099 --> 00:38:56.099
of seems slightly sordid.

00:38:56.099 --> 00:38:58.660
Blood bags you know and shadowy doctors.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.630
Whereas back then, it was, it seemed quite
innocent in a way.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.410
But it's always been there.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:07.940
And that is a misconception, you know a lot
of the methods and products that were around

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.290
now were around 30, 40 years ago.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:17.940
It's just that, we've stigmatized in a way
by making the punishments more draconian.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.869
You know we say now its two years, four years
and all of the sudden in people's minds "God

00:39:21.869 --> 00:39:23.220
this is a really terrible crime."

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:28.869
Whereas if you say you're banned for a week,
then people start to view it as something

00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:29.869
that's kind of trifling.

00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:31.279
&gt;&gt;Ned: Eddy Mokes got a month right?

00:39:31.279 --> 00:39:35.140
&gt;&gt;Daniel: And then it was, yeah he didn't
even get the month.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.390
So that's one of the things.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:42.880
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah, I would suggest that, even in
the 10 years I've been covering it actually.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.249
And I understand entirely what you're saying,
you're right to feel that in some ways.

00:39:46.249 --> 00:39:52.380
But I would suggest hesitantly that actually
incrementally over those 10 years the instances

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.619
of doping have come down, year on year.

00:39:55.619 --> 00:39:59.680
And even those instances where people have
doped, I think probably the percentage of

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.650
advantage they're gaining is probably smaller.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:07.940
In other words, the conclusion I'm trying
to draw is that it's getting better.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.309
And so what you do?

00:40:09.309 --> 00:40:12.890
Is this a point to give up on it?

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:13.890
I'm not sure it is.

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.470
I think that probably they, it's heading in
the right direction albeit slowly.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:21.660
&gt;&gt;Richard: I'm recently comforted in that
clean the riders are winning big races now

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.720
in a way that it wasn't 10 years ago.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.720
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.739
&gt;&gt;Richard: When I say clean, it's all relative.

00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:29.170
I mean we have this.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:33.769
Well I'm not casting aspersions here at all.

00:40:33.769 --> 00:40:37.420
You know we have this very black and white
viewpoint of doping that you're either a drug

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.489
cheat or you're not.

00:40:38.489 --> 00:40:43.799
And it's just so complex you know there's
this huge gray area, and the actual line between

00:40:43.799 --> 00:40:46.869
doping and clean is moving all the time.

00:40:46.869 --> 00:40:50.390
You know that's something I covered in another
book about Team Sky where you know it was

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:54.859
very obvious that if you’re a professional
athlete, if you're training for the Tour de

00:40:54.859 --> 00:40:57.930
France it's your job to go it's close to that
line is possible.

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:01.499
And to do everything that you can that is
legal.

00:41:01.499 --> 00:41:05.250
Which might not be considered natural or even
ethical, I don't know.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.250
And by some people.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:11.009
Athletes at that level are doing things and
taking things that the rest of us would regard

00:41:11.009 --> 00:41:13.720
as crazy.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.329
But it's kind of the responsibility to do
that.

00:41:15.329 --> 00:41:18.229
They would be kind of silly not to I think.

00:41:18.229 --> 00:41:19.690
In a way.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.999
So I think it's a very foggy area.

00:41:22.999 --> 00:41:27.960
And there isn't this kind of, an athlete doesn't
decide alright I'm gonna dope today, I'm gonna

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.420
go from being a clean rider to a cheat.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:35.029
I think as David Miller very eloquently described
in his book, it's a process.

00:41:35.029 --> 00:41:39.300
But, there's always this puzzle.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.990
This game of being as close to that line as
you can possibly be.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:46.720
&gt;&gt;Daniel: The other thing I'd say is that
there's this misconception that the media

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.150
knows.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.759
It's a charge that's often leveled at us that
we spent time with these athletes.

00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:54.390
We do have really good access like Ned said
earlier.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.130
We don't know, we have no idea.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.609
And the athletes themselves have no idea what
another guy.

00:41:58.609 --> 00:42:00.050
I mean in some cases they might.

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:06.670
You know, at the Tour de France, the pressroom
is, you will not ever walked into a more cynicism

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.869
fueled room.

00:42:09.869 --> 00:42:16.559
You know we watch the stage on the big screen
and you know as soon as anyone does something

00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:18.400
incredible they'll be a nudge, nudge and a
wink, wink.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.589
But really we don't know.

00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:20.589
&gt;&gt;Ned: Rumors.

00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:23.880
&gt;&gt;Daniel: And often we're basing that on stereotypes.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.599
&gt;&gt;Ned: And sometimes you'll be live to a,
I mean I don't dwell on it.

00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:31.460
You will be live to a decent rumor that you
can follow through and actually affect the

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:32.460
challenge.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.880
I mean that does happen.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.119
It happened with me and Stephan Schumacher
after his time trial win where I basically

00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:39.309
accused him of doping.

00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:43.069
He was wearing the yellow jersey at the tour,
he didn't like it one bit.

00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:44.819
But I was right and he was wrong you know.

00:42:44.819 --> 00:42:48.089
And he's, it doesn't always happen, you gotta
be pretty sure of your ground.

00:42:48.089 --> 00:42:50.980
It happened with Rasmussen, albeit he never
failed a dope test.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:43:15.969
Sorry can I just come to this guy?
&gt;&gt;male 7: do you think the relevance [Inaudible]

00:43:15.969 --> 00:43:21.519
over the past few years [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah.

00:43:21.519 --> 00:43:22.519
Doesn't look good.

00:43:22.519 --> 00:43:23.519
&gt;&gt;male 7: Do you think that's something that
we seize upon?

00:43:23.519 --> 00:43:24.519
Is it fair to seize upon that [Inaudible].

00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:27.470
Is it something that it's just you do something
that doesn't say you're one or the other?

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.470
&gt;&gt;Richard: I think it's dangerous to make
any assumptions isn't it?

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:29.470
I mean we could make the same assumption about
Chris Froome who rode into second in the Vuelta

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:30.470
last year.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:34.119
But we knew that he'd been ill and that you
had this terrible bad luck.

00:43:34.119 --> 00:43:38.809
So, it's like a very British mindset perhaps.

00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:43.039
You know the cheating foreigners and the plucky
Brit.

00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:47.769
So you know, I think it's always dangerous
to make assumptions one way or the other.

00:43:47.769 --> 00:43:49.400
There could be a logical explanation.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:55.029
I mean Joe Barr apparently had dental problems
that could explain it, who knows.

00:43:55.029 --> 00:43:58.079
Inconsistency though, or massive leap in improvements.

00:43:58.079 --> 00:44:00.359
&gt;&gt;Ned: Thomas Voeckler
&gt;&gt;Richard: It's always suspicious.

00:44:00.359 --> 00:44:01.359
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah.

00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:02.569
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Tom Boland.

00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:09.789
&gt;&gt;Richard: Well there's an interesting little
bit in your book your new book the e-book,

00:44:09.789 --> 00:44:13.130
where you have a conversation with an ESO
official who suggests that.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:18.089
&gt;&gt;Ned: I mean on last year's tour there at
this funny moment where it almost became a

00:44:18.089 --> 00:44:21.380
possibility that Thomas Voeckler would win
the Tour de France.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:26.589
I mean having been not up to consideration,
it just flickered for second, hang on this

00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:28.160
ain't gonna happen is it?

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:33.349
But after 10 days in the yellow at which point
I said this guy who is very high up in the

00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:34.829
organization, I said.

00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:36.799
&gt;&gt;Richard: What's his name?

00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:38.279
&gt;&gt;Ned: Matthieu Peres.

00:44:38.279 --> 00:44:42.180
And I said, "That would be a thing wouldn't
it?

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:46.670
Out of nowhere of Frenchman after all this
time winning you know we're two days from

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:47.710
Paris.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:48.969
This could happen."

00:44:48.969 --> 00:44:53.289
And he went, "I hope it doesn't happen.

00:44:53.289 --> 00:44:54.400
This needs to stop now."

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.400
And I went, "No!?", and he goes.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:01.660
[laughter]
Now I don't know, he's not party to information.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.140
But he sensitive to those insinuations.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.829
And to the image of the tour.

00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:05.829
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:07.690
&gt;&gt;Daniel: This is on YouTube Ned, you know
that right.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.150
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:16.550
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Richard: Bleep that bit out.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:31.610
&gt;&gt;male 8: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Richard: More time to think, I think.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:36.269
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I think that cycling in sports that's
least vulnerable to that kind of thing.

00:45:36.269 --> 00:45:40.489
Because I think the sport where you feel that
most is probably something like golf where

00:45:40.489 --> 00:45:41.489
you're stationary.

00:45:41.489 --> 00:45:43.080
Because no seriously.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:46.470
[laughter]
No because it's also it's a physiological

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.660
thing, it's a hormonal thing.

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:55.380
If you're moving, if you're moving fast your
producing hormones which will ultimately often

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:58.410
they will kind of muffle the stress.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:04.069
You know like that adrenaline that works against
stress a lot of the time without becoming

00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:05.069
more nervous.

00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:07.329
I think generally – –
&gt;&gt;Richard: It's a sport Daniel.

00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:12.690
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I, but yeah outside of when they're
actually performing.

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:14.559
Yeah I think all sportsmen are susceptible.

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:21.640
&gt;&gt;Richard: I think the self-doubt thing, it
can be the difference between you know you

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:27.099
start with Ullrich and Armstrong's, or any,
LeMond Hinault.

00:46:27.099 --> 00:46:30.150
Any rivalry where that's really exposed.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:31.940
Often the difference is confidence, self-confidence.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.170
&gt;&gt;Ned: And actually there's a really good
case in point just the other week wasn't there

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:36.170
with Johnny Hoogerland.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:38.369
I don't know how closely you been following
this season.

00:46:38.369 --> 00:46:42.849
But he's a kind of marauding, he doesn't quite
know what he is kind of rider, but he's got

00:46:42.849 --> 00:46:44.969
bundles of aggression and a lot of talent.

00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:49.339
And in Milan-San Ramo he kept attacking and
in slightly inappropriate places and having

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:50.339
a go.

00:46:50.339 --> 00:46:55.150
And actually, his DS came out and said he's
doing that because his self-confidence is

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:56.150
brittle.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:57.690
Cause he doesn't know how to get the best
out of himself.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:58.700
&gt;&gt;Richard: It's ironic isn't it.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.039
We can see, I think the with Pantani as well.

00:47:01.039 --> 00:47:05.559
Some of these great you know really excited
climbers are often the ones who are most wracked

00:47:05.559 --> 00:47:06.559
by self-doubt.

00:47:06.559 --> 00:47:10.569
And they're not happy unless they are you
know.

00:47:10.569 --> 00:47:13.499
If they're sitting in the bunch waiting for
things to happen they are not happy.

00:47:13.499 --> 00:47:18.529
And it takes a very confident rider to actually
just sit there and control it.

00:47:18.529 --> 00:47:22.999
And someone like Armstrong who would say this
was the key moment of the race, this is where

00:47:22.999 --> 00:47:24.099
I'm gonna set it alight.

00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:25.099
And do that.

00:47:25.099 --> 00:47:28.160
&gt;&gt;Daniel: But it's interesting that some people
can turn that into fuel and other people,

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.319
for other people it would just kill their
performances.

00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:35.390
I mean that was, for Merckx, he was just as
wracked with self-doubt as any rider you will

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:36.390
ever find.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:40.140
&gt;&gt;Richard: The nature of cycling, particularly
with the hours of training and racing, it

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:43.790
does, if you're an introspective sort it's
gonna make you worse.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:45.690
I think climbing is the same.

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:49.190
I think that's why there's some really good,
not these ones obviously, but there are some

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:51.219
really good books out about cycling.

00:47:51.219 --> 00:47:56.210
Because there is that time to think and like
there's great climbing literature as well.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:01.059
Because people have this time to think and
to you know David Miller book for example

00:48:01.059 --> 00:48:04.339
is a product of you know years of introspection.

00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:10.279
And he's intelligent enough to turn that introspection
into this coherent story.

00:48:10.279 --> 00:48:14.809
And that I think is a fact of the sport definitely
significant.

00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:19.039
&gt;.Ned: And the psychological fuel thing, you
said using it as a fuel.

00:48:19.039 --> 00:48:24.079
Just to quote Gary Imlach who presents our
coverage, who's I think a brilliant brilliant

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:25.079
journalist.

00:48:25.079 --> 00:48:28.049
He once summed up Lance Armstrong at the end
of one of our shows after he had that spat

00:48:28.049 --> 00:48:30.509
with Simeoni in the best way possible.

00:48:30.509 --> 00:48:35.989
He said, "Lance Armstrong needs grudges like
the flying Scotsman needs a steady supply

00:48:35.989 --> 00:48:36.989
of coal."

00:48:36.989 --> 00:48:39.609
[laughter]
Which I thought was just brilliant.

00:48:39.609 --> 00:48:46.349
&gt;&gt;male 9: Speaking of psychology, can you
talk a little bit about [inaudible]

00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:52.050
[laughter]
[Inaudible]

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:56.479
&gt;&gt;Ned: Andy really disappointed me.

00:48:56.479 --> 00:49:01.219
I mean, last, I mean he disappointed me in
so many ways you know over the last couple

00:49:01.219 --> 00:49:02.219
years.

00:49:02.219 --> 00:49:05.160
I think if they're head-to-head against Contador
on the Tour Mila in the pissing rain it just

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160
didn't happen.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.369
Maybe there were sporting reasons for that,
I don't know.

00:49:08.369 --> 00:49:12.470
But where were the fireworks, where was the
attempt?

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:16.140
The most disappointing memory, or recent memory
of Andy Shleck is interviewing him on the

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.869
Champs-Elysees last year at the tour where
he finished in second.

00:49:19.869 --> 00:49:22.000
And I said, "Andy, sum it all up.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.079
Now you're here, you've reached Paris.

00:49:24.079 --> 00:49:26.170
When you look back in 10 years, what will
you think about this tour."

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:31.210
And he said, "I'm immensely proud to finish
second in the Tour de France."

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:34.900
[laughter]
He should've won it, last year he should've

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.900
won it.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.900
Shouldn't he have?

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.420
And even if he's just trying to say the right
thing, and I actually believe he's kind of,

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:44.809
he's got himself into that mindset where he
actually is immensely proud of finishing second,

00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:49.209
which is, I've never finished second you never
finished second you know It's a rare place

00:49:49.209 --> 00:49:50.209
to be.

00:49:50.209 --> 00:49:51.299
But with his talent.

00:49:51.299 --> 00:49:55.430
He should be, I mean would Mark Cavendish
say, "I'm immensely proud to finish second

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:57.160
in the sprint"?

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.829
You know, that's what kind maddens me about
Andy Shleck a little.

00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:04.450
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I was reading the interview with
Andy Murray in Sport magazine earlier and

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:07.549
he said, "In what other domain would you be
the fourth best in the world at something

00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:08.650
and still be criticized."

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:13.250
And I was writing about Andy Shleck yesterday,
and it occurred to me we were very harsh about

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:14.250
him.

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.959
But actually he's the second-best, you know
last year he was the second best rider in

00:50:16.959 --> 00:50:19.509
the biggest race in the world.

00:50:19.509 --> 00:50:20.509
It's not bad.

00:50:20.509 --> 00:50:23.950
The other thing about the Shleck's is, I think
if you go to Luxembourg you start to understand

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:25.509
what a goldfish bowl it is for them.

00:50:25.509 --> 00:50:31.239
I mean Luxembourg is not exactly, the cup
does not runneth over with celebrities.

00:50:31.239 --> 00:50:33.249
And you know in any business.

00:50:33.249 --> 00:50:34.249
&gt;&gt;Ned: Nor does Frank.

00:50:34.249 --> 00:50:35.249
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Exactly.

00:50:35.249 --> 00:50:36.269
And they live in the same house.

00:50:36.269 --> 00:50:38.359
And then there was their Dad John before that.

00:50:38.359 --> 00:50:39.359
&gt;&gt;Ned: Yeah exactly.

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:41.479
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I remember that worked both ways.

00:50:41.479 --> 00:50:46.200
On the one hand you know they're mates for
life, they don't, they're the biggest stars

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.460
in the country.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.960
Also there's a lot of pressure.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.619
There's a huge amount of pressure on them,
especially with the team now having a kind

00:50:53.619 --> 00:50:54.619
of Luxembourg identity.

00:50:54.619 --> 00:51:00.070
&gt;&gt;male 9: Do you think they would be better
if they were on separate teams?

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:05.380
&gt;&gt;Richard: It's funny I mean yeah you could
see them riding certainly last year.

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:09.930
I remember Plateau de Bais stage where you
felt that one would accelerate and then look

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:11.539
to see where the other one was.

00:51:11.539 --> 00:51:16.819
And they have that brotherly bond which is
both a help than a hindrance really.

00:51:16.819 --> 00:51:22.400
You know, had Cadel Evans not been riding
last year, and had he not been riding as well

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.989
as he was then they would have probably finished
first and second in the Tour and we've been

00:51:25.989 --> 00:51:29.329
seeing this remarkable, these wonderful brothers.

00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:35.709
So you know it's close to being an incredible
story and I think it is a story of unfulfilled

00:51:35.709 --> 00:51:36.709
promise really.

00:51:36.709 --> 00:51:37.940
At the moment, you know.

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:42.709
When Andy Schleck emerged and finished second
in the Giro as a 21-year-old or something

00:51:42.709 --> 00:51:45.450
in 2007.

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:51.450
And we thought my God this guy is a bit like
Jan Ullrich when he won the tour and '97.

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:57.779
It was, we thought this guy is the new Merckx
or Hinault or somebody, he's just so so talented.

00:51:57.779 --> 00:52:01.729
And you wouldn't have thought then that he
would get to this age and not have won a grand

00:52:01.729 --> 00:52:02.729
tour.

00:52:02.729 --> 00:52:04.789
&gt;&gt;Ned: He's got Contador in his way more often
than not.

00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:06.950
And Contador's an amazing story in his own
right.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:10.880
Because he's been, I think I'm right in saying
he's been not eligible to ride four Tour's

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.859
de France is.

00:52:13.859 --> 00:52:14.890
I think that's right.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:16.890
You know one way or the other with Astana
and bans.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:18.940
I mean it's just extraordinary.

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.999
And he should be, we should be talking about
Contador had things panned out differently

00:52:22.999 --> 00:52:28.489
in the same tones that we talk about Merckx
and Armstrong and Hinault, greatest stage

00:52:28.489 --> 00:52:29.809
racer of his generation.

00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:32.400
But that ain't gonna happen now.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.999
&gt;&gt;male 10: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Richard: Until your ban is almost over.

00:52:36.999 --> 00:52:40.670
&gt;&gt;Ned: Ninety-nine days til his ban is up.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:42.390
Just in time for the Tour of Britain.

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:46.089
[laughter]
You gonna see them lining up in Gilford.

00:52:46.089 --> 00:52:55.920
[laughter]
Sorry, I mean I'm, what do you mean?

00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:02.920
&gt;&gt;,ale 10: Inaudible
&gt;&gt;Ned: Plenty doesn't look good about his

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.920
cleanliness.

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.839
And the bottom line is that none of us know
do we but the inalienable fact in all that

00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:11.540
is that he had Clenbuterol in his system.

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:14.900
That's only fact you can return to.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:36.430
&gt;&gt;male 11: One of my favorite things [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Ned: Well, I know very little about bikes,

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:38.849
and these guys know an awful lot more.

00:53:38.849 --> 00:53:41.190
Well I guess they do, you've ridden a bike
so you must know.

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:46.779
At first I thought it was absolutely hilarious,
and I couldn't believe that it was.

00:53:46.779 --> 00:53:52.259
But by all accounts it's, it is a kind of
real possibility isn't it technically that

00:53:52.259 --> 00:53:53.259
you could.

00:53:53.259 --> 00:53:55.660
&gt;&gt;Richard: I wouldn't dismiss it as a real
possibility.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:59.390
Somebody recently said something to me that
suggested it may be a real possibility.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:05.809
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I remember conversations that we
had in the car at the Tour de France about

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:09.109
what would be the next step, would it be geographical
doping?

00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:10.869
As in—
&gt;&gt;Richard: retro doping.

00:54:10.869 --> 00:54:12.260
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah, retro doping.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:18.150
You know the first Tour de France people used
to catch the train then they used to pack

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.029
packs on the road.

00:54:20.029 --> 00:54:21.029
[laughter]
[Inaudible]

00:54:21.029 --> 00:54:25.640
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, that'd would be fun to return
to those days wouldn't it?

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:31.880
&gt;&gt;Daniel: But the guy who made the first YouTube
video and compiled all the evidence, yes he

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.289
went on to write a book about that.

00:54:33.289 --> 00:54:36.180
In Italy yeah it's come out.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:40.059
A thick tome all about mechanical doping.

00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:44.029
But it was quite convincing when you watch
that piece.

00:54:44.029 --> 00:54:45.349
Well, sorry?

00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:50.279
&gt;&gt;male 11: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I mean it kind of did look like

00:54:50.279 --> 00:54:51.279
that.

00:54:51.279 --> 00:54:53.359
&gt;&gt;Richard: There was this book that came out
that [inaudible]

00:54:53.359 --> 00:54:56.309
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Richard: Really suspicious.

00:54:56.309 --> 00:55:04.339
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, but you know I mean he did
something that wasn't any more extraordinary

00:55:04.339 --> 00:55:05.930
than Tom Boonen did this year.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:11.589
I mean Cancellara went away with I think with
40 K's to go, just under 40 K's to go and

00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:13.660
Boonen went away with just over 50.

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.289
And what if he had a motor?

00:55:15.289 --> 00:55:20.130
But I didn't hear the mechanical doping rumors
then.

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.069
&gt;&gt;Ned: That's good punish.

00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:23.311
&gt;&gt;Richard: On the same bike as well wasn't
it?

00:55:23.311 --> 00:55:24.329
A specialized bike.

00:55:24.329 --> 00:55:29.309
&gt;&gt;Daniel: It's quite funny, the Belgian said
there's a whole kind of microculture of Belgians

00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:32.019
in like the press room and cycling in general.

00:55:32.019 --> 00:55:34.849
And they have their own language, it's not
a language because they don't speak.

00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:36.970
It's just kind of winks and nudges.

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:42.490
There, and the standard, their standard sign
language for someone basically doing what

00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:43.619
Cancellara or Boonen did is like "grrrrr"
like that.

00:55:43.619 --> 00:55:44.619
They actually did it to the riders in the
morning, they walk around the buses "grrrr".

00:55:44.619 --> 00:55:45.619
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Christina: I hate to cut this short but

00:55:45.619 --> 00:55:46.619
we can only have just one more question.

00:55:46.619 --> 00:55:47.619
I think we might be getting to the end.

00:55:47.619 --> 00:55:58.029
&gt;&gt;male 12: Yeah so how is Team Sky running
all over the UK, and what else do you think

00:55:58.029 --> 00:56:13.339
they can do to promote the sport?

00:56:13.339 --> 00:56:18.190
&gt;&gt;Daniel: I was asked the same question the
other day in a similar event.

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:22.660
And I, this was the last question I ended
it on the grimmest and most depressing note

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.660
possible.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.880
So I'll get it out of the way and then you
guys can.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.690
&gt;&gt;Ned: I agree with you though.

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:31.349
&gt;&gt;Daniel: So in racing a similar thing happened.

00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:34.150
The boom in cycling in this country.

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:35.150
We talked about it a lot.

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:38.099
Rich and I have actually discussed whether
it is actually happened or something that

00:56:38.099 --> 00:56:41.400
we like to imagine is happening in our head.

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.289
And comfort is when we feel bad about our
freelance careers.

00:56:44.289 --> 00:56:46.809
But it is, I think it is happening.

00:56:46.809 --> 00:56:48.759
But it also happened in Germany a few years
ago.

00:56:48.759 --> 00:56:53.420
And that went from nothing to you know stratosphere
within two or three years.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.749
When Jan Ullrich won the Tour de France.

00:56:55.749 --> 00:56:58.819
I was writing I think about another rider
Andreas Kloden a few days ago.

00:56:58.819 --> 00:57:03.710
And in the introduction it was all about how
cycling in Germany was just taking off.

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:05.769
There was Kloden, there were guys under him.

00:57:05.769 --> 00:57:09.329
Patrik Sinkewitz who a couple years later
was banned.

00:57:09.329 --> 00:57:13.510
But it literally went from one day to the
next it went from everything to nothing.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:15.069
I don't think that will happen in this country.

00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:18.619
&gt;&gt;Richard: But what was the statistic on,
cause it was a very similar story in a sense.

00:57:18.619 --> 00:57:22.640
They had a big German team that was supposed
to have a bid German brand.

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.190
But you were telling me about just the kind
of money that they had.

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:33.069
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Yeah I mean well they would fly
130 journalists just to their training camp.

00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:35.009
German journalists at the start of the year.

00:57:35.009 --> 00:57:39.150
And the riders said they were just groveling
these guys to get the riders in their paper.

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:43.099
Now you will not find any media coverage about
cycling in Germany.

00:57:43.099 --> 00:57:45.269
And there was a huge sponsor, it was like
Sky it was T-Mobile.

00:57:45.269 --> 00:57:48.380
So that is a cautionary tale.

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.660
I don't think it'll happen.

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:51.660
But it might.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.900
&gt;&gt;Ned: There are very specific reasons for
that collapse though aren't there, almost

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.469
all doping related, so a little hedge on that.

00:57:57.469 --> 00:58:01.589
But I take your point, it's a brittle foundation,
and it seems a bit grafted on.

00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:05.190
A kind of carbon fiber shell that we've built
over, a pretty rusty edifice.

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:11.719
You've got to let, you got a hope that enough
time elapses for these roots to really take

00:58:11.719 --> 00:58:13.069
hold.

00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:16.999
The other thing that fueled the German collapse
was the moral high grounds that the broadcasters

00:58:16.999 --> 00:58:22.440
took national television in Germany, ZDF and
AL TV said well, not showing the race, sod

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.440
ya.

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.869
But ITV don't have a moral high ground, or
show it whatever.

00:58:26.869 --> 00:58:30.279
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah I guess in the Britain in

00:58:30.279 --> 00:58:35.809
a sense it began almost even before, cause
Armstrong was kind of important I think here

00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:37.280
as well.

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:44.019
You know certainly in the books boom Armstrong's
books did so well that it transcended the

00:58:44.019 --> 00:58:45.019
sport.

00:58:45.019 --> 00:58:48.920
And it convinced publishers the cycling book,
there was an audience for cycling books.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.010
So there's always been that kind of hard-core
following in the UK.

00:58:53.010 --> 00:59:00.380
It certainly, it's kind of growing all the
time, you really feel it multiplying.

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:04.390
I mean Ned made a comment the other day saying
that you know it was a bit like Andy Murray

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:07.180
in tennis that we only really have one guy
or two guys at the top.

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:08.441
I don't agree with that.

00:59:08.441 --> 00:59:11.099
I think there are slightly stronger foundations.

00:59:11.099 --> 00:59:17.209
There are guys coming through British riders
on top teams now worldwide, where there wasn't

00:59:17.209 --> 00:59:18.529
10, 15, 20 years ago.

00:59:18.529 --> 00:59:20.960
Dave Miller was the only one 10 years ago.

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.829
So there's that encouragement.

00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:26.660
The other thing that's helped enormously has
been lottery funding with the track program.

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:31.949
My worry is that after London that's reduced
and that starts to diminish a little bit.

00:59:31.949 --> 00:59:34.549
And Dave Brills may leave the British program.

00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:41.359
And that might, and that is a very important
foundation that might begin to crumble.

00:59:41.359 --> 00:59:55.880
&gt;&gt;male 13: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Richard: Not on its own, I mean it needs,

00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:02.739
you know I think there are the pro scene and
in the UK at the moment is pretty healthy.

01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:08.980
Again you know were in a recession again apparently
and these things are very much dependent on

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.049
corporate sponsorship, and if that disappears.

01:00:11.049 --> 01:00:15.119
&gt;&gt;Ned: And there's one big sponsor, and they're
all gravitating towards that sponsor.

01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:19.180
You know John Tannock is an example of a British
rider from outside the system where you know

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.799
he's gonna be riding for them next year.

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:24.249
So don't put all your eggs in one basket,
it's a bit risky.

01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:29.319
&gt;&gt;Richard: I mean having said that, you know
there certainly is a huge huge interest in

01:00:29.319 --> 01:00:30.319
it.

01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:32.799
And you know that, I think that is real.

01:00:32.799 --> 01:00:42.319
But I think that I mean you totally see people
cycling and you see I think that there's,

01:00:42.319 --> 01:00:43.339
the evidence is before us.

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.690
&gt;&gt;Daniel: We desperately desperately need
it to carry on.

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:48.719
&gt;&gt;Richard: Were screwed if it doesn't carry
on.

01:00:48.719 --> 01:00:51.380
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ned: Thank you very much, cheers.

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:51.750
[applause]
