MANDY WAITE: This person's
asking a question, What--

00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:05.476
10 different definitions
of a Frontend

00:00:05.476 --> 00:00:07.452
versus a Backend Instance?

00:00:07.452 --> 00:00:10.086
And they're still not really
quite clear on what the

00:00:10.086 --> 00:00:11.630
difference is between Frontends
and Backends.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.010
Is that something you can
explain to everybody?

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.140
FRED SAURE: Yeah,
so we actually--

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.090
you mentioned this in the
introduction, sort of the two

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.460
different notions
of a Backend.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.450
You talked about mobile Backends
for Cloud endpoints.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.990
And then App Engine has a
specific definition of what a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.750
Frontend is and what
a Backend is.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.010
And frankly, other customers
have said, that's confusing.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.160
And we found it a little bit
limiting in what developers

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.840
want to do with their
applications.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.640
And so if you've been actually
reading through the release

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.970
notes, carefully, you'll notice
that we've already

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.950
started talking about kind of
a new way of classifying

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.470
components in an application
called Servers.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.600
And what we're going to do is
we're going to get rid of the

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.020
two special cases.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.420
The Frontends that do things one
way and the Backends who

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.240
do things slightly differently,
and we're just

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.900
going to say, you can have as
many different types of

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.160
Servers as you want.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.250
You can call them Frontends
and Backends.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.590
Maybe one of them is your mobile
API, and one is your

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.820
admin API, and a third one is
something experimental.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.710
Maybe you have a component
that's text message

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.930
processing, and another
component that's like real

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.790
time interactive stuff, and a
third one that's reports.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.390
Every application
is different.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.460
But when you get beyond kind of
a trivial application, you

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.080
often want to logically split
your application into pieces.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.710
You may want to deploy the
different pieces separately,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.460
like your mobile Backend that's
handling all your

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.020
mobile requests, maybe have
a new version for that.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.120
And this will allow you to see
separate traffic graphs for

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.990
each of your server versions.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.790
Your logs will be
separated out.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.900
So your mobile Backend logs and
your static image logs can

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.640
be separate.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.240
So all of that's coming.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.180
Just check out the release
notes, you'll see that.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.630
And just sort of forgive
us for calling them

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.990
Frontends and Backends.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.000
We'll make that go away.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.280
You have an application, split
it in logical pieces, and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.570
we'll allow you to configure the
different pieces the way

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.390
you want, whether you want
different instance sizes,

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.770
different logs, et cetera.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.300
MANDY WAITE: So things like,
what a Frontend has currently,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.020
autoscaling.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.480
That will just be a property
of a server instance?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.380
FRED SAURE: Exactly, so you
say, if I have a mobile

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.220
Backend how does scaling
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.820
I have this batch Backend where
I'm only going to do

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.390
certain administrative tasks,
I actually only want one

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.100
instance of the server running,
and it's just going

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.440
to be crawling some database or
doing some background work.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.900
And you can have variations
in between.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.470
So we're making it easier and
we're simplifying the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.720
terminology.
