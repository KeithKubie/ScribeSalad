[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.610
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: So
let's get started.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.890
Again, we have groups
from all over Google.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.260
And Jilian flew up
from LA for the day.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.990
And so for those that
don't know her, or know her

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.940
from one of these
different settings--

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.220
you might know her from "The
Biggest Loser," or from one

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.160
of her eight "New York
Times" bestselling books,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.520
or from her online fitness
platform called FitFusion,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.670
or from her podcasts, or
her DVDs, or most recently,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.320
her app, which launched
on Google Play.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.210
Woo-woo.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.460
All very excited about that.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.380
She's here to talk to
us today about some

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.040
of her lessons learned, her
career journey, and then,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.400
some of her health and fitness
insights on the industry

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.870
and where everything is headed.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.800
So with that, I'm going to
kick it over to Jillian.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.380
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Well, thank
you so much for having me.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.421
Super excited to be here.

00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:04.970
It's like Oz, but
the wizard is real.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.850
So it's a [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.560
Anyway, yeah, if there is
anything that I can share,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.430
or inform you with, or
answer questions-- obviously,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.954
about health and fitness--

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:18.922
[INAUDIBLE] about
what you guys do.

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:20.364
And mad respect.

00:01:20.364 --> 00:01:21.780
MARY LIZ MCCURDY:
There's so much.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.371
JILLIAN MICHAELS: I'm
just excited to spend

00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:22.910
some time with you.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.910
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Great.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.200
So let's just get started
about the path you took.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.330
How do you go about getting
100 million followers

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.830
and transforming a
fitness industry?

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.560
JILLIAN MICHAELS: In my early
20s, I made great money,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.220
and life was a party.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.430
And then I turned about 24.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.704
And I was friends with people
in the entertainment industry

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:42.870
who were much older than me.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.160
And it was like,
you need a real job.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.360
You need to be responsible.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.390
I was getting pressure from my
mom, who was worried about me.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.056
What are you going
to do with your life?

00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:51.946
You can't do this at 30, or 43--

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.030
which, you can, actually.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.490
So anyway, I got a desk job
in the entertainment industry.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.419
And I worked my way
into a talent agency

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:04.710
called International Creative
Management, which was one

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.810
of the big five at the time.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.440
And I hated it.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.230
But I mean, I guess you're
supposed to hate work.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.640
I thought that's what you do.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.250
You hate work, and
that's just part of life.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.330
So to make a very long story
short, a bad day for your ego

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.650
is a great day for your soul.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.560
And I managed to
get myself fired,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.930
because I just could
not keep myself

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.822
from telling this one guy
how much of an asshole

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:31.530
I thought he was.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.190
Anyway, not only
was I fired, I was

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.780
blackballed from working again.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.482
Because he happened to
be a very powerful agent.

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:44.190
And I didn't know what
I was going to do.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.782
I'm now 27.

00:02:44.782 --> 00:02:46.740
And I was like, what the
hell am I going to do?

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.150
I had bills to pay.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.330
So I fell back into
personal training,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.010
because I had to pay bills.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.870
And ironically, a
lot of the people

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.624
that I worked with at ICM
were coming to work with me.

00:02:57.624 --> 00:02:59.040
I was working at
a sports medicine

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.340
facility helping to rehab
patients who were injured.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.610
And they would come in, and
it was so embarrassing, right?

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.200
Here I am getting,
like, ice packs,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.170
and I had been a junior agent.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.490
And to make a long story
short, I get a call one day

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.489
from somebody I'd been
working with for a while,

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.710
crying because she'd felt her
hipbone for the first time

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.450
in eight years.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.400
And in that moment, I
was like, all right,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.490
somehow I got so far off-pieced.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.520
Like, this is clearly
what I am good at.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.320
This is clearly what
I'm meant to do.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.680
It's clearly what I'm passionate
about and what I love doing.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.950
How am I going to make
a business doing this,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.920
and not just like, you
know, train one person,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.000
make 50 bucks?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.677
Because I didn't see that being
sustainable as I got older.

00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:45.510
And that's where the
desire came was, first,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.880
appreciating that you
can make a living at what

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880
you're passionate about.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.963
And I think so many people
believe that you can't,

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.650
which is just not the truth.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.500
In fact, that's where you will
find affluence and abundance

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.050
is if you're doing what you
love and what you're good at.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.600
So over the years, I began
studying other people who

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.970
had built brands, not
necessarily in fitness, and how

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.450
they did it, and what
platforms they utilized,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.390
and what their career
trajectory was.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.240
And to a certain extent,
some of that's a great idea,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.380
and some of it isn't.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.110
I definitely studied
the landscape.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.870
I was very passionate
about what I do.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.720
You need those two things-- an
understanding of the landscape,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.974
to be passionate
about what you do--

00:04:26.974 --> 00:04:28.890
to learn from your
failures and your mistakes.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.744
But you also need-- man,
you need to be flexible,

00:04:32.744 --> 00:04:33.660
and you need to pivot.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.640
And I think that's how we built
such a big audience globally

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.760
was being able to pivot,
change course, move on, not cry

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.430
over spilled milk, not
throw good money after bad,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.920
and be authentic with our
message throughout all of it

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.070
no matter what the platform
or the trend for people

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.680
to consume content.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.350
Sorry, that was a
really long answer.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.395
Jesus, OK.

00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:01.770
MARY LIZ MCCURDY:
That was great.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.220
JILLIAN MICHAELS: OK.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.360
MARY LIZ MCCURDY:
So can you talk--

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.130
I think most of us
think about-- when

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.980
we think about Jillian Michaels,
we think about fitness.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.801
But we know-- or I know, from
reading some of your books,

00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:13.050
and from getting to know you
better, how much more you

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.790
are than that, an
entrepreneur, which

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.130
we'll talk a little bit about,
a philanthropist, author, and so

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.630
on.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.090
So can you talk about
expanding beyond,

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.640
you know, what you were
originally known for,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.980
and how that's
helped define your--

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.382
and define your own
personal brand and impact?

00:05:28.382 --> 00:05:29.340
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Sure.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.480
It's interesting, because a
lot of times people will ask,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.146
especially peers,
when I speak to peers,

00:05:33.146 --> 00:05:34.390
they're like, well, why you?

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.805
You're not a tremendous athlete.

00:05:35.805 --> 00:05:37.770
You're-- you don't
have, you know,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.900
your advanced degree
in kinesiology.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.460
And, I mean, I do
study the science,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.650
but they've got a
really good point;

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.365
there are fantastic fitness
trainers out there, so why me?

00:05:48.365 --> 00:05:49.740
And if I was to
look at it, there

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.420
were definitely some
of those outlier

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.650
elements of time and place.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.030
But I am a person that
doesn't actually love fitness.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.410
I love what it does in my life.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.390
I love that I fit into my
favorite pair of jeans.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.690
I love that, you
know, I can spar

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.470
with my five-year-old and
my seven-year-old for hours.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.756
But when I'm at the gym, I'm
not like, oh, fuck, I love this.

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:18.530
I feel slightly nauseous,
I'm really sweaty.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.530
My quads are shaking.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.170
I am in heaven.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.970
Not ever.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.710
That never happens.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.470
So, for me, fitness
has always been

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.620
about building a better
life utilizing health

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.915
as the platform your
life is on top of,

00:06:32.915 --> 00:06:36.200
and utilizing fitness
as an entry point

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.200
to rebuild someone's
self-worth and self-esteem.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.180
Because when you're
strong physically,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.310
it transcends into the
other facets of your life.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.680
And I learned this
when I was very young,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.210
as a bullied kid in junior high,
when I got into martial arts.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.300
And so it's always been about
empowering people, not about

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.800
lunges.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.784
And I think that's
transcended to my audience,

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.700
because they're like,
well, that's relateable;

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.158
I don't really love
the gym either.

00:07:01.158 --> 00:07:02.150
And some people do.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.430
You know, Bob Harper
loves the gym.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.110
I call him the
consummate weirdo.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.420
But, for me, I like
what it provides me.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.630
And I think that's what's been
transcendent about our brand,

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.635
is the bigger picture.

00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:13.676
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Got it.

00:07:13.676 --> 00:07:14.850
Awesome.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.510
And most recently,
you've expanded

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.830
into multiple other territories.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.900
We were meeting earlier
about Empowered Media,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.512
and you've made a ton of
really interesting investments.

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:27.720
We also we're talking a
little bit about the research

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.270
that you're very excited
about on longevity.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.590
So what's been getting you
out of bed most recently?

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.016
There's a lot going on upstairs.

00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:36.600
JILLIAN MICHAELS:
My five-year-old.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.710
Fucker.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.670
Every morning--

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.130
MARY LIZ MCCURDY:
Like literally.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.130
JILLIAN MICHAELS: --at 6
AM, literally, wha-mom.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.170
I'm like, oh God.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.430
I mean, but in truth,
I do think, you know,

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.380
I'm lucky to have great
friends and great family,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.750
and that gets me out of bed.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.267
And I'm unlucky
to love what I do.

00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:55.350
You know, when it comes
to work, what's getting me

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.695
out of bed nowadays, I like--

00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:01.950
the Jillian Michaels brand,
you know, it's-- for me,

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.885
it's a snooze fest, which I--

00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:05.540
I mean, I love
the app, because I

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.690
can like-- it's
the closest thing I

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.856
can do to personal training.

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:10.050
But I'm not super
interested in my brand.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.690
Like, I've done my brand,
and we know Jillian Michaels.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.470
Got it.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.900
So the question is how
do we use platforms

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.150
that have been created with
the Jillian Michaels brand

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.890
to grow other brands?

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:25.200
It could be a Better4U water,
an organic nitro cold brew,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.610
an online healthy market that
is creating accessibility

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.539
and affordability, like Thrive,
for people in food deserts.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.210
We're looking to
invest strategically

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.610
in Better4U options that
make health, happiness,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.020
and wellness more affordable
and more accessible.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.620
And-- and that's the kind
of stuff that excites me now

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.270
is growing those
kinds of companies.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.340
And I think that's what's going
to change the face of wellness,

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.580
are places like Thrive
Market or younger generations

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.720
that speak to Z, you know,
not just the millennials,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.120
And what is the message
that they're conveying?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.390
And how can you help
give them a voice

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.024
and stand out amongst the noise?

00:09:05.024 --> 00:09:06.690
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Can
you talk about how

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.350
we should navigate things like
gluten-free versus ketogenic

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.440
versus paleo versus eating
for your blood type,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.870
and, most recently,
eating for your DNA?

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.022
How do you know--

00:09:17.022 --> 00:09:19.230
I mean, there's navigating
all of those different fad

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.230
diets, but then also eating
what's best-- finding out

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.820
what the best one is for you.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:23.970
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Yeah.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.800
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: How should
we go about doing that?

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.320
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Well, blood
type and DNA, one day blood

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.250
type no, DNA yes, and we're
about 25 years away from that.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.550
Although we were 25 years
away from it 10 years ago.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.290
Neutrogenomics.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.500
So, you know, hopefully we
will understand, like, wow,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.800
green tea turns off the breast
cancer gene in me but not you,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.100
but you can have turmeric and
it will turn off ovarian cancer.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.790
That will be the future.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.880
And, you know, hopefully
we'll get there in a way

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.838
that all of us will be
able to benefit from it,

00:09:52.838 --> 00:09:54.360
but we're not there now.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.110
There are two universal
rules when it comes to food.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.060
Calories are units of energy.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.380
You-- anyone-- it's become
so trendy to be like,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.310
I don't care what I weigh, and
I'm not getting on the scale.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.300
That's bullshit.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.100
It might be trendy,
but the scale

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.880
lets you know when you're on
track and when you're off.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.750
It's a compass.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.380
That's it.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.030
If you're trying to lose weight
or maintain a healthy weight,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.220
the scale will tell
you, hey, you've

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.386
got to make some changes,
or you're doing just fine.

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:20.010
That's it.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.880
It's a barometer.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.290
That's all that it is.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.000
And calories are
units of energy.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.079
So if you consume
more units of energy

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:29.370
than you're burning in a day,
you will store it as fat.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.530
Fat is stored energy.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.860
Fat does other things, but
that's what it is, right?

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.930
It's stored energy.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.220
So I don't care
how healthy it may

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.490
be, we evolved, over
thousands of years,

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.550
to store fat for periods of
famine that were seasonal.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.930
And we did not have Red #40
3,000, 4,000, 10,000 years ago.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.900
So yes, you can eat too
much avocado or too much

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.860
cashews or too many
things and gain weight.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.050
So, if you don't overeat,
you will not gain weight.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.720
Then we get into food quantity--
or sorry, food quality, which

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.900
is what I just talked about.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.320
And I don't care if
you're paleo or vegan,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.840
nobody should be eating
hydrogenated fats.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.310
Nobody should be
eating pesticides.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.210
Nobody should be eating
growth hormones, and so on.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.170
Two universal rules.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.589
When I look at the rest of the
diets today, they really are--

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:17.880
I look at them like a religion.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.640
We were talking
about it's choice.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.300
I'm Buddhist.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.420
Awesome.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:22.920
Great.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.580
I'm paleo.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.720
Fantastic.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.500
I'm vegan.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.670
Wonderful.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.950
So what I would simply say is
that if you choose a diet--

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.870
and generally, they're
macronutrient ratios,

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.260
if you think about it.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.710
So if you're choosing a diet
to be vegan, vegetarian,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.889
pescatarian,
omnivore, paleo, there

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:41.430
are certain pitfalls
with every diet.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:45.030
As long as you're aware of
them and you're not overeating,

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.010
and you're not eating
poor quality food,

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.444
you'll be fine across the board.

00:11:48.444 --> 00:11:50.610
So with paleo, make sure
you're getting enough fiber

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.840
and phytonutrients.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.984
Make sure the meat
you're eating is organic.

00:11:53.984 --> 00:11:56.400
I mean, we can get into the
environmental aspects of that,

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.050
but that's not really
the conversation.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.390
If you're vegan,
and you're a woman--

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.445
men do much better on vegan
diets, because they don't--

00:12:05.445 --> 00:12:06.300
how do you say--

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.260
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Menstruate?

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.676
JILLIAN MICHAELS:
Thanks for that.

00:12:08.676 --> 00:12:10.410
That.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.902
Appreciate you.

00:12:11.902 --> 00:12:15.141
I'm like a five-year-old
with shit like that.

00:12:15.141 --> 00:12:18.581
I'm like, you know,
that thing that happens.

00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:19.080
Right.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.452
So men do much better on vegan
diets, believe it or not,

00:12:21.452 --> 00:12:23.160
because they actually
have too much iron.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.500
But we lose iron every month,
so we're more-- females

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.270
are more prone to anemia.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.120
As long as you're
getting B12, a B12 shot,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.840
and good sources of iron in
your diet, you'll be fine.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.895
And if there are allergies,
like gluten allergies, then,

00:12:37.895 --> 00:12:40.020
of course, you'll know what
your sensitivities are,

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.894
if you're lactose
intolerant, and then you'll

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:43.230
just avoid those things.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.510
When it comes to
fine-tuning macronutrients,

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.790
I would simply say
listen to your body.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.250
And this is where,
because people do

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:55.106
convert food into glucose
at faster or slower paces--

00:12:55.106 --> 00:12:56.730
I wrote a book about
it many years ago,

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.810
and it was based on--

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.920
it's called oxidizer types.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.560
So, the way you can tell, quite
honestly, is if you eat a meal

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.340
and it's predominately fat and
protein, and you feel superb,

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.640
then you likely break
down your food very quick,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.160
because those things
break down very slowly.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.960
Now, if you eat whole grain
toast and a little bit of fruit

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.170
spread on top, and
you're like, oh my God,

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.504
I'm exhausted, same thing.

00:13:23.504 --> 00:13:25.170
So that's a person
that breaks down food

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.284
more quickly, in
which case, if you

00:13:27.284 --> 00:13:28.950
eat things that break
down more quickly,

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.990
you're going to spike and crash.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.710
Whereas, conversely, if you
break things down more slowly,

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.250
and you eat a ton
of fat and protein

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.670
and you feel like you've got a
weight sitting in your stomach

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.440
and you feel lethargic,
you'll do better

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.390
with more complex carbohydrates.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.690
So that's where I would just
say listen to your body.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.697
And the whole idea is really
how much energy do you have?

00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:49.780
That's what will tell you.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.080
And how long do
you feel satiated?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.004
So, if you feel satiated
for three to four hours

00:13:55.004 --> 00:13:57.420
and you feel like you can keep
going without eating again,

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.650
you've stabilized
your blood sugar

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.983
and you've hit that right ratio.

00:13:59.983 --> 00:14:02.379
And a great place to
start is just be balanced.

00:14:02.379 --> 00:14:04.170
South-- that's why
South Beach did so well.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.340
It's 30, 30, 40.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.450
Start there.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.280
And if you feel great,
don't fuck with it.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.960
If you don't, tweak
it a little bit

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.463
and see what gives
you more energy.

00:14:11.463 --> 00:14:12.504
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Mm-hmm.

00:14:12.504 --> 00:14:13.430
Awesome.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.860
So going back to the--

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.330
super helpful hearing a little
bit about the navigating diet

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.490
trends, one thing that's come
up recently in the press,

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.990
or maybe, you know,
you've seen this

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.720
in the past couple of
years, is New York Times'

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.945
deep dives on the role genetics
is playing on your metabolism.

00:14:29.945 --> 00:14:31.570
And they've done some
interesting work,

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.730
like looking at the
Biggest Loser contestants

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.700
before and after.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.850
JILLIAN MICHAELS: That's an
interesting conversation.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.460
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Yeah.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.665
So I would love to hear
about your thoughts on,

00:14:38.665 --> 00:14:40.430
you know, is it
nature or nurture?

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.790
Are we-- is it like baby,
I was born this way, or--

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.920
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Right.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.120
MARY LIZ MCCURDY:
--is there actually

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.328
something we can do about it?

00:14:44.328 --> 00:14:45.220
JILLIAN MICHAELS: OK.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.330
Well, we'll get to "Biggest
Loser" in a minute.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.720
First, let's discuss genetics.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.820
Your genetics are as
unique on the inside

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.570
as they are on the
outside, right,

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.440
and for evolutionary purposes.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.047
With that said, how you
respond to certain foods,

00:15:00.047 --> 00:15:01.630
right, we were talking
about-- will be

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.412
different for differing people.

00:15:03.412 --> 00:15:04.870
Some people are
lactose intolerant.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.700
Some have gluten sensitivities.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.000
Some people, as we
look at micronutrients,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.250
some people will respond
to them in positive ways,

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.680
and some people it
won't do anything for.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.240
But if you're looking at
weight, everybody can be fit.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.130
Now, are you-- is
everybody going

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.140
to be a size zero
with, you know,

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.180
this percentage of body fat?

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:25.930
No.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:26.180
Right?

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.540
That-- that's going to
involve your unique genetics.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.250
Can anybody be fit and healthy?

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.090
Yes.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.840
Is it easier for
some than others?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.340
Yes.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.240
I mean, if I look at
food, I will gain weight.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.290
I was an overweight kid.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.720
I mean, I cannot play
those kinds of games.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.500
I just can't.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.780
It's not-- like, you know,
my partner can eat anything

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.865
she wants, and is
still like, ugh,

00:15:45.865 --> 00:15:47.680
I'm just trying to put
on five more pounds.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.577
You know, I mean, and
that's-- and that's genetics.

00:15:53.577 --> 00:15:54.910
But are we both fit and healthy?

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:55.660
Yes.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.920
So, you can dramatically affect
the expression of your genetics

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.850
for better or worse.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.400
So nutrigenomics, how does
food express your genetics,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.240
epigenetics.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.880
How's your environment
expressing--

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.100
facilitating the expression
of your genetics?

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.650
So, we are all
empowered, for better

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:17.200
and for worse, which brings
me to "Biggest Loser."

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.800
And it's kind of interesting.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.682
So, one of those
contestants is a girl

00:16:22.682 --> 00:16:25.140
named Shay, who is one of the
biggest contestants we'd ever

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:25.960
had on the show.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.690
She's-- was over 500 pounds, and
she's still a friend of mine.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.760
And, you know, they
put the weight back on.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.680
And if they don't
ask for help, I

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.880
don't give unsolicited advice.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.887
So I was like,
whatever, we're friends,

00:16:38.887 --> 00:16:40.470
I'm not going to say
a word unless she

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.344
talks to me about it.

00:16:41.344 --> 00:16:44.280
This is also a woman-- and a lot
of those people on that show,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.170
you have to understand--

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.940
people watched it,
and it was a TV show,

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.270
but, for me, it was a
life-or-death intervention

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.740
on a ticking clock.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.990
And you're dealing with trauma.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.220
Tremendous trauma.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.990
People don't get to 400, 500
pounds without deep trauma.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.700
It's not because
they like pizza.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.240
It's not.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.550
I love pizza; I'm
not 500 pounds.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.107
So, this is a
woman whose parents

00:17:08.107 --> 00:17:10.440
were drug addicts, who was
in and out of the foster care

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.510
system.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.099
So the study comes
out, and she's

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.400
like, I'm just curious
what you think?

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.510
I saw you said it was bullshit.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.450
I'm like, you know I
think it's bullshit, Shay.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.210
And she's like, why?

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.626
And I was like,
tell me right now,

00:17:20.626 --> 00:17:22.890
are you eating 2000
calories a day?

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:23.579
No.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.930
Are you moving your body
for four half hours a week?

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:26.430
No.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.890
I was like, try that
and get back to me.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.800
She lost 85 pounds,
again, in six months,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.455
eating 2000 calories a day and
walking four half hours a week.

00:17:34.455 --> 00:17:37.246
Got diagnosed with
thyroid cancer.

00:17:37.246 --> 00:17:39.870
Just got it out, and she's-- we
don't even know if she's cancer

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.060
free yet, so that was kind
of a bump in the road.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.530
But she's now maintained.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.840
So she's like 425 again.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.380
So it's like the minute we put
her back on 2000 calories a day

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.990
and walking four
half hours a week,

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.000
85 pounds falls off of her.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.650
This is-- you know, and have
to understand the psychology.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.900
There's a lot of shame that
goes on, so it's like, no,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.835
the show did it.

00:18:00.835 --> 00:18:03.460
And when they were on the show,
it was, mommy and daddy did it.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.610
And when-- what you really
need in that scenario

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.450
is a therapist, because when
you're eating like that,

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.280
there's much deeper
stuff going on.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.410
And people don't eat
dangerously or engage

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.260
in destructive behaviors because
they're weak or they're stupid

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.830
or they're lazy.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.080
It's affording them something.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.360
And it's affording them
something very significant.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.270
And at one time or another,
that destructive habit

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.860
meant their
psychological survival.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.130
So whether it was a
connection to a loved one,

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.860
or control, or
protection, you won't know

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.750
until you deal with the person.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:42.310
But, to give that up is
way deeper than anything

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.320
we can comprehend
on the surface.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.700
And that's-- that's what
that animal's really about.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.412
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Got it.

00:18:47.412 --> 00:18:49.060
JILLIAN MICHAELS: It's
not about food at all.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:49.570
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Yeah.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.550
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Well,
it is, but not literally.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.591
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Mm-hmm.

00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:55.250
That's a helpful insight.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.090
So, switching
gears a little bit,

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.390
we talked about
where you've been

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.880
and what you've been
doing most recently.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.560
Can you share-- or
make a prediction

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.470
on where this whole
fitness industry is headed?

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.250
JILLIAN MICHAELS:
[EXHALES] God, there's

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:15.454
some things I see that
really distress me.

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:16.870
And then there's
some things I see

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.550
that I'm really hopeful about.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.640
You know, I love the
integration of technology,

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.800
because information
is power, right?

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.770
And I always tell people, if
you have the right information,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.260
you can make choices
that are going

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.240
to yield powerful results.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.632
We get so confused thinking
that action and intention are

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:35.590
going to bring results.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.640
But, in truth, if you
take misinformed action,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.020
you'll have disaster.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.540
But if you take informed, very
deliberate, specific actions,

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.006
and you make informed
choices, you're

00:19:45.006 --> 00:19:48.220
going to get, most of the time,
really positive and powerful

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.100
outcomes.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.980
So I love that
technology is giving us

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.635
this kind of information
now, so we can see, like, OK,

00:19:54.635 --> 00:19:56.510
you know, you're not
working out hard enough.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:57.550
Your heart rate's here.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.860
Your burn was only
here; it should be here.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.820
And then-- you know.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.190
You can tell when people
have more, oh, I'm dying.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.280
Yeah, your heart rate's
at 75; you're not dying.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280
You know, just various--

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.750
how far they walked, how
much they've done, like,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.930
that stuff's exciting.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.200
You know, how much they slept.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.530
How much they had deep sleep.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.370
How much hydration
they have, and so on.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.660
The part that is distressing
for me-- and I, honest to God,

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.890
cannot tell if I'm
just really old now--

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.220
but is that, you turn,
you turn on Instagram--

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.201
and some of it I love.

00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:29.950
You know, there are
some trainers on there

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.740
that I just love, and
I constantly, like,

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.660
friend and dialogue
with, and think

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.580
are great, and
watch them evolve,

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.100
and would like to put them on
FitFusion, and what have you.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.520
And then, like, last
night I was watching

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.170
this one woman who was--

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.830
because it makes
suggestions, you know,

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.330
and she's working out
with a chair in her room,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.972
so I'm watching it,
and I'm like, OK.

00:20:49.972 --> 00:20:52.180
And the next thing I know,
it, like, turns into porn,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.370
and there's a camera,
and she's like--

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:58.740
and I just-- that part
I'm like, ugh, God.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.300
Like, as a woman in
general, I'm like, why?

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.620
And I-- I don't know-- you
know, I ask these girls,

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.010
I'm like, you know that,
like, this lives forever.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:12.400
Like, what if you want to
run for office one day?

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.080
What if you want to
go into medicine,

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.697
and there's your crotch,
living forever on the internet.

00:21:17.697 --> 00:21:20.030
And the younger generation,
they're like, we don't care,

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.446
and we don't think
our peers care.

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.850
And you know what?

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:23.920
Maybe they don't.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.570
But that's-- I don't
know what that is.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.419
It's not fitness.

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:29.710
So I just-- and the look at
me, look at me, look at me,

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.666
is also not fitness.

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:33.040
I don't know what
the fuck it is.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.780
It's like validate me.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.640
And that's not what
fitness should be about.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.760
Fitness should be about you
validating yourself, not

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.999
going and taking a
picture for 10 minutes

00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:43.540
to find the right
angle in the mirror

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.420
so 50 people can tell
you you look good.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.670
So that-- that stuff
freaks me out, dude.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.300
And this is where I'm
like, God, I'm old.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.724
But I love some of the
younger personalities

00:21:54.724 --> 00:21:56.140
and the interesting
things they're

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.260
doing with actual
fitness and the way

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.370
they're incorporating technology
to build community for people.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:04.760
And that part's really exciting.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.570
So I think it's the continued
evolution of connectivity

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.480
and community and
accountability, as well as

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.030
having more and more
accurate information

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.590
to get better results faster.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.490
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Great.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.440
Thanks.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.510
And in terms of what we can
do about it, so where do

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.980
you see Google playing a role?

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.060
I mean, what's holding us back
from getting more people moving

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.116
and healthier?

00:22:29.116 --> 00:22:29.990
JILLIAN MICHAELS: OK.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.120
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: We talked
a little bit about Android

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.610
specifically, and you have
2 billion Android users that

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.450
are actively on our platform,
so we have a responsibility

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.220
to help impact their health.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.140
Obviously, you have
100 million followers,

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.000
and are a huge influencer
in the community.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.150
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Across
the platforms, the users.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.720
MARY LIZ MCCURDY:
What can we do?

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.980
JILLIAN MICHAELS: The
goal, in my opinion,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:53.470
is to make that information
as simple, accessible,

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.490
and effective as possible.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.880
So, how can you give
them information

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.927
that is not overwhelming?

00:22:58.927 --> 00:23:01.510
It's kind of like what you were
talking about today with the--

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.970
your information layout
and what you're giving them

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.580
and what you're prioritizing,
and how can you give them

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.860
information that they're
like, that I can do,

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.690
they can afford it,
they can access it,

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.740
and they will see results,
they'll feel better right away.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.670
Or like, hey, little tips.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.440
Hey, you know, push them
to sign up for Google Fit.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.579
And it's like, hey,
enable this for us,

00:23:21.579 --> 00:23:23.120
and we'll be able
to do this for you.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.630
And I think it's just in really
encouraging, simple ways,

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:30.740
because ultimately
those baby steps yield

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.500
far bigger results over time.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.130
And meeting people
where they're at.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.171
And that's the cool thing
about what you guys can

00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:38.830
do with that phone is that--

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.150
and all your technology is
you know where they're at.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.520
You know where they live.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.690
You know what their
economic status is.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.550
You know the foods they like.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.210
I mean, it's crazy.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.300
So knowing that,
it could literally

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.370
be like what you
said, we noticed

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.829
you've got this great park
in your area, go-- you know,

00:23:54.829 --> 00:23:56.870
maybe you should get out
and go for a walk today.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.191
We've seen you've been
sitting for several hours.

00:23:59.191 --> 00:23:59.690
And--

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.280
Present company accounted for.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.238
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Yeah.

00:24:05.238 --> 00:24:08.180
JILLIAN MICHAELS: And I
think--I think that support,

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.670
and holding them accountable,
because they're attached

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:15.920
to a device or a watch or a
screen, can be really helpful.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.715
I mean, if I was to get really--

00:24:19.715 --> 00:24:20.840
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Go there.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.460
JILLIAN MICHAELS:
--Machiavellian about it,

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.501
I mean, I would definitely
manipulate the infor--

00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:27.800
I would prioritize the
proper information.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.930
Because there is--
I think that today--

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.684
I find younger people
read it on the web,

00:24:32.684 --> 00:24:34.100
and they're like,
well, I read it.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.890
I'm like, but that
doesn't make it true.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:38.390
You know?

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:39.348
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Yeah.

00:24:39.348 --> 00:24:41.980
JILLIAN MICHAELS: So it's
like kind of really looking

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.839
at curating feeds on
fitness that are-- which I

00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:48.130
know you're not supposed to do.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.546
But, I mean, if
you're asking me--

00:24:49.546 --> 00:24:52.711
like making sure that the shit
that's true goes to the top

00:24:52.711 --> 00:24:53.335
of the search--

00:24:53.335 --> 00:24:53.910
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.680
JILLIAN MICHAELS: --and the
shit that isn't, you know, like,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.400
we want to pay for this ad about
a tapeworm when you search--

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.760
you know.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.097
So it's crazy how many
people are manipulated.

00:25:04.097 --> 00:25:04.930
It's like fake news.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.762
Same-- it's the same thing.

00:25:06.762 --> 00:25:07.720
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Yeah.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.160
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Fake
ads, fake this, fake that.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.530
And if they could curate
that and kind of clean up

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.130
some of that mess, I think
that that would help.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:15.880
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Yeah,
Google's partnered

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.609
with Harvard and Mayo
Clinic to prioritize,

00:25:18.609 --> 00:25:19.900
in the search knowledge panel--

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.650
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Really?

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.060
MARY LIZ MCCURDY:
--information on health

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.215
because of the reasons
that you mentioned.

00:25:22.215 --> 00:25:23.200
JILLIAN MICHAELS:
I didn't know that.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:23.947
Yeah.

00:25:23.947 --> 00:25:25.405
I think will make
a big difference.

00:25:25.405 --> 00:25:26.488
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Awesome.

00:25:26.488 --> 00:25:27.070
Great.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.120
Well, those were
the questions I had.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.010
I'd love to open it
up to the audience.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.910
There's a mic that
we can pass around.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.570
Don't be shy, or Jillian's
going to have you do burpees.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:37.570
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Right?

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:38.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.060
Or it will just be
really awkward silence.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:41.877
That too.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.790
AUDIENCE: OK, this might be too
personal, but how was your--

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.123
JILLIAN MICHAELS: I got
a pap smear yesterday.

00:25:52.123 --> 00:25:54.810
AUDIENCE: No, not that personal.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.500
How have your
thoughts on marriage

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.810
changed since before you
decided to get married?

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.230
And do you regret waiting as
long as you did with Heidi?

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.030
JILLIAN MICHAELS: I
don't regret waiting.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.630
I mean, in truth, the only
reason I can still see

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.400
to get married is estate tax.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.490
I'm like, if I love
you, who gives a shit?

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.540
But, you know, for her
it means something,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.790
and so I respect that.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.500
You know what I mean?

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.822
But, to me, I just--

00:26:18.822 --> 00:26:20.530
because I think I've
seen so many people,

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.530
like, get married because
they want the wedding,

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.515
or get married because
they think they should.

00:26:24.515 --> 00:26:25.300
Excuse me.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.160
Or get married because
of the shoulds,

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.210
not because of the wants.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.400
And I'm like, what
are your shoulds?

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.780
Because I want to be with
you, I'll stay with you.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.180
I don't need paper do that.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.570
But if it does prevent
her from losing 50% again

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.090
to the government,
then yes, I'll do that.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.620
So, you know, so be it.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.040
But I-- you know, I
don't change that much.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:51.570
I'm flexible in that the people
I love, I want to compromise,

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.030
but I'm--

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.970
you really have to show me
something unique and new

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.160
to change my mind about
things, which I know is bad,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.810
but-- and it does happen.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.920
But with that one,
I'm like, nah.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.032
But I would-- I do it
because I love her.

00:27:06.032 --> 00:27:06.740
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:14.628 --> 00:27:15.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.480
I'm wondering, as a parent,
how you balance, you know,

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.911
your kids and having a healthy
lifestyle, you know, not--

00:27:21.911 --> 00:27:25.330
you know, not-- wanting to guide
them, not, you know, do this,

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.470
don't do that, letting them
make their own choices,

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:29.640
but helping guide them to
having a healthy lifestyle?

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.598
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Yeah.

00:27:30.598 --> 00:27:32.700
Well, you know, what's
interesting, with my kids

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.950
I've been really
lucky because it just

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.070
hasn't been that
difficult. But if I

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.822
look at why I think it hasn't
been that difficult, in truth,

00:27:41.822 --> 00:27:43.280
they have very
limited screen time.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.120
I'm like, you have a
social network, outside.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.185
Go outside.

00:27:47.185 --> 00:27:50.390
And, you know, we have the
luxury of sending them outside.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:54.240
So, you know, they're
not on screens,

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.001
and so they're really fit
because they play all day long,

00:27:59.001 --> 00:28:00.750
I mean, except for
when they're in school.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.557
And, you know, they're
on the jungle gym.

00:28:02.557 --> 00:28:03.390
They're in the pool.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.200
They're on the trampoline.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.616
They're running around chasing
each other with water guns.

00:28:06.616 --> 00:28:09.480
I mean, they're constantly
bouncing off the walls.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.100
So I, honest to
God, just let them--

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.640
I mean, they don't stop
eating, and I don't stop them,

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.160
because they're crazy fit.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.910
I thought that there
might be a time where

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.332
I was like, ugh, oh no, you
know, before having kids,

00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:22.290
like what do you do if
they're eating too much?

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:24.840
But, because they're
constantly moving and growing,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.290
that's not been an issue for me.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.407
I do, when they want
stuff that's crap,

00:28:30.407 --> 00:28:32.740
you know, they see other kids
having stuff that's crap--

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.160
like, they eat sugar.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.920
They eat fat.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.220
Like, I put organic
Cheetos in their lunch.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.957
Luke's makes an organic Cheeto.

00:28:39.957 --> 00:28:41.040
Like, I put that in there.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.956
Or I'll-- you know, every
day they get a treat

00:28:42.956 --> 00:28:45.450
in their lunch, but I'll put
like an organic peanut butter

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.956
cup from Justin's, or a little
OCHO chocolate caramel bar

00:28:48.956 --> 00:28:50.330
that's organic,
because I'm like,

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.980
they'll burn the sugar off.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.632
But their little bodies
cannot handle the chemicals.

00:28:54.632 --> 00:28:56.340
Their organs aren't
even fully developed.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.631
It's really dangerous for them.

00:28:57.631 --> 00:29:00.540
So that part I mitigate
as much as I can,

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.764
and explain to them why.

00:29:01.764 --> 00:29:03.180
Like with my son,
I'm like, if you

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.700
want to eat that marker, I'll
let you have that Otter Pop,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.180
or, you know, you can
have an organic ice cream

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.520
sandwich from-- whatever.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.770
I just discovered one the
other day that they like.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.249
So I try to explain it to them.

00:29:15.249 --> 00:29:17.790
And I have, quite honestly, for
the longest time-- and I also

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:21.000
look at people that they
admire, whether it's

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.080
Beyonce or Luke Skywalker,
and I'm like, I promise you,

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.730
Beyonce is not
eating Fruit Loops;

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.170
at least I don't think so.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:30.640
I don't think so.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.820
I know her trainer, and I'm
pretty sure that my girl is not

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.810
eating the Fruit Loops.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.450
So-- and that helps.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:41.220
You know?

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.180
AUDIENCE: So I think
mine's a good build

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.000
on that, because I want to ask
you the same question but about

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.380
spouses.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.990
I don't have kids, but inspiring
your spouse to, you know,

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.350
get in shape and stay in
shape, without ever making them

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.646
feel like they need
to or et cetera.

00:30:00.646 --> 00:30:04.850
JILLIAN MICHAELS: [EXHALES]
It depends on the spouse.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:10.370
There are two strategies you
can employ to motivate someone.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.160
The first is you
lead by example.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.530
And, in truth, it's
really all you have.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.800
You lead by example.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.280
You talk about the things
that you want and perspective

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.770
on the outcome, you
know, what's the why.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.650
If you have a why to live
for, you can tolerate the how.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.550
What's your why?

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.230
How do you see the future?

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:30.740
Very innocently asking
them what their why is,

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.390
what they see for the future.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:36.029
Letting them be motivated
and inspired by your journey.

00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.820
Sometimes it works.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.500
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.110
The other thing is to
just literally crack them

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.630
over the head with
fear and concern.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.400
And sometimes it works.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.540
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.110
And the reality is that people--

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.970
remember that whatever
the food or the behavior

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.050
is providing them, it's
something significant for them.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:57.400
They may not even understand it.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.774
You might not even
understand it.

00:30:58.774 --> 00:31:02.230
But it has to hurt
more to continue

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.020
the way they've been living
than the work and the fear

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.660
and the loss associated with
where you want them to go.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.544
And that's where if
they see you being like,

00:31:10.544 --> 00:31:12.460
I'm afraid you're going
to have a heart attack

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.079
and orphan our two
kids, I really am,

00:31:15.079 --> 00:31:16.120
and you're just in tears.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.453
And it's not, you're an
asshole, you're lazy, it's like,

00:31:18.453 --> 00:31:20.290
listen, I love you.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:21.340
I'm really afraid.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.710
This is a reality I
think we're facing.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:29.230
And if you can hurt them enough,
make them feel-- or you're not

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.530
hurting them, but make
them feel the hurt of that,

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.660
and it's more
uncomfortable where

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.322
they are than where
they need to go,

00:31:38.322 --> 00:31:40.030
you've got another
chance of them moving.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.580
But sometimes that
stuff is so deep.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.200
And I can give you one example
of what I'm talking about.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.987
So-- I can give you
many, but here's one.

00:31:47.987 --> 00:31:50.320
So there was a kid that I
worked with on "Biggest Loser"

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.900
for a little while, and he was
doing great, he was like 18,

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.990
he was there with his dad,
they were both doing great.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.870
They went home for the
holidays, and they all

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:02.560
come back to the "Biggest Loser"
ranch, everybody's weighing in,

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.170
and it's like
everyone's doing great,

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.835
and the dad gets on the
scale, he lost nothing.

00:32:06.835 --> 00:32:08.260
And the room gets kind of quiet.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.676
The kid gets on the scale, and
he gained like five pounds.

00:32:10.676 --> 00:32:12.350
They were gone for two weeks.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.605
And everyone starts with
the bullshit of like, oh,

00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:16.780
the traveling, and the
food at the airport,

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.950
and the whole-- they start.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.658
And that--you know
that's not what it is.

00:32:19.658 --> 00:32:23.760
So I'm like, listen, just tell
me what happened step by step.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.455
So he starts with
the, I packed my lunch

00:32:25.455 --> 00:32:28.380
and, you know, with
the surface stuff,

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.750
and I go to the airport,
and this, that, the other,

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.390
and I walk in the door, and
all my friends and family

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:37.050
are there, and there's my mom,
and she starts crying and not

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.550
tears of joy.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:42.780
So it turns out that mom is
morbidly obese, and upon seeing

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.780
husband and son being
significantly more fit,

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.380
I mean, she immediately
shuts down, withdraws,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.170
becomes depressed, feels like
they're going to abandon her,

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.780
like, they've outgrown her,
they've left her behind.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.045
And so, you know, it's the
primal abandonment for him,

00:32:57.045 --> 00:32:57.878
and what does he do?

00:32:57.878 --> 00:33:00.297
He slams the brakes on the
weight loss and starts eating.

00:33:00.297 --> 00:33:01.630
What does the weight afford him?

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.979
An emotional connection
with his mother.

00:33:03.979 --> 00:33:05.520
You think you can
change that easily?

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.125
AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:07.125 --> 00:33:09.420
JILLIAN MICHAELS: No way.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.360
So, you've got to appreciate
that you may never

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.730
know what the answer is, or
why they're attached to it.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.230
They may never know.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.990
But it has nothing
to do with you.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.240
Those two strategies may work.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:21.782
They may not.

00:33:21.782 --> 00:33:23.448
You'll hear a lot of
people say, well, I

00:33:23.448 --> 00:33:26.160
had a massive heart attack
and then I changed my ways.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.420
Look at Clinton.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.490
Massive heart attack, and
then he changed his ways,

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.490
but that's what it took.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:35.130
I hope that doesn't happen, but
sometimes a rock bottom moment

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.926
is necessary, and you
can't facilitate that.

00:33:37.926 --> 00:33:39.260
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Thanks.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.250
I think we have time
for one last question.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.962
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Yeah.

00:33:40.962 --> 00:33:41.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.580
This is a fitness question.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.370
JILLIAN MICHAELS:
Oh, there you are.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.765
I was like--

00:33:43.765 --> 00:33:45.050
AUDIENCE: Right in front of you.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.002
JILLIAN MICHAELS:
Sorry about that.

00:33:46.002 --> 00:33:46.900
AUDIENCE: That's OK.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.794
So, I'm just wondering,
like, for-- you

00:33:48.794 --> 00:33:50.960
mentioned about fitness
goals and about weight loss,

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.940
and, like, a scale
as your compass.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.010
And it totally makes
sense, but what

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.770
about if it's, like, a little
bit more complicated, like,

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.690
if you want to lose
weight, gain muscle,

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.570
and how do you go about that
with nutrition wise, what

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.120
to eat, when and what
time, after a workout,

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.110
before a workout, and, like--
and if you're going to, like,

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.520
lose the weight, are you
going to, like, sprint 5K,

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.350
or are you just going to do
like a long-- like, you know,

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.864
just sprint just
short distances?

00:34:14.864 --> 00:34:15.739
You know what I mean?

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:16.614
JILLIAN MICHAELS: OK.

00:34:16.614 --> 00:34:17.456
AUDIENCE: So like--

00:34:17.456 --> 00:34:19.190
I'm sorry.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.884
I've always wanted
to ask you that.

00:34:20.884 --> 00:34:22.050
JILLIAN MICHAELS: All right.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:27.260
So, first of all, women don't
really gain muscle size.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.134
It's really hard.

00:34:29.134 --> 00:34:30.400
I mean, you could.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.360
You'd have to eat a lot of
food and lift very heavy,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.020
and really be extraordinarily
diligent about that.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.010
We just don't have the
androgenic hormones to like--

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.389
we can maintain muscle.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.190
We can burn intramuscular fat.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:47.420
We can condition muscle.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.360
But to like literally make
something bigger on your body

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.739
by adding muscle,
it's very hard to do.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:55.932
Like, Mr. Olympia puts on
three pounds of muscle a year.

00:34:55.932 --> 00:34:57.890
When you think, like,
God, is that all, I mean,

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.180
if you take three
pounds of hamburger meat

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.554
and slap it on your body, it's
a hell of a lot of muscle.

00:35:01.554 --> 00:35:03.320
But, at the same
time, like, when

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.825
you put it in perspective--

00:35:04.825 --> 00:35:06.200
because trainers
are like, oh no,

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.130
you're just--you know
what you're doing?

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.910
You're gaining muscle.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:08.690
That's bullshit.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.440
So it's not that you've offset
loss with muscle gain; that's

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.497
not true.

00:35:14.497 --> 00:35:16.580
So you've really got to
focus on one or the other.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.310
If you want to gain size,
which I don't think that's

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:20.210
what you mean.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:23.270
But you can't gain and
drop at the same time.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:25.640
So-- and fat does
not turn into muscle.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.900
It's not led into gold.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.800
So you would drop the weight and
then start putting on muscle.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.010
With that said, if you're
like I just want to get leaner

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.191
and I want to lower my
body fat, which is what

00:35:36.191 --> 00:35:37.440
it sounds like you want to do.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, probably.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.846
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Condition your
muscle and lower your body fat,

00:35:40.846 --> 00:35:43.430
it doesn't matter what you do,
as long as you're consistent.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:47.000
What will get you there faster,
sure, high-intensity training

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.220
for shorter periods of time.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.380
20 to 30 minutes,
four to five times

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.230
a week, with-- in
conjunction with being

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:57.770
really good about your diet,
will get you there the fastest.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.150
And if you take a
duration-- a long duration,

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:03.410
low-intensity day, make it like
your off day or your recovery

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.940
day, that'll get you there.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.820
Just take you longer
because it won't

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:11.310
affect your metabolism
as intensely,

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.200
or your EPOC, your afterburn.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.510
Your elevated
metabolic rate is not

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.280
as great from lower
intensity exercise.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.320
So, high intensity gives
you a greater burn during,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.570
greater burn after
the workout's over.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:30.760
It-- oh God-- it facilitates
improved fitness faster,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.120
which allows-- continues to
allow for greater intensity,

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.560
and it becomes--

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.790
it gains momentum, and you work
out harder, you get fitter,

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.010
you work out--

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.590
holy shit.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:41.797
Forgive me.

00:36:41.797 --> 00:36:43.380
You work out harder,
you get more fit,

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.700
you burn more calories, and
the cycle begets itself,

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.630
if that makes sense.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.130
JILLIAN MICHAELS:
But there's not

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:48.551
going to be a
right or wrong way.

00:36:48.551 --> 00:36:50.550
There's just going to be
a faster or slower way.

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.120
AUDIENCE: What about the eating
wise, like, what to eat and all

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:53.805
that, and like to--

00:36:53.805 --> 00:36:56.304
JILLIAN MICHAELS: If you want
to-- what do you want to lose?

00:36:56.304 --> 00:36:59.172
AUDIENCE: Like 15 pounds
or something, and also

00:36:59.172 --> 00:36:59.880
gain the weight--

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.005
JILLIAN MICHAELS: With 15--

00:37:01.005 --> 00:37:04.350
but I would say, you know, if
you're in that vanity pound

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.680
range, don't create more
of a calorie deficit

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.750
than 500 calories.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:11.930
Because I bet if I took you
to the doctor right now,

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:13.890
you would-- your blood
pressure would be good,

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.020
your heart rate would be
good, your fasting glucose

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.936
would be good, your
cholesterol would be good,

00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:20.700
and your body is like,
well, I'm perfectly healthy,

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.650
why is she starving me?

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:26.370
And so it would signal a
metabolic shift to slow down.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.110
Because that's
what metabolism is.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.820
It's biochemistry.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.830
It's the hormone balance
of human growth hormone,

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:36.030
insulin, cortisol, grow and
let-- all of those things work

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.240
in a symphony, and
they are all responding

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.530
to your environments and
your food, your stress levels

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.160
and so on.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.820
So if you are reducing
your calories too much

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.530
and you're already
fit and healthy,

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.919
your body is going to signal
metabolic slow shutdown.

00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:53.460
So that's where with
people like you,

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:57.420
I'm like go to no more
than a 500-calorie deficit,

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.630
and eat clean.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.880
So, if you're using your
little contraption that says,

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.190
hey, you burned
2000 calories today,

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:11.330
and you eat 1,500, that's really
kind of where you want to be.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.330
And don't eat chemicals.

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:13.320
Keep it simple.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.049
Doesn't need to be--

00:38:15.049 --> 00:38:15.840
don't overthink it.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.762
When you overthink it,
it's impossible to sustain.

00:38:18.762 --> 00:38:22.270
Just because something is
simple doesn't mean it's easy,

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.570
but at least if you
can stick with it,

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.000
it's a heck of a lot more
accessible than too much

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.803
information and all of that.

00:38:28.803 --> 00:38:29.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.511
MARY LIZ MCCURDY: Thank you.

00:38:31.511 --> 00:38:33.010
All right, well
thank you, everyone.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:33.610
JILLIAN MICHAELS: Thank you.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:34.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.069
Thank you so much, guys.

00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.610
That was fun.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.760
MARY LIZ MCCURDY:
Yay, it was so fun.
