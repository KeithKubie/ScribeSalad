00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.860
The percent of adults
who smoke recorded

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.230
every few years
since 1967 suggests

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.300
a negative linear
association with no outliers.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.430
On average, the percent drops
by 0.5 points each year.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.740
Which of the following plots
suits the above description?

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.010
So let's see, this looks like
a negative linear association.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.020
As the years go by, you have a
smaller percentage of smokers.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.390
This one does too.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540
As years go by, you have
the number of smokers

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.090
go down and down.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.500
This one down here
also looks like that,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.874
although it's not as smooth.

00:00:38.874 --> 00:00:40.290
If you were to fit
a line here, it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.850
looks like you have
a few outliers.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.391
Well, this is a
positive correlation.

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:46.320
So we can definitely
rule out Graph 4.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.300
Now, the other
thing that they told

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.510
us is that there
are no outliers,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.840
suggests a negative linear
association with no outliers.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.095
If you were to try to
fit a line to Graph 3,

00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:57.720
you could fit a line
pretty reasonably.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.240
That would go
someplace like that.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.130
But it would have this
outlier right over here.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.760
It looks like it's 12
or 13 years after 1967.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.875
So that would be 1980.

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:12.291
It looks like an outlier there.

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:14.040
But they said it didn't
have any outliers.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.070
So we would rule out Graph 3.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.420
And so we have to pick
between Graph 1 and Graph 2.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.370
So the other hint they give
us or piece of data they

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:30.360
give us is that the percent
drops by 0.5% each year.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.490
So here's what's happening.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.700
In 1967, it looks like
we're at about 55%.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.080
And then 10 years go by.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.940
We are roughly at around
45, a little under 45%.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.660
So we dropped 10% in 10 years.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.930
That seems to be how much
this is dropping, roughly 10%

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.680
in 10 years.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.440
Another 10 years go by.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.510
We go from 45, a little
more than 10% in 10 years.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.850
And so that would mean that
we're dropping, on average,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.980
more than one percentage
point per year.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.740
That seems more than
what's going on here.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.250
Now, let's look over here.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.340
Over here, we're starting,
it looks like, at around 42%.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.540
And then after 10 years,
it looks like we're at 37%.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.156
So it looks like
we've dropped about 5%

00:02:23.156 --> 00:02:25.680
in 10 years, which is
consistent with this.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.450
If you drop 5% in
10 years, that means

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.640
you drop half a
percent per year.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.030
So we'll go with Graph 2.
