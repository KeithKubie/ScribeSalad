00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.420
Let's imagine
ourselves in some type

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.510
of a strange casino
with very strange games.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.900
And you walk up to a
table, and on that table

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.660
there is an empty bag.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.990
And the guy who
runs the table says,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.630
look, I've got
some marbles here,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.055
3 green marbles,
2 orange marbles.

00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:19.680
And I'm going to
stick them in the bag.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.120
And he literally sticks
them into the empty bag

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.840
to show you that it's
truly 3 green marbles and 2

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.535
orange marbles.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.700
And he says, the game
that I want you to play,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.470
or if you choose
to play, is you're

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.590
going to look away-- stick
your hand in this bag,

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.000
the bag is not transparent--
feel around the marbles.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.170
All the marbles feel
exactly the same.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.070
And if you're able to
pick 2 green marbles,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.230
if you're able to take 1 marble
out of the bag, it's green.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.500
You put it down on the table.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.830
Then put your hand back in the
bag, and take another marble.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.180
And if that one's also
green, then you're

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.350
going to win the prize.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.500
You're going to win $1
if you get 2 greens.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.870
If you get 2 greens,
you're going to win $1.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.090
You say, well, this sounds
like an interesting game.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.910
How much does it cost to play?

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.270
And the guy tells you,
it is $0.35 to play,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.240
so obviously a fairly
low stakes casino.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.490
So my question to you is, would
you want to play this game?

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.410
And don't put the
fun factor into it.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.630
Just economically, does
it make sense for you

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.810
to actually play this game?

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.450
Well, let's think through the
probabilities a little bit.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.090
So, first of all,
what's the probability

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.155
that the first marble
you pick is green?

00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:49.760
Actually, let me just
write, first green,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.240
probability first green.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.040
Well, the total possible
outcomes-- there's

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.590
5 marbles here,
all equally likely.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.590
So there's 5 possible outcomes.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.580
3 of them satisfy your event
that the first is green.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.639
So there's a 3/5 probability
that the first is green.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.380
So you have a 3/5 chance,
3/5 probability I should say,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.640
that after that first
pick you're kind of still

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.060
in the game.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.870
Now, what we really care
about is your probability

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.620
of winning the game.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.270
You want the first to be
green, and the second green.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.020
Well, let's think about
this a little bit.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.590
What is the probability that
the first is green-- first, I'll

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.310
just write g for green--
and the second is green?

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.630
Now, you might be
tempted to say, oh, well,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.080
maybe the second being green
is the same probability.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.200
It's 3/5.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.810
I can just multiply
3/5 times 3/5,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.350
and I'll get 9/25, seems like
a pretty straightforward thing.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.330
But the realization
here is what you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.420
do with that first green marble.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.020
You don't take that first
green marble out, look at it,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.920
and put it back in the bag.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.790
So when you take
that second pick,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.801
the number of green
marbles that are in the bag

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.550
depends on what you
got on the first pick.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.550
Remember, we take
the marble out.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.360
If it's a green
marble, whatever marble

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.050
it is, at whatever
after the first pick,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.480
we leave it on the table.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.990
We are not replacing it.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.960
So there's not any
replacement here.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.560
So these are not
independent events.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.100
Let me make this
clear, not independent.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.510
Or in particular, the second
pick is dependent on the first.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.920
Dependent on the first pick.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.370
If the first pick
is green, then you

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.130
don't have 3 green
marbles in a bag of 5.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.120
If the first pick
is green, you now

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.200
have 2 green marbles
in a bag of 4.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.829
So the way that we
would refer to this,

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.620
the probability of both
of these happening,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.830
yes, it's definitely
equal to the probability

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:02.500
of the first green times-- now,
this is kind of the new idea--

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.260
the probability of the second
green given-- this little line

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.750
right over here, just a
straight up vertical line, just

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:19.000
means given-- given that
the first was green.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.570
Now, what is the probability
that the second marble is green

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.270
given that the first
marble was green?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.490
Well, we drew the
scenario right over here.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.280
If the first marble
is green, there

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.570
are 4 possible outcomes,
not 5 anymore, and 2 of them

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.150
satisfy your criteria.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.280
So 2 of them satisfy
your criteria.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.830
So the probability of the
first marble green being green

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.997
and the second
marble being green,

00:04:45.997 --> 00:04:48.330
is going to be the probability
that your first is green,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.840
so it's going to be 3/5,
times the probability

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.390
that the second is green,
given that the first was green.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.700
Now you have 1 less
marble in the bag,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.930
and we're assuming that
the first pick was green,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.970
so you'll only have
2 green marbles left.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.280
And so what does this give
us for our total probability?

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.025
Let's see, 3/5 times 2/4.

00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:09.480
Well, 2/4 is the
same thing as 1/2.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.100
This is going to be
equal to 3/5 times

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.690
1/2, which is equal to 3/10.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:24.720
Or we could write that as 0.30,
or we could say there's a 30%

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.920
chance of picking
2 green marbles,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.000
when we are not replacing.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.440
So given that, let me ask
you the question again.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.782
Would you want to
play this game?

00:05:35.782 --> 00:05:37.990
Well, if you played this
game many, many, many, many,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:47.500
many times, on average you have
a 30% chance of winning $1.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.080
And we haven't covered this yet,
but so your expected value is

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.500
really going to
be 30% times $1--

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.320
this gives you a little
bit of a preview--

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.230
which is going to be $0.30
30% chance of winning $1.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.790
You would expect on average,
if you were to play this many,

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.410
many, many times, that playing
the game is going to give you

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.940
$0.30.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.090
Now, would you want to
give someone $0.35 to get,

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.910
on average, $0.30?

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.620
No, you would not want
to play this game.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.470
Now, one thing I will
let you think about

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.510
is, would you want to play
this game if you could replace

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.420
the green marble,
the first pick.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.650
After the first pick, if you
could replace the green marble,

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.863
would you want to play
the game in that scenario?
