people have known that experience can

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370
people have known that experience can
 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.830
people have known that experience can
change the brain ever since it became

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840
change the brain ever since it became
 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.330
change the brain ever since it became
known that the brain was the seat of

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340
known that the brain was the seat of
 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.550
known that the brain was the seat of
consciousness thought and experience and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560
consciousness thought and experience and
 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.609
consciousness thought and experience and
so I would say that for hundreds of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619
so I would say that for hundreds of
 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.370
so I would say that for hundreds of
years has been known implicitly that the

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380
years has been known implicitly that the
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.080
years has been known implicitly that the
brain must undergo change because of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090
brain must undergo change because of
 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.279
brain must undergo change because of
course is the brain is the physical

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289
course is the brain is the physical
 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.929
course is the brain is the physical
object by which we generate our

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939
object by which we generate our
 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.470
object by which we generate our
consciousness and ourselves then there

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480
consciousness and ourselves then there
 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.939
consciousness and ourselves then there
must be some physical change happening

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949
must be some physical change happening
 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.500
must be some physical change happening
in the brain so in that sense I think

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510
in the brain so in that sense I think
 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.020
in the brain so in that sense I think
neuroplasticity has been known

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
neuroplasticity has been known
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.900
neuroplasticity has been known
implicitly for centuries but I think

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910
implicitly for centuries but I think
 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.060
implicitly for centuries but I think
it's really been in the last few decades

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070
it's really been in the last few decades
 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.710
it's really been in the last few decades
that has become really appreciated

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720
that has become really appreciated
 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.899
that has become really appreciated
exactly what happens in the brain so

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909
exactly what happens in the brain so
 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.170
exactly what happens in the brain so
about a little over 50 years ago a

Canadian psychologist named Donald Hebb
 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.450
Canadian psychologist named Donald Hebb
suggested the specific idea that

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460
suggested the specific idea that
 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.090
suggested the specific idea that
experience could change the brain in

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100
experience could change the brain in
 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.979
experience could change the brain in
ways that that perhaps there'd be some

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989
ways that that perhaps there'd be some
 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.380
ways that that perhaps there'd be some
pathway that gets activated an order of

pathway that gets activated an order of
 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.179
pathway that gets activated an order of
events that gets turned on when we

events that gets turned on when we
 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:04.950
events that gets turned on when we
experience something and that when we

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960
experience something and that when we
 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.920
experience something and that when we
recall it we are perhaps playing it back

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930
recall it we are perhaps playing it back
 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.289
recall it we are perhaps playing it back

this the hints of this in writings of
Thomas Hobbes and even Aristotle so it's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830
Thomas Hobbes and even Aristotle so it's
 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.980
Thomas Hobbes and even Aristotle so it's
been in the last 50 years or so that

this suggestion that's been around for

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310
this suggestion that's been around for
 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.000
this suggestion that's been around for
millennia has turned into a very

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010
millennia has turned into a very
 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.350
millennia has turned into a very
concrete suggestion about neural

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360
concrete suggestion about neural
 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.450
concrete suggestion about neural
pathways so that's neuro plasticity in

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460
pathways so that's neuro plasticity in
 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.220
pathways so that's neuro plasticity in
the adult brain then there's also neural

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230
the adult brain then there's also neural
 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.899
the adult brain then there's also neural
plasticity in response to injury and

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909
plasticity in response to injury and
 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.969
plasticity in response to injury and
also during development and all these

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979
also during development and all these
 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.870
also during development and all these
things are facets that have been studied

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
things are facets that have been studied
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.649
things are facets that have been studied
facets of neuroscience that have been

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659
facets of neuroscience that have been
 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.330
facets of neuroscience that have been
studied over the last few decades and is

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340
studied over the last few decades and is
 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.280
studied over the last few decades and is
becoming really appreciated how much the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290
becoming really appreciated how much the
 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.840
becoming really appreciated how much the
brain can change

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
 
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.300
 
when challenged we can do more and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
when challenged we can do more and
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.609
when challenged we can do more and
everyone knows this and when in the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
everyone knows this and when in the
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.350
everyone knows this and when in the
absence of challenges we don't

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
absence of challenges we don't
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.359
absence of challenges we don't
necessarily reach our full potential now

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
necessarily reach our full potential now
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.770
necessarily reach our full potential now
I don't know that that necessarily means

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
I don't know that that necessarily means
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.620
I don't know that that necessarily means
that stress per se is good for the brain

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630
that stress per se is good for the brain
 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.120
that stress per se is good for the brain
what I mean by stress is very

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
what I mean by stress is very
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.430
what I mean by stress is very
specifically the secretion of steroid

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440
specifically the secretion of steroid
 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.800
specifically the secretion of steroid
hormones these hormones that turn up

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
hormones these hormones that turn up
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.080
hormones these hormones that turn up
when we are under some low level

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
when we are under some low level
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.760
when we are under some low level
pressure when we're not allowed to sleep

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
pressure when we're not allowed to sleep
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.040
pressure when we're not allowed to sleep
or when we're under some kind of bodily

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050
or when we're under some kind of bodily
 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.350
or when we're under some kind of bodily
stress where we are put into some kind

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360
stress where we are put into some kind
 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.820
stress where we are put into some kind
of adverse condition for long periods of

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830
of adverse condition for long periods of
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.460
of adverse condition for long periods of
time certainly pressure can make us

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
time certainly pressure can make us
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.790
time certainly pressure can make us
perform better but chronic stress has

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800
perform better but chronic stress has
 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.370
perform better but chronic stress has
been demonstrated to to slow down the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380
been demonstrated to to slow down the
 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.259
been demonstrated to to slow down the
birth of new neurons to reduce the

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269
birth of new neurons to reduce the
 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.509
birth of new neurons to reduce the
plasticity of dendrites and so there are

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519
plasticity of dendrites and so there are
 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.520
plasticity of dendrites and so there are
physical consequences of chronic

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
physical consequences of chronic
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.160
physical consequences of chronic
exposure to stress hormones and and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
exposure to stress hormones and and
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.059
exposure to stress hormones and and
those long-term effects of stress are

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069
those long-term effects of stress are
 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.790
those long-term effects of stress are
mostly unlikely to be very good for us

your heart are good for your brain so
 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.070
your heart are good for your brain so
it's again this principle of good for

examples of that include green leafy

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920
examples of that include green leafy
 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.340
examples of that include green leafy
vegetables they include not having too

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350
vegetables they include not having too
 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.510
vegetables they include not having too
much in the way of saturated fats

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520
much in the way of saturated fats
 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.740
much in the way of saturated fats
because that improves your circulation

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
because that improves your circulation
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.200
because that improves your circulation
or you get older and your brain lives

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210
or you get older and your brain lives
 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.090
or you get older and your brain lives
off of oxygen in the blood and so you

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100
off of oxygen in the blood and so you
 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.979
off of oxygen in the blood and so you
need blood and so when your heart's not

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989
need blood and so when your heart's not
 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.750
need blood and so when your heart's not
getting the oxygen your brains not

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760
getting the oxygen your brains not
 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.840
getting the oxygen your brains not
getting the oxygen one category of foods

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850
getting the oxygen one category of foods
 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.199
getting the oxygen one category of foods
that seems to be somewhat helpful is

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209
that seems to be somewhat helpful is
 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.220
that seems to be somewhat helpful is
antioxidants so for instance blueberries

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230
antioxidants so for instance blueberries
 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.350
antioxidants so for instance blueberries
especially wild blueberries have

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360
especially wild blueberries have
 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.750
especially wild blueberries have
antioxidant properties and they seem to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760
antioxidant properties and they seem to
 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.310
antioxidant properties and they seem to
have some kind of protective effect on

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320
have some kind of protective effect on
 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.720
have some kind of protective effect on
cognitive function as we get older

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730
cognitive function as we get older
 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.000
cognitive function as we get older
omega-3 fatty acids are good for both

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010
omega-3 fatty acids are good for both
 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.590
omega-3 fatty acids are good for both
the heart and for the brain and in fact

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600
the heart and for the brain and in fact
 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.199

I myself take omega-3 fatty acids the OL

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209
I myself take omega-3 fatty acids the OL
 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.909
I myself take omega-3 fatty acids the OL
all these things you can take I mean

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919
all these things you can take I mean
 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.680
all these things you can take I mean
just to put in perspective the only

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690
just to put in perspective the only
 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.060
just to put in perspective the only
things that I make a point of eating are

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
things that I make a point of eating are
 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.670
things that I make a point of eating are
those and and blueberries I like

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680
those and and blueberries I like
 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.210
those and and blueberries I like
blueberries

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220
 
 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.720
 
a lot of therapies well I'll be honest I

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730
a lot of therapies well I'll be honest I
 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.390
a lot of therapies well I'll be honest I
don't really know a lot about

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400
don't really know a lot about
 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.530
don't really know a lot about
demonstrated effects of these therapies

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540
demonstrated effects of these therapies
 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.030
demonstrated effects of these therapies
like art therapy and music therapy on

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040
like art therapy and music therapy on
 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.190
like art therapy and music therapy on
the brain I think one major mechanism

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200
the brain I think one major mechanism
 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.430
the brain I think one major mechanism
that is worth thinking about is the idea

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440
that is worth thinking about is the idea
 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.980
that is worth thinking about is the idea
that these therapies reduce stress one

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990
that these therapies reduce stress one
 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.480
that these therapies reduce stress one
thing that has been demonstrated is that

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490
thing that has been demonstrated is that
 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.490
thing that has been demonstrated is that
stress hormones are bad for the brain so

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500
stress hormones are bad for the brain so
 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.260
stress hormones are bad for the brain so
for instance sleep deprivation leads to

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270
for instance sleep deprivation leads to
 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.350
for instance sleep deprivation leads to
the secretion of stress hormones being

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360
the secretion of stress hormones being
 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.000
the secretion of stress hormones being
in danger I mean stress stress hormones

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010
in danger I mean stress stress hormones
 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.000
in danger I mean stress stress hormones
are stress hormones arose and the stress

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010
are stress hormones arose and the stress
 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.980
are stress hormones arose and the stress
response arose evolutionarily to be

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990
response arose evolutionarily to be
 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.660
response arose evolutionarily to be
something that works briefly if you're

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670
something that works briefly if you're
 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.580
something that works briefly if you're
in if there's danger or if there's

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590
in if there's danger or if there's
 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.720
in if there's danger or if there's
something that's caught your attention

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730
something that's caught your attention
 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.360
something that's caught your attention
and you need to get away from it the

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370
and you need to get away from it the
 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.180
and you need to get away from it the
idea is that your certain systems in

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190
idea is that your certain systems in
 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.620
idea is that your certain systems in
your body shut down like your immune

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630
your body shut down like your immune
 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.540
your body shut down like your immune
response and the idea is that you got to

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550
response and the idea is that you got to
 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.160
response and the idea is that you got to
shut down the unnecessary things so you

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170
shut down the unnecessary things so you
 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.320
shut down the unnecessary things so you
can get it away from danger quickly so

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330
can get it away from danger quickly so
 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.659
can get it away from danger quickly so
that's the normal biological

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669
that's the normal biological
 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.770
that's the normal biological
evolutionary history of stress hormones

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780
evolutionary history of stress hormones
 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.540
evolutionary history of stress hormones
but now in modern times we have

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550
but now in modern times we have
 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.909
but now in modern times we have
situations in which stress is always

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919
situations in which stress is always
 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.520
situations in which stress is always
present and so one major way that these

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530
present and so one major way that these
 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.770
present and so one major way that these
therapies may work is by simply reducing

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780
therapies may work is by simply reducing
 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.360
therapies may work is by simply reducing
the secretion of stress hormones which

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370
the secretion of stress hormones which
 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.220
the secretion of stress hormones which
is good for the brain stress hormones

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230
is good for the brain stress hormones
 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.260
is good for the brain stress hormones
when chronically present can damage the

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270
when chronically present can damage the
 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.060
when chronically present can damage the
brain

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070
 
 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.330
 
it's not exactly it's not fully

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340
it's not exactly it's not fully

it's not exactly it's not fully
understood what it is that exercise does

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710
understood what it is that exercise does
 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.140
understood what it is that exercise does
that's good for the brain the empirical

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150
that's good for the brain the empirical
 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.230
that's good for the brain the empirical
observation is that the one of the best

things you can do to keep your brain
 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.640
things you can do to keep your brain
alive and healthy is fitness training

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650
alive and healthy is fitness training
 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.230
alive and healthy is fitness training
things that get your heart rate up the

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240
things that get your heart rate up the
 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.760
things that get your heart rate up the
kinds of things that hear about getting

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770
kinds of things that hear about getting
 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.770
kinds of things that hear about getting
on the treadmill for three times a week

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780
on the treadmill for three times a week
 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.540
on the treadmill for three times a week
for at least 20 minutes in each session

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550
for at least 20 minutes in each session
 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.910
for at least 20 minutes in each session
that's a classic way of getting fitness

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920
that's a classic way of getting fitness
 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.860
that's a classic way of getting fitness
training and that's been demonstrated to

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870
training and that's been demonstrated to
 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.690
training and that's been demonstrated to
improve brain function especially in

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700
improve brain function especially in
 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.600
improve brain function especially in
older people the mechanism is not known

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610
older people the mechanism is not known
 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.310
older people the mechanism is not known
here are the two major candidates one

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320
here are the two major candidates one
 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.740
here are the two major candidates one
candidate is simply improving blood flow

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750
candidate is simply improving blood flow
 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.480
candidate is simply improving blood flow
to the brain and again it's back to the

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490
to the brain and again it's back to the
 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.100
to the brain and again it's back to the
heart brain principle things are good

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110
heart brain principle things are good
 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.060
heart brain principle things are good
for your heart or good for the brain

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070
for your heart or good for the brain
 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.130
for your heart or good for the brain
another major mechanism that's been

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140
another major mechanism that's been
 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.340
another major mechanism that's been
suggested is the secretion of a

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350
suggested is the secretion of a
 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.900
suggested is the secretion of a
signaling molecule whose job it is to

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910
signaling molecule whose job it is to
 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.030
signaling molecule whose job it is to
allow dendrites to grow and to be

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040
allow dendrites to grow and to be
 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.760
allow dendrites to grow and to be
plastic and this gets back to what we

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770
plastic and this gets back to what we
 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.630
plastic and this gets back to what we
were talking about before about

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640
were talking about before about
 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.300
were talking about before about
neuroplasticity this molecule is called

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310
neuroplasticity this molecule is called
 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.820
neuroplasticity this molecule is called
brain derived neurotrophic factor and if

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830
brain derived neurotrophic factor and if
 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.200
brain derived neurotrophic factor and if
you know what a neurotrophic factor you

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210
you know what a neurotrophic factor you
 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.850
you know what a neurotrophic factor you
know from the name what this does it's a

category and major signalling molecules
 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.860
category and major signalling molecules
in this category are molecules such as

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:29.870
in this category are molecules such as
 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.730
in this category are molecules such as
oxytocin and arginine vasopressin

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740
oxytocin and arginine vasopressin
 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.409
oxytocin and arginine vasopressin
oxytocin and vasopressin are secreted

when we feel feelings of romantic love

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:36.650
when we feel feelings of romantic love
 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.530
when we feel feelings of romantic love
they're also secreted when we feel

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:38.540
they're also secreted when we feel

baby cry will feel their milk drop and
 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.010
baby cry will feel their milk drop and
the mechanism of that is the secretion

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.020
the mechanism of that is the secretion
 

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.159
the mechanism of that is the secretion
of these molecules to cause milk to be

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:51.169
of these molecules to cause milk to be
 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:54.460
of these molecules to cause milk to be
secreted and so it's possible to to

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:54.470
secreted and so it's possible to to
 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.280
secreted and so it's possible to to
reproduce feelings like that those same

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:57.290
reproduce feelings like that those same
 

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.020
