it was Sarah Sewall who came over to
 

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.630
it was Sarah Sewall who came over to
Afghanistan last winter and I think one

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640
Afghanistan last winter and I think one
 

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.210

of the enemy and
 

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.139
of the enemy and
I think that that's a very important

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:44.149
I think that that's a very important
 

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:48.220
I think that that's a very important
part and then myth number five and this

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:48.230
part and then myth number five and this
 

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.689
part and then myth number five and this
gets at the government piece is that

00:08:49.689 --> 00:08:49.699

president and our partner dooms our
 

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.210
president and our partner dooms our
mission and I think that gets back to

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:58.220
mission and I think that gets back to
 

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.300
mission and I think that gets back to
the whole government piece I think it's

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.310
the whole government piece I think it's
 

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.910
the whole government piece I think it's
commonly recognized that that power is

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920
commonly recognized that that power is
 

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.309
commonly recognized that that power is
going to have to be devolved some from

00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:06.319
going to have to be devolved some from
 

00:09:06.319 --> 00:09:11.470
going to have to be devolved some from
the center and it's that's how the

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.480
the center and it's that's how the
 

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.059
the center and it's that's how the
society is going to work in some way

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:13.069
society is going to work in some way
 

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:17.040
society is going to work in some way
decentralized portion and so I think

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.050
decentralized portion and so I think
 

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.759
decentralized portion and so I think
reconciliation is going to start to

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:18.769
reconciliation is going to start to
 

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:21.579
reconciliation is going to start to
force some of that really what people

00:09:21.579 --> 00:09:21.589
force some of that really what people
 

00:09:21.589 --> 00:09:22.929
force some of that really what people
want locally and that's what they're

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:22.939
want locally and that's what they're
 

00:09:22.939 --> 00:09:24.189
want locally and that's what they're
fighting against is their local

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:24.199
fighting against is their local
 

00:09:24.199 --> 00:09:27.999
fighting against is their local
districts of Governors and local police

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:28.009
districts of Governors and local police
 

00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:29.470
districts of Governors and local police
and the corruption at the local level

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480
and the corruption at the local level
 

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.050
and the corruption at the local level
that's what they see Kabul is not really

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:32.060
that's what they see Kabul is not really
 

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.970
that's what they see Kabul is not really
a psychological center of gravity's the

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:33.980
a psychological center of gravity's the
 

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.860
a psychological center of gravity's the
same as what you saw a lot of we saw in

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:35.870
same as what you saw a lot of we saw in
 

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.590
same as what you saw a lot of we saw in
Iraq where people were really focused on

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600
Iraq where people were really focused on
 

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.900
Iraq where people were really focused on
Baghdad they're not as focused on it in

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:40.910
Baghdad they're not as focused on it in
 

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.879
Baghdad they're not as focused on it in
Kabul and so we I think what we we need

00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:45.889
Kabul and so we I think what we we need
 

00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:47.679
Kabul and so we I think what we we need
to do is really focus on the kind of

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:47.689
to do is really focus on the kind of
 

00:09:47.689 --> 00:09:48.939
to do is really focus on the kind of
building the kind of government that's

00:09:48.939 --> 00:09:48.949
building the kind of government that's
 

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:52.809
building the kind of government that's
going to last over there and and that's

00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:52.819
going to last over there and and that's
 

00:09:52.819 --> 00:09:54.579
going to last over there and and that's
really what counterinsurgency is is a

00:09:54.579 --> 00:09:54.589
really what counterinsurgency is is a
 

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:56.439
really what counterinsurgency is is a
comprehensive strategy to make sure that

00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:56.449
comprehensive strategy to make sure that
 

00:09:56.449 --> 00:10:00.519
comprehensive strategy to make sure that
we are not having defeating dismantling

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:00.529
we are not having defeating dismantling
 

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:02.429
we are not having defeating dismantling
and defeating the Taliban but also then

00:10:02.429 --> 00:10:02.439
and defeating the Taliban but also then
 

00:10:02.439 --> 00:10:04.960
and defeating the Taliban but also then
providing an environment where it's not

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:04.970
providing an environment where it's not
 

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.439
providing an environment where it's not
going to allow terrorist safe havens so

00:10:08.439 --> 00:10:08.449
going to allow terrorist safe havens so
 

00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:10.990
going to allow terrorist safe havens so

central government but power will be

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:16.370
central government but power will be
 

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.100

the possibility of potential alternative
strategies and that would be the first

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:03.790
strategies and that would be the first
 

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.340
strategies and that would be the first
half of my remarks and the second I'm

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:05.350

least in one small but an important
segment of the war so you know I think

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:22.810

there are some some myths as well not
 

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.090
there are some some myths as well not
just about Afghanistan but about

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.100
just about Afghanistan but about
 

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.980
just about Afghanistan but about
counterinsurgency generally and I think

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:28.990
counterinsurgency generally and I think
 

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.110
counterinsurgency generally and I think

one of the most problematic from a
 

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.180
one of the most problematic from a
policy standpoint at this point is the

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.190
policy standpoint at this point is the
 

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.070
policy standpoint at this point is the
myth of American agency in these

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.080
myth of American agency in these
 

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.350
myth of American agency in these

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:33.430
it you do apply a lot of the same
 

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:34.770
it you do apply a lot of the same
lessons I mean obviously we're learning

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:34.780
lessons I mean obviously we're learning
 

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.680
lessons I mean obviously we're learning
from what we're doing one of the points

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:37.690
from what we're doing one of the points
 

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.150
from what we're doing one of the points
that I brought out earlier though that I

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160
that I brought out earlier though that I
 

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.839
that I brought out earlier though that I
think you can't neglect is and this gets

00:37:42.839 --> 00:37:42.849
think you can't neglect is and this gets
 

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:44.549
think you can't neglect is and this gets
back to well the military if they just

00:37:44.549 --> 00:37:44.559
back to well the military if they just
 

00:37:44.559 --> 00:37:47.039
back to well the military if they just
build the security forces and then we'll

00:37:47.039 --> 00:37:47.049
build the security forces and then we'll
 

00:37:47.049 --> 00:37:49.799
build the security forces and then we'll
focus on the political problem will the

00:37:49.799 --> 00:37:49.809
focus on the political problem will the
 

00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:52.440
focus on the political problem will the
whatever the forces they have - a lot of

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:52.450
whatever the forces they have - a lot of
 

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:54.780
whatever the forces they have - a lot of
that is a the political problem as I

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:54.790
that is a the political problem as I
 

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.309
that is a the political problem as I
mentioned earlier and so if they're

00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319
mentioned earlier and so if they're
 

00:37:56.319 --> 00:37:59.700
mentioned earlier and so if they're
buying into the government and you're

00:37:59.700 --> 00:37:59.710
buying into the government and you're
 

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.799
buying into the government and you're
trying to have a certain quality I do

00:38:01.799 --> 00:38:01.809
trying to have a certain quality I do
 

00:38:01.809 --> 00:38:03.569
trying to have a certain quality I do
think that those are the most important

00:38:03.569 --> 00:38:03.579
think that those are the most important
 

00:38:03.579 --> 00:38:07.890
think that those are the most important
pieces to getting a the security forces

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:07.900
pieces to getting a the security forces
 

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.740
pieces to getting a the security forces
built up I do think that we have done a

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:10.750
built up I do think that we have done a
 

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:13.080
built up I do think that we have done a
lot more over the last year or so

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:13.090
lot more over the last year or so
 

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.850
lot more over the last year or so
with general Caldwell there's been a

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:14.860
with general Caldwell there's been a
 

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.410
with general Caldwell there's been a
real focus on that and a lot of that has

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:16.420
real focus on that and a lot of that has
 

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.750
real focus on that and a lot of that has
been the resources there's been a lot

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760
been the resources there's been a lot
 

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.370
been the resources there's been a lot
more resources that have been focused

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:20.380
more resources that have been focused
 

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.340
more resources that have been focused
and helping to train those but that was

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:23.350
and helping to train those but that was
 

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.230
and helping to train those but that was
a big that was a big focus of what we

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240
a big that was a big focus of what we
 

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.690
a big that was a big focus of what we
were what we were doing over there so I

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:27.700
were what we were doing over there so I
 

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.400
were what we were doing over there so I
do think that the lessons have been

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:29.410
do think that the lessons have been
 

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.230
do think that the lessons have been
applied I guess one of my big concerns

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240
applied I guess one of my big concerns
 

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.390
applied I guess one of my big concerns

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:11.610
comprehensive approach and I think
that's what we need to look at to even

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:11.620
that's what we need to look at to even
 

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.250
that's what we need to look at to even
get it what we're talking about in

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:14.260
get it what we're talking about in
 

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.010
get it what we're talking about in
Afghanistan and starting to withdraw and

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:17.020
Afghanistan and starting to withdraw and
 

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:17.760
Afghanistan and starting to withdraw and
do certain

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:17.770
do certain
 

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:19.530
do certain
certain conditions are gonna have to be

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:19.540
certain conditions are gonna have to be
 

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.780
certain conditions are gonna have to be
there on the ground in my opinion from

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:21.790
there on the ground in my opinion from
 

00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:25.560
there on the ground in my opinion from
what I what I saw in my area the the CDI

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:25.570
what I what I saw in my area the the CDI
 

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:27.930
what I what I saw in my area the the CDI
the initiatives that Austin was talking

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:27.940
the initiatives that Austin was talking
 

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.870
the initiatives that Austin was talking
about they will not survive out there in

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880
about they will not survive out there in
 

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.450
about they will not survive out there in
those areas unless there's some kind of

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:33.460
those areas unless there's some kind of
 

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.490
those areas unless there's some kind of
a political accommodation and we won't

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:35.500
a political accommodation and we won't
 

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.130
a political accommodation and we won't
get the kind of intelligence and sure we

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:38.140
get the kind of intelligence and sure we
 

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.110
get the kind of intelligence and sure we
can blanket the whole area with all

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:40.120
can blanket the whole area with all
 

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.330
can blanket the whole area with all
other kinds of assets but we're not

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:42.340
other kinds of assets but we're not
 

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.130
other kinds of assets but we're not
going to have people telling us that

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:44.140
going to have people telling us that
 

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.290
going to have people telling us that
there's terrorists out there or their

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:46.300
there's terrorists out there or their
 

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.690
there's terrorists out there or their
safe havens unless we have allies out

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:48.700
safe havens unless we have allies out
 

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:50.070
safe havens unless we have allies out
there and we're gonna have to work to do

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:50.080
there and we're gonna have to work to do
 

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.750
there and we're gonna have to work to do
that and that's gonna be part of I think

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760
that and that's gonna be part of I think
 

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.660
that and that's gonna be part of I think
reconciliation or or some sort of

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:54.670
reconciliation or or some sort of
 

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:58.500
reconciliation or or some sort of
political accommodation so I think that

00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:58.510
political accommodation so I think that
 

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.540
political accommodation so I think that
we have to look for I guess what I'm

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:00.550
we have to look for I guess what I'm
 

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.100
we have to look for I guess what I'm
getting at is that we have to figure out

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:02.110
getting at is that we have to figure out
 

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.290
getting at is that we have to figure out
the way forward from this if we're going

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:04.300
the way forward from this if we're going
 

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.790
the way forward from this if we're going
to get down to a certain piece and I

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:05.800
to get down to a certain piece and I
 

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.560
to get down to a certain piece and I
certainly believe that a stable

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:07.570
certainly believe that a stable
 

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:10.830
certainly believe that a stable
Afghanistan will help with what's going

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:10.840
Afghanistan will help with what's going
 

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.370
Afghanistan will help with what's going
on in Pakistan and which is is what you

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:14.380
on in Pakistan and which is is what you
 

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.990
on in Pakistan and which is is what you
were you were bringing up and I guess

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000
were you were bringing up and I guess
 

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.300
were you were bringing up and I guess
that's that's that's the argument here

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:18.310
that's that's that's the argument here
 

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.500
that's that's that's the argument here
is is just staying and doing very little

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:21.510
is is just staying and doing very little
 

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.670
is is just staying and doing very little
first of all how do we get to that point

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680
first of all how do we get to that point
 

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.150
first of all how do we get to that point
and then is it worthwhile stabilizing

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160
and then is it worthwhile stabilizing
 

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.890
and then is it worthwhile stabilizing
that so it will also help Pakistan and I

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:28.900
that so it will also help Pakistan and I
 

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.470
that so it will also help Pakistan and I
believe that it will I'll jump in

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480
believe that it will I'll jump in
 

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.090
believe that it will I'll jump in
respond to that I don't want to spend

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:33.100
respond to that I don't want to spend
 

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.170
respond to that I don't want to spend
too much time on this because there are

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:34.180
too much time on this because there are
 

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.150
too much time on this because there are
four other people in line but first on

01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:57.600
be different region to region where you
 

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.930
be different region to region where you
have where you have political buy-in in

01:04:59.930 --> 01:04:59.940
have where you have political buy-in in
 

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.760
have where you have political buy-in in
certain areas and you could really focus

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:01.770
certain areas and you could really focus
 

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:03.410
certain areas and you could really focus
on quality because you've got the right

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.420
on quality because you've got the right
 

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.350
on quality because you've got the right
mix so it's just like Afghanistan a very

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:06.360
mix so it's just like Afghanistan a very
 

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.910
mix so it's just like Afghanistan a very
decentralized problem I think that

01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920
decentralized problem I think that
 

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.960
decentralized problem I think that
that's how you're gonna have to tackle

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:08.970
that's how you're gonna have to tackle
 

01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:12.770
that's how you're gonna have to tackle
it I would be encouraged by what's

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:12.780
it I would be encouraged by what's
 

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.240
it I would be encouraged by what's
happening at the national level as far

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:14.250
happening at the national level as far
 

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.690
happening at the national level as far
as building up other aspects of enablers

01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700
as building up other aspects of enablers
 

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.980
as building up other aspects of enablers
which is a lot of the other things that

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:18.990
which is a lot of the other things that
 

01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:20.290
which is a lot of the other things that
we're talking about that we would need

01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:20.300
we're talking about that we would need
 

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.880
we're talking about that we would need
to continue to prosecute any kind of

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:22.890
to continue to prosecute any kind of
 

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:26.260
to continue to prosecute any kind of
action against terrorists in the future

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:26.270
action against terrorists in the future
 

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:28.670
action against terrorists in the future
I think the quite Ashura

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680
I think the quite Ashura
 

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.920
I think the quite Ashura
question was was already answered and

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:30.930
question was was already answered and
 

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:32.000
question was was already answered and
the only thing I would add again is

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:32.010
the only thing I would add again is
 

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:33.560
the only thing I would add again is
there several other groups that are over

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:33.570
there several other groups that are over
 

01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:35.510
there several other groups that are over
there that we sometimes we lose focus

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520
there that we sometimes we lose focus
 

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.220
there that we sometimes we lose focus
and we just get primarily focused on

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:37.230
and we just get primarily focused on
 

01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:39.470
and we just get primarily focused on
that one group but as political

01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480
that one group but as political
 

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.090
that one group but as political
accommodation reconciliation and all

01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:41.100
accommodation reconciliation and all
 

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.500
accommodation reconciliation and all
these are going to take place you're

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:42.510
these are going to take place you're
 

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:43.880
these are going to take place you're
gonna have to look at a lot of different

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:43.890
gonna have to look at a lot of different
 

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:47.840
gonna have to look at a lot of different
groups over there moving forward you

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:47.850
groups over there moving forward you
 

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:49.820
groups over there moving forward you
know it's on the development one because

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:49.830
know it's on the development one because
 

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:52.370
know it's on the development one because
we didn't talk about that much is you

01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380
we didn't talk about that much is you
 

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.230
we didn't talk about that much is you
know a lot of people see Afghanistan as

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240
know a lot of people see Afghanistan as
 

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.500
know a lot of people see Afghanistan as
I've seen it as a reconstruction problem

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:57.510
I've seen it as a reconstruction problem
 

01:05:57.510 --> 01:06:00.770
I've seen it as a reconstruction problem
and that's kind of got to give us a lot

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780
and that's kind of got to give us a lot
 

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.750
and that's kind of got to give us a lot
of problems today that we looked at it

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760
of problems today that we looked at it
 

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.180
of problems today that we looked at it
that way for several years and a lot of

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:05.190
that way for several years and a lot of
 

01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:07.100
that way for several years and a lot of
our money is really contributed to the

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:07.110
our money is really contributed to the
 

01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:07.550
our money is really contributed to the
problem

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:07.560
problem
 

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.580
problem
so when people a lot of these groups

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:10.590
so when people a lot of these groups
 

01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:12.050
so when people a lot of these groups
that come over are spending US

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:12.060
that come over are spending US
 

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:15.230
that come over are spending US
government money and I think we have we

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240
government money and I think we have we
 

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.820
government money and I think we have we
owe it to taxpayers to make sure that

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:16.830
owe it to taxpayers to make sure that
 

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:18.520
owe it to taxpayers to make sure that
we're spending that money correctly

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:18.530
we're spending that money correctly
 

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:21.020
we're spending that money correctly
we're making sure that we're integrated

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:21.030
we're making sure that we're integrated
 

01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:23.090
we're making sure that we're integrated
and how we're doing development over

01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:23.100
and how we're doing development over
 

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.610
and how we're doing development over
there and it is important that we we

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:25.620
there and it is important that we we
 

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.220
there and it is important that we we
look at that sometimes I think we get

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:28.230
look at that sometimes I think we get
 

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:30.350
look at that sometimes I think we get
caught up in to more because we have a

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:30.360
caught up in to more because we have a
 

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.750
caught up in to more because we have a
lot of resources that's we get caught up

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760
lot of resources that's we get caught up
 

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.630
lot of resources that's we get caught up
in the metric of how much we spend makes

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640
in the metric of how much we spend makes
 

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:39.920
in the metric of how much we spend makes
us feel good and it's not and I think

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:39.930
us feel good and it's not and I think
 

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:42.590
us feel good and it's not and I think
that has heard us and and we have

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:42.600
that has heard us and and we have
 

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.570
that has heard us and and we have
actually contributed to corruption and

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:44.580
actually contributed to corruption and
 

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.560
actually contributed to corruption and
we just need to really focus on on that

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:48.570
we just need to really focus on on that
 

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:54.440
we just need to really focus on on that
in the future Alliance were the question

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.450
in the future Alliance were the question
 

01:06:54.450 --> 01:06:56.330
in the future Alliance were the question
I think the obviously the cost will

01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:56.340
I think the obviously the cost will
 

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.340
I think the obviously the cost will
increase for us public opinion

01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:58.350
increase for us public opinion
 

01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:00.980
increase for us public opinion
everything that's already going on right

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:00.990
everything that's already going on right
 

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:03.920
everything that's already going on right
now what I do think we should be doing

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:03.930
now what I do think we should be doing
 

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:05.390
now what I do think we should be doing
is working harder to get regional

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400
is working harder to get regional
 

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.950
is working harder to get regional
stakeholders involved I mean the

01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960
stakeholders involved I mean the
 

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.620
stakeholders involved I mean the
question came up about drugs one country

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:09.630
question came up about drugs one country
 

01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:12.080
question came up about drugs one country
that has that is very focused on that is

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:12.090
that has that is very focused on that is
 

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:15.740
that has that is very focused on that is
Russia and what I would like I think we

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:15.750
Russia and what I would like I think we
 

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:17.000
Russia and what I would like I think we
should do is spend a lot more energy

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:17.010
should do is spend a lot more energy
 

01:07:17.010 --> 01:07:18.620
should do is spend a lot more energy
trying to get a lot of more of the

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:18.630
trying to get a lot of more of the
 

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:21.680
trying to get a lot of more of the
regional stakeholders involved in and

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:21.690
regional stakeholders involved in and
 

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:24.950
regional stakeholders involved in and
what's going on over there and instead

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960
what's going on over there and instead
 

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.810
what's going on over there and instead
of sometimes the focus which seems to be

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:26.820
of sometimes the focus which seems to be
 

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.560
of sometimes the focus which seems to be
you know very centric to us or

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:29.570
you know very centric to us or
 

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:32.270
you know very centric to us or
Eurocentric and and put a little more

01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280
Eurocentric and and put a little more
 

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.910
Eurocentric and and put a little more
energy diplomatically in getting those

01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920
energy diplomatically in getting those
 

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.410
energy diplomatically in getting those
stakeholders involved and I think that

01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:36.420
stakeholders involved and I think that
 

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:41.030
stakeholders involved and I think that
would help so and I guess last is like I

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:41.040
would help so and I guess last is like I
 

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.610
would help so and I guess last is like I
said it did it is popular to point out

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:43.620
said it did it is popular to point out
 

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.760
said it did it is popular to point out
the 28 percent literacy rate or five

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:46.770
the 28 percent literacy rate or five
 

01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:48.800
the 28 percent literacy rate or five
percent literacy rate and and all the

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:48.810
percent literacy rate and and all the
 

01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:51.550
percent literacy rate and and all the
problems that we know exist over there

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:51.560
problems that we know exist over there
 

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.530
problems that we know exist over there
what what is what I really I think is

01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:54.540
what what is what I really I think is
 

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.630
what what is what I really I think is
important is whatever strategy it is and

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640
important is whatever strategy it is and
 

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.020
important is whatever strategy it is and
counter-insurgency or CT throws are not

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:00.030
counter-insurgency or CT throws are not
 

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:01.760
counter-insurgency or CT throws are not
just strategies and then we have to have

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:01.770
just strategies and then we have to have
 

01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:04.040
just strategies and then we have to have
comprehensive idea on how to move

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:04.050
comprehensive idea on how to move
 

01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:05.660
comprehensive idea on how to move
forward here what kind of government is

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:05.670
forward here what kind of government is
 

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:07.370
forward here what kind of government is
going to work best or if we're not going

01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380
going to work best or if we're not going
 

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:08.840
going to work best or if we're not going
to leave it how are we going to leave

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:08.850
to leave it how are we going to leave
 

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:10.610
to leave it how are we going to leave
those things that we really focus on

01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:10.620
those things that we really focus on
 

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.320
those things that we really focus on
