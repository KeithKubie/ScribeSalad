00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.030
Three people are at a dinner party.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.054
Paul, who’s married, is looking at Linda.

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:17.480
Meanwhile, Linda is looking at John, 
who’s not married.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.964
Is someone who’s married looking 
at someone who’s not married?

00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:24.564
Take a moment to think about it.

00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:28.395
Most people answer that there’s 
not enough information to tell.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.530
And most people are wrong.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.770
Linda must be either married 
or not married—there are no other options.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.064
So in either scenario, someone married 
is looking at someone who’s not married.

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:43.322
When presented with the explanation, 
most people change their minds

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:44.799
and accept the correct answer,

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.100
despite being very confident 
in their first responses.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.906
Now let’s look at another case.

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:53.781
A 2005 study by Brendan Nyhan 
and Jason Reifler

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:58.831
examined American attitudes regarding 
the justifications for the Iraq War.

00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:01.938
Researchers presented participants 
with a news article

00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:05.574
that showed no weapons 
of mass destruction had been found.

00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:10.669
Yet many participants not only continued 
to believe that WMDs had been found,

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:14.528
but they even became more convinced 
of their original views.

00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:20.136
So why do arguments change people’s minds 
in some cases and backfire in others?

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:25.034
Arguments are more convincing when they 
rest on a good knowledge of the audience,

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:27.615
taking into account 
what the audience believes,

00:01:27.615 --> 00:01:28.845
who they trust,

00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:31.185
and what they value.

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:35.615
Mathematical and logical arguments 
like the dinner party brainteaser work

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:38.215
because even when people 
reach different conclusions,

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:41.543
they’re starting from 
the same set of shared beliefs.

00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:47.562
In 1931, a young, unknown mathematician 
named Kurt Gödel presented a proof

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:51.347
that a logically complete
system of mathematics was impossible.

00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:54.553
Despite upending decades of
work by brilliant mathematicians

00:01:54.553 --> 00:01:56.824
like Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert,

00:01:56.824 --> 00:01:58.203
the proof was accepted

00:01:58.203 --> 00:02:02.952
because it relied on axioms that 
everyone in the field already agreed on.

00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:06.222
Of course, many disagreements involve 
different beliefs

00:02:06.222 --> 00:02:08.994
that can’t simply be reconciled
through logic.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:11.758
When these beliefs involve 
outside information,

00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:16.672
the issue often comes down to
what sources and authorities people trust.

00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:19.831
One study asked people to estimate 
several statistics

00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:22.393
related to the scope of climate change.

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:24.471
Participants were asked questions,

00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:29.297
such as “how many of the years 
between 1995 and 2006

00:02:29.297 --> 00:02:33.819
were one of the hottest 12 years 
since 1850?”

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.451
After providing their answers,

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:39.511
they were presented with data from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,

00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:44.144
in this case showing that the answer 
was 11 of the 12 years.

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:48.270
Being provided with these reliable 
statistics from a trusted official source

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.772
made people more likely to accept 
the reality that the earth is warming.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:56.599
Finally, for disagreements that 
can’t be definitively settled

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.556
with statistics or evidence,

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:00.348
making a convincing argument

00:03:00.348 --> 00:03:03.466
may depend on engaging 
the audience’s values.

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:07.326
For example, researchers have conducted 
a number of studies

00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:10.337
where they’ve asked people 
of different political backgrounds

00:03:10.337 --> 00:03:12.254
to rank their values.

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:15.490
Liberals in these studies, 
on average, rank fairness—

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.405
here meaning whether everyone is treated 
in the same way—above loyalty.

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:24.748
In later studies, researchers attempted 
to convince liberals

00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:28.336
to support military spending with 
a variety of arguments.

00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:30.279
Arguments based on fairness—

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.733
like that the military provides employment

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:35.458
and education to people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds—

00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:39.093
were more convincing than arguments 
based on loyalty—

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:41.935
such as that the military 
unifies a nation.

00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:44.323
These three elements—

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:47.169
beliefs, trusted sources, and values—

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.232
may seem like a simple formula 
for finding agreement and consensus.

00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:55.446
The problem is that our initial 
inclination is to think of arguments

00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:59.660
that rely on our own beliefs, 
trusted sources, and values.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.953
And even when we don’t,

00:04:00.953 --> 00:04:04.496
it can be challenging to correctly 
identify what’s held dear

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:07.259
by people who don’t already agree with us.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.043
The best way to find out
is simply to talk to them.

00:04:10.043 --> 00:04:11.749
In the course of discussion,

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.927
you’ll be exposed to counter-arguments
and rebuttals.

00:04:14.927 --> 00:04:19.094
These can help you make your own 
arguments and reasoning more convincing

00:04:19.094 --> 00:04:23.303
and sometimes, you may even end up 
being the one changing your mind.
