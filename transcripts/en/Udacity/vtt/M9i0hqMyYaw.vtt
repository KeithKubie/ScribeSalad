00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this problem, imagine that your sitting on a swing set here that's 1 m off the ground,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the swing itself is expanded 4 m below the top of the swing set here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now it turns out we can view the movement of you on the swing moving back and forth

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as being the same as the movement of the pendulum back and forth.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For this problem, imagine that the maximum angle

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
you ever reach away from the vertical here is 45°.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When you swing back all the way and you run out of velocity,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you're at 45° away from the vertical line here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And one time when your swinging forward, however, you decide to jump off the swing

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
when the swing makes an angle at the vertical of exactly 30°, and of course you end up going flying

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and making a parabolic trajectory in the air before you finally land on the ground.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now can you tell me how far away from the swing you land.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You should measure this distance from the point on the ground

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to right below the point where you jumped off the swing.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Also, for this problem you should assume that you have a mass of 60 kg.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Put your answer here. Good luck!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now just as a hint for solving this problem,

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you're probably going to have to use conservation of energy, so keep that in mind.
