00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.700
Convert 37
centimeters to meters.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.850
Let me write this over.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.910
37, and I'll write centi
in a different color

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.610
to emphasize the prefix.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.600
37 centimeters, and we want
to convert it to meters.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.350
So we really just have
to remind ourselves

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.420
what the prefix centi means.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.920
Centi literally means 1/100th,
or one hundredth of a meter.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.030
So this is really saying
37 hundredth meters,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.660
so let's write it that way.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.900
This is literally
37/100 of a meter.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.010
So 1/100 meters.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.300
These are equivalent statements.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.980
So what are 37/100 of a meter?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:03.620
Well, that's going to be
37/100 of a meter, which

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.900
can be rewritten
as, if you wanted

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.520
to write it as a
decimal, that's 0.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.260
you could view it as 3/10
and 7/100, or 37/100.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.850
So 0.37, 0.37 meters.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.580
Another way that you could have
thought about this is look,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.570
I'm going to go from
centimeters to meters.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.840
I have 100.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.370
I need 100 centimeters
to get to one meter,

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.270
so I'm going to have to
divide by 100 in order

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.590
to figure out how
many meters I have.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.670
And you should always
do a reality check.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.500
If I convert
centimeters to meters,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.080
should I get a larger
number or a smaller number?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.190
Well, however many
centimeters I have,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.720
I'm going to have a
fewer number of meters.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.850
Meters is a larger unit.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.280
So you should have a
smaller value here,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.035
and it should be a smaller
value by a factor of 100.

00:01:56.035 --> 00:01:57.660
So you literally
could have started off

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.650
with 37 centimeters.

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:03.690
Let me write it this
way, 37 centimeters.

00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:10.050
And actually, let's go
through a couple of the units

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.300
right over here.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.110
Now, if you wanted to turn it
to decimeters, so this is 1/100.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.580
Decimeters, one over 1/10.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.000
So you would divide.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.445
This would be 3.7 decimeters.

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:24.953
Let me write this
as 3.7 decimeters.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.850
And a decimeter is
1/10 of a meter,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.760
so you would divide by 10 again.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.030
So this is 0.37 meters.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.730
So one way to think about
it is to go from centimeters

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.610
to meters, you're
going to divide by 100.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.590
Dividing by 100, you would
move the decimal space over

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.140
to the left two times.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.130
Doing it once divides by 10.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.230
Doing it twice divides by 100.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.290
So you get to 0.37 meters.
