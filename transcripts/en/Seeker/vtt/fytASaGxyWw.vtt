00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.070
In March, scientists announced the discovery
of gravitational waves and evidence for the

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.100
Big Bang!

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.330
Today... well, they're not so sure.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.680
Hello everyone, I'm Ian O'Neill, space producer
for Discovery News, and, like many of our

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.860
viewers, I'm a little confused.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.530
You may remember the video when Trace and
I got very excited about gravitational waves

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.360
embedded in the cosmic microwave background
radiation, known simply as the "CMB".

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.440
We even sacrificed a whole pack of balloons
to help explain this historic discovery!

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.149
But now the team of researchers have urged
caution about their original announcement

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.510
after other space scientists began doubting
their conclusions.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.809
It's thought the CMB is the weak echo of the
Big Bang that happened nearly 14 billion years

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.809
ago.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.219
Using a telescope located at the South Pole
called BICEP2, the researchers concluded that

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.460
they were indeed looking at the signature
of gravitational waves.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.420
This discovery proved the inflationary model
of the Big Bang and even provided possible

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.300
evidence for quantum gravity.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.109
These are all amazing discoveries!

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.840
Unfortunately, there was one problem.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.309
Well, there were TWO problems.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.020
Galactic dust fills the Milky Way and, when
looking out into the Cosmos, this dust gets

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.670
in the way, creating its own polarization
signature.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.960
Astronomers need to correct for this dusty
interference in order to find gravitational

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.369
waves in the CMB.

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.759
The European Space Agency has a telescope
called Planck that is ALSO looking for evidence

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.950
of gravitational waves in this Big Bang Echo.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.939
Planck can also create an accurate map of
this galactic dust because it's surveying

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:26.939
the entire sky.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.530
When the BICEP2 astronomers corrected for
the dust, they only had very limited data

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.600
from Planck so, according to critics, they
made insufficient corrections and the now-famous

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.970
polarization was more likely caused by dust
and not gravitational waves.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.939
The SECOND problem is that the researchers
made the groundbreaking announcement BEFORE

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.070
they'd published their work to a scientific
journal.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.360
But this month, the BICEP2 team finally published
their work.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.240
Although they stand by their research, they
also pointed out that dust COULD have interfered

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.250
their results.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.940
To remove the galactic dust interference,
they need to wait until Planck releases detailed

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.429
measurements later this year.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.282
So now the big question is: Why the heck did
the BICEP2 team make an announcement of this

00:02:03.282 --> 00:02:05.370
magnitude before they'd even published?

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.282
Well, it could be argued that the BICEP2 team
were so confident in their analysis that they

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:11.390
were just enthusiastic to get the word out.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.560
Sometimes in science it's important to make
a big announcement first to secure your name

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.330
in the history books before any competing
scientists can do the same.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.360
Or perhaps they just wanted to make their
results known to the scientific community

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.390
before publishing so their conclusions could
be checked.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.970
So they may have been premature, but it's
important to remember that the BICEP2 findings

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.140
COULD STILL be real and gravitational waves
and the theories behind the Big Bang are just

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.830
as valid TODAY as they were in March.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.050
Right or wrong, it's fascinating to see the
scientific process play out on a very public

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.050
stage.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.500
I just hope, for the BICEP2 scientists' sake,
that the upcoming Planck data proves they

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500
were right.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.500
What do you think?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.700
Let us know in the comments below and keep
coming back from more science videos every

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.230
