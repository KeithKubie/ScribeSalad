00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.100
Not only can we use our SNVs to

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.180
connect ourselves and our families to populations all

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.380
over the world, but we can even connect

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.900
to one of our extinct relatives. Homo Sapiens Sapiens

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.120
us, to Homo Sapiens Neaderthalensis. This is a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.270
close but extinct species. Neanderthals evolved outside of

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.650
Africa, and existed along a geographic range that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.710
covered Europe through parts of the middle east and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.750
central Asia, and using nothing more than

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.808
a DNA sample from Neandertal bones over

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:34.540
30,000 years old. A first draft of

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.790
the Neandertal genome project was published in May

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.330
2010. Since this report has been published, new research has suggested

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.090
that Neanderthals and humans actually interbred with

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.860
each other in Mesopotamia. A region in the Middle East about

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.940
50 to 100,000 years ago. New research

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.250
indicates that Neandertal chromosome regions were identified

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.340
in European and Asian genomes, but not

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.150
in African genomes, which was expected based

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.590
on the geographies of Neandertal fossils. Amazingly.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.410
Looking at the SNVs shared between humans

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.860
and neanderthals, we can estimate roughly what

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.050
percentage of your genome might be carrying

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.110
genetic information that was once part of the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.110
neanderthal genome. So even though neanderthals are now extinct,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.440
they left relics of themselves in our own

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.040
genomes through possible interbreeding. And on the 23andMe website,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.260
they actually have an ancestry tool to discover

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.850
what percentage of your genome has neanderthal variation. So,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.810
here I'm showing you mine. I'm about 2.7%

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.270
neanderthal. I'm in the 56th percentile, and they even

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.740
have a little comparison here for you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.590
to see, essentially, how modern humans compare to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.400
neanderthals. Now it's important to remember, this

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.050
is kind of speculative and it's an estimation

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.040
based on the current data. And as new data comes in, these values may be

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.070
reassessed. And we may change how we

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.450
think about the human in the neanderthal relationship.
