00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.929
Kristof, let me ask you.

00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:08.369
Why do you think that Truman has never come close to discovering the true nature of his world until now?

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.439
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:21.089
In the beginning of the truman show a star falls from the sky, well.. a light falls from the ceiling of a sky-high

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.199
Set that encloses an artificial town built for the life of one

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.099
man

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.668
and the entertainment of the whole world the light says sirius nine canis major which refers to

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.460
sirius the Brightest [star] in the night sky

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.620
This star which [homer] once called an evil portent bringing heat and fevers to suffering humanity. In the film the falling of Sirius

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.620
is the first in a series of

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.579
Ruptures in Truman's fake reality,  a series that ends here with [an] actual rupture a breach in things as they are

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.879
like an homer Peter Weir director of the Truman show

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.279
envisions this door into real reality

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.609
in darker terms than you might expect. All the symbols we usually associate with goodness and positivity are

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.519
behind Truman. Bright blue skies sunbeams breaking through the clouds an expanse of sea of

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.319
possibility. Reality,  truth and authenticity on the other hand are relegated to a small single rectangle of

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:20.770
shadow

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.420
hardly the light at the end of the Tunnel that we normally associate with

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.920
liberation all throughout the film freedom for Truman is linked tightly with trauma every peek behind the curtain is accompanied by

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.669
Some form of pain whether it's the pain of seeing the image of a deceased loved one the pain of a true connection

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.759
Abruptly cut short the pain of memory or simply the pain of uncertainty of not knowing what it is

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.939
You're seeing that's of course a pain that we're all familiar with it's why for the most part we see only

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.169
What we want to see. Truman has been privy to a lifetime full of hints

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.199
Clues to the fact that his world is not as it seems

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.770
Yes

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.220
to incorporate those clues means to reconfigure the [entire] narrative of his existence and

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.179
Rewrites like that just aren't free. They cost.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.269
They cost suffering. Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol were prophetic about so much from the vantage of

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.410
1998 the ubiquity of Reality television the rise of Mass Surveillance

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.660
they keyed in perfectly to my parents generation of cold War Paranoia of being watched or bugged and my own generation of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.050
narcissism where it bugs us not to be watched

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.899
That's a great joy of the truman show the allegories and layered readings, the heaviness of it all stands out vividly

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.350
Even for a kid like I was when I saw it at age 10

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.859
It's not pedantic or preachy. It just asks so many damn questions that are impossible to ignore. [Truman] "what the hell are you talking about?

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.109
Who are you talking to?" And actually I was watching it again recently

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.479
And I was really struck by how easily the truman show can be read as an allegory for

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.140
the present. Like Truman's town of C. Haven, our own world seems to be experiencing a similar series of

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.929
ruptures, ruptures like the Great Recession 2008

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.360
the Arab Spring, like the killings of Young Black men by police or our

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.130
increasing awareness of them, like brexit the splitting of [the] uk from Europe and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.619
Most recently like the rise of the political outsider movements of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.730
I think American society at large is a lot like Truman Burbank

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.419
Laboring like him for 30 plus years under a system that is finally showing itself to be ridiculous

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.709
Society like Truman is trying to wake itself up while stumbling under the pain that surfaces from doing so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.940
The Truman show is a massive operation with a crew and cast of thousands

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.380
But for all the power that Christoph commands the show's success always

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:59.130
Hinges on Truman himself. It can only work if Truman believes in it. [Chrtistoph] "He could leave at any time

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.929
if he was absolutely determined to discover the truth

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.799
There's no way we could prevent him" The powerful in our world hold things in place like Christoph holds Truman

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.950
But we hold ourselves in place, too. If nothing else, It's clear that in 2016

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.039
we are slowly waking up into a new political reality like in Truman's world the power

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.929
relationships of our own have gained and consolidated strength by convincing us that

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.870
They're normal like laws of nature by taking any breach and folding it [back] into the narrative

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.070
They've kept all those like Truman who are perennial losers at they but ideologies don't last forever eventually

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:51.049
They crumble under their own weight and the increasing refusal of people to believe it. [Truman] Thank you for your help. [Policemen] You're welcome, Truman.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.100
the Truman Show shows us

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.559
what waking up looks like. It stages in a really valuable way the struggles that come with it?

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.079
It shows how the messaging of the dominant ideology is absorbed into media and into education

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.800
It shows us how individual people even people we trust, good people, can become the mouthpieces of a rotten system

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.289
Everybody is in on it

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.220
I'd have to be a nun [too] and

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.649
Most importantly of [all] the Truman show Imagines liberation, not as utopia

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.209
but as a world flawed like our own full of multiplicity and contradiction and

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.729
people obsessed with TV

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.579
[it's] a world gained only by struggle and pain, one that often looks like an evil portent in the moment

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.729
It's not a sunburst in the clouds or an endless sea

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.769
But a small shadowy door that leads off to a territory unmapped

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.280
But invested hopefully with a greater

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.889
Authenticity. [Truman] In case I don't see ya

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.460
Good afternoon good evening, and good night

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.379
There is a new Nerdwriter video every [Wednesday]

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:13.239
So if you go right there and click on that you'll subscribe to this channel get all the videos and that's what helps

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.019
Me out the most the truman show blows my mind every time [I] watch it

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.049
[I] saw it in the theaters when [I] was 10 in 1998 with my mom

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.459
And it was one of the best movie experiences the formative movie experiences of my life

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.959
So this was a blast to make thanks so much for watching again. [I'll] see you guys [next] Wednesday
