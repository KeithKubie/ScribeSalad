00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.779
The 
Exploding Anti-Tank Dogs of World War II

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.000
During WWII many innovative weapons were created
and promptly put into action.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.610
One of the more unique, and wildly inhumane,
were exploding anti-tank dogs.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.700
These dogs, usually Alsatians, were also called
“Hundminen” or “dog mines.”

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.521
They were trained to carry explosives on their
bodies to enemy tanks, where they would then

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:42.521
be detonated.

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.460
No, it did not end very well for the dogs
in question.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.440
This type of animal weaponry was first used
by the Soviets.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.250
Following a decision in 1924 to allow dogs
to aid the military, a dog training school

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.890
was set up in Moscow.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.670
The military recruited such people as police
dog trainers, hunters, circus trainers, and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.989
animal scientists.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.329
Twelve more schools were set up hot on the
heels of the first one and the Soviet dog-training

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.299
division started out in earnest.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.340
At first, dogs were trained to carry supplies,
tracking mines, and rescuing people -tasks

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.159
at which the dogs excelled.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.640
In the early 1930s, they decided it would
be a good idea to turn man’s best friend

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.300
into an anti-tank weapon.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.909
Three of the schools began training dogs for
this purpose.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.920
First, they were trained to carry a bomb to
a tank and run off; afterwards, their handler

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.540
could detonate the bomb with a remote or the
bomb may have simply been set with a timer.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.920
There were several reasons that these methods
didn’t work.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.610
To drop the bomb, the dogs had to pull on
a belt with their teeth to release it.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.549
This proved to be too complicated, and often
the dog would simply return to its handler

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.810
without releasing the bomb.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.040
Secondly, remotes were too expensive at the
time to be used practically, so timers would

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.970
be used more often instead.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.230
If the dog returned to his handler with the
bomb still attached, he would have killed

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.159
the handler and himself.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.860
Even if the bomb was released under the tank,
if the tank was in motion and the timing wasn’t

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.030
set just so, the bomb would simply explode
without doing any damage to the enemy tank.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.110
The Soviets scrapped their initial plan, but
unfortunately for Fido, they came up with

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.229
a new one.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.819
Rather than drop a bomb, explosives would
be strapped to the dog.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.050
When the dog went under the tank, the bomb
would be triggered, killing the dog (and,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.590
hopefully, disabling the tank).

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.599
As if ending their life wasn’t enough, the
training involved wasn’t exactly a walk

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.599
in the park.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.700
The dogs were starved, and then food was placed
under a practice tank, training them to think

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.820
that food was under all tanks.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.580
After a while, additional battle sounds were
added to their practice runs so that they

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.830
wouldn’t be spooked when they were running
under the real thing.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.950
Anti-tank dogs started being used in earnest
in 1941, when German forces advanced on Soviet

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.950
lands.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.200
Thirty dogs kicked off what would be a rather
lacklustre debut for the exploding dog-force;

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.250
indeed, the dogs were so ineffective that
the Soviet military was accused of simply

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.910
sacrificing them.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.870
Part of the problem was that many of the dogs
refused to dive under the tanks in the field.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.080
They were being shot at, which hadn’t happened
in training, and they were understandably

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.780
not willing to dive under some huge noisy
“beast” that was seemingly trying to kill

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.780
them.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.310
Food can only motivate an animal so much.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.270
I could put a steak on my vacuum cleaner and
my dog wouldn’t go near it, even if she

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.840
hadn’t eaten in ages.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.260
A tank with guns a-blazing is a tad more noisy
and frightening.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.819
When the dogs were shot and killed before
they could get into position and blow up,

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.770
they were taken by German soldiers who were
able to examine the weaponry and potentially

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.790
copy it themselves.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.620
They didn’t end up taking advantage; rather,
one captured German soldier claimed that they

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.290
found the entire system rather inefficient.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.069
Well, it was.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.540
One downside of this was that the Germans
did take measures to defend themselves against

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.530
the dogs, rendering their sacrifice often
useless.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.190
A much larger problem was that the dogs had
been trained with Soviet tanks, not German

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.190
ones.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.780
Soviet and German tanks used different types
of fuel, and some of the dogs sniffed out

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.459
the fuel they were used to and trotted off
to blow up the tanks used by the very military

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.180
that trained them.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.180
Oops.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.290
That said, the anti-tank dogs are known to
have taken out some tanks, including at the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.400
Battle of Kursk in which twelve tanks were
destroyed by sixteen deployed dogs.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.000
This was possibly one of the most successful
anti-tank dog ventures in history.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.329
The Soviets later reported that some 300 tanks
total had been destroyed by anti-tank dogs,

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.729
but many question this number, thinking it
was probably made up by the Soviet government

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:30.090
who wanted to justify the program, particularly
justify killing so many dogs with so few results.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.210
Whether they were useful or not, anti-tank
dogs started to be used less and less from

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.159
1942 onwards, though there were anti-tank
dogs that continued to be trained until 1996.

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:45.110
While the Soviets were perhaps the most prominent
users of anti-tank dogs, they were trained

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.759
in other countries, too, including Japan and
the United States.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.439
Much more recently, bombs were strapped to
dogs as late as 2007 when insurgents attempted

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.030
to use them during the Iraq War.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.780
In this case, there’s only one documented
case of a bomb actually being detonated while

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.029
attached to a dog though; protests rose up
among Muslims who believe that animals should

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.139
be killed only for food.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.240
Bonus Facts:
• Dogs were not the only weaponized animals.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.919
There were attempts to make bomb carriers
out of cats, birds, and rats.

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.869
Bombs have also been strapped to camels, horses,
donkeys, and mules.

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:20.800
Donkeys were especially favoured in Iraq because
they could carry packs stuffed with bombs

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.490
without looking suspicious.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:29.839
Even monkeys and, supposedly, whales could
not escape the military’s explosive reach.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:33.819
• Dolphins trained to kill by the Soviet
Union were sold to Iran in the 1990s when

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.979
the Russian military closed its marine mammal
program.

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.789
The United States Navy still has such a program,
though dolphins are supposedly not trained

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:57.449
to kill, but rather to perform various 
other tasks.
