to hypothesis that was generated and
 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.899

took 10 years to elucidate whether it
was right or wrong and he formed the

was right or wrong and he formed the
 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.239
was right or wrong and he formed the
hypothesis that human papillomavirus

hypothesis that human papillomavirus
 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.279

indeed there were specific types that
cause cervical cancer he proved that to

detect HPV DNA within the nuclei of the
 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.800
detect HPV DNA within the nuclei of the
cells and for that took a long time and

also to realize that was so many
 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.170
also to realize that was so many
different types so he had to make so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180
different types so he had to make so
 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.600
different types so he had to make so

HPV that actually were causing this and
 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.480
HPV that actually were causing this and
piece by piece he put it all together

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490
piece by piece he put it all together
 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.120

from cervical genital wart over to the
 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.840
from cervical genital wart over to the
cervical cancer and had to do that he

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850
cervical cancer and had to do that he
 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.310
cervical cancer and had to do that he
made small pieces of DNA that he used as

samples and he did it with a technique

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880
samples and he did it with a technique
 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.320
samples and he did it with a technique
that is called low strain stringency

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330
that is called low strain stringency
 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.480

hybridization so that partial binding of
 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.880
hybridization so that partial binding of
the DNA was enough for his fishing

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890
the DNA was enough for his fishing
 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.460
the DNA was enough for his fishing
experiments and then he refined the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470
experiments and then he refined the
 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.400
experiments and then he refined the
tools all the time until finally came to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410
tools all the time until finally came to
 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.720
tools all the time until finally came to

human papillomavirus yes and you have to
 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.590
human papillomavirus yes and you have to
remember that at that time point you

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600
remember that at that time point you
 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.020
remember that at that time point you
could not capture this virus and also

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030
could not capture this virus and also
 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.090
could not capture this virus and also
the tumors didn't produce viral

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100
the tumors didn't produce viral
 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.849
the tumors didn't produce viral
particles in the tumors the viral genes

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859
particles in the tumors the viral genes
 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.039
particles in the tumors the viral genes
were incorporated into the host genome

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049
were incorporated into the host genome
 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.570
were incorporated into the host genome
and thus he could only detect them part

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580
and thus he could only detect them part
 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.430
and thus he could only detect them part
of the virus and those jeans that were

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440
of the virus and those jeans that were
 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.070
of the virus and those jeans that were
incorporated in the cancer cells

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080
incorporated in the cancer cells
 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.899

and there were two particular types of

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:30.909
and there were two particular types of
 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.010
and there were two particular types of
this virus that were the key

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020
this virus that were the key
 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.029
this virus that were the key
breakthrough could you tell us a bit

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039
breakthrough could you tell us a bit
 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.610
breakthrough could you tell us a bit
more about that please yep and that

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620
more about that please yep and that
 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.619
more about that please yep and that
tells you a little bit how much he was

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629
tells you a little bit how much he was
 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.100
tells you a little bit how much he was
able to fish out so he started by

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110
able to fish out so he started by
 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.189
able to fish out so he started by
discovering the HPV type 124 then came

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199
discovering the HPV type 124 then came
 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.850

the 5 &amp; 6 11 was the one that caught him

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860
the 5 &amp; 6 11 was the one that caught him
 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.379
the 5 &amp; 6 11 was the one that caught him
on track to detect HPV 16 and 18 which

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389
on track to detect HPV 16 and 18 which
 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.290
on track to detect HPV 16 and 18 which
was the two types that was associated

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300
was the two types that was associated
 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.480
was the two types that was associated
with cervical cancer seventy percent of

with cervical cancer seventy percent of
 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.020
with cervical cancer seventy percent of
all cervical cancer are caused by HPV 16

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030
all cervical cancer are caused by HPV 16
 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.779
all cervical cancer are caused by HPV 16
or 18 and those were the ones he

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789
or 18 and those were the ones he
 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.499
or 18 and those were the ones he
discovered and how did they cause cancer

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509
discovered and how did they cause cancer
 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.409
discovered and how did they cause cancer
human papilloma virus is original for

human papilloma virus is original for
 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.200
human papilloma virus is original for

disease cause cancer we were able to

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840
disease cause cancer we were able to
 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.379
disease cause cancer we were able to
demonstrate that in the malignant cells

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389
demonstrate that in the malignant cells
 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.469
demonstrate that in the malignant cells
were two specific set of viral genes

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479
were two specific set of viral genes
 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.779
were two specific set of viral genes
that were overexpressed e6 and e7 those

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789

make the chromosomes in stable so that
they can mutate in addition they

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710
they can mutate in addition they
 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.399
they can mutate in addition they
generate uncontrolled growth of these

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409
generate uncontrolled growth of these
 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.350

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.189
cells so that they can turn into a
malignant state and that was the key

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199
malignant state and that was the key
 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.719

high-risk types the other development is
that we now have generated vaccines

ten times better than the actual

it has been already been proven that the
