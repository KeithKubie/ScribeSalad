In this video,

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.620
we're going to be showing you
some of the cool things

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.600
that you can do
with UV activated ink.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.980
And thanks to Audible
for sponsoring this video.

[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
[Music]

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.040
[Music]

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.260
This is what we've got in mind:

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.730
We'll take our UV ink pens

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.130
and our UV ink in a bottle,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.880
and we'll try writing,
painting, and spraying the ink

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.400
onto several different surfaces.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.300
We'll see which
ones show up the best,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.130
which one's glow best
under a black light,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.880
and which ones seem
the most permanent.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.980
To test this out, we have
a few different methods.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.780
We have a couple of ballpoint
pens that have UV ink in them.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.040
And then we also have a large bottle

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.020
and this is just eight ounces of glowing ink.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.160
This stuff is an alcohol-based ink,
so it spreads really thinly.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.440
And we're going to try using
a paintbrush to apply that

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440
as well as this thing,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.410
which lets you choose
what liquid you want to use

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.940
and then it sprays out just
like a can of spray paint.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.280
First off, I think we need
to do some tests to see

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.060
what this ink looks like
under normal lighting conditions,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.120
so we can see how different
it is when we use the black light.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.960
These little ballpoint pens
that I have are pretty nifty

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.940
because not only
do they come with black-light ink,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.300
they also come with a small
black light built right into the cap.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.520
I can press this button,
and it lights right up.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.740
This lets you write secret notes
that wouldn't otherwise be visible.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.740
But if you and a friend
both have the pens,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.340
you can write secret
notes to each other

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.040
and reveal them with the black light.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.250
Now, for our first test,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.170
I just wrote a little bit
on this white piece of paper.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.340
And of course, a white piece of paper
is going to reflect the UV light pretty well.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.520
We also have a much
larger black light

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.960
that we can use to try
and reveal our lettering.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.440
That certainly makes it more legible,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.730
at least in real life.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.320
On camera, it really has
a hard time picking it up.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.200
The biggest issue is that
the ink reflects in the same color

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.320
as our white piece of paper.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.220
So let's try using
a piece of colored paper,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.900
and see if we have a better result.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780
It's really easy to write
secret notes using these things

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.740
and I think, especially,
the best way to do it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.940
would be to write a plain-text note

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.290
and then a secret note below that –

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.050
so you can see one note
when you have normal light,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.190
and a secondary note when
you've got the black light added.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.670
Personally, what I think
is one of the best uses for this

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.770
is if you have a long
or difficult password

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.229
that you really
struggle to remember,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.460
you can write it down using the UV ink

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.340
and then write a distracting
fake note right above that.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.530
So you've got a reason
to have it on your computer,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.510
but you know that
if you forgot your password,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.680
you have way to look it up
without it being broadcast to everyone.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.760
Although these pens are
designed for writing on paper,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.890
you may find you have success
writing on some other surfaces as well.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.740
Let's try a few.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:49.120
[Music]

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.980
Well we've tested on
a few different surfaces.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.720
Let's see how permanent it is.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.700
Let's grab a wet cloth,
and see if that scrubs off

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.640
or if it stays pretty
much where we put it.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.620
[Music]

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.420
Sure seems to be
staying pretty well.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.860
Of course, I'm only using water,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.920
but that's not going anywhere.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.959
I think it may have
worn down a little bit

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.120
from all of that scrubbing,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120
but not very much.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.250
Let's try this stuff
on the back of my glove

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.560
where it says glove.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.840
How about the smiley face on my arm?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.400
[Music]

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.940
It rubs off of skin fairly well.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.209
There's still a little bit of marks,

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.420
but I'm not sure if they
show up very well on camera.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.780
Water doesn't do it.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.400
I think it's an alcohol-based ink,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.640
so let's see if we can
get it off with rubbing alcohol.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.560
[Music]

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.910
It takes a little bit of effort,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.349
but it does lift it off.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.600
Of course, that could just be that
we're lifting the paint right off.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.900
Let's try it on my glove.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.140
Okay, that barely
touched that.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.680
So, I'm going to say that even alcohol

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.640
doesn't do a very good job of removing it,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.920
but it may do a good job
of removing the paint

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.240
that the ink is written on top of.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.960
Let's see if it does anything
to the ink on my jeans.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.280
Seems to be picking up
a little bit of it.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.040
[Music]

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.600
It takes some of it out,
but it's definitely still there in part.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.299
I've got this black poster board,

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.020
which is a piece of foam
with black paper on the outside,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.759
and I discovered that the pens
work really well on this surface.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.330
It shows up very nicely against the black –

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.940
kind of like it does on a glove.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.800
Here, I've written the word
Sunshine with a sun shining out of it

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.980
because I have another test,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.660
and that's to see if we can
look at this ink outside.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.240
Sunlight has quite
a bit of UV rays in it,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.920
and I'm wondering if that's enough
to let us see what we've written.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.600
First impressions when I look at it

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.860
is that I can see something

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.220
and I'm not sure if that's from

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.069
where the pressure of the pen
was denting into the board

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.400
or if it's really reflecting the light.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.860
Since I wasn't sure if the pen
had scratched into the board

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.439
or if I was seeing the ink itself,

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.889
I tried drawing
this square on my glove,

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.580
because the pen doesn't leave
physical marks in the gloves.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.180
Let's see if we can see
that square out in the sunlight.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.520
Right off the bat,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.340
it looks like it's pretty visible.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.120
It's even reflecting a little bit,

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.830
which makes me think that
the ink might not be dry yet.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.740
I think this means
if you know what to look for,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.379
this ink might be
visible in bright sunlight,

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.229
at least if it's freshly applied.

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.880
We know these pens are pretty cool

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.020
and they can write
on a lot of surfaces,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.639
but let's see what we can do
with this bottle of ink.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.240
This is a lot of ink.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.840
I want to try applying it
in a few different methods.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.000
First, I've got a paintbrush,

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.990
and I want to see what happens
if I just brush this onto

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.800
a few of the same surfaces.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.480
[Music]

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.979
Let's try some of this on my glove.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.680
It was extremely visible
with the pen on my glove.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.360
I'm betting I have a similar
result with the brush.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.480
[Music]

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.240
Wow!

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.240
That is a very bright glow!

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.620
Now, this stuff actually
has warnings on it saying,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.040
don't put it on your skin.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.740
But I'm going to try it anyway.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.720
[Music]

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.000
I'd say that shows up quite a bit,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.539
although, because I'm brushing it on

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.260
and this ink is really thin,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.580
it does bleed a little bit through
the tiny little crevices in your skin.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.180
Shiza.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.580
Oops!

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.720
[Music]

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720
Well, because I'm very clever,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.440
I just managed to spill about
half an ounce of the liquid,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.960
all over the workbench.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.700
Given my test, this might stay
glowing under a black light

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.920
pretty much forever

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.920
until we repaint the surface –

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.620
not to mention, my gloves.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.620
Amazingly, even with that much
of the ink, when the black light is off,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.520
it looks pretty normal.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.300
But now, I want to
see this in the sun as well.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.600
So, let's try that out.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.529
I would say that the sun
is definitely putting off

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:57.180
enough UV light that you can see this.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.160
There's a clear change in color
from black to navy blue.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:10.860
[Music]

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.540
Well, our ink glows
beautifully under our black light.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.560
And it glows beautifully
when it spills on the table

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:16.659
and gets all over your gloves.

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:18.090
I want to see if
we can use it to spray

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.240
like a sort of
hidden secret graffiti.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.779
So we're going to try
putting some of our ink

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:22.779
into this spray bottle.

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:25.360
This is a cool little thing
that uses an aerosol sprayer

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.729
to spray whatever you put
down in this glass jar.

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:29.720
And we're going to try it
with some of our glow ink.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.979
That looks pretty cool.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.480
Alright.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.300
Let's see how well this thing works.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.200
[Music]

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.100
It's spraying something.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.960
Of course, my glove
is already glowing,

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.700
but that looks pretty neat.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:52.720
[Music]

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.680
I'm not sure exactly
what it's doing to the paint

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:55.740
or not doing the paint.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.980
Oops. I touched it earlier.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.020
But Grant said it's okay,

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.620
so, you know...

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.400
[Music]

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.420
Ooh! That comes out a lot at a time.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:12.720
[Music]

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.480
Looks like it's getting
absorbed into the paint too.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.960
That works pretty well.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.809
It's not a super consistent spray,
but it was definitely spraying out.

00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:22.380
And here's the thing:

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.240
I'm really bad at graffiti.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.780
so I'm going to try making a stencil

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.500
and using that to spray onto stuff,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.840
instead of just freehanding it.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:38.260
[Music]

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.360
Our TKOR stencil –

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.200
this should be fun.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.380
I think we'll be able to get
a few different uses out of that.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.120
I made a little bridge connecting
to the cut-out part in the 'R.'

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.250
There's space on the top and bottom.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.340
We'll see if that works.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.360
A little bit of an experiment,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.320
but either way, this should
give us what we're looking for:

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.560
a stencil, so we can spray
this logo onto stuff – like the wall.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.580
Here goes.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:05.340
[Music]

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.720
It worked!

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.240
It's not the cleanest stencil ever,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.180
but that is definitely the logo.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:36.200
[Music]

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.680
We tried using the stencil
on a t-shirt as well,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.960
but it kind of got
absorbed into the cloth

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.780
and doesn't reflect very much.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.600
It's still visible a little bit,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.200
but not nearly as well
as it works on the wall.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:55.520
[Music]

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.550
Guys, we want to take a minute
to talk about the sponsor for today's video,

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.550
Audible.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.970
Audible has the largest
collection of audiobooks available,

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.320
and it is a great service.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.360
I love Audible.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.320
The thing I listen to the most
is science fiction and fantasy books,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.740
but I do like to branch out.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.680
And whenever I do,
Audible's got me covered.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.800
They've got all sorts
of things to listen to.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.260
There are two places I prefer
to listen to Audible the most.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.900
The first is when I'm driving somewhere.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.940
Long drives can
get kind of boring to me.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.390
But if I'm listening
to something good,

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.910
I look forward to it.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.860
The other is when I'm working on a build –

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.320
I'm making something in my workshop –

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.200
and there's some tedious parts to it.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.580
Like if you're ever just sanding something...

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.940
But throw in a pair of headphones,

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.920
and suddenly, you are
taken away to whatever land

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.300
your audiobook takes place in.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.320
It really makes it
a much better experience.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.380
Audible also keeps track
of what you're listening to

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.670
and where in the track you are.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.670
So, if you switch devices,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.360
it's not a problem.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.560
I can go from listening
on my phone in my workshop

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.400
to my computer on my desktop,

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.890
and it's not going
to make any difference.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.680
To start your free 30-day trial,
and receive a free audiobook,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.920
go to AUDIBLE.COM/THEKINGOFRANDOM

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.710
or text the text "THEKINGOFRANDOM" to 500-500.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.060
Guys, the fun doesn't end here.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.100
We've got more for you to see.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.320
The box at the top will transport
you directly to our last video,

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.630
and you should go check that out.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.280
The box at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.330
you should be watching now.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.640
And this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe to the channel.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.080
That way,
you'll never miss a video.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.060
Don't forget to ring the bell.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.160
And we'll see in the next one.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:09.860
Talk to you then.
