00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:16.380
The Reason Champagne is Broken on New Ships

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.930
While today breaking a bottle of champagne
over the hull of a ship is considered tradition

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.430
before launching a vessel in certain countries,
particularly Britain and the United States,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.380
people have been performing ceremonies at
launches seemingly as long as humans have

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.840
made boats.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.129
Like today, this was essentially for the hope
of good fortune on the ship’s voyages.

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.379
For instance, one of the earliest known references
to a similar practice when launching a ship

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.210
goes all the way back about 5,000 years ago
when a Babylonian stated, “To the gods I

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.749
caused oxen to be sacrificed,” before launching
a new ship he’d made.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:52.120
The ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians
also called upon their various gods to protect

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.409
a new ship and her crew upon its initial launch.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.559
For example, the ancient Greeks, during their
launch festivities, would drink wine to honor

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.070
the gods and pour water on the ship as a sort
of blessing.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.729
The religious aspects of ship christening
remained well into more modern times, particularly

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.100
in Catholic nations.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.530
For example, there’s an account of a ship
christening by the Knights of Malta in the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.799
seventeenth century that describes two friars
boarding a new warship, praying, and sprinkling

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.350
holy water all around the ship before deeming
her seaworthy and sending her out into the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.619
water.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.840
After the Protestant Reformation, kicking
off in earnest after Martin Luther’s 1517

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.670
“Ninety-Five Thesis”, certain nations
in Europe did away with some aspects of the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.300
religious part of the christening.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.479
Rather than use religious leaders for this
task, members of the monarchy or military

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.829
leaders would take over the christening duties.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.700
For instance, 65 years before the above Knights
of Malta reference, in 1610, the Prince of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.219
Wales was present at the christening of the
Prince Royal.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.969
In this instance, there was a standing cup
on board the ship, which is just a large and

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.749
expensive cup made of some precious metal,
usually silver.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.609
The Prince took a ceremonial sip of the wine
in the cup before throwing the rest of the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.249
contents across the deck.

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:07.579
The cup was then thrown off the side of the
ship to be caught by a lucky observer.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.620
Late in the seventeenth century, the standing
cup ceremony was replaced with breaking a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.730
bottle of wine over the bow.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.640
This switch was in part because the cups were
extremely valuable and the British navy was

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.379
growing rapidly; it just wasn’t practical
to continue to give the expensive cups away

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.409
every time a ship was launched.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.159
As for the switch from wine to champagne,
it’s thought that preferences simply switched

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.450
with the times.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.620
Champagne came to be seen as an “aristocratic”
choice -for a time in the nineteenth century

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.990
being more popular than wine among many elite
–and, therefore, considered the best option

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.270
for ship christening.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.760
The tradition of using it has stuck around
ever since in certain countries.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.099
Bonus Facts:
• Rather than use champagne to christen

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.480
new ships, in Japan, it’s traditional to
have a special silver axe made with the axe

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.840
being used to cut the lines holding the ship
from plunging into the water.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.820
After the cutting ceremony, the axe is usually
kept by the ship’s owner.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.550
• Wine and champagne haven’t been the
only types of liquid used for ship christening

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.519
throughout even recent history.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.860
Whisky, brandy, and even sea water have been
used as well.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.610
For instance, during Prohibition in the United
States, alcohol fell out of favour somewhat,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.969
and water, juice, and cider were often used
in its stead.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.959
• Today, it’s considered bad luck if the
bottle of champagne doesn’t break on the

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:24.959
ship.

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.930
In 2007, the Duchess of Cornwall attempted
to smash a bottle of champagne against the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.590
hull of the Queen Victoria, but the bottle
didn’t break.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.980
A few weeks later, nearly eighty passengers
became sick with a contagious stomach bug.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.689
They called it “Camilla’s Curse” and
pointed the finger at the Duchess for failing

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.150
to break the bottle against the ship properly.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.599
Obviously, it’s all superstition, but to
avoid the “bad luck,” people have come

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.650
up with a variety of ways to ensure that the
bottle breaks.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.090
The main problem is that the bottles have
been designed not to break—you want your

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.739
champagne in the bottle, not all over the
floor, after all.

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.569
They also have to withstand high pressure
from within, so they’re pretty tough eggs

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.569
to crack.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.500
But when a bottle has some small defect in
it, its strength becomes compromised.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.750
Scoring the bottle beforehand with a glass
cutter is one common way to ensure the bottle

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.790
will bust on the hull of the ship.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.870
Similarly, using bigger bottles means that
the bottle is more likely to have some natural

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.030
defect that will make it easier to break.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.389
Choosing a type of champagne with larger bubbles
is also favourable, because it usually means

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.419
that the bottle is under a higher pressure
and more likely to break.

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.550
Ropes are often used to swing the bottle toward
the ship, and those with less elasticity are

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.560
better, because the elasticity would absorb
some of the shock needed to break the bottle

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.230
when it connects with the ship.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.430
• It’s commonly thought that the bottle
used to christen the Titanic didn’t break,

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.780
and because of that it was doomed to sink.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.860
This is a myth.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.780
While it’s true no bottle was broken against
the Titanic’s hull, none of the White Star

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.389
Line ships were actually christened that way.

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.350
Obviously, not every White Star Line ship
sank because of the lack of traditional launch.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.210
One of the men who broke the supports from
the Titanic at her launch did sustain fatal

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.340
injuries on the job, which could be taken
as a bad omen if you like to look into that

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.340
sort of thing.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.870
The fact remains, though, that the bottle
not breaking when it hit the Titanic is a

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:24.679
myth because it wasn’t ever attempted.
