Adel Mahmoud:
It's one thing to say, I
have a vial of vaccine.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.010
Adel Mahmoud:
And it's another to say,
how can you implement a

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.260
Adel Mahmoud:
vaccination program?


00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.290

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.130
Adel Mahmoud:
Princeton University's approach
to global health is

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.010
Adel Mahmoud:
based on a very, very clear vision.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.510
Christina Paxson:
It really does bridge science
into social science into

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.180
Christina Paxson:
public policy in a way
that very few other

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.020
Christina Paxson:
institutions can do.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.630
Christina Paxson:
And if you really want to get a
handle on these issues, you

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.820
Christina Paxson:
need to have all of that together.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.080
Christina Paxson:
The subject matter demands it.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.360
Christina Paxson:
This multidisciplinary focus is not

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720
Christina Paxson:
just nice, but essential.

Joao Biehl:
One of the hallmarks of our program is

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.040
Joao Biehl:
experiential learning.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.080
Joao Biehl:
Learning from local communities,
learning from

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.590
Joao Biehl:
interventions on the ground.

Joshua Oppenheimer:
When I came to Princeton
I knew that I was

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.530
Joshua Oppenheimer:
interested in medicine.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.350
Joshua Oppenheimer:
And I also knew that I was
interested in politics.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.090
Joshua Oppenheimer:
But I never really put
them together.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.480
Joshua Oppenheimer:
I've been able to learn about
how Medicaid programs can

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.580
Joshua Oppenheimer:
better set up their design;
how Congress is trying to

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.250
Joshua Oppenheimer:
address health care at
the national level.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.370
Joshua Oppenheimer:
And I've also been able to
learn how the Mexican

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.260 position:58%
Joshua Oppenheimer:
government is trying to address their

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.350
Joshua Oppenheimer:
health policy issues.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.710
Yolisa Nalule:
I took Professor Biehl's class,
Medical Anthropology.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.780
Yolisa Nalule:
That class and the way he taught
us to view the world of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.300
Yolisa Nalule:
health was the eye opener.


00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.870
Yolisa Nalule:
It was that ah-ha moment that
you get when you're like, "This

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.620
Yolisa Nalule:
is what I want to do."

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.590
Yolisa Nalule:
I came up with my summer
internship which I designed to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.090
Yolisa Nalule:
go to Uganda and look at how
doctors, nurses, NGOs --

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.930
Yolisa Nalule:
all these organizations that
had HIV/AIDS drugs and were

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.010
Yolisa Nalule:
giving them out to people -- how
they're dealing with the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.260
Yolisa Nalule:
issue of drug resistance.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.900
Christina Paxson:
Leaders in global health need
to have a broad perspective.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.400
Christina Paxson:
We live in a world where
societies are aging.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.140
Christina Paxson:
Health issues are really
coming to the fore.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.130
Christina Paxson:
We can launch students into
careers where they can make a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.390
Christina Paxson:
difference doing something that's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.600
Christina Paxson:
really, really important.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.160 position:73%
Yolisa Nalule:
The one thing Princeton has taught me is giving

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.790
Yolisa Nalule:
back and service.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.660
Yolisa Nalule:
And the way I can do it is
in the field of health.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.330
Yolisa Nalule:
I will not rest until health
is a human right.
