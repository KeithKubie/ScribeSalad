00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:04.037
PREMIERE PARTY PLANNERS.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.873
AND SHE HAS BIG HOPES OF TAKING
HER COMPANY,

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:08.342
VERONIQUE EVENTS,
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.410 line:0%
 
- MY WISH IS TO BE
A BIGGER COMPANY

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.248 line:0%
 
WITH A LOT OF ARTISTIC DIRECTORS
AND, YOU KNOW, A WHOLE CREW.

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.183
- BUT TO DO THIS, SHE'S GOING
TO NEED SOMETHING

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.485
THAT MAKES HER DIFFERENT
THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.121
SO I PAID VERONIQUE A VISIT
TO SEE IF I COULD HELP.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.155
HEY.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.490
[dog yips]
OH, JEEZ--

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.625
WHEN SOMEONE'S HAVING A PARTY

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:27.561
THE BIGGEST STRESS COMES
FROM WHO TO INVITE.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.062
- ABSOLUTELY.
- I MEAN, SOMETIMES

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.264
THERE ARE JUST PEOPLE
YOU DON'T WANT TO INVITE.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.832
- YES.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.668
- BUT YOU DON'T WANT THEM
TO KNOW YOU DIDN'T INVITE THEM

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.203
BECAUSE THEN THEY'LL HATE YOU.

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.438
BUT YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.340
RIGHT?
- YEAH. BUT THE THING IS,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.543
YOU HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.244
- BUT MAYBE YOU DON'T.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.079
THESE DAYS, MOST PARTY
INVITATIONS ARE SENT

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.549
AS A DIGITAL INVITE
THROUGH EMAIL.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.485
SO IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP
A TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD SEND

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:54.488
CERTAIN PEOPLE'S INVITES
DIRECTLY TO THEIR SPAM FOLDER,

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:57.958
VERONIQUE'S CLIENTS COULD INVITE
EVERYONE THEY KNOW TO A PARTY,

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:01.595
WHILE GUARANTEEING THEIR
UNDESIRED GUEST WON'T SHOW UP.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.931
AND IF CONFRONTED AFTER
THE EVENT BY THAT GUEST,

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.465
THEY COULD SIMPLY SAY,

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:09.403
"I DID INVITE YOU.
DID YOU CHECK YOUR SPAM?"

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.305
- THAT IS A GA--
GREAT TRICK.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:14.441
- I MEAN, AS THE ONLY PARTY
PLANNER TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE,

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:18.278
YOU WOULD GET EVERYONE WANTING
YOU TO PLAN THEIR PARTY.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.414
- YOU KNOW,
I WANT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:23.083
I WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.353
AND THEN IF I HAVE THE USE, YES.
WHY NOT USING IT?

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.822
- BEFORE VERONIQUE COULD OFFER
THIS SERVICE TO HER CLIENTS,

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.959
I'D FIRST NEED TO CREATE
THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE IT WORK.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.328
SO I HIRED A SOFTWARE ENGINEER
NAMED CHRIS,

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:38.098
WHO BUILT ME A CUSTOM INVITATION
SYSTEM TO EXECUTE MY IDEA.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.234
- ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS
THE INVITATION FORM.

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:41.502
- RIGHT.
- AND THEN ON THIS SIDE

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:44.104
YOU ENTER THE EMAILS
WITH YOUR DESIRED GUESTS

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:45.572
AND YOUR UNDESIRED GUESTS.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.608
- SO THE EMAILS IN HERE
GO WHERE?

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:50.711
- THE DESIRED GUESTS EMAILS
WILL BE SENT TO THE INBOX.

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.112
BUT WITH THE UNDESIRED GUESTS

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.515
I JUST PUT A WHOLE BUNCH
OF SPAM WORDS IN THAT EMAIL,

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:57.484
SENT IT THROUGH A FOREIGN SERVER
THAT WAS LOCATED IN RUSSIA.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.919
- SO THAT MAKES IT GO TO SPAM--
- YEAH.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.320
SO THAT MAKES IT GO TO SPAM.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.222
- AND WHAT WORDS DID YOU USE?

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.859
- UM, I USED "VIAGRA", "PENIS",
"PENIS ENLARGEMENTS",

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.928
I PUT EVERYTHING FROM
1-INCH PENIS ALL THE WAY

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:09.129
TO 10-INCH PENIS.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.365
- WHY 1-INCH PENIS?

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:13.934
- UH, BECAUSE IT'S JUST MORE
TO PUT IN THERE.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.170
- 'CAUSE I'VE SEEN SPAM
FOR LIKE, 8-INCH PENIS,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.538
9--
- YEAH.

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:19.873
- BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE--
A SPAM EMAIL SAY, LIKE,

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.942
"DO YOU WANT A 1-INCH PENIS?"

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.510
- [laughs]

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.248
- BUT YEAH.

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:29.516
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DID
A GOOD JOB.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.784
- YEAH.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.686
- CHRIS SENT A TEST INVITE
TO MY EMAIL

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:34.188
AND IT SEEMED TO WORK GREAT

00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:36.089
WITH THE HIDDEN KEYWORDS
DIRECTING IT

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.091
STRAIGHT TO MY SPAM FOLDER.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.459
THERE IT IS.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.728
SO THE NEXT DAY, I RETURNED
TO VERONIQUE TO SHOW HER

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:42.963
WHAT I HAD DEVELOPED.

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.264
[dog yips shrilly]
OH!

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.966
OH, SORRY, SORRY.
JESUS CHRIST.

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.769
THE PROGRAM WILL ADD HIDDEN
WORDS TO THOSE EMAILS

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.704
THAT WILL MAKE THEM GO
DIRECTLY TO SPAM.

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:53.207
- OH.
- THERE'S "PENIS", "ROLEX"--

00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:54.341
- I MEAN THE IDEA IS--

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.343
- UH, "PENIS ENLARGEMENT"...
- OH.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:59.646
- "VIAGRA", "8-INCH PENIS",
"9-INCH PENIS",

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:00.814
"10-INCH PENIS",

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:02.249
"11-INCH PENIS"...
- GOOD.

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:03.483
- "VIAGRA PENIS"--

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.152
- I MEAN, I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
EXACTLY--

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.521
IS IT IMPORTANT FOR ME TO KNOW
THIS INFORMATION?

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.122
- IF ANY OF YOUR CLIENTS ASK,
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.390
- NO,
NOBODY WOULD BE INTERESTED.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.391
- WELL, SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT WANT TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.960
IT'S INTERESTING SCIENCE.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.228
VERONIQUE WAS IMPRESSED.

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:16.430
BUT IN ORDER TO SHOW HER
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.098
MY SYSTEM WOULD HAVE,

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:20.133
I DECIDED TO THROW
A SMALL PARTY AT MY PLACE

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:23.804
AND PUT SOMEONE THAT I KNOW
ON THE UNDESIRED GUEST LIST.

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:26.139
FOR THIS, I CHOSE SALOMON,
WHO WORKS ON MY SHOW,

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.608
BECAUSE I KNEW IT
WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:30.077
IF HE FOUND OUT
HE WASN'T INVITED.

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.111
SO AFTER SENDING THE INVITES,

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:33.380
I HEADED HOME TO PREPARE
FOR MY PARTY.
