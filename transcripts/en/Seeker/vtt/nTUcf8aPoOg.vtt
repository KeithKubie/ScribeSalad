00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.080
I have herpes!

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:09.830
And I bet you do too!

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.429
Hey guys. Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.910
Yup it’s true, I’m just one of millions
of people who have herpes type 1. I’ve had

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.480
cold sores on my lips plenty of times in my
life. They’re painful, gross, and unfortunately

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.900
incurable. It’s caused by a virus and spread
by contact. A very common virus. Nearly 2/3s

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.150
of everyone on this planet has one of two
strains [[of what]] that usually causes painful

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.640
and irritating sores on the lips and genitals.
And some estimates say as many as 90% of adults

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.450
have some strain of it. While they are 8 different
strains of the virus, most people are familiar

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.160
and infected with type 1 and type 2. There
are other types of herpes as well. Type cause

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.309
the chicken pox, mono or other less well known
diseases.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.610
Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) is ancient.
According to a study published in the journal

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.989
Molecular Biology and Evolution, the HSV-1
strain is over 6 million years old. The other

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.720
strain is significantly younger, HSV-2 was
contracted in humans from Chimpanzees over

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.939
1.6 million years ago. Which means it was
a part of our lives before we were even human.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.549
It’s a strong sucker. A study published
in the journal of the American Chemical Society

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.229
found that the DNA in a virus body is tightly
packed and under high pressure. This pressure

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.439
allows it to be powerfully injected into a
host’s cells. It then turns the cell into

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.619
a virus making factory, turning out more copies
of itself.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.880
Since the virus never goes away, herpes is
in a constant battle with your immune system.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.710
Most of the time your immune system is winning
and the virus is latent and dormant in your

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.409
nerve cells. Well… maybe not entirely dormant
according to research from the Australian

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.759
National University. Researchers found that
the virus is actually pretty active, but our

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.189
immune cells “are constantly pushing it
down."

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.049
And since HSV is an old virus, it’s evolved
some tricks of its own. HSV-1 actually rearranges

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.360
our telomeres according to a study published
in the journal Cell Reports. Telomeres are

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.700
the caps on our DNA, often compared to the
plastic tips on your shoelaces. They serve

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.770
pretty much the same function, they keep the
strands of DNA from fraying. The virus attacks

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.239
telomeres in a few ways, but basically it
degrades a telomere protein called TPP1. When

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.190
this protein is inhibited, the virus is better
able to replicate itself.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.310
And this is the good news bad news part of
the story. In bad news, you can still spread

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.819
the virus even if you’re not showing symptoms.
One study published in JAMA found that 20%

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.900
of people with symptoms were “shedding”
the virus, and even 10% of those without symptoms

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.900
“shed” the virus.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.250
But, there might be a good side to herpes.
One study published in the journal Nature

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.540
found that it offered protection from serious
diseases like the plague.. at least in mice.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.510
Basically the virus makes your immune system
make more of a protein hormone called inter-fear-on

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.519
gamma (interferon). This sets your system
on high alert, so your immune is ready to

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.690
attack other invaders. In this case, it protects
against bacterial infections like the plague

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.989
and food poisoning,

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.510
But just in case you’re ready to give up
the benefits and the sores, there might be

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.629
some hope. There’s a lot of research on
the herpes virus, and a lot of potential for

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.420
cures or treatments. The more common types
of drugs like acyclovir tend to focus on the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.580
stage when the virus is multiplying in the
skin. A tricky place since the virus can often

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.500
build resistance to treatment at that stage.
But scientists are working on that.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.010
Like one study published in the journal Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences found

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.010
that the herpes virus goes through a kind
of bottleneck in the body as moves from it’s

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.879
dormant state in nerve cells into skin cells.
Only a few cells make the harrowing journey,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.099
and once they’re in the skin cells, usually
in the lip, that they multiply. So scientists

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.180
are looking to target this transitional period
since the virus might be more susceptible

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.330
to drug treatments.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.459
So scientists keep working on drugs that work
at earlier stages, like one drug tested in

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.670
a study published in the journal Science Translational
Medicine used an epigenetic approach. The

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.540
drug they studied exists already and they
found it blocked a protein called LSD1 which

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.370
works in early stages of the virus and can
turn genes on and off. By blocking the protein,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.200
the drug kept the virus latent.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.659
So yeah, that’s herpes. You probably have
it, you can still spread it when you’re

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.209
not showing symptoms, there’s no cure, but
there are some decent treatment options. While

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.930
viral STIs can’t be cured, they can be prevented
with proper sex education, practicing safe

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.790
sex, and some can be prevented by vaccines,
like HPV!

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.620
