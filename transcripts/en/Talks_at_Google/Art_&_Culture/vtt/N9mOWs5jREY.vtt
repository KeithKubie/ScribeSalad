00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:07.700
TOBY OLIE: Yes, my name's Toby.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.910
I'm the Puppetry
Director and Puppet

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.690
Co-designer for "Pinocchio"
at the National Theatre.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.302
Audrey plays Jiminy
Cricket, does the voice,

00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:18.010
and is one half of
the puppeteering team.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.510
And James is the other half
of the puppeteering team.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.720
And our show is quite unique.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.880
And very near sort
of the beginning

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.010
of the inception
of the show, it was

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.780
decided that Pinocchio would
be the only human onstage.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.450
And everybody else
would be a puppet.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.580
So characters like
Geppetto and Stromboli

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.890
are all 12 foot high puppets.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.179
So the scale is really
shifted in Pinocchio's favor

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.720
and so the audience kind of see
the world through Pinocchio's

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.500
eyes.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.786
And Jiminy Cricket
originally was a bit

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:44.910
of a sort of question mark.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.820
It's such a kind of
iconic character really.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.670
You know, in the
Disney branding,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.100
Jiminy is part of the
theme park branding.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.840
It's on the beginning of DVDs.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.510
He's pretty essential
to that kind of image.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.070
And so there was
a lot of questions

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.850
as to how loyal we should be
to the original animated film,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.950
or how much we should
go in another direction.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.000
And I suppose I was looking to
see if we could have our cake

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.270
and eat it, really.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.910
And the first few
drafts of the script

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.160
had the character being
very much more insect-like.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.310
It referenced the
character having more arms

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.056
than just the two arms, two legs
that the Disney character has.

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:23.680
There was no reference
to the character

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.410
wearing clothes or a little top
hat like it does in the film.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.320
So it sort of felt right
to go for a more insect.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.605
So it's worth saying
as well that Jiminy

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:34.030
is female in our version.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.120
Hence Audrey.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.010
AUDREY BRISSON: Yes.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.426
TOBY OLIE: Which came
sort of brilliantly out

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:39.550
of the development process.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.140
But we'll talk a little
about that shortly.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.940
So initially I kind of
began to go back and look

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.360
at the original source material.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.220
Lots of the original
concept drawings

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.170
for Jiminy, different
expressions, and just

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.100
began immersed into what
creative process led

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.175
Disney to end up with Jiminy
the way he looks in the film.

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:07.030
I was quite obsessed by
his proportions as well.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.840
And as you'll see later on,
if the proportions are out,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.110
he ends up looking a bit like
a grasshopper, not cricket.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.240
So I quite liked the sort of
three heads high kind of vibe.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.040
And so the final puppets ended
up sort of closer towards that.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.160
So the first drawing in my
sketchbook, which I think

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.080
was while someone
was having a meeting

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.580
and was being quite
important, and I

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.410
have a very bad habit for
doodling during people talking.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.880
But that's normally when
the good stuff happens.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.380
Yeah.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.830
It was very much kind
of insect, six legs,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.580
had backwards knees on this
one, and the wings hanging down

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.610
like a little coat tail like
the character has in the film.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.700
But sort of keeping the kind
of nose, little kind of old man

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.240
kind of mouth that the character
has from the animated film.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.550
I felt like, in my head
when I picture Jiminy,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.770
I thought like, oh, he's
got a little green pea head,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.124
and he's got that sort
of little pinched mouth.

00:03:00.124 --> 00:03:01.540
So I thought keeping
that is quite

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.892
a nice nod to the original.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.740
I got obsessed with
the shape of his head

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.770
and start drawing it from
all different angles.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.570
Whether the antennae go
forward or they go back.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.740
There's lots of other animated
movies with insects in.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.530
I didn't want Jiminy to look
like she was from any of those.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.850
And so various kind
of little details.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.900
Eye proportion.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.830
If they're too big,
she looks like a fly.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.920
She looked too small,
she looked like a sort

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.470
of human version of a bug.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.050
Various different things.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.370
And so "Pinocchio"
was in development

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.300
for a number of years.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.424
And the National Theatre
has this amazing building,

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:39.760
the National Theatre Studio,
which sort of incorporates

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.170
the new work department.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.180
And shows that are
being pitched--

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.690
they're not even
commissioned yet--

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.060
get developed in this building.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.726
And so that's where
scripts are drafted.

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:51.430
It's where workshops are held
with actors and directors,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.210
and where you sort of pitch the
shows to the National Theatre.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.860
And "Pinocchio"
was sort of still

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.010
being commissioned, per se.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.130
It hadn't been given
the full green light.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.230
And so I did three
development workshops there,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.360
deciding on the scale
of the bigger puppets--

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.490
making a giant
cardboard Geppetto

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.982
and then that turned
to a foam one.

00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:12.940
And then eventually it
sort of evolved through.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.620
And in the second
workshop, the big sort

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.036
of question we'd
all been avoiding

00:04:16.036 --> 00:04:18.850
was, how's Jiminy
Cricket going to work?

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.290
Is it going to be an actor?

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.730
In my head as soon
as someone said

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.521
that, I was like, oh,
someone in a big lime

00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:28.550
green kind of onesie, with
some like green hoppers on.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.050
Yeah.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.966
An actor in a costume.

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:32.200
Is it objects from
Geppetto's workshop

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.200
that the fairy kind of conjures
together to be an insect,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.130
or is it a puppet character?

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.627
And I being a massive
puppet nerd since I was six,

00:04:40.627 --> 00:04:43.210
and making puppets things, I was
like, if Jiminy Cricket isn't

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.150
a puppet, I've not
done my job right.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.860
Let's kind of go for it.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.120
And so we were casting
this development workshop.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.030
And in those kind of situations,
it's always quite nice

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.460
to have a mix of people you
have and haven't worked with.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.512
And in the case of
puppetry, I'm always

00:04:59.512 --> 00:05:01.970
a big fan of going right with
people who've had experience,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.531
so no one is learning on
the job over five days,

00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:07.030
how to puppeteer something as
complicated as Jiminy Cricket.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.988
If ultimately, the
decisions about that process

00:05:08.988 --> 00:05:10.950
are going to be made
in those five days,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.320
let's have some kind
of common ground.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.630
Audrey and I have done a
number of projects together,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.450
but the main one being the
"Elephantom" adaptation

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.509
of a children's book
at The National.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.800
And James and I have done
far too many things together.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.189
JAMES CHARLTON: Too many.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.980
TOBY OLIE: "Light
Princess" at The National

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.730
and "Little Shop of Horrors" in
Manchester, and "Running Yeah.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.090
Too many things.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.660
And so it was really exciting
that actually these guys,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.552
we'd had puppetry
experience together.

00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:37.510
That they could kind of
hit the ground running.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.350
So we made a prototype,
which you can see here.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.590
It was an upside down
plastic bleach bottle.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.890
It was full sort of
"Blue Peter" making mode.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.500
And some plastic plumbing
pipe and cardboard

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.330
and polystyrene for the head.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.140
It was really quickly
thrown together

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.350
to sort of try out the ideas.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.490
And so I think the
idea was that we would

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.810
run a scene with the puppet.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.393
We'd run the same
scene with an actor.

00:05:59.393 --> 00:06:01.680
And we'd run the same
scene with sort of objects

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.930
or a kind of abstracted
thing on the actor's arm,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.021
and see which one people
related to the most.

00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:07.770
And thankfully we
started with the puppet,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.645
because we never needed
to try the other two.

00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:11.910
Because people were
ludicrously spellbound,

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.154
which was really,
really brilliant.

00:06:14.154 --> 00:06:15.570
It remains one of
my favorite days

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.230
of my career, people's response
to this puppet in the room.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.269
And the work these guys did in--

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:20.810
I don't know.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.830
You sort of had
probably, two half days,

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.300
and then we ended up
showing the scene to people.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.600
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.817
And it wasn't always our
primary focus either.

00:06:26.817 --> 00:06:28.150
There were some things going on.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.399
So you sort of get thrown
this puppet and, off you go.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:32.513
And you're like, OK, we've
got to show people now

00:06:32.513 --> 00:06:33.350
if it's good.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.530
TOBY OLIE: Yeah.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.170
Yeah.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.120
And John and the rest
of the creative team--

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.370
there was never a question,
really, about gender

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.810
being an issue with Jiminy.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.310
There are so few
female characters

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.250
in the original Disney movie.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.430
I think there's just the fairy,
the more I think about it.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.510
It's just the Blue Fairy.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.280
And she comes in and is very
ethereal and is very 1940s.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.340
When did it come out?

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.010
Late '30s?

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.594
No.

00:06:51.594 --> 00:06:53.760
You know, she's very of
that time-- very moralistic.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.720
And she leaves.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.374
And so John and
Dennis the writer

00:06:57.374 --> 00:06:59.040
were really keen to
have some much, much

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.860
stronger female presence in
the show, as well as the Blue

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.580
Fairy.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.050
And actually, Jimmy just
immediately presented herself

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.400
as being a really
great candidate for it.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.880
Audrey is too modest
to say it, so I should.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.520
She has very good comic timing.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.127
And she's an amazing singer.

00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:19.710
Not as good comic
timing in real life.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.970
AUDREY BRISSON:
Not in real life.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.970
TOBY OLIE: But on stage.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.599
On stage, it's a lot better.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.390
And so these two kind
of worked their magic

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.540
with this bit of cardboard
and plastic bottle.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.380
And the sort of go ahead
for the puppet was given.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.220
So probably, four or
five months later--

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.570
the prototype was December 2016?

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.550
AUDREY BRISSON: Yes.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.630
JAMES CHARLTON: Yes.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.350
TOBY OLIE: And so probably
May, April time 2017,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.160
we started to think about
what she might look like.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.910
Googling crickets.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.500
I had no idea there were so many
different kinds of crickets.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.070
There were some
freaky looking things

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.467
like camouflaged ones, ones
that were like hideous aliens.

00:07:56.467 --> 00:07:58.050
I quite liked the
sort of top left one

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.500
that looks like it is
standing on its back legs.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.960
And from those kind of
things it was like, oh yeah,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.293
her knees should point forwards.

00:08:03.293 --> 00:08:05.700
They shouldn't point back
like a real cricket's,

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.447
because it's a bit too
sci-fi kind of weirdy.

00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:10.030
Let's try and make
it a bit relatable.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.000
So I kind of, yeah,
started to draw.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.800
She's sort of four
heads high, this one.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.110
A sort of more insect-y
looking cricket with the kind

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.660
of slight anthropomorphic
human sort

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.310
of layout of the Disney film.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.660
It just looked too sci-fi.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.800
It didn't feel-- it felt
a bit like "District 9."

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.289
I mean, where people start
turning into the shrimp aliens.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.559
It felt a bit like that.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.590
A bit sort of too, I don't know.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.570
Yeah.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.450
Just a bit too
science experiment-y.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:44.039
And so John the director,
and Bob Crowley,

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.450
who designed the
set and costumes

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.037
and co-designed the puppets
with me, he just said,

00:08:48.037 --> 00:08:49.620
don't go too far
from what you've got.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.744
What you had really worked.

00:08:50.744 --> 00:08:52.350
Don't over-engineer it.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.210
And so we kept the
nod to the bottle.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.469
And her body is sort of a
kind of upside down apothecary

00:08:57.469 --> 00:08:59.760
bottle kind of shape, with
these sort of sections in it

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.481
to give her kind of an
exoskeleton kind of shape.

00:09:04.481 --> 00:09:04.980
And yeah.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.570
All of her limbs--

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.945
I just kind of went more with
kind of curves, or thinking

00:09:07.945 --> 00:09:10.460
about having little sleeves
that looked sort of exoskeleton.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.750
They're so segmented.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.700
But I kind of thought of
little sleeves or little cuffs.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.222
Or if her legs are
so kind of curvy,

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.180
going in different
directions, and it gives her

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.160
a kind of rounded,
sort of friendly vibe,

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.481
but still sort of creates
insect kind of feeling.

00:09:23.481 --> 00:09:23.980
And yeah.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.854
The head proportions
are a bit bigger by now.

00:09:25.854 --> 00:09:28.324
And I'm thinking about
how the joints would work.

00:09:28.324 --> 00:09:30.240
She's got elastic in her
legs that you'll see,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.000
which means she's very springy.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.190
But this was the
sort of blueprint

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.590
that we ended up, that
I gave to the makers.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.320
So we do a sort of side
profile, and front profile.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.210
And then this was blown
up to exact scale.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.580
And then this amazing maker,
Roy, started to carve her.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.930
And so he carved all the
elements out of blue Styrofoam.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.639
It's quite rigid.

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:55.304
And it's a bit like polystyrene,
but doesn't sort of flake away.

00:09:55.304 --> 00:09:56.760
And you can take molds from it.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.039
It's quite good and sturdy.

00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:59.580
And so he started
sculpting the head.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.190
This is probably about the
third test of the head.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.410
I got really pedantic
about the shape of eyes

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.470
and how jowly she was.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.700
Things like that.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.200
But yeah.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.140
It took a few sculpts
of the head, eyebrow.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.280
Whether her eyebrows
looked too angry.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.970
And various things like that.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.580
And so head was
sculpted in foam.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.770
Hands were sculpted in foam.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.880
And they were covered.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.940
And made molds of.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.440
Because we knew we wanted more
than one puppet for the show.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.280
The puppet gets
quite a long workout.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.020
She's probably the puppet that's
on stage the most in the show,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.520
right?

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.395
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:10:30.395 --> 00:10:31.700
That or Geppetto.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.360
Between them, they
probably share.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.400
TOBY OLIE: Though Geppetto's not
jumping around as much, is he?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.350
JAMES CHARLTON:
That's true, too.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.387
TOBY OLIE: So we knew
we wanted more than one.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:40.220
And if things broke,
then it's great to have

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.490
a means of just making
another arm or leg,

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.810
so molding her, and being
able to make duplicates

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:45.686
felt really valuable.

00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:47.226
AUDREY BRISSON:
Which was very useful

00:10:47.226 --> 00:10:48.339
in the rehearsal process.

00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:49.130
TOBY OLIE: Oh yeah.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.030
Yeah, go on about the
rehearsal process.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.655
AUDREY BRISSON: So
we were doing a run.

00:10:51.655 --> 00:10:53.120
I think it was our first run.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.110
And there's a moment
when the Fox attempts

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.420
to kill Jiminy with an ax.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.540
TOBY OLIE: Spoiler alert.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.750
AUDREY BRISSON: Oh.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.310
Sorry.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.710
JAMES CHARLTON:
Have to know now.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.140
AUDREY BRISSON: Well, in doing
so, chops his own tail off.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.010
And the actor, David
Langham, who plays the Fox,

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.900
did it with such gusto, and
had been given a new ax--

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.900
TOBY OLIE: Still a prop.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.077
But still quite heavy.

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:19.910
AUDREY BRISSON: Still
a prop but very heavy.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.680
And he went with such
force and conviction

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.600
and chopped one of her legs off.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.980
But I didn't notice.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.855
And so the reaction--

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:29.430
JAMES CHARLTON: Because
you were so in the--

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.430
AUDREY BRISSON: Because
I was in the moment.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.810
The reaction of the
audience, the creatives,

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.420
were just, oh, oh my God, what's
happened, what's happened.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.640
And I just said, wow,
they're very into the scene.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.304
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:41.304 --> 00:11:42.220
They're so [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.890
JAMES CHARLTON: I
think between us,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.099
we were absolutely mortified.

00:11:44.099 --> 00:11:46.514
And we sort of went over to
Toby and went, it's all right.

00:11:46.514 --> 00:11:47.264
We've got spares.

00:11:47.264 --> 00:11:48.075
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:48.950
TOBY OLIE: And it is.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:49.825
It's like a pit stop.

00:11:49.825 --> 00:11:52.670
You can literally sort of go,
leg goes on, leg goes off.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.749
But ax attacks aside,
we knew that she

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:58.790
was going to have some
wear and tear in the show.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.660
So her legs and arms
and hands are all

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.400
molded in fast cast, which
is sort of crazy resistant.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.650
You can throw it on the floor.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.700
It doesn't shatter.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.940
Feels quite sort
of like porcelain.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.299
It feels sort of quite
dense kind of china.

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:17.590
And we filled it with this
crazy expanding stuff that's

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.714
sort of like glass bubbles.

00:12:18.714 --> 00:12:20.950
So actually she is sort
of like an aero inside.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.700
She's aerated, with
this very solid outside,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.440
which is massively resistant.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.770
And then her head and her
body are fiberglass from mold.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.016
So she can really
kind of take a knock.

00:12:35.016 --> 00:12:36.420
But yeah.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:42.390
All of her numerous arms and her
legs and feet coming together.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.860
And so by the time
we got to rehearsals,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.850
we did a week of puppet
training, didn't we,

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.650
prior to full-time rehearsals
with the rest of the company.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.810
Because in the show we've
got five puppets in total.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.547
Jiminy, Geppetto, Blue Fairy,
Stromboli, Coachman-- oh,

00:12:57.547 --> 00:12:58.130
and the whale.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.180
Six.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.200
The whale is enormous.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:01.700
But yeah.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.800
So we had a week
of puppet training

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.670
so that the people working in
teams of two or three or four

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.060
could work together to
animate the characters.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.352
And so throughout rehearsals,
we had very nearly

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:14.810
finished the finished
Jiminy, which

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.309
is great, because it means you
can sort of road test things.

00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:20.552
If there's any alterations
to handles or grip tape.

00:13:20.552 --> 00:13:22.010
Various things that
you can kind of

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.660
keep adding and playing with.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.850
And so we did a
majority of rehearsals

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.050
with one of our two
Jiminys in unfinished form.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.050
And yeah.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.530
Getting up to
hijinks and kind of

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:40.310
beginning to find their kind of
duet on this puppet together.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.770
So lots of questions
were being bandied around

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.420
about what her finish would be.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.220
And it felt quite nice
to sort of give her

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.630
a slight fantastical quality.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.447
So in the Disney movie, Jiminy
turns up at the beginning.

00:13:51.447 --> 00:13:52.280
And he's just there.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.321
And he's wearing clothes.

00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:54.980
He happens upon
Geppetto's workshop.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.130
And the Blue Fairy says,
you're Pinocchio's conscience.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.630
And the story continues.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.200
And in Dennis'
script, the Blue Fairy

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.500
turns sort of a real cricket--

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.030
which, on stage,
is kind of mimed,

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.260
and people see it
jumping around.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.370
And there's a sound effect.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.078
She transforms the
kind of actual cricket

00:14:12.078 --> 00:14:14.690
into a bigger, more kind
of humanoid cricket,

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.920
which is our puppet.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.990
And so to give her this
sort of fantastical quality,

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.230
I began to look at
other insects that

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.100
had kind of fantastical
wing colors, shell colors.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.530
And so there's a
jewel beetle that

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.130
come in all sorts of colors
and shapes and sizes.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:31.640
And, yeah.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.010
This sort of green that sort
of turns blue in places,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.565
or it turns red.

00:14:35.565 --> 00:14:37.190
Just thought that
was really brilliant.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.205
Give her a real kind of
cosmic sort of sheen.

00:14:39.205 --> 00:14:41.330
As you can see, the final
puppet doesn't have this.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.890
So there is a story to tell.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.802
But we researched
this amazing paint

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.510
that's called flip-flop
paint that's used

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.130
a lot of motorbikes, on cars.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.200
And it does shift.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.172
So the shadowier side
is a different color

00:14:52.172 --> 00:14:53.630
to the side that's
in direct light.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.630
We were like, brilliant.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:55.940
She's going to look amazing.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.523
Yeah, it's kind of
an expensive paint.

00:14:57.523 --> 00:14:59.570
Yeah, it takes 12 different
coats of spraying,

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.630
and it takes four weeks.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.130
Whatever.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:01.490
We'll do it.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.970
It's going to be great.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:02.928
It's going to be great.

00:15:02.928 --> 00:15:04.479
Create some really
fancy concept art.

00:15:04.479 --> 00:15:05.270
Everybody loved it.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:05.700
Great.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.200
Brilliant.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:06.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:06.895 --> 00:15:08.119
Puppet arrived.

00:15:08.119 --> 00:15:09.410
Oh my God, it's like Christmas.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.100
It looks amazing.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.120
Oh, and they put
red on the bottom.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.619
One bit.

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:12.920
Ah, gosh, she looks brilliant.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.570
Ah, let's thread
it together, yeah.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.670
Oh, God, it's great.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.250
It's like Iron Man, but a bug.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:17.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.446
Oh yeah, cool.

00:15:19.446 --> 00:15:20.496
Yeah, it's fantastic.

00:15:20.496 --> 00:15:21.620
Yeah, let's put it onstage.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.452
Oh.

00:15:22.452 --> 00:15:23.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.059
It was so disappointing.

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:28.850
It's the first day of
technical rehearsals.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.634
So we were five days in tech?

00:15:30.634 --> 00:15:32.300
AUDREY BRISSON: Five
days in tech, yeah.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.020
TOBY OLIE: So you
have rehearsals

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.740
in the rehearsal room.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.890
And you go into
technical rehearsals

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.020
where you're onstage.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.610
And yes, the cast is
still kind of rehearsing,

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.060
but it's more about adapting to
the space, putting in lighting,

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:40.910
putting in sound.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.660
There's a lot of
illusions in "Pinocchio."

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.670
There's some flying.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.500
And so there was a lot
of technical things

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.220
to put in place.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.410
And Jiminy just sort
of wasn't a worry

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.200
until she turns up
under the table.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.830
And all you can see is Audrey
staring into some sort of--

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.413
AUDREY BRISSON: Which
is a nice thing.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:57.810
TOBY OLIE: A sort of black
VW Beetle that she's holding.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:58.400
I don't know, yeah.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.840
She didn't reflect light at all.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.048
She didn't reflect any light.

00:16:01.048 --> 00:16:02.270
She sort of absorbed it.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.554
All the darker tones
kind of came out.

00:16:04.554 --> 00:16:06.970
And she sort of just looked
like she was always in shadow.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.479
And people who have seen the
show comment on how brilliant

00:16:10.479 --> 00:16:12.770
it is being able to see Audrey
and James do their thing

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.690
and how they relate
to the puppet.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:19.950
But ultimately, if you can't
see the puppet in darkness,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.660
and you can see the
puppeteer staring at nothing,

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.160
we're kind of not
doing our jobs right.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.400
So, frantic on my
phone, image searching

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.570
different kinds of cricket,
brighter color palettes.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.770
Things that could
be really zingy.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.930
There's not a lot
of set in Pinocchio.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.440
Very often Jiminy is performed
on a sort of dark canvas.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.450
And so the fact that she
could be quite bright

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.750
would really help show her
silhouette and all the kind

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.310
of detail that you
guys were doing,

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.430
that you just couldn't see with
the shinier, darker puppet.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.250
Some crazy bright green fellows.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.630
Getting the old Pantone app out.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.390
We're going through, comparing,
finding the right kind of tone.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.640
Because there's a weird thing.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.830
You're straight into a kind
of acid trip crazy neon green

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:04.460
too easily.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.960
And it was quite
interesting to find

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.099
the kind of very bright lime
shade that would kind of work

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:13.525
and still feel natural, without
being too kind of cosmic.

00:17:13.525 --> 00:17:15.650
I got my coloring pencils
out on my tech desk,

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.180
while we're still
carrying on with the show.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.730
AUDREY BRISSON:
Look at that, yeah.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.800
We only had three days
or something [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.420
before we had the photo
shoots on that Wednesday.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.384
And I think that was a Saturday
when we were told that Jiminy--

00:17:28.384 --> 00:17:29.300
TOBY OLIE: It was mad.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.111
So because we had
two puppets, yeah.

00:17:31.111 --> 00:17:31.610
Thank you.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.180
That's worth saying.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.170
We had two puppets.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.545
And one of them
had been sprayed.

00:17:34.545 --> 00:17:36.950
And this other one had been
sent to this amazing custom

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.540
motorcyclist to start.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.180
And as soon as we saw this, I
was like, get him on the phone.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.220
Stop him.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.160
So we called up.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.010
And he'd brilliantly-- he'd
sanded her down, primed her.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.468
She was totally
ready for painting.

00:17:46.468 --> 00:17:49.522
He hadn't started the motorbike
paint, which was perfect.

00:17:49.522 --> 00:17:51.230
So we were like, you've
done a great job.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.230
We just don't want to
proceed any further.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.820
So he sent it back brilliantly.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.790
And yeah.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.470
Sitting in tech, trying out,
does she have green highlights,

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.280
does she have yellow highlights?

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:00.850
Does she have spots?

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:01.766
Does she have stripes?

00:18:01.766 --> 00:18:03.450
And trying out
different combinations,

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.090
settling on this palette.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:11.120
And brilliantly, Daisy, who
is the puppet supervisor

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.380
on the project--

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.270
Daisy Beatty, she's
amazing, she's

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.010
got many, many skills--
and Lara, who's

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.968
from the National Theatre
Props Workshop, who's

00:18:17.968 --> 00:18:19.370
an amazing painter,
they just set

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.780
to work priming and painting
her ready for the dress

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.380
rehearsal, which is always
where the production photos are

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.380
taken, for shows really.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.700
Which, on really
design-heavy shows,

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.810
you're like, that's crazy.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.870
The show's not even-- we haven't
got it on its feet fully yet.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.990
But it's when it's needed
for press and for publicity.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.192
So she had to be
ready for that date.

00:18:39.192 --> 00:18:41.150
And I kind of wanted to
get used to seeing her,

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.280
whether we needed to change
the color any further.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.020
So it was sort of nail bar
going on in the props department

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.850
of painting all
these little hands,

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.010
going into quite a lot of
detail, a lot of shading,

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.650
trying to pick up all
the contours in her.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:59.240
We added a little kind of an
Swarovski crystal to her eye,

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.090
to slightly give her a pupil.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.590
I'm a big fan of puppets
of not having a fixed sort

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.500
of dot, because actually it
means that the puppet is always

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.510
looking in one fixed place.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.504
And if you're slightly out,
it's very, very unforgiving.

00:19:11.504 --> 00:19:13.670
And because Jiminy is on
the floor a lot of the time

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.161
and you're looking
up, you sort of

00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:16.910
need the freedom to
go, oh, if her nose is

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.220
looking in that direction,
she's looking up there.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.960
And it's more fun
for the audience

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.730
to kind of fill in
the blanks and imagine

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.260
what her eyes are doing.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.810
And so the white little
crystal on top of the orange

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.640
just gives her a
little kind of accent

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.410
as to where her
kind of direction

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.420
is without being
too kind of staring

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.484
kind of Muppet-eyed
kind of black on white.

00:19:36.484 --> 00:19:37.900
And so we ended
up with her as she

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:43.580
is now, her very lime
green, bright, playful self.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.180
And yeah.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.912
I suppose you could talk
next a little bit about how

00:19:46.912 --> 00:19:47.870
we brought her to life.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:48.800
We-- I mean you.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.272
I just hung out
and shouted at you.

00:19:51.272 --> 00:19:52.730
JAMES CHARLTON:
Watched and judged.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.174
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:54.174 --> 00:19:54.840
TOBY OLIE: Yeah.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.506
It's a pleasure.

00:19:57.797 --> 00:20:00.380
Is it worth saying a little bit
about your puppetry experience

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.944
before, or how you
felt as you trained,

00:20:02.944 --> 00:20:04.610
what you trained in
originally, and then

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.693
how that's kind of progressed
into the weird world

00:20:06.693 --> 00:20:07.290
of puppetry?

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.080
JAMES CHARLTON: Would
you like me to go first?

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.290
AUDREY BRISSON: Yes.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.230
You go first.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.146
JAMES CHARLTON: Great.

00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:13.190
Well, I trained in musical
theater, predominantly.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.069
And my first job
out of drama school

00:20:15.069 --> 00:20:16.610
was "Les Miserables"
in the West End.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.420
And it was amazing.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.794
And in my second job,
I luckily met Toby.

00:20:21.794 --> 00:20:23.210
And it was on "The
Light Princess"

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.890
at the National Theatre.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.810
And it was my first
real experience

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.695
of puppetry in any form.

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:31.070
I'd sort of watched
the "Muppets"

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.110
and loved it, obviously.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.590
Who doesn't?

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.980
But it was a real
baptism of fire

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.230
because we had a lot
of different moving

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.140
puppets in that show.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.560
It was very, very
much like Jiminy.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.490
There would be different
aspects going on all the time.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.480
And I learned a lot.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.377
And I learned very
quickly on that job.

00:20:50.377 --> 00:20:51.960
And then I sort of
got the bug for it.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.820
Forgive the pun-- for
just sort of picking up

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.540
an object of that sort of ilk
and trying to bring it to life.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:04.610
It has a real sort
of gratification

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.510
of being able to serve
something that's beyond you

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.131
with other people at one time.

00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:10.880
And I feel like there's
something probably

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.457
we share, as all
puppeteers, of making

00:21:13.457 --> 00:21:14.540
something bigger than you.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.820
And I think that's sort of
an ensemble nature anyway,

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.700
and that's sort of
what I trained in.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.900
And then from there,
I just didn't stop.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.240
I think I've done
puppetry jobs ever since.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.140
And it's been a real pleasure to
do it, because it's such a joy.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.420
And you get to do so many
different types of shows

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.660
and work in different places.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.951
I did another show in Manchester
at the Royal Exchange.

00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:35.310
It was in the Round,
which was just fantastic.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.175
And we took a real
show that was sort of--

00:21:37.175 --> 00:21:40.949
you know, Audrey II was
sort of stuck in most parts,

00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:41.990
at the back of the stage.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.350
But because we're in the Round,
we sort of had to change up.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.145
And that was quite
fun-- doing something--

00:21:46.145 --> 00:21:46.940
TOBY OLIE: Not Audrey too.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.020
JAMES CHARLTON: Not Audrey too.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.590
Not this Audrey.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.798
TOBY OLIE: The big plant
from Little Shop of Horrors.

00:21:50.798 --> 00:21:51.440
Yeah.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.020
JAMES CHARLTON: And
then, obviously--

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.810
AUDREY BRISSON:
Who's named after me.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.160
TOBY OLIE: Yeah.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.870
JAMES CHARLTON: A few years
later, "Pinocchio" comes round

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:58.828
and it was in workshop.

00:21:58.828 --> 00:22:00.800
And it just took off from there.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.760
What about you?

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.300
AUDREY BRISSON: Well, I also
trained in music theater.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.050
And I find it very
funny when Toby mentions

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.350
that he wanted to work
with experienced puppeteers

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.180
because I wasn't one of them.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.510
I mean, I have worked in the
past with Toby a little bit.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.300
You know, I've had the odd
experience with a puppet

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.190
for two or three
minutes in the show,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.455
and then moved away
from the puppet and--

00:22:24.455 --> 00:22:25.640
TOBY OLIE: Just put
it down and walk away.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.515
AUDREY BRISSON: Yeah.

00:22:26.515 --> 00:22:27.500
I'm done now.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.720
So when Toby called
me and said, would you

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.635
like to be part of the research
and development for Pinocchio,

00:22:32.635 --> 00:22:34.580
playing Jiminy--

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.920
and with the line,
we don't know yet

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.950
if it's going to be a
puppet or an actor--

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.370
the nine weeks that we had for
the rehearsals of "Pinocchio"

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.350
were the training.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.400
And actually, I believe
that regardless of how much

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.004
experience you've had,
every puppet is a new one.

00:22:52.004 --> 00:22:52.920
TOBY OLIE: Absolutely.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.400
AUDREY BRISSON: You
will have to figure out

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.820
the language of the
puppet that you are with.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.530
So James and I-- well, maybe
not you, because you also do--

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.280
but like I puppeteered
Jiminy, but I would never

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.740
be able to puppeteer
Geppetto or the Blue Fairy,

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.360
because it's a completely
different instrument.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.340
It took me the nine weeks to
learn how to play with her

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.350
and be happy.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.370
She was very heavy.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.230
She's not heavy, but
she was heavy for me

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.490
at the very beginning.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.073
TOBY OLIE: Anything
is heavy if you're

00:23:24.073 --> 00:23:26.630
holding it mid-height out
for 10, 15 minutes at a time.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.490
You could hold a bag of-- you
could hold your iPhone out

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.350
and after a while and be
like, oh, it's a bit--

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.530
AUDREY BRISSON: Yeah.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:30.770
No.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:31.480
It's surprising.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:36.230
So there would be a lot of, do
the scene once and then, OK,

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.550
put Jiminy aside,
relax the muscles.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.690
Maybe do it with
your own body, just

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.930
to have a feeling of what it is
that you're trying to portray.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.725
And at first we used
to do that quite a lot.

00:23:47.725 --> 00:23:48.350
TOBY OLIE: Yes.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.850
AUDREY BRISSON: And then
there was one afternoon

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.485
where we had some
children coming over

00:23:51.485 --> 00:23:53.360
to see some of the
rehearsals that we'd done.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.750
Because it was just to see if
the children responded to what

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.740
we were doing.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:03.050
And John Tiffany, the director,
asked me to lead the warm up

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.340
with Jiminy.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.420
So we arrived.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.930
And it was our first time
improvising with her.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.552
And I think it opened
the door for us

00:24:11.552 --> 00:24:13.010
to understand that
actually, we had

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.570
more control than we thought.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.160
We could play more
than we could.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.620
And then afterwards,
it really was, for me,

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.480
like an overnight thing.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.710
After this rehearsal, all
the leading of the warm up,

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.905
suddenly, we could play.

00:24:25.905 --> 00:24:26.780
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.210
I think there are certain
points in the rehearsal process

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.270
for puppeteers, where there's
certain benchmark moments,

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.140
where--

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.056
you first get it, and
it's absolutely foreign,

00:24:35.056 --> 00:24:35.850
and you hate it.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:36.870
No matter what it is.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.100
It doesn't matter
how well-- yeah.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.270
But you do, and you go,
because you want to end game,

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.270
and you always want to
get to the final product.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.850
AUDREY BRISSON: And you're
blocked by the incapacity.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.120
JAMES CHARLTON: And
there's a few moments

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.870
where you sort of get there.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.040
And that was definitely
one of those moments

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.530
where you suddenly clicked, and
you go, John, the possibilities

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.520
are now endless for us.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.910
We can sort of go
anywhere with this puppet.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.690
But it takes a long
time to get there.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.315
And we're fortunate,
with the National,

00:24:58.315 --> 00:25:01.250
that they gave us such a
long period of rehearsal

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.572
to understand the puppet,
to get to know it.

00:25:03.572 --> 00:25:06.030
And also, it's not just full
nine weeks on that one puppet.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.832
There's so much more
going on in the room.

00:25:07.832 --> 00:25:09.540
You know, we'll be
dancing in the morning

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.650
or learning a song
in the afternoon.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.247
And we get an hour at the end
of the day to play with Jiminy.

00:25:13.247 --> 00:25:14.830
AUDREY BRISSON: At
the end of the day.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:15.960
It was always at
the end of the day.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.605
JAMES CHARLTON: Which is--

00:25:16.605 --> 00:25:17.806
and you're sort of so tired.

00:25:17.806 --> 00:25:19.430
I don't know if I
can do anything else.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.971
TOBY OLIE: But even
from the outside,

00:25:20.971 --> 00:25:23.320
you know, as a director
of the puppets,

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.471
you start off very much
talking to James and Audrey

00:25:25.471 --> 00:25:27.720
and going, OK, so it's this,
and if you hold it there,

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.660
maybe that's easier.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.730
And where's the tension?

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:30.950
How can we help that move?

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.210
And you are sort of by the
end going, OK, can Jimmy

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.819
jump up and do-- you end up
sort of talking about Jiminy

00:25:35.819 --> 00:25:37.860
like she's a character in
the room, which she is.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.420
She's another
performer in the room.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.510
And actually it was so exciting
seeing, after that warm up,

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.220
you guys being
able to improvise.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.200
And we did put the puppet down.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.450
You know, there were times
when, if a move was tricky,

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.940
or you want to-- she's
such a small puppet on such

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.980
a big stage.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.470
Her movements had to be quite
kind of concise, very sort of

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.180
crystallized, so that
her whole body is

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.470
kind of reacting to the same
kind of state of tension.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.090
And very often--
did you like that?

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:03.825
That was good.

00:26:03.825 --> 00:26:05.100
AUDREY BRISSON: I did.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:05.890
TOBY OLIE: Wasted.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.100
Wasted in puppetry.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.680
That Audrey would have a
go, James would have a go.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.917
And we'd sort of see how
it was embodied in them,

00:26:12.917 --> 00:26:14.250
and then put that in the puppet.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:15.690
And that process
sort of gradually

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.580
decreased as their
thinking went more and more

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.163
into kind of what
the puppet could do,

00:26:19.163 --> 00:26:21.840
what was the puppet's
version of that emotion.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.881
JAMES CHARLTON: I think
an important thing for us

00:26:23.881 --> 00:26:26.490
as well-- we live in a sort of
a box about this big on stage

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.090
together, as two
actors or puppeteers.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.820
So it's about getting used
to that sort of relationship

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.820
with each other.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.310
And as well as we
know each other,

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.840
it's about sort
of literally being

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.910
able to lean on your
partner at certain points.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:39.380
AUDREY BRISSON: Absolutely.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.530
JAMES CHARLTON: And knowing
that when I barge into Audrey,

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.240
it's not because I want
her to move out the way.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.115
It is because that's
the only way my body can

00:26:45.115 --> 00:26:46.681
get to that certain place.

00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:48.180
And that's a real
great relationship

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.721
that we've built
over the nine weeks.

00:26:49.721 --> 00:26:53.310
And going forward, the teamwork
involved in it is really--

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.752
it has to be sort
of in that box.

00:26:55.752 --> 00:26:57.210
If it's anywhere
outside there-- as

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.770
soon as you sort of have
airs and graces about it,

00:26:58.770 --> 00:26:59.360
you're done.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.300
AUDREY BRISSON:
In September, if I

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.095
was to take one step
to the left when

00:27:02.095 --> 00:27:04.220
we'd said that we were
supposed to go to the right,

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:04.970
it would go--

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:05.230
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.020
It would go wrong.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:06.990
AUDREY BRISSON:
Completely mental.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.190
What are you doing and now--

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.390
JAMES CHARLTON: We'd have to
reassess and take about an hour

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.730
and go, why did you go left when
I was obviously going right?

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.605
AUDREY BRISSON: Yeah.

00:27:12.605 --> 00:27:13.680
It was obviously right.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.630
Whereas now, when I
forget my words on stage,

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.810
and I start mini-improvising
or blocking,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:22.180
well, James just laughs and
just completely goes with me.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.490
JAMES CHARLTON: I don't
completely laughed, but yes.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:25.285
It is fun.

00:27:25.285 --> 00:27:26.160
TOBY OLIE: But it is.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.720
It's such a strange
thing, thinking

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.450
in a group of two, three,
four, as one brain.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:34.110
It's a massive
test of generosity

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.220
onstage, of kind of
really good acting.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.690
As somebody who studied puppetry
and trained in puppetry,

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.020
the more I kind of hear about
other people's acting training,

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.560
or work with more actors and
directors, great puppetry

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.300
and great acting
are kind of the same

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.730
in that you're kind of
leaving room for the audience

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.605
to project their own
experiences and emotions

00:27:52.605 --> 00:27:53.438
on your performance.

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:55.290
You're not selling it
so much that you're

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.170
kind of offended by it.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.940
And there's something really
selfless about puppetry.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.980
Not only because
you're telling people

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.990
to look at this inanimate
thing, not at you.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.365
But at the same
time, you kind of

00:28:05.365 --> 00:28:07.884
have to take responsibility for
your bit of the puppet, then

00:28:07.884 --> 00:28:09.300
your bit of the
puppet in relation

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.966
to the other person's
bit of the puppet.

00:28:10.966 --> 00:28:13.590
Then how that puppet relates
to another character opposite.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.345
You sort of feel
the vision goes--

00:28:15.345 --> 00:28:17.220
and your peripheral
vision kind of

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.303
feels like a muscle by the
end, that you've really

00:28:19.303 --> 00:28:20.050
kind of worked.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:24.120
And it's just very exciting
making decisions together.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.760
I was one of the puppeteers in
the original production of "War

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.630
Horse."

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.780
And you work in a team with
three on the horses together.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.280
And one night we had a
light explode above us

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.846
in the sort of rig
of the theater.

00:28:36.846 --> 00:28:39.660
A massively loud bang
in a really quiet calm,

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.310
pastoral kind of moment, and
the horses just really relaxed.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.401
This huge bang happened.

00:28:43.401 --> 00:28:45.150
And more fool us,
because it could've been

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.440
something huge falling on us.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.275
None of us as puppeteers went--

00:28:48.275 --> 00:28:49.110
and looked up.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.994
The horse went--
and was spooked.

00:28:50.994 --> 00:28:53.160
Because you're kind of in
this weird state together.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.290
You're in this kind of weird,
sort of meditative state,

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.270
going, OK, yeah, we're
listening to each other.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.270
If the feet give me a
signal, I'll do something.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.687
But otherwise, I'll be looking.

00:29:00.687 --> 00:29:02.270
And when you're in
that kind of state,

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.460
you're kind of taught to
react to any outside stimulus

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.280
together.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.821
And so the fact that the horse
reacted to an exploding light,

00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:11.730
and none of us thought about
our own lives, and looked up,

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.830
was hilarious and bizarre.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.570
So shall we give
Jiminy a bit of a demo

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.887
and talk about some principles?

00:29:19.887 --> 00:29:20.720
AUDREY BRISSON: Yes.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.175
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:29:21.175 --> 00:29:21.630
Absolutely.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:22.370
AUDREY BRISSON:
She wants her time.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.800
TOBY OLIE: Yeah.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.591
She needs her time.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.090
Which puppet is this, Audrey?

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:27.840
Which one?

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.640
AUDREY BRISSON: This
is Tracy McJumpy.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.640
TOBY OLIE: So we've got
two puppets in the show.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.360
And to help distinguish
them, Audrey's named them.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:34.860
So yes.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.630
This is Tracy McJumpy.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.463
AUDREY BRISSON: And we
have Brenda MacLeapy,

00:29:37.463 --> 00:29:38.790
who is currently on rest--

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.849
TOBY OLIE: On rest.

00:29:39.849 --> 00:29:40.890
AUDREY BRISSON: In a spa.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:41.150
TOBY OLIE: In a spa, yes.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.839
She's having a bath somewhere.

00:29:47.345 --> 00:29:48.220
I'll do it this time.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:48.720
Don't worry.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.860
You've got next.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.000
So let's talk mechanics,
a little bit, actually,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.180
who's doing what.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.967
So Audrey has got
a rod in the back

00:29:57.967 --> 00:30:00.550
of the body, which you can maybe
show us if you still keep her

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.570
in the character.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:02.800
Yeah.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.377
And that rod is attached to
her body with an elastic.

00:30:05.377 --> 00:30:07.210
And Audrey has a little
trigger on that rod.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.930
That means she can
raise her chin.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.760
And then in her right
hand, Audrey's got two rods

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.710
that go from
Jiminy's arms, which

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.770
she's holding sort of like kind
of crazy reverse chopsticks.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.350
It's a thing that took a
long, long time to practice.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.230
That's the face of experience.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.540
A long, long time to practice.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.830
And sort of trusting that
you can sort of keep one

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.220
pose while you move your
finger to twist another one.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.600
She's got these lovely little
wrist joints or hand joints

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.308
that you can twist
the stick and her hand

00:30:36.308 --> 00:30:38.750
goes palm, top, palm, top.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.800
And so yeah.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.490
It's a bit of a sort of
multitasking challenge being

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.800
on the head and arms
at the same time.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.000
And then James is on the feet.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.880
And he's got little
rods in the back.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.495
And all of her leg
joints are bungee.

00:30:52.495 --> 00:30:54.370
They've all got elastic
running through them.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.840
So that Audrey can
jump Jiminy by herself.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.360
Yeah, go on.

00:31:00.947 --> 00:31:03.280
So she's kind of got enough
kind of structure and bounce

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.000
to manage that.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.710
But then James can
join in and sync up

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.396
for kind of bigger jumps,
or kind of crazier moves--

00:31:08.396 --> 00:31:10.780
AUDREY BRISSON: [LAUGHS]

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.530
TOBY OLIE: And then
her second set of arms

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:15.010
are similarly bungeed,
so that she can-- yeah.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.578
She gets very exasperated
and says, I'm a cricket!

00:31:17.578 --> 00:31:18.434
AUDREY BRISSON: Six!

00:31:18.434 --> 00:31:19.720
Six!

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.746
I'm not a spider?

00:31:23.746 --> 00:31:24.620
TOBY OLIE: Very good.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.160
Very good.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.660
Yeah.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.830
And so the two of
them are always

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.246
in a kind of slight tension
together as well, which again,

00:31:30.246 --> 00:31:31.870
the elastic of the
legs really helps

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:33.900
be in sort of slight
tension with each other.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.150
So that if Audrey
makes a decision,

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.691
or James makes a decision, they
can literally feel each other

00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:39.336
through the puppet.

00:31:39.336 --> 00:31:40.755
And--

00:31:40.755 --> 00:31:43.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.680
And so three principles
that I kind of use,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.110
the core ones anyway
when directing puppetry--

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.582
the first one is focus.

00:31:49.582 --> 00:31:52.040
And all these kind of apply to
the puppeteer and the puppet

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:52.310
really.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.820
But yeah.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.290
Focus for a puppet--

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:58.765
where it's looking tells
you what it's interested in.

00:31:58.765 --> 00:32:01.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.780
Yeah.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.050
Good luck picking that up.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:04.910
Oh, nearly!

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.051
Good try.

00:32:07.051 --> 00:32:07.550
So yeah.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.966
Where a puppet's
looking basically

00:32:08.966 --> 00:32:10.490
tells you where the story is at.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.220
And as puppeteers,
where they're looking

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.250
tells us what the most important
thing on stage to look at is.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.764
If they look away, and
look at you guys, then

00:32:19.764 --> 00:32:21.180
there's three
characters on stage.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.890
But as soon as they
look at the puppet,

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.370
they're immediately telling
you to look at Jiminy.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:27.360
In the same way--

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.230
No pictures.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.430
In the same way that
if I'm talking to you

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.650
and I look at the
door and go, [GASP]

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.660
what are you all going to do?

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.410
You're going to turn
and look at the door.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:37.620
Yeah.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:37.890
Exactly.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:38.190
Exactly.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.210
We're pack animals who
instinctively do that.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.560
And so the act of
puppeteering-- or certainly,

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.250
my preference of
puppeteering, is going

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.550
to give focus to the object.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.070
So the audience
looks at the object.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.780
So that's focus.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.270
Second one is breath.

00:32:57.134 --> 00:32:58.550
AUDREY BRISSON: I
thought I'd seen

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.419
something that was exciting.

00:33:01.419 --> 00:33:02.960
TOBY OLIE: So if we
go watch a play--

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.210
if we go and watch Benedict
Cumberbatch in "Hamlet"--

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.750
AUDREY BRISSON: [GASP]

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.470
TOBY OLIE: I'm pretty sure.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.970
Yeah, you like
Benedict Cumberbatch?

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.910
I'm pretty sure a lot of
you wouldn't go home and go,

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.080
and I saw Benedict
Cumberbatch breathing.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.715
Like, his breathing was amazing.

00:33:16.715 --> 00:33:17.590
I mean, you might do.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.631
That might be your thing.

00:33:18.631 --> 00:33:19.460
I don't know.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.500
But with puppets, it's
sort of fundamental

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.490
that the audience
have to believe

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.310
that they're alive before
they can do anything else.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.768
Before they can learn about
the character or the reactions,

00:33:26.768 --> 00:33:28.586
or the emotional range,
or its physicality,

00:33:28.586 --> 00:33:29.960
you sort of have
to start playing

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.115
the game with the audience.

00:33:31.115 --> 00:33:33.198
And the simplest way doing
that is through breath.

00:33:33.198 --> 00:33:36.030
It's by showing her breathing.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:40.380
And the puppet, and by
Audrey vocalizing it.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.204
[BREATHING]

00:33:42.204 --> 00:33:45.030
And whilst James isn't
vocalizing the breath, per se,

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:47.150
for the audience to hear,
he's on the same kind

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.560
of breath wavelength with her.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.655
So that you're in the
same state of tension.

00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:53.780
And so that way breath
becomes a really useful tool

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.970
kit for the two of them to
check in with each other,

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.310
or do a little prep breath
before they do a big move

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:00.390
or various little bits.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:00.890
Yeah.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.280
Exactly.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:01.780
Exactly.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.830
It allows a kind
of synchronicity.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.910
The third one is weight.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.989
Which-- I mean,
you're not heavy.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:10.780
AUDREY BRISSON: OK.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.116
Thank you.

00:34:13.116 --> 00:34:14.699
TOBY OLIE: The
simplest way of putting

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:17.389
it-- muscles versus
gravity, in that,

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:20.900
without any weight or
muscularity, if Jiminy jumps,

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.652
he's just sort of lifting off.

00:34:22.652 --> 00:34:23.610
Well that was too good.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.739
You did it with one.

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:25.942
Go on.

00:34:25.942 --> 00:34:26.442
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:26.442 --> 00:34:28.964
AUDREY BRISSON:
That's too-- wait--

00:34:28.964 --> 00:34:29.630
TOBY OLIE: Yeah.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.130
Exactly.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:31.250
Exactly.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:36.280
But with our muscles
versus gravity,

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.590
there's kind of more of a prep.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:37.739
Go on.

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:37.909
Do it.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.075
Try and give us it again.

00:34:39.075 --> 00:34:41.300
[GASP]

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.190
You know, it's as
simple as that.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.134
You're kind of giving
the puppet our physics,

00:34:45.134 --> 00:34:47.050
essentially, because a
puppet can do anything.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.520
It can fly.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.820
It can explode apart.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.634
I've done that
with some puppets.

00:34:51.634 --> 00:34:53.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.250
But with Jiminy we
do little things.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.041
She slightly suspends
her gravity sometimes

00:34:57.041 --> 00:34:59.298
if she's shouting
stop, or she does--

00:34:59.298 --> 00:35:01.090
AUDREY BRISSON: Stop!

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:02.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.820
TOBY OLIE: But generally,
for the audience

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.680
to sympathize and
relate to the character,

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.710
we're giving the
puppet our physics.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:12.070
So we feel its truth
and its reality.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.200
And I suppose, weight
for the puppeteer,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.560
my preference is
that the puppeteer,

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.500
you never see their muscles
working before the puppet's.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.840
So that if Jiminy walks
to the edge of the table,

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.570
they get to their full
stretch before they

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:26.990
have to tilt and move as well.

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.490
Yeah.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:30.070
You see, so James only
gets up at the last second.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.470
If Jiminy was to
walk to the edge

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.970
of the table and
the first thing you

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:35.112
saw was James do that,
you'd start to second guess

00:35:35.112 --> 00:35:36.070
what she's going to do.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.720
And there's a big
thing about putting

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.345
the audience in the
brain of the puppet

00:35:39.345 --> 00:35:44.244
by letting the puppet
instigate all of the movements.

00:35:44.244 --> 00:35:45.910
Should we give them
a bit of repertoire?

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.965
A bit of scene?

00:35:47.965 --> 00:35:50.320
I'll stand in for
everybody else in the scene

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.762
and be a bit of an
eyeline by standing here.

00:35:52.762 --> 00:35:54.220
And you can watch
her do her thing.

00:35:55.116 --> 00:35:56.460
AUDREY BRISSON: Are you ready?

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.065
JAMES CHARLTON: Yes.

00:35:57.065 --> 00:35:57.856
AUDREY BRISSON: OK.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.370
What's going on?

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.290
Wait?

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.670
Who are you?

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.770
Why am I talking?

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.130
Is it cold in here?

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.770
Oh, yes, I think
it's cold in here.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.810
Is this my voice?

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.680
Well, it's a bit high, isn't it?

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.180
[GASP]

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.670
Have I got a throat infection?

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.379
Oh, I do feel a bit weird.

00:36:19.379 --> 00:36:20.920
Maybe I'm coming
down with something.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.975
Am I coming down with something?

00:36:22.975 --> 00:36:25.011
I think I'm coming
down with something.

00:36:25.011 --> 00:36:26.394
Achoo!

00:36:26.394 --> 00:36:27.780
Oh no.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.560
I'm coming down with something.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.090
This table is filthy.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.750
Why is that window open?

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:42.650
Do you have any idea how much
the temperature drops at night?

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:47.885
I mean, has no one heard of
streptococcal pharyngitis?

00:36:47.885 --> 00:36:49.220
Ugh.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.500
Right.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.570
So.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.780
In my first official
act as your conscience,

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.210
I declare that it
is time for bed.

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:04.478
But I said it's time for bed.

00:37:04.478 --> 00:37:04.978
Ugh.

00:37:04.978 --> 00:37:05.924
Look.

00:37:05.924 --> 00:37:07.350
You heard the lady.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.965
I'm your conscience, which
means I know what's best.

00:37:10.965 --> 00:37:15.461
And I am telling you
that it is time for bed.

00:37:15.461 --> 00:37:16.880
Oof!

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.560
Right.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.084
Well, I'm off then.

00:37:22.084 --> 00:37:22.750
TOBY OLIE: Nice.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.490
Very good guys.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.370
Very good, very good.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:24.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:29.070
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:29.570
So yeah.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.810
So the character of
Jiminy in the show

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:34.080
is slightly more kind of
hypochondriac, slightly more

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.630
OCD, slightly more,
forgive me, annoying sort

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:41.810
of sibling to Pinocchio than the
sort of wiser, older guardian

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:45.170
sort of Yoda vibe that he
is in the animated film.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.420
So it's been really fun kind
of letting that character

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.985
kind of develop, and finding
your version of Jiminy

00:37:49.985 --> 00:37:50.860
throughout rehearsal.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:51.735
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:37:51.735 --> 00:37:54.900
The puppet tells us slightly
more about the character

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.620
than sometimes the writing can.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.090
Because it can only
do x or y, which

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:00.340
leads us to do certain things.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.192
Or it can do a myriad
of different things,

00:38:02.192 --> 00:38:04.150
and it means that the
possibilities are endless

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.070
and we shouldn't just be honed
in to what's on the script

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:07.570
sometimes.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.861
TOBY OLIE: And because she's
turned from a real cricket

00:38:09.861 --> 00:38:14.300
into our kind of
anthropomorphic cricket, her--

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.250
do her chirruping, what that
transition is from [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.250
AUDREY BRISSON: Chirrup.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:19.150
TOBY OLIE: So she
starts the cricket.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.150
AUDREY BRISSON: Chirrup.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.138
Shutup.

00:38:21.138 --> 00:38:22.132
Shutup.

00:38:22.132 --> 00:38:23.126
Shutup.

00:38:23.126 --> 00:38:24.120
Shut up.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.620
Shut up.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.720
TOBY OLIE: So she becomes
really kind of angsty.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.630
And so every so often, a kind
of cricketism sort of kicks in,

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:30.980
a bit like a sort of tic.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.410
We sort of gave her this kind
of little like leg stem--

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:34.410
AUDREY BRISSON: Shut up.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:34.680
TOBY OLIE: Yeah.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.472
Yeah, see.

00:38:35.472 --> 00:38:36.430
We don't need a puppet.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.970
They're in sync.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.980
Practically married.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:40.691
Yeah.

00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:42.604
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:42.604 --> 00:38:44.270
And so it was really
interesting finding

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:47.270
how her kind of cricketiness
kicks in at moments

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.910
of stress or tension.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:50.740
But yeah.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.804
That is how we brought Jiminy
Cricket to life in "Pinocchio."

00:38:53.804 --> 00:38:56.220
AUDIENCE: What is the difference
between bringing puppetry

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.377
to stage versus
bringing it to screen?

00:38:58.377 --> 00:38:59.960
Kind of what's the
different processes

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.650
that you would go
through for that?

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.775
TOBY OLIE: I have a lot
more prep time in theater

00:39:03.775 --> 00:39:05.600
than in screen.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.540
Certainly with sort of puppetry
in TV and film that I've done,

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.970
there's a lot of making time.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.110
But actually the
sort of development

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:14.276
and having the time on set
to practice things-- it's

00:39:14.276 --> 00:39:15.557
very much on the day.

00:39:15.557 --> 00:39:17.140
You find something,
you work together,

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.140
and it's kind of
onscreen doing its thing.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.790
Whereas, yeah, on "Pinocchio"
we had nine weeks rehearsal,

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:25.005
plus workshop time before that?

00:39:25.005 --> 00:39:25.880
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.220
TOBY OLIE: It feels like you're
kind of slightly chipping

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.280
away and growing and developing
it, whereas in the film,

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.770
it's very much
like, this is here.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:32.570
It's on the day.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.280
Let's do it.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.464
And very often with
film and TV puppetry,

00:39:36.464 --> 00:39:37.880
you're only a part
of the picture.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.650
It's going to be
filled in with CGI,

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.820
or it's going to have
another element to it.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.380
Or the puppeteers
will be taken away.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.004
There's always kind
of another process,

00:39:45.004 --> 00:39:46.940
whereas it feels,
certainly in theater,

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.640
it's very much like, you're
building towards that finished

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.985
thing as a long term goal.

00:39:50.985 --> 00:39:51.860
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.750
AUDREY BRISSON: And also,
once you film, you filmed it

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.710
and then you move on,
whereas we've been performing

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:58.910
since early December.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.610
And literally an
hour ago, we were

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.770
talking to Toby
about this new idea

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:08.810
that we could add something
at the end of the show.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.097
We are way ahead of where we
were in December, already,

00:40:12.097 --> 00:40:12.930
so this is constant.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:13.805
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:40:13.805 --> 00:40:14.602
Totally.

00:40:14.602 --> 00:40:15.935
And I suppose it's like you say.

00:40:15.935 --> 00:40:19.160
It's the filling in the gaps,
whereas with stage, it's

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.330
got to be ready to go.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:23.570
It's got to be film ready,
as it were, every night,

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.150
for x amount of months.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.610
Whereas with film you can
sort of take it back, edit it,

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.359
someone else can fill
in the gaps for you.

00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:32.810
We sort of have to do it all.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:33.880
That's why we're so good.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.190
AUDREY BRISSON: We are.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.689
Yeah.

00:40:34.689 --> 00:40:35.854
TOBY OLIE: And modest.

00:40:35.854 --> 00:40:36.756
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:36.756 --> 00:40:37.255
Who knew.

00:40:37.255 --> 00:40:37.754
Who knew.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.520
AUDIENCE: I was just
thinking about what

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.620
it must have taken
to choreograph

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:50.950
every second of that scene,
that short scene you just did.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:54.170
And I wondered if you could
talk a little bit about how you

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.950
find your path through that.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:58.720
Are there moments that
you kind of mentally map

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.890
and go, OK, so we want that
movement, that movement,

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.230
that movement, that one,
and you connect them all up?

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:04.460
Or is it a bit more fluid?

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.820
Like how do you find
your way through that?

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.340
It must just take so long.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.150
AUDREY BRISSON: Well today
was already a bit of a mash up

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:17.720
and improvisation on the theme.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.410
Because I'm usually on the
table, the other way around.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.430
Having said that, yes.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.045
It is still choreographed
every night.

00:41:27.045 --> 00:41:27.920
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.440
There's a certain amount
of being choreographed.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.540
And there's also got to
be fluidity, because it's

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.550
a live theater project.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.660
If you were just rigid
and stuck in what you do,

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.040
I feel like the only
thing that would suffer

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.180
would be the puppetry.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.000
We have quite a good
dynamic in that sense,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.070
as I like to keep the structure.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.890
And Audrey will not
keep the structure.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.200
AUDREY BRISSON: I
would like to, I just--

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:51.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.480
JAMES CHARLTON: Because Audrey's
also got about three balls

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:53.780
to juggle.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.696
And I've only got one.

00:41:54.696 --> 00:41:57.920
So moments can
get lost, but it's

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.160
my job to follow and
listen as much as possible.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.650
And Audrey's job is to offer
up different situations.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.540
And between the
two of us, we can

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.455
get through a show
pretty competently now.

00:42:07.455 --> 00:42:08.330
AUDREY BRISSON: Yeah.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.670
JAMES CHARLTON: But that
takes time to develop.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:12.170
But there are
earmarks in the script

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.461
that we go, well, these are
the lines we've got to say.

00:42:14.461 --> 00:42:16.339
And that's usually
how we say them.

00:42:16.339 --> 00:42:17.630
But it can be a bit more fluid.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.370
AUDREY BRISSON: And
I think it comes back

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.410
to what we were saying earlier.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.210
In the early days,
it was very important

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.300
for us to follow
said choreography.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.930
And now we have a
bit more freedom.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.280
And it will also be
a tell on whether we

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.290
are having a good show or not.

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.382
Sometimes we are
very, very in tune

00:42:35.382 --> 00:42:36.590
and we listen to each other--

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.462
TOBY OLIE: It's
all coming out now.

00:42:37.462 --> 00:42:37.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.858
AUDREY BRISSON: No, no.

00:42:38.858 --> 00:42:40.820
And we'll find moments
where you can go,

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.770
wow, we improvised that
bit, because something

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.070
had gone wrong, but we were so
together, that it was seamless,

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:50.870
whereas other moments,
you know, I'll be ahead,

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:51.820
or I'll be behind.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.750
Or you'll feel
slightly disconnected.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.070
It never happens.

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:56.095
Don't worry.

00:42:56.095 --> 00:42:56.970
Sometimes it happens.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:57.400
TOBY OLIE: Thanks guys.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.660
I think what's interesting
is having the script first,

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.050
certainly as an outsider,
finding the character with you

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.650
guys--

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.680
you sort of look for the
changes in emotional tension.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.480
And with her, it was
sort of about finding

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.800
what kind of shapes
would read, given

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.716
that for people at the
back of the auditorium,

00:43:11.716 --> 00:43:13.970
she's probably a little green
speck, sort of that big.

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.342
No offense.

00:43:15.342 --> 00:43:17.300
And it sort of became
about sort of using those

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.800
as kind of chapter headings--

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.590
new changes of thought,
things like that,

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:24.410
where the kind of
flight plan map of her

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.330
emotionally is in that scene.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:27.970
And having that as
a kind of structure.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.320
Very often with
puppetry, you end up sort

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.660
of saying, there's a kind
of visual script of moves

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.664
that you know are the
kind of lines, I guess,

00:43:34.664 --> 00:43:36.080
that the puppet
has to go through.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.341
But how you say them, in
what temperature, in what--

00:43:38.341 --> 00:43:39.340
AUDREY BRISSON: Dynamic.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.930
TOBY OLIE: Emotion, what
frequency-- yeah, dynamic--

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.000
is sort of always up for grabs.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.870
I suppose I'm always
keen, and these guys

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.995
do it amazingly-- all the
puppeteers on "Pinocchio"

00:43:47.995 --> 00:43:51.367
do it amazingly-- of not
filling in any intentional gaps.

00:43:51.367 --> 00:43:53.700
Because pauses are really
clear, as you would have seen.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.370
You know, if she
looks at something,

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:56.650
there's a kind of
little moment for you

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:58.566
all to clock that she's
looking, or maybe make

00:43:58.566 --> 00:44:00.030
sense of what she thinks of it.

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.577
And actually, with puppetry,
all those tiny gaps--

00:44:02.577 --> 00:44:04.910
the more you do something,
those tiny gaps feel massive.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.650
You feel like you're kind
of giving dead air time.

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:10.220
And so very often, puppets
start to go quite hyper,

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.100
or kind of overact, because
other bits start to tune in.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.540
And there's a real discipline
in going, actually,

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.790
those pauses or little kind
of moments where you just

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.920
see breath, are all
there for the audience

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.380
to kind of read in and apply
understanding and movement

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.650
and meaning.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:24.649
And if they're
taken away, you're

00:44:24.649 --> 00:44:26.690
kind of bombarding the
audience with information.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.430
So it feels like quite
a good discipline

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.490
to kind of keep
that sense of play,

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.430
whilst having a sort
of outside perspective

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:36.920
on what you guys would be
thinking of what they're doing.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.260
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.510
TOBY OLIE: It's a weird thing.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.402
When you're a puppeteer, you
are actor and your own director

00:44:41.402 --> 00:44:42.110
at the same time.

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:44.401
You have to sort of develop
your own outside eye, which

00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:46.812
is a strange thing, but
a really satisfying thing

00:44:46.812 --> 00:44:47.520
when it kicks in.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.170
AUDREY BRISSON: It
really is, especially

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:49.910
when you have someone
like Toby here,

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:54.120
who is an amazing director,
because he knows what he wants.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.200
But he's also very
good at saying,

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.420
when I come with a problem
going, in the early days,

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:03.350
how do I hold her, or how do
I do this particular movement,

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:05.300
because I don't know how
to physically do it--

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.502
and he's like, just work it out.

00:45:07.502 --> 00:45:08.710
TOBY OLIE: Work it out, lazy.

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:10.880
AUDREY BRISSON: No,
but meaning, you're--

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.255
and it's the best way to do it.

00:45:12.255 --> 00:45:13.880
Because we do find
our way of doing it.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:17.170
And he's not going to be very
prescriptive about when she

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:18.840
needs to breathe or turn right.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.000
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.251
AUDREY BRISSON: Then Jiminy
becomes our own character.

00:45:22.251 --> 00:45:23.125
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:45:23.125 --> 00:45:24.810
And ultimately it's
about storytelling.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.020
And Toby is a very
good storyteller.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:30.500
And that's helpful when you're
being directed in puppetry,

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.981
that it's very clearly about
the story, rather than anything

00:45:34.981 --> 00:45:35.480
else.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.410
Because you can get--

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:38.000
I mean, we could do some
amazing tricks with Jiminy.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.560
But it wouldn't help
the story at all.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:39.770
AUDREY BRISSON: It's not-- yeah.

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:40.130
TOBY OLIE: And it's funny.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:41.870
Because in rehearsals
at the beginning,

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:44.180
very often, if Audrey was
like, how would this happen,

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.860
I'd sort of go, well, let's
see, and kind of do it.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.150
And she'd go, God,
how could you do that?

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:48.570
AUDREY BRISSON: Because his
hand is like three times

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:48.880
as big as mine!

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.760
TOBY OLIE: How can you move
the thing-- yeah, that's true.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.534
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:50.534 --> 00:45:52.700
And you'd be like, maybe
it's this, maybe it's that.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.616
You make a suggestion.

00:45:53.616 --> 00:45:56.410
But halfway through rehearsals,
they are masters of it.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:58.180
And I'd go, well,
let me give it a go.

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:58.340
Ahh!

00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:58.700
I don't know.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.490
I don't know anymore.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:45:59.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.550
It is sort of this
weird thing of,

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:07.310
you learn how to work with this
object so kind of tactiley--

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.530
our puppets are more
like musical instruments

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:10.769
than my props.

00:46:10.769 --> 00:46:12.560
Whenever I go into a
new project and people

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.830
want to use puppetry,
I'm always like, solve

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.220
who the puppeteers are, first.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.260
Then you'll know what
the kind of world is.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:21.410
Who are the people that are
invisible in your aesthetic?

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.780
And second of all, think of
them as musical instruments,

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.480
because they're expensive
in man hours to make.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.500
They need stands.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.629
They need fine tuning.

00:46:28.629 --> 00:46:30.170
They need someone
to look after them.

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:32.240
We've got a puppet technician,
full time on the show,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.110
whose job is to just
look after the puppets.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.980
An amazing guy, Will.

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:36.590
Yeah.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:38.480
It's really interesting,
how sort of bespoke,

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.354
and the kind of relationship
the kind of bond

00:46:40.354 --> 00:46:41.570
you have with this object.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.830
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:45.109
AUDIENCE: Does anyone else?

00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.650
AUDIENCE: Me.

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:46.970
AUDIENCE: OK, here.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.640
Can you talk to us
a little bit more

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:53.690
about how you guys work
together so closely over such

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:55.580
a long period of time?

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.890
There can't be many
other jobs where

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:01.220
you're so stuck to
someone else for so long.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.960
So I'm really curious as to--

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.170
is that just part of
being a puppeteer?

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:07.580
Or do you have to do specific
exercises to get used

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.940
to one another's movements?

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.080
JAMES CHARLTON: I think--

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.220
I'll take this
one, just quickly.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:13.690
AUDREY BRISSON: Please do.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:15.380
JAMES CHARLTON: It's
just in my head.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.910
It's different
with every puppet.

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:19.370
And it's different
with every job.

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:23.000
And with every single person
that you puppeteer with.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.332
Ultimately, everyone's
got the same goal,

00:47:26.332 --> 00:47:27.540
which is always really great.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.960
And I think in any type
of business, crossover

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.530
anywhere, if everyone's got
the same goal and same aim,

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.905
you're usually going to
be on the same track.

00:47:35.905 --> 00:47:38.030
The difficulty is always
working with other people,

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:41.960
because everyone has different
needs, even though you're

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.050
aiming for the same thing.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:46.320
But I feel like, especially
with our relationship,

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.460
it's about understanding
who we are as people first.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.340
And then making sure
that that serves the goal

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.530
at the end of the day.

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.330
Sometimes we're
selfless with that.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:57.220
Yourself, certainly.

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.610
And myself.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:01.250
It's about letting go of
who you are and going, OK,

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.250
we can put that aside.

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:06.250
And let's just get
on with the job.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.160
But it can be difficult.
It can be difficult.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.712
But I feel like creating a
good relationship between us

00:48:10.712 --> 00:48:12.170
means that, when
we go on stage, we

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:13.520
don't have to worry about that.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.610
We can just do the job.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:17.070
And if we've got concerns,
we can speak to each other.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.350
There's no problems there.

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:21.380
Being very open and honest
about stuff is really important,

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:22.160
I think.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.701
AUDREY BRISSON: And, you know,
I think we are very fortunate,

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:26.570
because when you
see, potentially,

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:34.070
other people who are not in such
a fortunate relationship, no--

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.350
I think, James and I,
I'm very fortunate.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:37.670
So thank you very much.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:40.640
I can be a little
bit like Jiminy.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.170
I can be a bit angsty
and stressed and nervous.

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.850
I'm going to use different words
to say exactly the same thing.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:53.330
Whereas James is very good at
calming situations, and being

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:54.870
laid back in a way.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:57.320
And I think that's what works.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.580
There are moments on stage when
it's not physically dangerous.

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.100
But I'm in a slightly
precarious position.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:08.390
And people quite
often tell me, when

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:11.060
after seeing the show,
how much they notice

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.737
James being focused on me.

00:49:13.737 --> 00:49:15.320
I mean, of course,
he's on the puppet.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.720
But you can feel
that he's there.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.740
He protects me.

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.262
He's aware.

00:49:20.262 --> 00:49:20.762
No.

00:49:20.762 --> 00:49:21.740
You do!

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:22.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.210
But people have noticed.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.800
And there are moments when
he's just aware that maybe--

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.050
JAMES CHARLTON: And then there's
times when I want to push you.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.340
AUDREY BRISSON: Oh yes.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.181
Yes, he does.

00:49:30.181 --> 00:49:30.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.930
JAMES CHARLTON: And
it's dangerous thinking.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:35.390
AUDREY BRISSON: So we
are very fortunate.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:37.390
Because we could
hate each other.

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:40.471
And I guess it's like any job.

00:49:40.471 --> 00:49:40.970
Yeah.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:41.600
Absolutely.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.580
So it is very fortunate.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.290
But it's like any acting job.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:47.800
Very, very, very
early on, on day one,

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.620
the creatives are going
to be working hard

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.250
at making you feel
comfortable with each other.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.280
We are literally all over
each other on day one.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.280
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:57.780
AUDREY BRISSON:
The hands on face.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.405
JAMES CHARLTON: But
also, it comes down

00:49:59.405 --> 00:50:02.837
to Toby's choice of
puppeteers and team.

00:50:02.837 --> 00:50:04.420
Because you know
everybody personally.

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.211
And like you said, you
want the experience.

00:50:06.211 --> 00:50:09.320
But also, Toby knows everyone
personally, in a personal way,

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.450
as either friends
or as colleagues.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:13.680
He knows the type of
temperament of people.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.440
So I'm sure in the back of his
head, I can't speak for him,

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.460
but there is a moment where
he goes-- that will work.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.090
That will work.

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:20.881
And that will work.

00:50:20.881 --> 00:50:22.450
And not always
will it come to it.

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:23.250
But I imagine, most of the time.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:24.740
AUDREY BRISSON: And also,
as you were saying earlier,

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.540
how you are very consistent.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.100
And I'm not.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.230
It's a good marriage.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:31.105
JAMES CHARLTON: Yeah.

00:50:31.105 --> 00:50:35.140
AUDREY BRISSON: Because then
we find the air around Jiminy,

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:35.640
which--

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:35.910
JAMES CHARLTON: We gel.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:36.840
AUDREY BRISSON: We gel.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.340
JAMES CHARLTON: We gel.

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.215
AUDREY BRISSON: Yeah.

00:50:38.215 --> 00:50:39.464
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:39.464 --> 00:50:40.130
TOBY OLIE: Yeah.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.710
I think it's very often about
kind of relinquishing control

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:44.550
as well, and sort of going,
I trust that the other person

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:45.590
is going to do that.

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.670
So finding the sort of
combinations of teams

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:48.920
for these puppets in the show.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.836
We knew the people who
are operating the heads

00:50:50.836 --> 00:50:53.330
and doing the voices were
cast as those characters.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:59.390
But of the kind of squad of
six, seven puppeteers-- seven,

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:01.022
eight puppeteers--

00:51:01.022 --> 00:51:02.980
it was up for grabs who
was on which character.

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.270
So very much a lot of the
early rehearsals and the puppet

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.811
training, we're sort
of going, right,

00:51:06.811 --> 00:51:08.930
do we put a lot of the
"War Horse" veterans

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:10.520
with the really
experienced person

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.930
who was in "The Lion King"?

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:13.810
Do we put quite a few of
the people who never touched

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:15.351
a puppet before
together, so they all

00:51:15.351 --> 00:51:16.920
have those
realizations together,

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.530
so that nobody is sort of
going, guys, it's like this.

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:20.170
And actually--

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:21.044
AUDREY BRISSON: Ohhh.

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:21.941
TOBY OLIE: Ohhh.

00:51:21.941 --> 00:51:22.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.290
JAMES CHARLTON:
That's how it works.

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:26.415
TOBY OLIE: And with these
two, it was exactly that.

00:51:26.415 --> 00:51:28.850
I was like, Audrey is
already great at Jiminy.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:30.380
Has a lot of self-doubt.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.240
Will be absolutely fantastic.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.630
James is a kind of--
is just so organized

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:38.750
and self-critical
and consistent,

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.580
that actually the two
of them together are

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.250
kind of the yin to
each other's yang.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.890
And so kind of watching
Jiminy kind of--

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.770
come together and
kind of form and

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:50.530
throughout that whole
process was just amazing.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:52.530
AUDIENCE: Give Toby a
massive round of applause.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:53.730
Thank you.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:56.480
[APPLAUSE]
