00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,740
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,140
N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. E. R.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,260
Okay. Let's see. Hello? Hello.
Hi, is this Aero Morris?

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,730
I think it's me. Hello. This is
Chad from, uh, from radio lab.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,710
Hi. Thank you for your very,

6
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:25,190
very nice but somewhat disturbing email,

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,610
but disturbed you in the email.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,150
The term truth fascist

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,520
[inaudible]

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,780
you called Aaron Cloris a truth
fascist. Where were you thinking? I was,

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,320
I was trying to, I wrote him an email
to try and get him to come talk to us.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,760
And I don't know why you use that

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,420
is a truth fascist that was
meant and lovingly I should say,

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,340
ahh, wasn't exactly the right choice of
words. Fundamentalist. Oh, I like it.

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,030
The really what I meant is it like,
this is a guy who's always trying,

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,520
you get to the bottom of things. I
mean, all these documentaries, uh,

17
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,580
thin blue line. Well,

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,200
you've got a guy off death row
actually in a thin blue line.

19
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:07,490
He made the fog of war,
right? Vernon, Florida. Yeah.

20
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,980
But I contacted him because you know,

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,550
I'd recently seen him give this talk
about this one investigation of his.

22
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,110
The for me is like the purest example of
the thing that drives him think it's in

23
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,850
all of his films, this desire, relent,

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,970
lis desire to figure things
out, to get to truth,

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,780
and it all starts with a photograph.

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,650
One of the very, very
first photographs of war,

27
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,530
1855 which war?

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,330
This is the Crimean war
that involved Great Britain,

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,350
France, Russia, the Ottoman Empire,

30
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,630
and believe it or not, Sardinia,

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,990
the fighting took place in what
is now basically the Ukraine.

32
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:50,100
The Russians were on one side.

33
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,830
Everybody else on the other
half a million people died.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,910
It was incredibly brutal.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,120
And there's this photograph titled
The Valley of the shadow of death.

36
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,340
It's black and white.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,620
It shows a dirt road cutting
through this landscape.

38
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,120
Just one dirt

39
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,013
road

40
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,860
between two hills. There's nobody in
the photograph, no birds, no trees,

41
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,060
no people. There's really nothing living
in the photograph, not even grass,

42
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,920
nothing. What is, you stare at
this road a little more closely.

43
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:29,900
You realize why nothing is living in
this photograph because this road is

44
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:34,670
littered with Canon
cannonballs everywhere.

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,540
As soon as you notice them
photographs springs to life,

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,600
you imagine this fuselage of artillery
fire raining down on this landscape.

47
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,920
This is one really fascinating thing
about photography. It's a time machine.

48
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,190
There's a physical connection between
that photograph and world cause you're

49
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,230
holding this piece of film that was
literally ripped right out of that world.

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,980
But the context is God and
more importantly in this case,

51
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,900
you don't even know if that
picture is true. What do you mean?

52
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,910
It turns out that this
photograph is one of a pair.

53
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,370
There is a second photograph exactly
the same as the first photograph,

54
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,210
exact same camera position,
but in this other photograph,

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,920
the cannon balls that
were on the road are gone.

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,673
Yeah.

57
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,680
So one has cannibals on the road and
one has cannon balls not on the road,

58
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,030
but otherwise they're completely
identical. Yes. He thought that's weird.

59
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,380
Let me look into that.

60
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,380
And there was a passage in any ends
up reading this essay by Susan Sontag.

61
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,550
Where is she talks about these photographs
as though it's just obvious what was

62
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:57,240
going on. And he was like, ah, that word.

63
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,790
Well I don't like the word obvious.

64
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,790
Susan Sontag was basically arguing
that the guy who took the picture,

65
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:07,440
Roger Fenton, came to an empty road,
put the cannonballs on the road.

66
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:11,590
He staged it. Yes, it's
obvious, but that word,

67
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,870
nothing is so obvious that it's obvious.

68
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,770
And so I started investigating

69
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:19,500
[inaudible]

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,590
and so we began a
ludicrous, obsessive dug it,

71
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,750
but kind of sublime pursuit
of this slippery little
fact that actually inspired

72
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:31,020
this whole hour. So today on radio lab,

73
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,550
we are going to wrestle with a series
of seemingly simple facts. Yup.

74
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,040
Turn out to raise complicated
questions like what is truth?

75
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,960
Is it just a pile of facts? And how
much does the fact of the matter matter?

76
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,490
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich back to Aero Morris.

77
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,450
I track it down.

78
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,410
Fenton's letters from the Crimea journals,

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,900
written records of soldiers who
were in that area given time.

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,073
Didn't find much.

81
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,250
I interviewed five historians who
ordered the photograph in one way thing.

82
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:11,050
Yes, it's obvious he posed the pictures
who, this is a bit of a surprise order.

83
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,270
The photographs in the opposite way.

84
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,680
Really they told them it is actually
very possible that Fenton saw the

85
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,740
cannonballs, took the picture
and then soldiers came along,

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,090
took the cannibals off the road to recycle
them so they could fire them back at

87
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:29,800
the rushes. Exactly. Was that
kind of recycling common practice?

88
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,611
Yes, indeed.

89
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:35,110
It was actually see at a tie to historian
saying you faked it to saying he

90
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:39,460
didn't and the fifth Daybreaker
jumped back and forth.

91
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,590
I like the, you call it, tried to call
him the tie that he didn't break the tie.

92
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,200
Well, of course none of none of
these things is subject though.

93
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:51,100
Vote truth isn't something
that you vote on at this point.

94
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,840
He says he was feeling a very familiar
irritation start. You know what?

95
00:05:55,841 --> 00:06:00,600
Forget historical. What if I
could from the photograph itself,

96
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:05,601
the very photograph itself determine
which photograph came first from just the

97
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:09,320
photo. So I started a
being the photograph,

98
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,760
just sort of superimposing them on
each other and flipping back and forth.

99
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,050
A, B, B, a, B, B, a,

100
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,440
etc. Etc. Nothing in any
things. I know what I can do.

101
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:26,180
I can start studying the
shadows, which meant, yeah,

102
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,890
let's go to the Crimea. Are you serious?

103
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,993
Yeah.

104
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,140
His reasoning was I can't study the
shadows unless I knew the exact direction

105
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:41,141
the camera was pointing on that day in
1855 which means I need to find the exact

106
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,800
spot where Fenton stood and I had
terrible trouble finding this place.

107
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,810
Is it marked? No.

108
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,370
All of the guides kept taking me
to the charge of the light brigade.

109
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,800
That's site where Tennyson wrote about
the valley of death. No, no, no. Noon.

110
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,440
Not The valley of death.
The Valley of the shadow.

111
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,630
Finally, a guide named
Olga. She was fabulous.

112
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,680
Helps them locate this spot. It's
completely desolate, undeveloped,

113
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,440
still after 150 years
with some trial and error,

114
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:19,130
he's able to figure out that Fenton was
facing north when he took those photos

115
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,670
and then he goes off to the
Crimean war museum and asks them,

116
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,390
could I borrow some cannon balls? Oh Man.

117
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,390
I take the cannon ball,
take it out to the valley.

118
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:32,630
Of the shadow of death and I photograph
it at different times of the day,

119
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:35,930
hoping that he'd be able to see subtle
differences in the shadows cast by those

120
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,360
cannonballs that could help them order
the photos, but nothing, nothing.

121
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,190
There was endless questions
about cloud cover,

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,020
whether you could even measure the
shadows on these photographs. In fact,

123
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:55,370
he now suspects that the shadows in those
old pictures may not have been shadows

124
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:55,910
at all,

125
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,500
but just artifacts of how the
prints were made and on and on.

126
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,130
So was the trip useful
at all? Not so much.

127
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,923
How many,

128
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,000
how many days did you spend photographing
and examining the photographs of

129
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,240
cannon balls on the road? I
was there for about a week

130
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,110
and then he went home with
no answer to his question,

131
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,030
only that continuing irritation,
but he was like, no, no,

132
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,300
not done yet. Look, when you investigate
anything, I don't care what it is,

133
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:35,301
whether it's a Fenton photograph or Ahboo
grave or the mirror of a Dallas police

134
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:39,990
officer. Yes. Complications,

135
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:44,400
result thinking causes
complications. I'm sorry,

136
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,120
but it's part of that process that we go
through of trying to figure out what's

137
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:54,690
out there in the world,
what really happened.

138
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:56,730
Uh,

139
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,190
this is about truth,

140
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,030
[inaudible]

141
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,360
absolute truth

142
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,860
and the

143
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,240
pursuit of truth properly considered
shouldn't have stopped short of insanity.

144
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,443
Okay.

145
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,303
So yes,

146
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,490
the photographs worried me that I
might not be able to resolve it to my

147
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:18,760
satisfaction,

148
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,413
but then

149
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,620
he's at a party and he
bumps into a friend of his,

150
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,740
a guy by the name of Dennis
Purcell, who is very,

151
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:32,270
very good with Photoshop when he
called them up. Hello? Turns out, well,

152
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,240
I'm an optical engineer, so he's not
just good at Photoshop. He actually,

153
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,960
he builds high tech cameras. In any case,

154
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,560
they were talking at this party
and the Fenton picture came up.

155
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,660
Aerial told him he had this problem of
wondering which came first and said,

156
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,530
could you take a look at these?
Dennis takes the pictures home,

157
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:52,490
puts them in his computer.

158
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,910
Then I immediately started
to compare them right away.

159
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:59,570
He starts noticing differences
between the two. The light changed.

160
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,820
The weather was different shadows,

161
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,820
but he comes to pretty much the same
conclusion as Arrow that those things

162
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,270
ultimately don't help. So he just
starts flipping between the photos,

163
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,770
flipping the back and forth,

164
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,730
back and forth between the two photographs
on the road, flip off the road,

165
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,950
flip on the road, flip off the road,

166
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,400
flip it's doing this for hours
off the road, flip on the road,

167
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,170
and then he sees it. The
rocks on the left hand side,

168
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,720
this little group of
pebbles up on the left bank.

169
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,800
Every time you flip back and forth, flip,
flip, those little rocks popped out.

170
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,930
They moved just a little
bit and when he zoomed in,

171
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:39,140
he could see that there were five
of them. Fred, George Oswald,

172
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:41,330
Lionel and Marmaduke, we named them. Yes,

173
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,910
these five guys shifted
from one photo to the next.

174
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,580
And here's the key in the
picture where the road was empty,

175
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:51,790
they were a little bit higher on the
hill when the road was full of cannibals.

176
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,000
This little rock shift down maybe
eight inches or nine inches.

177
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,080
And from the direction of that movement,

178
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,960
you can order the photographs.
It's basically like this,

179
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,090
you could say some rocks
fell down the hill.

180
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,290
They went from up on the hill
to down, up goes before down.

181
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,740
And if the up photo is the empty road
and the down photo is the road full of

182
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,593
cannonballs.

183
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,620
Well then the one with the cannon balls
on the road was the second picture.

184
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,210
Imagine the scene. Fenton
comes upon an empty road,

185
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,110
but he sees Canam malls
on the hill. So he and

186
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:32,150
whoever was helping him would have walked
along the sides of the road and lifted

187
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:37,950
up cannon balls, move them on
to the road. In that process,

188
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,540
they would have invariably
knocked into rocks

189
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,530
and rocks don't fall up hill. They
only fold down downhill. It's gravity.

190
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,890
So case closed. This is,
this has been resolved. Yeah.

191
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,690
Susan Sontag was right for the
wrong reasons, but she was right.

192
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:04,430
Fenton staged the photograph.

193
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,770
So in addition to being one of
the first photographs of war,

194
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:09,680
this is one of the
first photographic lies.

195
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,350
[inaudible].

196
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,370
I guess he just figured it was a
better photo. Yeah, or you could say

197
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,050
fitting was a coward.

198
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,620
Maybe he didn't want to get too
close to the actual fighting,

199
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:25,450
so he'd put the cannon balls on the road
to make it look a lot more dangerous

200
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:26,980
than it would have otherwise,

201
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,350
or maybe he was after some
kind of emotional truth.

202
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,440
That's what Dennis Purcell thinks.
It's obvious why he did it.

203
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,250
Here's that word again to make it look
the way it felt to put those cannonballs

204
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,670
on the road is how you
felt when you were there.

205
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,010
Which case he would argue
that the second photo,

206
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:47,040
the one he posed is more
authentic than the first,

207
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,120
but forget all of that. Who in hell
knows what Fenton was thinking?

208
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,510
I really don't know
what his motivation was,

209
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,760
but isn't that kind of the
question at the end of the day,

210
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,000
do I really care whether he put the
cannon balls on the road or not? Well,

211
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,770
I hope you do. If you do, don't you?

212
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,673
Okay.

213
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,170
I do and I don't really, we didn't.
Why would you go through all this then?

214
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,570
I guess this is what I take from it.

215
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,473
Mm.

216
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,670
In flipping back and forth between
those two photographs, flip,

217
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,830
he says, you see the rocks move, flip.
And when you see the rocks move flip,

218
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,280
you imagine feet kicking those rocks
and when you imagine feet kicking those

219
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:40,530
rocks flip, you feel

220
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,090
the soldiers walking like really feel it.

221
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,300
You feel them hitting into the rocks.

222
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,650
You feel on some deep sense for me,

223
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:59,510
the reality of that scene in a way
that I would not have felt otherwise.

224
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,790
It's almost as if you've walked
through a pinhole camera into the past

225
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,290
[inaudible]

226
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,630
that world in which the photograph,

227
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,660
that strange temporal evanescent
world in which we live is gone.

228
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,600
But if you can step
between these photographs,

229
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,050
you're permitted a brief trespass into
something that you thought was lost. Yes.

230
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,090
My father died when I was two years old

231
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,920
and perhaps the deepest one of
the deepest mysteries of my life.

232
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,190
Who was he

233
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,040
air all these photographs around the house

234
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,760
[inaudible] I was very, very
young. I have no memories of him.

235
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,763
There's a mystery

236
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,380
about this man who is central
to my life in so many ways,

237
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,670
but who I don't know

238
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,100
and who I never will know.

239
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,720
[inaudible]

240
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,780
Errol Morris, his latest book
is called a wilderness of error.

241
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,900
This story was taken from
his book believing is seeing.

242

I also want to thank IRA glass for
helping us to connect with them.

Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

279
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:58,330
This is Radiolab and today we've
been investigating the truth,

280
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,500
fact of the matter and this
next segment to set it up.

281
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,820
I guess all I really want to say is it
sometimes getting to the fact of the

282
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:10,510
matter, a fact of the matter,
the way Arrow just did.

283
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,270
That can be tricky. Yeah.

284
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,870
You end up finding things that you didn't
expect that are way more complicated

285
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:19,900
than you expected. The story
begins with our producer,

286
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,770
Pat Walters started for him when he
was talking with an ex CIA agent.

287
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:28,140
So maybe you've taken me to,
was this the summer of 1981

288
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,910
okay.

289
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,910
In the summer of 1981 I was
being transferred from one
overseas post to another.

290
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,710
This is a pro bono and
I'm a retired CIA officer.

291
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,040
But in 1981 Merle was still
at the CIA and he was posted

292
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,610
in the sticks out in the boonies somewhere
in Southeast Asia. And, and, and why,

293
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:51,680
why were you, oh, well
that's, yeah, I had a,

294
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,000
I had a little disagreement with my, uh,

295
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:00,010
previous chief and I ended
up in a, in this remote,

296
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:02,950
a jungle backwater, I guess
is the best way to phrase it.

297
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,810
Can you say what country
you in? Um, I'd rather not.

298
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,860
Oh,

299
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,470
in any case, as much as Merle
did not want to be there,

300
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,580
it turned out that this little backwater
was ground zero for what was about to

301
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:19,400
become one of the strangest
stories of the Cold War,

302
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,680
just to set the scene.
The story happens in Laos,

303
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:26,740
which is that kind of narrow country
between Vietnam and Thailand.

304
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,660
And the time is a few years after
the Vietnam War, right after the war,

305
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,560
U s army left pulled out all of
our troops. And once we were gone,

306
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:37,480
the communist basically
took over the region,

307
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:41,350
the communist being the Vietcong and
their allies and loudest the path at Lao

308
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,070
[inaudible] Chateau g,

309
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,520
it was may of 1975 all of a sudden they'd
be a con that La had infiltrated and

310
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:53,800
they were all over our village. And
I knew that the American Tetlock,

311
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,160
this is Ang Yang. Robert and I
spoke with him and his niece,

312
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,360
Kalia translated for us
[inaudible] lives in Minneapolis,

313
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:06,190
but in 1975 he lived in a tiny village
in the mountains of Laos [inaudible].

314
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,390
It's part of a tribe called the man and
ink says as soon as the Americans left

315
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,750
Lao and Vietnamese soldiers
showed up in his village,

316
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,860
there was a hundred of them.

317
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:18,520
They came in cars and in a way you
could say they were out for a day,

318
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,710
they told because during Vietnam war,

319
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,180
thousands of Mong soldiers had fought on
our side and as soon as we were out of

320
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:29,830
the picture, that's when
the killing started. Thanks.

321
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,710
As it began with isolated attacks,

322
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,490
John Mondo had the [inaudible] par
villagers started getting killed in random

323
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,510
field [inaudible] like did they just
find one of their neighbors shot dead in

324
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:44,511
his rice patty one day or a woman would
go fetch water and never come back.

325
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,140
Yellow car show John Name,
which are partial far long. It

326
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,880
was a village and I know
the name of the village.

327
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,320
I know the name of the village chief,

328
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,450
the path that Lao, which again
is the communist army in Laos,

329
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:57,480
had gotten suspicious that these
villagers may have been hiding guns in the

330
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:01,860
jungle like plotting to rebel
against the government to one day.

331
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,500
The fact that law went over and
he slaughtered the whole village.

332
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,180
That's when we knew that the laws of
humanity had been, had been terminated

333
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,090
and not long after that in his family,

334
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,870
along with thousands of other mung
fled their villages when to hiding the

335
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:23,630
jungle. This is where things stood
when Moreau got his assignment and a,

336
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,740
before he left DC and flew over to Asia.

337
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,770
I stopped in our headquarters and while
I was there I was brief by our desk

338
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:34,200
officer who told him about what
was happening. The communist raids,

339
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:35,190
the among the fleeing,

340
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,420
but then the desk officer
said something kind of odd.

341
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,940
There had been these reports
from refugees, refugees
like Ang about this yellow,

342
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,060
these yellow droplets
falling from the air.

343
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,990
[inaudible]

344
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,150
PBS went out to the camps and interviewed
some of the refugees. Crab who?

345
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,200
Oh area.

346
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,390
I said this yellow stuff that was falling
out of the sky was coming from planes.

347
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,740
We only saw the powders free from yet.
Some refugees talked about powder,

348
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,800
some talked about the liquid,
a yellow miss sometimes,

349
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,080
but they all said whatever
this was. When it landed,

350
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:14,980
it mean people violently ill and they all
talked about how after this stuff fell

351
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:19,240
from the sky, when did powder reach
the ground? It's dark on everything,

352
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,300
but behind these yellow spots,
chip are done now, you know,

353
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,320
yellow drops everywhere
all over the landscape.

354
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,210
Ang remembers. The first time he saw it,

355
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,030
she was hiding in the woods somewhere and
somebody came running to him and said,

356
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,280
you have to come and
see this yellow stuff.

357
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:36,720
Just fell on a village up on the hill,

358
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,610
ran up the hill and sort of crashed
out of the forest and just stopped

359
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,120
[inaudible]

360
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,870
right there at the edge of the
village, a glued Lucia toe.

361
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:48,520
I learned let p electronic too.

362
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:53,050
I saw a dead cow and two dead pigs and
several dead chicken and all the people

363
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,050
who've been exposed that they, they
were all having stomach trouble.

364
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,300
Ink says people were doubled over
covering their stomach, riding in pain,

365
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,360
throwing up some, throwing up blood. Yet

366
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,620
[inaudible] people began to suffer from
everything from diarrhea to headaches,

367
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,693
rashes.

368
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,640
There was a person,

369
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:13,750
and I have the photo right here am my
keeping her capa ma who had been exposed

370
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,610
and her eyes, her eyes were destroyed,
entire leap and many people ang says,

371
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,250
didn't recover. What I saw was people
dying, they wouldn't get better.

372
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,093
They would die.

373
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,980
Marel says the thought in CIA was that
this might be some kind of chemical

374
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:32,690
weapon. Right? Did it have a name at
that point? Yellow rain, yellow rain.

375
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,610
By the time Marel got to Southeast Asia,
hundreds of these reports had come in.

376
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,240
Hundreds and several thousand people
had been reported killed by this stuff.

377
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,670
But you know, in those kinds of
situations and in Southeast Asia general,

378
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,190
you know, are tons of rumors,

379
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,910
but you have to be careful of what you
believe and what you don't believe.

380
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,200
And you have to rely on evidence,

381
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:54,650
which it just didn't have
no until all of a sudden

382
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:56,600
[inaudible]

383
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,050
they did just a few months after Maura
got there and they started getting these

384
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:03,890
reports that refugees and
collected samples off of leaves.

385
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,230
Some refugees had shown up with leaves
covered in these yellow spots there.

386
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,390
Here's a closeup. This is Matt Messel son.

387
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:14,360
He's a Harvard chemists and
chemical weapons expert.

388
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:17,030
The U S government asks to
help examine these samples.

389
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,050
I went up and visited him in his office
and Cambridge. Here's some old leaves.

390
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,840
These are only leaves rug back.
These are all dried out. No,

391
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,030
the leaves are small, black, brittle,

392
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,990
which only makes the spots stand out
even more because they're this incredible

393
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:33,800
bright yellow. They're tiny. They're,
they're two or three millimeters across.

394
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,341
And Matt says,

395
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:37,520
when scientists put these leaves under a
microscope and looked inside the yellow

396
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:42,140
spots, they saw that the spots had a
very high content of toxin called t two

397
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,490
which is a poison. And while
T2 does grow in nature,

398
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,270
the concentrations that they found in
these spots was way too high to have

399
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:53,104
occurred naturally,

400
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,790
which demonstrated that this
was, you know, in fact a, a,

401
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,160
a new type of a chemical weapon.

402
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,620
We now have physical evidence.

403
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,590
This is secretary of State
Alexander Haig in the fall of 1981

404
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,760
which has been analyzed and found to
contain abnormally high levels of potent

405
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,450
mycotoxins, poisonous substances.

406
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,470
The United States said today it has
evidence that chemical warfare has been

407
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:23,320
waged and parts of Southeast Asia,

408
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,150
the US obtained a test
sample of twigs and leaves.

409
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,570
Chemical analysis found high
levels of three toxic chemicals.

410
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,240
The news of this poison, this yellow
rain became an instant political crisis.

411
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,720
Refugees and camps along the Thai border
have been telling for years have a

412
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:40,560
yellow rain or rain that was followed
in minutes by vomiting, bleeding,

413
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,280
and death.

414
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,240
Because everybody knew the
Lao and Vietnamese armies
were not capable of making

415
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:49,800
this stuff. No Vietnam could
not even make their own rifles.

416
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,480
They were pretty backward in that sense,

417
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,350
which really left only one likely suspect
circumstantial evidence points to the

418
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:59,850
Russians. The Soviet Union may be engaging
in biological warfare. The Soviets,

419
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,440
of course denied. They were involved.

420
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,140
Soviets said it was a
slanderous accusation,

421
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,900
but the US government did not
believe them. Soviet Union,

422
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,060
the allies are violating the Geneva
Protocol of 1925 and in the summer of 1982

423
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:12,940
in a speech,

424
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,190
the UN president Reagan officially
accused the Soviet Union of supplying and

425
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:19,350
using chemical weapons in Southeast Asia.

426
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,820
There is conclusive evidence the Soviet
government has provided toxins for you,

427
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,280
Shun Laos and Cambodia. Three years later,

428
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:29,820
Congress passed legislation authorizing
the production of a chemical bomb called

429
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,710
the big guy, a 500 pound bomb,

430
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:34,770
and it's been to be carried on high
performance aircraft and within two years,

431
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,540
the factory in Penn Bluff, Arkansas,

432
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,380
begin churning out thousands of
bounds designed to carry Saron gas.

433
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,733
Why?

434
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,600
This would be the first time the United
States had manufactured a chemical

435
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:53,820
weapon in nearly 20 years.

436
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,690
All this in effect
because of the yellow rain

437
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,300
[inaudible]

438
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,630
but before we jump ahead in the,

439
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,640
in November of 1982 there were two
days of press briefings by the State

440
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,630
Department, and this is where
things really start to get weird.

441
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,480
The State Department had gotten
everybody together to explain it.

442
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:19,960
Some British scientists had looked at
the spots and in addition to the poison,

443
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,000
they found something else.

444
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,100
All the samples had a very high
content of pollen from flowers,

445
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,840
which initially didn't make any
sense like why would pollen be toxic?

446
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,950
But eventually the government officials
came to this kind of terrifying

447
00:27:35,951 --> 00:27:38,590
conclusion that in fact, this was a very,

448
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,380
very clever communist mixture.

449
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,670
Somehow the Russians had found a way to
use pollen as a vector to transmit this

450
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:49,960
toxin. If it falls right on your skin,
it would intoxicate you poison you.

451
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,230
But if these drops should
fall on a leaf or a rock,

452
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,850
then the wind would read, disperse these

453
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,223
Poland Greens,

454
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,610
which we've just the right diameter to
penetrate to the depths of [inaudible]

455
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,150
the lungs, thereby making
it a more deadly weapon.

456
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,450
[inaudible]

457
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,230
that remembers hearing that and thinking
that just seemed completely bonkers to

458
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,600
me. I knew a lot about chemical weapons.

459
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,790
You'd never heard of anything
like that before? No.

460
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,700
So he sent some of these samples
around to other scientists.

461
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:21,550
He knew in one afternoon he's sitting
in his lab and he gets a call.

462
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,880
I remember the phone call. This is
the guy who called and Tom Sealy.

463
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:29,320
I'm a professor in the department of
Neurobiology and behavior at Cornell

464
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,140
University. Matt pick up the
phone. Tom said to him, Hey,

465
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,830
I analyzed the samples you
sent me and then he said,

466
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,030
the State Department
explanation is not parsimonious.

467
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,550
Meaning meaning this yellow stuff is
not a chemical weapon that he paused.

468
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,810
He said it's be,

469
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:50,260
and then he used a four letter word and
if we can use that word because that all

470
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:54,640
right. Yeah. You said
it was beaten. What? BC,

471
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,460
what we call fecal spot of honeybee.

472
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,473
You tell

473
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,940
that was their idea. Yeah. They
were like, look, here's the thing.

474
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,510
Every winter bees kind of
hibernate during the winter.

475
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,300
There are no flowers and there
is no Paula, there's no nectar.

476
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,380
There's nothing for the bees to go out
and collect so that they stay inside and

477
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:15,360
confined to their hives all
winter feeding their babies,

478
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,970
fattening up the new worker
bees for the next season.

479
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,310
It's since they're very fastidious,
they do not defecate in their nests.

480
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,450
They don't poop all winter. Right? So
the becoming immensely constipated.

481
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,870
And then when the first warm days,

482
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,480
they all fly out on mass,

483
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,380
do like a hundred feet off
the ground and defecate

484
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,650
all at the same. It is called the
cleansing flight in anybody who cultures,

485
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:49,150
bees, noses. And if you get caught
beneath the situation, Tom says,

486
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,930
if feels like light raindrops hitting
your arms, hitting your forehead.

487
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,320
So this was their theory that the
yellow rain was not a chemical weapon.

488
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,180
It was just B droppings. They published
this and the government was like,

489
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,643
seriously,

490
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,030
even a bunch of prestigious scientists
came forward and said that it was an

491
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:10,450
absurd explanation. Kind of
crazy and embarrassing a,

492
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,300
let's not forget that this rain was
toxic and be honeybees and southeast Asia

493
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,730
don't even hibernate. There is no winter
in Southeast Asia. It's the tropics.

494
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:23,140
So Southeast Asian bees
never get constipated and
they never do the big poop.

495
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,510
Those Eric, good objections. No, Matt
and Tom Counter by going to Thailand.

496
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,140
12 and I flew out there and they go into
the jungle plants and beehives and one

497
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:35,440
day they're staring up at a high
and in the flesh they see it happen.

498
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,270
The bees shoot up into the sky

499
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,920
and within a minute or two after that

500
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,340
we started to get rained upon by the beef
ECS. So to tell the government, sorry,

501
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,630
we think it happens here too. Wait,
there's only half of it. I mean,

502
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,040
what about the toxic part? The whole
idea that these bees are pooping poison.

503
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,600
That is a hard one. But when
Matt and Tom were in Thailand,

504
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,680
some labs had started retesting those
original samples because you see the

505
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:08,550
poison had been detected by one particular
lab in Minnesota at the beginning,

506
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,530
but now that these yellow
spots were such a big deal,

507
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:14,550
other labs all over the world
began to retest them and

508
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,460
they couldn't find anything. The
British never found the trees.

509
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:25,230
The Swedes never found a trace. The Way
Matt sees it, the analyses were wrong.

510
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,400
He thinks that lab,

511
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,150
the lab in Minnesota that had been doing
this work inadvertently contaminated

512
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:33,210
the pollen because this lab did
lots of other work with Mycotoxins,

513
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,370
large quantities of these toxins.

514
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,660
The government obviously wanted to be
sure they did their own retests of the

515
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:42,120
samples. They didn't find anything.

516
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,680
They sent a team to Southeast Asia to
verify the bees do the poop shower thing

517
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,120
and they do,

518
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,470
and my friend, it's a good friend,
Palm Tet, who was part of that team,

519
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,330
told me that in the bar at the end of
this multi-day excursion, off the record,

520
00:31:57,331 --> 00:31:58,560
one of the gentlemen said, well,

521
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:03,420
I guess we owed the Soviets and apology
on this one. Which hasn't ever happened.

522
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,230
In fact, yellow rain is still,

523
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,740
that's moral again in the U S Army
Chemical Corps manual is, you know,

524
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:14,730
one of the possible weapons that
might be used. Oh really? Yeah,

525
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:16,470
it's still there. It's still there.

526
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,200
I have a, I have a clarifying question
before I interpreted that. So,

527
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:24,320
so they found toxins initially and then
when they looked again at those samples

528
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:28,230
that talk, some were no longer there.
That's right. Okay. I've got like,

529
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:31,340
you know, had the Hathaway [inaudible]

530
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,090
at a certain point in our
conversation with Ang, the Hmong guy,

531
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,570
Robert and I talked to you earlier with
his niece, Kalia translating for him.

532
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,850
We explained that the evidence they'd
been attacked by chemical weapons seemed,

533
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,220
yeah,

534
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,420
I interpret that from my uncle,
a little shaky, heightened and

535
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,680
[inaudible] uh, [inaudible] thanks.

536
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:55,681
Response was if this was just be feces
explains the kids dying the people and

537
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:57,350
the animals dying.

538
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,890
That where there is this yellow
thing where there are no bees, um,

539
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:02,570
whole whole villages die.

540
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,500
We asked Kalia to tell Ang what the
scientists had told us that the Hmong were

541
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:10,350
definitely dying. The mode
were under real attack.

542
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,260
They were being fired at from
airplanes and by soldiers.

543
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:16,710
And but more importantly, even if they
weren't killed by those direct attacks,

544
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:18,900
they were on the run through the jungle.

545
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,560
Mountain nourished and drinking
from contaminated streams.

546
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,470
Diseases like dysentery
in Colorado were rampant.

547
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,070
And the way a lot of people see it is
that they may have miss attributed some of

548
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:34,071
those mysterious deaths to this cloud of
bee poop that looked like it could have

549
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:36,120
been a chemical weapon.

550
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,660
Hi John Jake with hydro Noosa.

551
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,950
The Ang says no Caicos are more
on a weekend in the mirror planet,

552
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,180
not a chance. What I've seen,

553
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:49,930
and there is no inkling in my mind
that those deaths were not caused by

554
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:54,010
starvation dysentery. It was chemicals
that without were killing my people.

555
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,560
So we wanted to know, and
this was an honest question,

556
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,010
did he see something that would
contradict the scientist story?

557
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,880
Did the source of the rain,

558
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:08,650
was there always a plane and then rain
plane and then rain or did sometimes the

559
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:09,910
rain happen without a plane?

560
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,400
[inaudible] Sheila, let's learn

561
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,243
[inaudible] potty now.

562
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,610
We never saw what what they said was
that it was always just being dropped on

563
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:24,990
them and it will always,

564
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:29,340
always be in drop where there are heavy
concentrations of Hmong people that

565
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:33,240
that's what we knew. We don't know
whether there was a plane causing it.

566
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:36,180
It was just a, you just see
the dust or see the, you know,

567
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,660
you have to understand that the planes
are shooting bullets and bombs everyday

568
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,340
all the time and so, so whether it
was a bombing plane or yellow plane,

569
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,200
it was incredibly hard to distinguish

570
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,330
[inaudible] Tamayo everybody runs
when you hear the plane. So mom,

571
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:53,520
people don't watch bombs
coming down. You came out,

572
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:56,160
you sneak your head out and you
watch what happened in the aftermath.

573
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,380
You saw broken trees,
you saw yellow in the,

574
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,180
in the aftermath of what had been bombed

575
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,520
[inaudible] and [inaudible]
on it. I saw with my own eyes,

576
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:09,330
the bee pollen on the leaves
eating two holes with my own eyes.

577
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:13,350
I saw Paul and that could kill the grass,
could kill leaves, could kill trees,

578
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,610
but he himself

579
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,350
clear, oh.

580
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,030
Whether it's the B stuff or
whether it's other stuff,

581
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:23,390
because there was so much
stuff coming down from the sky.

582
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,230
Jean Young and my yard
needs either. Yeah. Them

583
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,010
[inaudible] that she don't pay a
court. Yeah. Which hippo had the

584
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,050
[inaudible] [inaudible]
you know, that, that,

585
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:39,360
that were chemicals being that being
against the mall in the mountains of Laos,

586
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,320
whether this is the chemicals from the
Balm or yellow rain chemicals were being

587
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:48,060
used, it feels to him like this is
a semantic debate and it feels like,

588
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,120
um, there's a sad lack
of justice that, that,

589
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,320
that the word of a man who survived
this thing must be pitted against a

590
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:59,340
professor from Harvard who's read
these accounts. As far as I can tell,

591
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,410
your uncle didn't see the bee pollen fall.

592
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,170
Your uncle didn't see a plane.

593
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,750
All of this is hearsay.

594
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,223
Okay.

595
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,580
It's hard. Yeah. [inaudible]

596
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,740
hot hope. Yeah. [inaudible] [inaudible]

597
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,810
my uncle says, um, for the last 20 years,

598
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:25,750
he didn't know that anything anybody
was interested in the death of the among

599
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:26,350
people.

600
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,610
Did he agreed to do this interview
because you were interested in know what

601
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:34,260
happened to them about what happened
and the world has has been on interested

602
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,040
for the last 20 years. He agreed
because you were interested

603
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,740
that the story would be hurt and that
the moment that's would be brought,

604
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,070
documented and recognized. That's
why he agreed to the interview

605
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,030
that the mobile heart is broken,

606
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,140
that our leaders have been silenced and
what we know has been questioned again

607
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:53,840
and again. It's not a
surprise to him or to me.

608
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,130
Okay.

609
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,690
I agree to the interview for the same
reason that radio lab was interested in

610
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:04,560
the Hmong story that they were interested
in, documented the dust that happened.

611
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,840
There was so much that was not told.

612
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,450
Everybody knows that chemical
warfare was being used.

613
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,790
How do you create bombs if
not what chemicals goes?

614
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:15,780
We can play the semantics game.
We can, but I'm not interested in,

615
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:17,040
my uncle was not interested.

616
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:20,760
We have lost too much heart and
too many people in the process.

617
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,533
Okay.

618
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,810
I, I think that, I think
the interview is done.

619
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,993
Okay

620
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,670
now, um, that,

621
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,800
that wasn't the end of the interview.

622
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:55,970
They kept on talking Robert and bad
explained to Kalia that we know we're

623
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:58,010
reporters. We're just trying
to figure out what happened.

624
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,110
One thing I do want to make clear,

625
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,080
we informed the gangs in advance that
we wanted to talk about the controversy

626
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:08,690
surrounding yellow rain. We
were very clear about that.

627
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,410
We did not intend to ambush them,
but this interview troubled us.

628
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,900
We talked about it for months,

629
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,960
arguing back and forth about
what it meant to the story,

630
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,510
what it meant for us personally and we
decided at a certain point to bring that

631
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,950
conversation into the studio.

632
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,880
We're gonna play you that conversation
as we originally podcast it and then

633
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,410
we'll have some things
to say on the other end.

634
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,433
Okay.

635
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,070
That started by, uh, talking about
the moment that you just heard on

636
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,903
tape

637
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,320
that somehow that moment was when
the whole story changed for me.

638
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,420
How exactly like

639
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,560
I think that there was something about

640
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,530
like the way that she was pointing away
from the thing that we had been looking

641
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:59,320
so hard at and saying,
stop looking at that.

642
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,170
Look over here. Yeah.

643
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,460
Like she like she didn't convince me at
all that this wasn't a chemical weapon,

644
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:11,250
but she convinced me that
we were missing something.

645
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,740
Yeah.

646
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,740
What I'm hearing her say they're not
having been in this interview is quit

647
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:19,930
focusing on the clo reign
stuff because when you do that,

648
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,570
you shoving aside the much larger story,

649
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,410
namely that my people were being
killed. Right. So what she's saying,

650
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,090
so you're mad as wrong.

651
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,020
That is absolutely into my mind. That
is not fair to us. How is it not fair?

652
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,950
It's not fair to ask us to not consider
the other stories and the other frames

653
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:42,530
of this story. The fact that the
most powerful man in the world,

654
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:47,360
Ronald Reagan used this story to order
the manufacturer of chemical weapons for

655
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:48,770
the first time in 20 years.

656
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,210
If the United States with the manufacturer
chemical weapons again and then use

657
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:55,730
them because the Russians supposedly had,

658
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,530
then people would have died. Ugly
deaths in the consequence of that.

659
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,610
And that is not unimportant.
That's hugely important,

660
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,290
but it's not important to her. So should
that not be important to us? But yeah,

661
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,210
I think that, I dunno, I,

662
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,650
I think that until she,

663
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,510
until she said the things that she
said at the end of that interview,

664
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:25,740
I don't think that I had
fully appreciated the,

665
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,750
the volume of pain that was involved
in that moment for them. Yeah. Yes.

666
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:34,500
I thought, I thought her
reaction was very balancing,

667
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,720
but her desire was not for balance.

668
00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:39,540
Her desire was to monopolize
the story and that we can, sure.

669
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,600
We can say that though. Oh, if you
listen to the words, that's okay.

670
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,191
No,

671
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:48,191
I just think that they feel like their
trauma has never been fully acknowledged

672
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,150
and that they've attached it to this
because maybe they felt that they had to,

673
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:56,660
they've attached it to this idea that
yellow rain was a chemical weapon.

674
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,990
And if yellow rain suddenly isn't a
chemical weapon that doesn't just and

675
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:03,470
validate the yellow rain,
it negates their whole loss.

676
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,270
And I think she might
be right. But it's a,

677
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,910
and I also think that the scientists
are right, it's not a chemical weapon.

678
00:41:10,911 --> 00:41:14,870
And I also think you're right that
to call it a chemical weapon has big

679
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:15,740
consequences.

680
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:19,880
So what do you do when three
truths are right at the same time?

681
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,500
This is where we stop.

682
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,590
So that was our original conversation
and when the podcast went out,

683
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:34,280
a lot of people were very upset by me
in particular. So I think I want to,

684
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,820
if I could add just a couple
of things here. First of all,

685
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,650
clearly it was wrong to say that Kalia
Yang was trying to monopolize our

686
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:44,780
conversation because after
all we are the editors.

687
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:47,090
We choose what to put on the
air. And in this case we chose,

688
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,420
we were looking for evidence that
despite what the sciences thought,

689
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,400
that maybe there was a chemical weapon
here and we wanted to find an eye witness

690
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:59,480
to see if anybody saw a bomb
open and yellow rain come out.

691
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:04,250
That's what reporters do. We test
truths and that is why I was persistent.

692
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:07,940
I had no idea what the gangs were going
to say and when they got angry I was,

693
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,320
I was embarrassed. And when I got angry
in my conversation with Jed and pat,

694
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,850
that was not right. And for that,

695
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,690
I apologize to Kaya and
Mr. Yang in particular,

696
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,980
I have to ask questions and search
for truth. But in this case,

697
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:24,050
given how much Mr. Yang
had already suffered,

698
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,800
I should've done it with
more respect and more gently

699
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,393

I don't really know where Tim is,
so we're just going to try. Hey,

716
00:43:38,021 --> 00:43:40,150
I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich,

717
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:43,450
Radiolab and today we're talking
about truth and facts. Yep.

718
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,900
Facts of the matter. So recently
our producer, Pat Walters and I,

719
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:51,670
we were trying to get in touch with
a guy, Tim Kreider. Hello, Tim. Nope.

720
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,990
Right there. I think if we just shout
very loudly, like up the window,

721
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,770
we wanted to talk to Tim because Tim is
not only is he a wonderful writer and

722
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:02,590
before that a cartoonist has this essay,

723
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,880
which kind of gets to the heart of a
very different kind of truth that we've

724
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:08,350
tackled so far, and that is,

725
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,300
can you truly know somebody even after
everything you thought you knew turns out

726
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:17,490
to be wrong. Hello, Tim? Yes. Oh,

727
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,910
there you are. You sound great too. Oh,

728
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,990
we should say this is
a story not about Tim,

729
00:44:22,991 --> 00:44:27,040
but about his friend who he named Skelly
just to protect his identity. Right.

730
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,690
So let's, let's try,
if it's okay with you,

731
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,130
if we could maybe just talk about Skelly

732
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,860
as if we were just kind
of hanging out at a bar,

733
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,210
even though you're in a tiny
booth on the other company.

734
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:42,270
I have a little shred of beer in this
tiny room that would be easier. Tell us,

735
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,440
uh, how you met this guy. Um,

736
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,880
he was part of a group of friends I made
when I was working in post-collegiate

737
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:55,080
job, going door to door
for the environment. Um,

738
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,740
to knock on doors with clipboards
and get people to donate,

739
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,990
like vacuum salesman, not,
not kind of thing. Yeah.

740
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:05,991
You're dropped off by a van in a suburban
neighborhood and I can still faintly

741
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:10,190
feel the dread of, of having to
knock on your first door the night,

742
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:13,920
which was always the worst. But you
know, like, like being in the army,

743
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:17,520
it was a bonding experience, especially
because they're knocking on the door.

744
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:20,310
Stuff was just really, you
know, a few hours a day.

745
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,650
Then there's going out
to the bars afterwards,

746
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:28,200
which became as much a part of the
job for us as, as anything else.

747
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,930
And one of those nights
out drinking with friends,

748
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:34,470
he got to talking with Skelly. What'd
he look like, by the way? You know, I,

749
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,900
he forbade me ever to draw him.

750
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,240
I used to put my friends in my
cartoons all the time and um,

751
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,770
I did that once to him and he
interdicted me from doing that again.

752
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:47,480
So you don't want to draw him on the
radio? No. You know, he's about to, okay.

753
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,360
I'm sorry.

754
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,010
He had this great mop of
curly hair glasses that were
literally held together by

755
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:57,570
duct tape. And the overall effect
was warmth and intelligence.

756
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:02,690
But from the beginning he says basic
facts about this guy where little hard to

757
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:03,594
pin down.

758
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,320
It wasn't really clear at first
whether he belonged to our camp,

759
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,010
uh, the hippiest young people or
whether he was someone slightly older.

760
00:46:15,011 --> 00:46:18,220
His first life hadn't worked
out. Um, as it turned out,

761
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:23,221
he was the ladder and he had been a
practicing lawyer and he had quit being a

762
00:46:23,861 --> 00:46:27,860
lawyer for reasons that
remain unknown to me. I mean,

763
00:46:27,861 --> 00:46:29,840
I'm not sure it was
entirely voluntary quitting,

764
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,430
but Tim says at the time he liked
the guy. Yeah. For one thing,

765
00:46:34,431 --> 00:46:37,160
women seem to like him. They
were charmed by him right away.

766
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,070
All my girlfriends always liked
him. And beyond that, you know,

767
00:46:40,071 --> 00:46:43,280
he and I were two of the
readers in the group.

768
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,330
We each always had a book with
us. So they began to swap books.

769
00:46:47,331 --> 00:46:50,660
And as they got to be good friends,
Skelly even showed him his writing.

770
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,440
I still have it somewhere in
Longhand, even beautiful long hand.

771
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,340
He was clearly, um, a
sort of kindred spirit.

772
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,620
But then some questions
popped up. One day,

773
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,330
Skelly told him that he had written a
novel and that it had been accepted for

774
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:11,500
publication. Tim was like,
wow, it was excited for him.

775
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,050
You probably thought you got published.
That's amazing. I wanted to do that.

776
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,060
Yeah. So, you know, I kept
bugging him about, well, when's,

777
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,470
when's your book coming out? Skelly would
say, well, you know, in a few months,

778
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,780
and then the few months would
pass. And Scotty would say, well,

779
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,120
they just pushed it back.
It's coming. And you know,

780
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:30,130
we had a close little group of
friends and like all people on Earth,

781
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:31,990
we talked about each other
behind each other's backs.

782
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:35,950
And it may be that someone else sort of
clued me in like, Tim, there's no block.

783
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,110
Mm.

784
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:43,090
I mean, maybe he wrote a book, but it's
not being published. Initially Tim said,

785
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,570
well, there's probably
some truth to it, you know,

786
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,530
even if the truth was only the kind
of truth that's contained in dreams.

787
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,140
But then there were other stories.

788
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,040
One of his stories was about having been
married briefly in France and having a

789
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,220
daughter over there. And there was a time,

790
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,140
at least one time when he was on vacation
from the environmental canvas and he

791
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:09,430
supposedly was going to be in France
visiting his daughter who lived with her,

792
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,680
uh, maternal grandparents there.

793
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,720
And our boss saw him walking on Charles
Street in Baltimore during that time.

794
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:21,580
Obviously he was not in France
and they were never like, uh,

795
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:26,560
dude, someone saw you in Baltimore
where you really in France? No,

796
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,710
we didn't say that. And
you know, I, I've met, uh,

797
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,080
I mean I've spent,

798
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,640
I've logged a lot of time hanging out in
bars and you do meet pathological liars

799
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:40,750
in that line of work.
Um, and, and you know,

800
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,480
I'm always duly impressed by their
stories when I first hear them,

801
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:48,010
until they pile up and they've, they're
always able to one up your story,

802
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:49,990
you know, they've always met
someone more famous than you.

803
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:51,910
Something more tragic has
always happened to them.

804
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,150
And then they start to
seem creepy and repellent.

805
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,280
And all I can say is he
didn't feel that way.

806
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:07,170
He just seemed like a really good guy
who happened to lie more than most.

807
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,000
In any case, after they
left the canvasing job,

808
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,120
they both stayed in Baltimore
and the state clothes,

809
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,180
we frequently ended up crashing
on the same floors together,

810
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:25,890
closed down the bars together every
night they take road trips together,

811
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:28,800
blasting classic rock
and he loved LED's up on.

812
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,480
And after a while those stories,

813
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,180
like I've published a novel or
I have a daughter in France,

814
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,520
we didn't hear that stuff anymore. Our,

815
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:44,660
our theory is that he did not expect that
we would end up being friends for the

816
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:49,980
next 20 years and he would have to
maintain these stories. And you know,

817
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:54,450
we liked the guy so much that it would
have been unthinkably mean spirited to

818
00:49:54,451 --> 00:49:57,810
bring this stuff up. So we just sort
of pretended we'd never heard it.

819
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,650
And he says they kept themselves from
asking too many questions like, yeah,

820
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,440
they knew he had a job at the
opera house, you know, fundraising,

821
00:50:04,441 --> 00:50:08,770
but he was always broke, always
hitting them up for money. And he was,

822
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:09,810
he was,

823
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,510
they wonder why was he always house
sitting and spending the night at the

824
00:50:12,511 --> 00:50:16,170
library? You just never
knew. You did have to,

825
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,730
you did have to triangulate from, from
the few facts available. And you know,

826
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:23,520
in a way it was a fun,

827
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,980
it was fun to speculate about and fun
to tease him about behind his back.

828
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:31,240
Of course, for example, Tim
told us about one time he'd,

829
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,980
his friend nick were up at their
cabin near the Chesapeake Bay,

830
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,900
which is about an hour outside Baltimore.

831
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:38,450
And we had had a lovely
afternoon eating oysters,

832
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:40,130
drinking beers overlooking the bay.

833
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,810
And we're supposed to drive to a
train station about 20 minutes,

834
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:47,270
half an hour away to pick Skelly up. Uh,

835
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,310
he's going to take the
train up there and join us.

836
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:54,670
And so we break away from our pleasant
set up on the water and we drive down to

837
00:50:55,551 --> 00:51:00,150
the train station to pick them up. The
train comes and goes, he's not on it. Uh,

838
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,790
and we're both a little peeved at having
been torn away from our afternoon to

839
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:07,580
come get him only to be stood
up at the train station.

840
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:12,470
So my friend checks his cell phone to
see if maybe there's a message and indeed

841
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:16,700
there is and the message
goes like this. Hey guys,

842
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:20,060
this is Skelly. Um, I missed
the train. First of all,

843
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:24,710
there's the background noises of what
is clearly a bar glasses clinking the TV

844
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:29,250
on unmistakably the mount
royal tavern, a low oil.

845
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,520
We just knew and he says, so, um,

846
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,290
I'm really sorry about this,

847
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:39,440
but I was in a meeting that ran a
little longer than I expected and

848
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,740
tried to catch it, but I was
like three minutes too late,

849
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:49,280
but I checked and there's another
train seven 20, it gets in seven 45.

850
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:50,600
I'll definitely be on that one.

851
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:54,830
So hopefully you all get this message
and be there to meet me. Ah, okay. Again,

852
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,600
sorry about that. Hope I'll see you soon.

853
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,520
And then there's 30 or 45 seconds of him
fumbling to figure out how to hang up

854
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:05,870
this borrowed cell phone throughout
which we can hear the sounds of the bar

855
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:06,920
clearly in the background.

856
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:12,310
And I listened to this message and I just
smiled and shook my head and handed it

857
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:18,020
speechless. Lee to my friend. Nick,
do you give any sense of what's,

858
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:19,820
when you're not being told something,

859
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,090
do you have any feeling for what you're
not being told or you just think it's

860
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:27,700
just silly detail? No,
you know, I don't, it was,

861
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:31,520
he was just a very secretive guy.

862
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,740
Whoa.

863
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,950
Um, and we got the sense that, I
mean he told me once, you know,

864
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:39,930
the less people know about
you, the better off you are.

865
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,533
[inaudible]

866
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:43,181
I mean,

867
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:46,060
we weren't supposed to know for a long
time that he lived at home with his

868
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:50,320
mother. Um, you know,
which is not unheard of,

869
00:52:50,321 --> 00:52:52,360
but an embarrassing thing
when you're a grown man.

870
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,870
And it became really obvious that he did,

871
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,780
cause if you called his house
sometime you got his mother. Um,

872
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:02,110
and he had a complex
cover story about how, oh,

873
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:04,420
well if the phone rang
enough times at his house,

874
00:53:04,421 --> 00:53:07,930
it was forwarded to his mother's
to pick up, which, you know,

875
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,250
I had never heard of that.

876
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,000
I didn't know the phone
company offered that service.

877
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,460
So you know,

878
00:53:15,461 --> 00:53:18,730
we knew the deal but we weren't going
to challenge him on it because it's so

879
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:22,510
clearly it was something he was
embarrassed about and eager to conceal.

880
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:24,530
[inaudible]

881
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:28,980
I think probably saw himself and was
worried that others would see him as,

882
00:53:28,981 --> 00:53:33,150
as you know, marginal or
pathetic or losers and you know,

883
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:37,340
we didn't see him that
way. We love the guy.

884
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,580
It was just one of us. You know,

885
00:53:43,581 --> 00:53:45,500
there are conditions that
come with every friendship.

886
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:49,640
People are weird and most of the people
who are really worth being friends with

887
00:53:49,641 --> 00:53:50,420
are weird.

888
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,310
And you learn to accept that there are
unspoken rules in certain friendships.

889
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,190
No,

890
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:59,950
until the day comes when the
rules don't apply anymore.

891
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,650
Fast forward a few years,
Tim has moved to New York.

892
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:08,040
Skelly still is in Baltimore with
his, well, his mother had died,

893
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:12,090
but he was living in the same
house. I still saw him pretty often.

894
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:15,030
He'd take the train up and we get
some beers and some chicken wings.

895
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:20,540
And one day I got a phone call from a
friend of mine and he sounded very badly

896
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:22,830
shaken.

897
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,130
Tim's friend said that he'd been worried
about Skelly cause he hadn't heard from

898
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:29,400
him for a while and then he called work
and it turned out he hadn't been there

899
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:33,840
and he knew something was wrong.
So he went to his house and um,

900
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:35,700
you know,

901
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,660
I think he was able to get the door
open enough to see inside and uh,

902
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,700
he called inform and he heard nothing
and he forced his way in and found him

903
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,160
lying on the floor dead.

904
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:53,930
The coroner ruled that that
death was drug related.

905
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,940
So I went back to
Baltimore right away, um,

906
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:04,220
because I assumed they were being
a, a memorial service and so on.

907
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,830
And for a couple of days,

908
00:55:06,831 --> 00:55:11,480
nothing happened at all because
he had kept his life so thoroughly

909
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:16,010
compartmentalized that no one knew
how to get in touch with his family.

910
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,490
Although at the last minute,
the day before his funeral,

911
00:55:19,491 --> 00:55:22,340
we got in touch with his extended family
and they were able to send some people

912
00:55:22,341 --> 00:55:25,520
up just before they
arrived at occurred to Tim.

913
00:55:25,521 --> 00:55:28,220
Well maybe we should go
through his house, you know,

914
00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:29,390
and just clean up and you know,

915
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:31,610
find out if there's anything
there that we should, you know,

916
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:33,860
disappear before his family shows up.

917
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,930
And we were talking to the guy who
first found him and he said, yeah,

918
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:43,790
well here's the thing. He told them, you
guys, you can go back into that house,

919
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:47,660
but I'm, I'm not going back
in there. He had warned us,

920
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:51,440
but as soon as we stepped
in, it was still shocking.

921
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:53,090
[inaudible]

922
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:57,920
and terrible. What did you
see when you walked in? Um,

923
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:04,490
there are aspects about that that I
will never tell you or anyone else.

924
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,390
But suffice to say that
as soon as you walked in,

925
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:12,530
you could tell that someone had
ceased living like a human being.

926
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:16,760
I mean, there were heaps of things heaps

927
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,650
and he'd stopped throwing things
out. There wasn't electricity,

928
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,010
there wasn't working plumbing,

929
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:30,160
no plumbing at all. No,
no, I don't think so.

930
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,133
[inaudible]

931
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,870
and words are going to
fail me here. I mean, the,

932
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:39,160
the simplest way to say it would be
to say it was clearly a place where an

933
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:40,210
insane person had lived

934
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,540
for someone who is
mentally ill and left. Um,

935
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:51,420
I dunno if that's what to call it because
most people who are mentally ill don't

936
00:56:51,421 --> 00:56:54,690
know to conceal their mental illness.

937
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,010
He was just a very gentle,
decent, kindhearted guy.

938
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:05,350
But something horrible had happened. Um,

939
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:09,140
but on some level he had, he
had understood that. I mean,

940
00:57:09,141 --> 00:57:12,140
it was a secret that he was keeping any,

941
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:15,260
kept it locked inside that house.

942
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:21,580
And I think we were all appalled to
realize that something had been so

943
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:24,500
drastically wrong with him all this time.

944
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,420
And the single most upsetting
aspect of it was imagining how

945
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,650
utterly alone he must've
felt himself to be.

946
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,710
Did you have ever have moments of
feeling guilt like I should have,

947
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,130
I should have gotten into that place.

948
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:47,560
I shouldn't have no. That I,

949
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:52,050
I don't think there is
anything that anyone could
have done for him. I mean, he,

950
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,183
uh, he,

951
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,900
he had so clearly determined not to
let people in to that chamber of his,

952
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,840
his life. And,

953
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,530
and the other thing is that he was
so convincing in his dissembling.

954
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:09,300
I mean, we really didn't think
there was anything seriously wrong.

955
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:10,170
Yeah.

956
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:15,170
He was his best and most decent and
sanest self when he was in our company.

957
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:22,230
But you didn't know so much
about him. And I guess I just in,

958
00:58:22,231 --> 00:58:24,690
in light of that, I
wonder what it means to,

959
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,210
to know someone or what it, who
exactly it was that you think you knew.

960
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,570
Yeah. Well, um, you know,

961
00:58:33,571 --> 00:58:38,160
the only people I knew of whoever
got mad at him for telling,

962
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,720
uh, what they would've called lies
were women. I mean, he was a guy,

963
00:58:42,721 --> 00:58:46,530
so he was not above trying to
impress girls and you know, the,

964
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:51,531
the things he was trying to impress
them with where his novel is storied

965
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,590
history.

966
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:57,540
And often when they found out that those
things were not strictly speaking true,

967
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:01,110
they felt lied to and betrayed and

968
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:06,000
none of his friends ever felt
that way. And I always felt that

969
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,250
perhaps as patronizing or nasty of me,

970
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:12,630
but I always felt that what those girls
were really mad about was that they

971
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:15,000
believed him, they'd fallen for it.

972
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,330
But in a sense you and your
friends fell for something too?

973
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,120
Well, I don't know.

974
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:26,290
I mean what I would say we fell for was
the thousands of hours we spent in that

975
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,183
guy's company,

976
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:35,480
which seems to me like a more direct and
reliable form of knowing than hearing

977
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,830
facts either made up or real. I mean,

978
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
there was a day when I'm Skelly and I
drove up to my cabin to check on the place

979
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:48,890
cause there'd been a blizzard, uh,

980
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,950
and there is a grove of bamboo trees
there and the weight of all the snow had

981
00:59:55,851 --> 01:00:00,851
bent them over the driveway so that they
formed a kind of continuous arch and we

982
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:06,701
parked and we walked down through that
arcade and we would tug on every bamboo

983
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:13,391
tree and it would shake the snow off and
it would suddenly spoiling up into the

984
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:18,590
air and fling it's load of
snow 50 feet into the sky.

985
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:27,040
We did that with every tree walking all
the way down the driveway and it was

986
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:29,330
[inaudible]

987
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:34,330
so beautiful and so much fun
that we cracked up like boys.

988
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:39,100
And I'm the only one
who remembers that now.

989
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:46,340
That was a moment that only he and
I were there for and he's gone. Um,

990
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,880
he shared that with me
and nobody else ever will.

991
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,740
You're imagining it cause
I've described it to you,

992
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:53,060
but that's not the same thing.

993
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,320
And if you don't know someone by having
experiences like that and memories like

994
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:01,250
that with them, then I would submit that
you cannot ever know anybody at all.

995
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,213

thanks to producer pat Walters
and to Tim Kreider whose book,

998
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,150
which includes this story is
called, we learned nothing.
