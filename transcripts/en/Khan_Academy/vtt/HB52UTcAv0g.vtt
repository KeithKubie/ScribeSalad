00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.940
Add the blue and
pink expressions

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.600
to create another expression.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.810
And be sure to
combine like terms.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.030
So let me get this
scratch pad out here.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.980
So we need to add this
6y plus 2 in blue.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.740
So we're going to add 6y plus 2.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.360
And we're going to add it
to negative 2/3 minus y.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.590
So first let's add
all the y terms.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.610
If we have six of something,
and I'm going to subtract one

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.930
of that something,
or 6y's minus 1y--

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.860
you could view this
literally as 1y--

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.310
I'm going to be left with 5y's.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.829
And then I have 2 minus 2/3.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.370
And let's solve that
right over here.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.720
So 2 minus 2/3 is
the same thing as-- 2

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.140
can be rewritten as 6/3-- 6
divided by 3 is 2-- minus 2/3,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.090
which equals 4/3.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.220
So 2 minus 2/3 is 4/3.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.840
So this is equal to 5y plus 4/3.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.780
Now let's actually input that
in to make sure we got it right.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.960
5y plus 4/3.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
And you see it
interpreted it properly.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.910
And we got it right.
