reverse order 1 4 2 equals 3 8 3 which

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
reverse order 1 4 2 equals 3 8 3 which
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.270
reverse order 1 4 2 equals 3 8 3 which
is itself prime so it's the smallest

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.930
100 years ago and so this is the
centenary we're in the centenary year of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940
centenary we're in the centenary year of
 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.229
centenary we're in the centenary year of
wood all primes and I imagine I mean a

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
wood all primes and I imagine I mean a
 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.910
wood all primes and I imagine I mean a
lot of people may be organizing wood all

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920
lot of people may be organizing wood all
 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.710
lot of people may be organizing wood all
prime parties but I haven't been invited

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720
prime parties but I haven't been invited
 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.479
prime parties but I haven't been invited
and I haven't heard about them mat if it

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489
and I haven't heard about them mat if it
 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.800
and I haven't heard about them mat if it
was one going on you would be well I

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
was one going on you would be well I
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.270
was one going on you would be well I
better be I'd be a little offended if I

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280
better be I'd be a little offended if I
 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.090
better be I'd be a little offended if I
wasn't and so I think in the centenary

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100
wasn't and so I think in the centenary
 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.190
wasn't and so I think in the centenary
year of wood all primes we should

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
year of wood all primes we should
 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.070
year of wood all primes we should
celebrate the less significant the less

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080
celebrate the less significant the less
 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.740
celebrate the less significant the less
exciting the less well known types of

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750
exciting the less well known types of
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.650
exciting the less well known types of
numbers as though 383 as a wood or prime

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660
numbers as though 383 as a wood or prime
 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.650
numbers as though 383 as a wood or prime
I think which we celebrating it in 1917

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660
I think which we celebrating it in 1917
 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.600
I think which we celebrating it in 1917
and what we can do other than having

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610
and what we can do other than having
 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.670
and what we can do other than having
parties if you want to celebrate it is

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680
parties if you want to celebrate it is
 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.120
parties if you want to celebrate it is
to help us find another one the last

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130
to help us find another one the last
 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.520

mostly number two get a little glory

partly because they're linked to perfect

numbers in fact that's why we cared

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:10.379
numbers in fact that's why we cared
 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.290
numbers in fact that's why we cared
about them in the first place and now

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300
about them in the first place and now
 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.529
about them in the first place and now
it's because they're easy and they hold

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539
it's because they're easy and they hold
 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:17.719

I think they've either got all or 9 out

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729

of 10 of the top 10 biggest primes or

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:20.339
of 10 of the top 10 biggest primes or
 

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.800
of 10 of the top 10 biggest primes or
almost and price because they're easy to

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810

find right and so people check people to

go for glory all they care about are the

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:26.189
go for glory all they care about are the
 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:27.860
go for glory all they care about are the
biggest one they go and pick off the

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870
biggest one they go and pick off the
 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.990
biggest one they go and pick off the
Mersenne primes whereas these other ones

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000
Mersenne primes whereas these other ones
 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.909
Mersenne primes whereas these other ones
they're not easy to find right and then

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919
they're not easy to find right and then
 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.519
they're not easy to find right and then
they know this is about well this is

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:34.529
they know this is about well this is
 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.320
they know this is about well this is
well below right this is an order of

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.330
well below right this is an order of
 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.480
well below right this is an order of
magnitude fewer digits than the current

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.490
magnitude fewer digits than the current
 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.119
magnitude fewer digits than the current
world record Mersenne Prime and I think

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:41.129
world record Mersenne Prime and I think
 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:43.519
world record Mersenne Prime and I think
it's a shame that we knew size isn't

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:43.529
it's a shame that we knew size isn't
 

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.139

everything we should be looking for

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:45.149
everything we should be looking for
 

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:48.500
everything we should be looking for
these other interesting numbers
