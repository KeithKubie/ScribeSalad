00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.715
So, which is it? Do I not have a

00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:07.750
lactase protein or do I have one that's non-functional?

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.180
&gt;&gt; Well, although it's possible to have a non-functional lactase protein,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.910
we're pretty sure you did because, as a baby, you were able

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.170
to drink milk. So in your case, we would presume that

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.630
you have the lactase gene, but it's just not expressed any more.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.890
&gt;&gt; Oh, once again Matt. What exactly do you mean by expressed?

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.490
&gt;&gt; What we mean by expressed is

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.450
whether or not a gene is transcribed and translated and turned

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.500
into protein. So a gene that's on, or expressed, means a gene

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.050
that's actually transcribed and translated into protein. And a gene that's

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.880
off or not expressed, is a gene that's not transcribed at all.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.970
&gt;&gt; So, it's not that Shalu doesn't have the

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.720
lactase gene, it's just that it's not turned on.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.904
&gt;&gt; Exactly, in this lesson, we're going to learn how

00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:50.828
turning genes on and off is just as important

00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:52.596
as making sure they have the right coding

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:56.350
sequence for a functional protein. We're going to focus particularly

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.870
on the non coding regions that can control

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.490
whether or not a gene starts transcription or not.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.544
&gt;&gt; Now why don't you tell us? Are you

00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:06.180
lactose intolerant like Shalu is? Check yes or no.
