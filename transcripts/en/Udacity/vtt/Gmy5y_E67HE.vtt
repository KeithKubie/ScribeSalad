00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.446
[SOUND] As you've seen,
Android Auto provides

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:09.118
an integration between your phone and
your car.

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:13.336
This allows you to make your phone
perform tasks without having to touch

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:15.040
the phone display.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.720
This is great because the user
is driving, meaning they need

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.540
minimal distractions and they need
to keep their eyes on the road.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.215
One of the key features of
Android Auto is messaging support.

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.765
Let's have a quick look
at what this might like.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:34.250
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Here's the message.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.059
Are you coming back to the studio for
filming?

00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:42.510
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Reply.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.434
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; What's the message?

00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:48.013
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Yes, in five minutes.

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:50.590
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.530
Here's your message.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.760
Yes, in five minutes.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.745
Do you want to send it?

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:56.451
[SOUND] Yes.

00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:59.210
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Sending message.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.480
&gt;&gt; As you can see,
this is a very simple workflow.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.470
In this lesson,
I'm going to show you the following.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.090
How to get an existing sample for
notifications, how it works, and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670
then how to get it running.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.180
Then, I'm going to show you
how to add extensions for

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.300
Android Auto Messaging, and then how
to test that messaging functionality

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.640
on the Android Auto Simulator.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.890
Let's head back to the studio and
get started.
