better way to do it would be to find a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
better way to do it would be to find a
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.010

where I was looking on the page and turn
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.779
where I was looking on the page and turn
pages automatically and I learned that

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
pages automatically and I learned that
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.100
pages automatically and I learned that
you know probably to do this really well

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
you know probably to do this really well
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380

I would have to learn about this thing

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
I would have to learn about this thing
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.670

you're working at open the eye tell me

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
you're working at open the eye tell me
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.740
you're working at open the eye tell me
about your work there so actually I've

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
about your work there so actually I've
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.050
about your work there so actually I've
been really excited to be able to tie

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
been really excited to be able to tie
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.090

together both my musical interests and
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.870
together both my musical interests and
my interest now in AI I've been working

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
my interest now in AI I've been working
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.170
my interest now in AI I've been working
on a project called muse net which tries

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180
on a project called muse net which tries
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999
on a project called muse net which tries
to take all these recent advances that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
to take all these recent advances that
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.460
to take all these recent advances that
we've had in natural language work and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
we've had in natural language work and
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.820
we've had in natural language work and
apply them instead to music so I went

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
apply them instead to music so I went
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.520
apply them instead to music so I went
through the process of trying to turn a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
through the process of trying to turn a
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.800
through the process of trying to turn a
regular sheet music into tokens that I

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
regular sheet music into tokens that I
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.020
regular sheet music into tokens that I
could then feed into a model and it's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
could then feed into a model and it's
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.670
could then feed into a model and it's
been great fun it means I get to debug

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
been great fun it means I get to debug
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560
been great fun it means I get to debug
by like listening to music trying to be

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
by like listening to music trying to be
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.010
by like listening to music trying to be
Brahms and a copepod of music was the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
Brahms and a copepod of music was the
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.050

only transforming network where that's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
only transforming network where that's
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.600
only transforming network where that's
going on that open the eye yeah can you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
going on that open the eye yeah can you
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.060
going on that open the eye yeah can you
explain to listeners what is that about

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
explain to listeners what is that about
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.109
explain to listeners what is that about
yeah so transformer architecture is very

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
yeah so transformer architecture is very
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.929
yeah so transformer architecture is very
powerful architecture based on self

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
powerful architecture based on self
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.410
powerful architecture based on self
attention so the the model can learn how

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
attention so the the model can learn how
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.690
attention so the the model can learn how
far in the past it might need to look in

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700
far in the past it might need to look in
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.399
far in the past it might need to look in
order to find the relevant information

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
order to find the relevant information
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.980
order to find the relevant information
so it makes it much easier to when

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
so it makes it much easier to when
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.780
so it makes it much easier to when
you're dealing with a long sequence you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
you're dealing with a long sequence you
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.190
you're dealing with a long sequence you
can equally well look at the beginning

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
can equally well look at the beginning
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.809
can equally well look at the beginning
of the sequence which you might need in

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
of the sequence which you might need in
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.320
of the sequence which you might need in
music when

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
music when
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.270
music when
might need to return to a theme that you

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
might need to return to a theme that you
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.740
might need to return to a theme that you
haven't heard for a couple minutes yeah

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
haven't heard for a couple minutes yeah
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.180
haven't heard for a couple minutes yeah
so give it a piece of music you can look

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
so give it a piece of music you can look
 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.980
so give it a piece of music you can look
way back at the last time this chorus

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990
way back at the last time this chorus
 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.420
way back at the last time this chorus
was played and then do the right thing

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430
was played and then do the right thing
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.100
was played and then do the right thing
when synthesizing the new piece of music

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
when synthesizing the new piece of music
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.240
when synthesizing the new piece of music
exactly

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
exactly
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.310
exactly
you're also policy open the eyes

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320
you're also policy open the eyes
 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.160
you're also policy open the eyes
Scholars Program how was that yeah that

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
Scholars Program how was that yeah that
 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.520
Scholars Program how was that yeah that
was an amazing opportunity for me it's a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530
was an amazing opportunity for me it's a
 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.710
was an amazing opportunity for me it's a
program that opening eye has that is

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
program that opening eye has that is
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.270
program that opening eye has that is
specifically looking for people from

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280
specifically looking for people from
 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.330
specifically looking for people from
more unusual backgrounds and it was

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
more unusual backgrounds and it was
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.800
more unusual backgrounds and it was
really great to be paired with a mentor

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
really great to be paired with a mentor
 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.540
really great to be paired with a mentor
who helped me kind of weave through and

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
who helped me kind of weave through and
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.220
who helped me kind of weave through and
it's such a big feel than to have

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
it's such a big feel than to have
 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.130
it's such a big feel than to have
someone help you navigate you know which

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140
someone help you navigate you know which
 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.690
someone help you navigate you know which
research to pay attention to which

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
research to pay attention to which
 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.210
research to pay attention to which
problems to do um I think it's so great

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220
problems to do um I think it's so great
 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.560
problems to do um I think it's so great
that you took the deep learning

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570
that you took the deep learning
 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.390
that you took the deep learning
specialization and that was part of your

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
specialization and that was part of your
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.780
specialization and that was part of your
journey

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790
journey
 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.960
journey
um for others wanting to volunteer for

um for others wanting to volunteer for
stairs above a similar career would you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980
stairs above a similar career would you
 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.180
stairs above a similar career would you
have any advice for them sure yeah I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190
have any advice for them sure yeah I
 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.680
have any advice for them sure yeah I
mean I do feel that the deep learning

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
mean I do feel that the deep learning
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.340
mean I do feel that the deep learning
sequence was a huge part of the way I

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350
sequence was a huge part of the way I
 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.220
sequence was a huge part of the way I
started into this I remember actually as

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230
started into this I remember actually as
 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.260
started into this I remember actually as
the courses were coming out and we would

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270
the courses were coming out and we would
 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.880
the courses were coming out and we would
wait for each new course to come out and

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890
wait for each new course to come out and
 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.220
wait for each new course to come out and
I I realized like at that point I could

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230
I I realized like at that point I could
 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.990
I I realized like at that point I could
look anywhere like probably the material

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000
look anywhere like probably the material
 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.940
look anywhere like probably the material
is online but it was only as your videos

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
is online but it was only as your videos
 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.440
is online but it was only as your videos
came out and you explain things in such

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
came out and you explain things in such
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.840
came out and you explain things in such
a good clear way that then I felt like I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850
a good clear way that then I felt like I
 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.940
a good clear way that then I felt like I
had this intuition and I kind of
