SPEAKER: Good afternoon and
welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.800
We are very pleased to bring
the author and entrepreneur

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.900
Ben Parr to campus today.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.850
This Princeton native, that
would be Princeton, Illinois--

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.980
being from Champaign,
I definitely

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.540
respect that-- was also voted
in 2012 one of the Fortune 30

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.450
under 30.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.280
So that's pretty cool.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.020
His career in the
Valley and in tech

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.100
has really spanned a
wide variety of areas

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.480
from working at "CNET" and
"Mashable" to currently

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.210
with "Inc." magazine
and the VC DominateFund.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.370
Today, he's speaking to us
about yonder book, "Captivology,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.550
discusses the
psychology of attention,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.630
and includes a variety of
interviews with thought leaders

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.760
on that subject.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.867
It is truly the fundamental
currency of today's economy.

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:48.950
And we'll have some time
at the end for questions,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.460
but for now, Ben Parr, you
now have our attention.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.220
Welcome to Google.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.490
BEN PARR: Thank you.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.690
But you've all seen "Up," right?

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.570
And you've seen Doug.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.790
I feel like Doug the
dog, screaming "squirrel"

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.200
everywhere all the time.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.040
And we live in this kind of
new era in the last decade

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.550
where we are bombarded with
more information than ever.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.420
And yet, we have the
same 24 hours a day.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.080
In 1986, we were presented with
approximately 46 newspapers

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.830
worth of information, according
to one research study.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.215
And by 2006, that
number had increased

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.800
to 176 newspapers worth.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.000
Today it's actually seven full
HD DVDs worth of information

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.510
that we are exposed
to on a daily basis.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.150
And so you combine that
with our multitasking

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.110
habitats--that's my
actual TweetDeck.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.245
It looks like someone
vomited on something.

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:49.870
And this is the kind
of thing all of us

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.190
are dealing with daily.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.250
And our multitasking habit,
which is not actually

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.370
helping us all that much.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.828
In fact, there's
another study that

00:01:56.828 --> 00:02:00.490
found that those who consider
themselves heavy multimedia

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.410
multitaskers are actually
the least effective

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.430
when it comes to completing
tasks and switching

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.910
between tasks and accuracy.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.385
And so you have this combination
of way more information

00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:13.640
than ever and us
having bad habits

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.906
to manage that information.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:17.280
And you have a world where it
is both extremely difficult

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.200
to capture attention and to
stand out with your idea,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.780
whether it's a project, it's
a start up, it's a passion,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.060
it's a charity, and having
it be seen by the world.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.380
And at the same time,
defending our attention

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.080
by all of this kind
of information,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.710
understanding which things are
worth our time and attention.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.790
And so that's kind of
the reason, the impetus,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.180
for why I wrote "Captivology."

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.990
And "Captivology" is about
the science and the psychology

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.540
of attention, and why we pay
attention to certain people

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.460
and products, and how to
utilize that science to capture

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.920
the attention of others.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.700
And so I'm going to talk a
little bit about the research

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.430
I did for "Captivology"--
over 1,000 research

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.130
studies, interviews
with dozens of PhDs,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.135
and everybody from Steven
Soderbergh, Adrian Grenier,

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:02.060
the people behind the
Old Spice campaign,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.660
Sheryl Sandberg,
David Copperfield,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.380
people across industries.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.690
I'm going to talk about the
three stages of attention

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.360
and my model of attention and,
more importantly, what I call

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.770
the seven captivation triggers.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.020
And these are seven
psychological triggers

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.350
that capture attention
across all these stages.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.830
And so let me get
into attention.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.270
And so I kind of describe
attention as a bonfire.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.460
And your goal in
capturing attention

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.830
is to walk people
through the three stages,

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.149
is to grow the fire
because you can't just

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.190
start out with a bonfire.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.590
You have to start
with the spark.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.131
And then you go
through the kindling.

00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:41.030
And then you go and you finally
get to the logs in the bonfire.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.710
And so the first stage
is immediate attention.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.520
The second stage
is short attention.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.290
And the last stage
is long attention.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.630
And let me explain a little
bit about each stage.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.750
Stage one.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.010
Immediate attention.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.110
It is our immediate
and automatic reaction

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.180
to certain sights,
sounds, and stimuli.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.510
It's how we react if someone
does this, for example.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.290
[POP]

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.360
I love doing that
every single time.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.200
It's how we automatically react
to when there's sights, sounds,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.033
something like that.

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:10.692
When someone puts a gunshot,
or launches a confetti cannon,

00:04:10.692 --> 00:04:11.900
we're going to pay attention.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.360
And I'm sorry to the
janitors in a little bit.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.360
But the reason why we
react is because it's

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.610
a defense mechanism.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.370
We're trying to
protect ourselves.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.330
Imagine if you had to
think every time a car was

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.570
coming at you.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.190
We'd be dead human beings.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.492
We'd be a dead species.

00:04:27.492 --> 00:04:28.950
And so it's a
protection mechanism.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.670
And you'll see that
a lot of attention

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.960
is a defense mechanism.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.120
And a lot of it is activating
those defense mechanisms.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.310
The second stage is
from subconscious

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.450
automatic attention to
conscious, directed attention,

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.150
is when we start concentrating
on something like a test,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.890
or a speaker, or a dress.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.870
That goddamn dress.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.730
But it's when we
actually start focusing.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.080
And it is a kind of
short-term thing.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.690
And it's run by a system
called working memory.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.380
And working memory is this
short-term memory system

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.730
that processes the
sights and sounds

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.680
around us and the other stimuli
and helps us determine which

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.410
things are worth our
time and attention

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.160
and, more importantly,
which things should

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.980
be stored in long-term memory.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.460
Which leads us-- well, before
I tell you-- very complicated

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.260
system, by the way.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.801
I won't go through
the entire process

00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:19.290
here, but suffice it to say
it's a very complicated system

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.950
that runs our attention.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.140
The final stage of attention is
a stage called long attention.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.670
I kind of use Beyonce
as an example.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.711
It's the difference between
hearing and listening

00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:32.694
to a Beyonce song in the
car and joining the Beyhive

00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:34.610
and becoming a lifelong
fan and buying albums.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.990
It's the reason why when
Beyonce launched her last album,

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.490
she didn't have to
do any marketing.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.050
She just got to drop it and
suddenly everyone bought it.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.270
But it's because she earned
long attention over time,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.770
building those relationships,
building that relationship

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.061
with her audience, building
long attention and interest

00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:49.800
from millions of people.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.430
And so those three
kind of things

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.160
combine to create this
bonfire of attention.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.094
Now how do you build that
bonfire of attention?

00:05:57.094 --> 00:05:58.510
You have to go
through what I call

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.790
the seven captivation triggers.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.350
And these are seven
psychological triggers

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.320
I discovered over and
over again that came up

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.550
in my research that
capture attention

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.820
from immediate attention
to long attention.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.103
So let me tell you about the
first one-- automaticity.

00:06:12.103 --> 00:06:12.830
All right.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.294
So pop quiz.

00:06:14.294 --> 00:06:16.210
If you're a hitchhiker
on the side of the road

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.543
and you want to have the best
chance of being picked up,

00:06:18.543 --> 00:06:20.270
what color shirt
should you wear?

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.910
Guesses?

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.160
Red, white, I heard.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.900
What else?

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.030
Orange.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.534
Yellow.

00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:27.450
I've heard everything.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.310
Actually, usually
someone says "naked."

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.610
You guys aren't dirty enough.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.870
It's too early in
the day or something?

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.500
It's a Monday.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.160
Fair enough.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.470
Maybe during Burning Man.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.620
So the answer is actually,
it's gender specific.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.740
If you're a man, on
average, any bright color

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.740
will do because of
the dark backgrounds

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.690
of the black roads, and
the dark green grass,

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.586
and the brown dirt.

00:06:53.586 --> 00:06:55.460
But if you're a woman,
and there was actually

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.049
a French scientist who was
like, I'm going to study this.

00:06:58.049 --> 00:07:00.340
He wanted to find out who
would get picked up the most.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.530
So he had women wear six
different colored shirts.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.900
And on average, someone
would pull over about 13%

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.910
of the time.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.450
Unless they were wearing
the color red, in which case

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.060
they were picked
up 21% of the time.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.520
And the reason for that is
actually our subconscious

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.340
associations that we have
with red and romanticism.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.170
In fact, another study found if
you just put a thick red border

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.770
around a person's face, the
opposite gender, on average,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.977
we'll rate that person
as more attractive.

00:07:25.977 --> 00:07:27.560
Reason why there's
a red border there.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.893
I also just like having an
excuse to put that picture up

00:07:29.893 --> 00:07:32.020
every time.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.449
But the opposite
gender will rate

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:34.740
that person as more attractive.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.281
And even there was
another study that

00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:38.910
found that if a researcher
is wearing a red shirt,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.799
a person who doesn't know will
actually sit several inches

00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:42.715
closer to that person.

00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:45.350
It's like an automatic
invitation to be more intimate.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.280
And so immediate attention
is this automatic response

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.540
to different stimuli.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.800
And it really comes down
to two things-- contrast

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.069
and association.

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:55.860
And contrast is the
contrast that something

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.890
has with its surroundings, and
association is the subconscious

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.060
associations we have with
a certain color, or symbol,

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.810
or sound, based on our cultural
history, based on our biology,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.880
based on other factors.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.390
And so a key to capturing
attention with automaticity

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.450
is to use the right
color for the job.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.180
So example is Amazon.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.010
There's a reason why they use
yellow and orange buttons.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.550
They have high contrast
with their surroundings,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.952
with white and gray backgrounds.

00:08:21.952 --> 00:08:23.160
And they perform really well.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.230
But most bright colors will
actually perform very well.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:31.340
However, give me some
word association game.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.100
Give me words you think
when you see this.

00:08:37.412 --> 00:08:38.870
"Dutch" is usually
the first thing.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.530
Give me more.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.570
Anyone else?

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.450
Usually someone says "prison."

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.770
But actually, here's my point.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.020
AUDIENCE: White collar prison.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.700
BEN PARR: White
collar-- there you go.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.710
So orange and yellow actually
have the lowest correlation

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:54.845
with competence.

00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:56.470
Teal and blue actually
has the highest,

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.800
which is why my cover
has blue and teal on it.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.390
But think about it.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.400
If someone like this
walked into most offices,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.160
maybe not Google,
but most offices,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.339
you'd laugh their
ass out of the room.

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:08.880
And it's because of
that correlation.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.390
And there's all these kind
of different correlations

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.170
we have with different
colors and sounds.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.390
In fact, let's talk about smell.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.410
So this flower, I believe
the Camellia flower,

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.260
was used by Ralph
Lauren in a perfume,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.710
and it performed really well.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.850
So like, let's
expand it everywhere.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.040
So we're going to take
it to South America.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.040
Problem is in South America,
this specific flower

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.440
is used in funerals.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.160
So when you sprayed it on, you
literally smelled like death.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.060
How do you think that performed?

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.280
Not well is the answer.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.380
Trigger number two-- framing.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.729
And so framing is
that we pay attention

00:09:43.729 --> 00:09:45.770
to things that fall within
our frame of reference

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.310
or don't pay attention
to things because

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.393
of our frame of reference.

00:09:48.393 --> 00:09:51.945
And to describe this, I want
to talk about deodorant.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.730
Anyone want some free deodorant?

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.570
Specifically, I want to talk
about a teenage entrepreneur

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.650
named Edna Murphy.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.230
And so in the 1910s,
deodorant wasn't a thing.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.090
And antiperspirants
weren't a thing.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.720
In fact, this is
what they literally

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.049
used to protect themselves--
cotton pads and dress shields.

00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:13.590
And there were two reasons why
antiperspirants and deodorants

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.190
weren't a popular
thing back then.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.690
First reason was
that people thought

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.790
it was going to kill you to use
one, to have antiperspirants.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.060
And it was going to kill you.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.590
But the bigger and second
reason was because it was not

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.120
a thing you talked about.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.330
Bodily fluids, sweat, any
of that sort of thing,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.280
it wasn't ladylike.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.660
It was not a thing you talked
about in proper conversation.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.540
And so Edna Murphy, teenage
entrepreneur, her father,

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.510
a surgeon, invented an
antiperspirant for his hands

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.950
because he wanted to not
sweat doing surgeries.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.880
And she's like, you know, I
could put those in my armpits.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.960
So she does.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.960
And she gets a $500 loan
from her grandfather

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.349
and she creates Odo-Ro-No.

00:10:55.349 --> 00:10:56.140
Greatest name ever.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.357
In fact, I found one.

00:10:58.357 --> 00:10:59.940
I don't think they
make these anymore.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.440
Odo-Ro-No.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.160
So she goes out and
she starts selling

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.912
and she gets a little
bit of traction.

00:11:05.912 --> 00:11:07.370
But she's finding
it very difficult

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.800
to get the product
above that plateau

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.230
because of the two reasons
I just told you about.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.325
Now she had to get past it.

00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:15.700
So what she did
was she teamed up

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.340
with a guy named James Webb
Young who would eventually

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.590
become the first chairman
of the Ad Council.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.170
And together they
decided they had

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.200
to go in and tackle these
frames of reference,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.696
these perceptions people had.

00:11:25.696 --> 00:11:27.320
First, how do you
get people to realize

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.450
it will not kill you
to wear antiperspirant.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.340
Well, it was
invented by a doctor.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.215
And so they really
advertised that fact hard.

00:11:33.215 --> 00:11:35.548
And this is actually one of
the original advertisements.

00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:37.060
And you'll see,
Odo-Ro-No being used

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.860
and recommend by leading
physicians skin specialists.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.290
That helped double
sales, when we

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.792
started advertising that fact.

00:11:42.792 --> 00:11:44.250
But they still had
the bigger issue

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.580
of how do you get people
to actually talk about it?

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.770
And so they put out this ad.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.140
Now this ad talks very
frankly about body orders.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.770
It says, "a frank discussion of
a subject too often avoided."

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.395
And it talks about body odor and
how you don't have to have it.

00:12:01.395 --> 00:12:03.530
And how you can use
Odo-Ro-No to fix it.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.830
By the way, this was in
the most popular magazine

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.260
of the era, of 1919.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.920
Does anyone want to guess
which magazine that is?

00:12:12.621 --> 00:12:13.120
What?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.410
Nope.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:13.800
Nope.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.650
Anyone else want to try?

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.983
I'm going to take some out
to dinner if they guess this.

00:12:16.983 --> 00:12:19.100
No one's ever guessed this.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.070
No.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.340
Answer is "Ladies Home Journal."

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.720
And so this was put in
"Ladies Home Journal."

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.090
And when it was put in
"Ladies Home Journal,"

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.291
it was actually one of the most
controversial things if 1919.

00:12:33.291 --> 00:12:35.540
Hundreds of women canceled
their "Ladies Home Journal"

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.310
subscriptions in
protest of this ad.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.969
But guess what?

00:12:39.969 --> 00:12:41.760
The ad changed people's
frame of reference.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.120
They started actually
talking about deodorants.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.790
And suddenly it was OK to
talk about antiperspirants.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.160
And sales went through the roof.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.680
And a few years
later, Edna Murphy

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.130
was able to sell her
company for millions.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.360
And so what she did was she
adapted her audience's frame

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.360
of reference.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.960
And she helped re-frame
the conversation.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.150
And Odo-Ro-No did this
by adapting to the fact

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.350
that people were worried
about health concerns

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.210
so they brought in the fact
that a doctor invented it.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.710
And they re-framed
the conversation

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.580
by making it OK to discuss.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.320
And so frames of
reference and framing

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.585
is this incredible power in
which we can pay attention

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.960
to certain things and not
others based on our backgrounds

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.690
and worldview.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.570
It's the reason why if you
talk about climate change

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.711
or you talk about
vaccines, one group

00:13:24.711 --> 00:13:26.460
is going to have a
very different reaction

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.590
than another.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.590
And in a funny way, it
does make sense sometimes

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.030
because if someone comes
to us and is telling us

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.670
how the earth is flat, why the
fuck should we listen to them?

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.120
It makes sense, but
then sometimes we

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.620
get into this kind of rut
where we miss important things.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.920
There are a couple ways to
create frames of reference

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.770
and to change
frame of reference.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.400
One big one is scarcity.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.190
So who likes Twinkies here?

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.650
Oh, thank God.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.200
No one.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.210
But Twinkies, as you
probably may remember,

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.085
a few years ago, the
company that owned them,

00:14:00.085 --> 00:14:01.410
Hostess, went bankrupt, right?

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.600
And suddenly, millions of
people went to the stores

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.030
to grab these things.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.350
And it was not for the reason
that they tasted any better.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.520
They still tasted like shit.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.189
But suddenly, they
became very popular.

00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:14.730
And the reason,
actually, the science

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.360
shows that we assign
higher value to things

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.750
that we feel are scarce.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.920
Specifically, when
we believe something

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.520
is scarce due to
outside circumstances.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.980
If something is scarce
because it is popular,

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.589
it does not raise
in value and we

00:14:27.589 --> 00:14:28.880
don't pay more attention to it.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.171
But if something is scarce
because of an outside force,

00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:33.150
because of a manufacturing
or some other thing,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.620
we assign much more value.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.630
In a Google example, let's
think about Gmail invites.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.800
I actually, someone paid
me $100 once for one

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.460
of my original Gmail invites.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.590
I was like, why the
f--oh, here you go.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.450
Thank you for the $100.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.290
But that scarcity element
does drive attention

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.270
and drives a different
frame of reference.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:55.050
Trigger number
three-- disruption.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.930
We pay attention to the things
that violate our expectations.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.364
And I'll explain
why in a moment.

00:15:00.364 --> 00:15:01.780
So there's this
one research study

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.570
where they want to
see which things would

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.934
stick in the memory longest.

00:15:04.934 --> 00:15:07.100
And so they would give
subjects different sentences.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.300
Standard ones like, the
maids were plating the food

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.425
on the table versus
the maid licked

00:15:13.425 --> 00:15:16.110
the ammonia off the floor.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.020
Now which one do you think
people had a better memory for?

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.610
It's actually a scientific term
called the bizarreness effect.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.370
And the reason we
remember this is actually

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.460
because of something called
violations expectancy theory.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.340
So imagine, for example,
we're on a date.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:31.840
All right.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.740
And we're just like sitting down
and suddenly, two giant clowns

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.160
come and just sit down
right next to us, right?

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.070
We're going to be paying
attention to them.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.550
But the reason why is because
we make an automatic threat

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.220
assessment.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.720
We have to figure out whether
this is a positive development

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.504
or we should run the fuck away.

00:15:48.504 --> 00:15:49.920
Maybe this is our
good friends who

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.711
are about to go visit
a children's hospital

00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:54.230
or maybe they're about to mug
us and we're about to die.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.070
Either way, we're going to
turn our attention to something

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.060
that violates our
expectations because we

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.410
have to protect ourselves.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.960
If you think about
how we originally

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.627
were as hunter gatherers when
our attention was scanning,

00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:05.710
we were looking for things
that were out of place.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.370
Maybe it's a saber tooth tiger,
maybe it's a potential food.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.190
We have the same
kind of instincts.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.898
And that's why we pay
attention to things

00:16:12.898 --> 00:16:14.180
that violate our expectations.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.554
And there's a couple examples,
especially in advertising,

00:16:16.554 --> 00:16:17.480
that work really well.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.870
This is a campaign a couple
years ago from Patagonia.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:20.760
They did a campaign.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.325
It was called Don't
Buy This Jacket.

00:16:23.325 --> 00:16:24.450
They're a clothing company.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.370
They're not supposed
to fucking say that.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.902
But they explain, when
you go into the ad

00:16:28.902 --> 00:16:30.360
deeper for that,
the reason they're

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.080
saying this is
because they don't

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.940
want people to unnecessarily
buy more stuff.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.390
They want to help repair
your clothing if you can.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.016
And of course, they'll sell you
a jacket if your jacket is old.

00:16:40.016 --> 00:16:41.723
But they'll help you
repair and they want

00:16:41.723 --> 00:16:42.890
to protect the environment.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.720
Funny enough, this ad telling
people not to buy their stuff

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.030
made more people buy
their stuff-- double

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.690
the amount within nine months.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.160
A whole ton of people
started buying their jackets

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.600
because people paid attention.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.380
It was a positive experience.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.010
The Old Spice guy's another
great example of this.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.810
Of positive destruction.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.060
Every five seconds diamonds
are suddenly coming out

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.810
of people's hands
and he's suddenly

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.496
on horses and diving into
cakes and who knows what else.

00:17:06.496 --> 00:17:08.329
But it's a very kind
of positive experience.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:09.740
And every few
seconds something is

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.114
happening different
that violates

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:14.119
your expectations of how the
world is supposed to work.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.849
The disruption has to match your
values is a very key thing I

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:17.920
want to mention.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.859
There is such a
thing as positive

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:20.965
versus negative attention.

00:17:20.965 --> 00:17:23.089
I think about what Nationwide
did at the Super Bowl

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:23.400
commercial.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.066
And the only thing I
think of Nationwide

00:17:25.066 --> 00:17:27.339
now is that
Nationwide kills kids.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:32.050
Now I'm going to show you the
actual ad from a few years ago.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.450
This one.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.560
This was an ad for Quiznos.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.550
And they had weird, freaky,
mutant, fucking rodents

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.560
advertising sandwiches.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.760
Why the fuck would you want any
of these things near your food?

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.270
How does that make
any sense at all?

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.670
And yet, a bunch
of execs decide,

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.000
you know what, this is
going to be a great idea.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.700
They went bankrupt last year.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.860
There is such a thing
as negative attention.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.990
This make no sense at all.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.350
It did not match their values.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.100
It was disruptive.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.390
People paid attention.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.620
But it didn't make people
buy their sandwiches.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.120
There is a clear difference.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.530
Trigger number four-- reward.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.780
And so I learned some
interesting things

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.800
about the reward
mechanisms of the brain.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.640
Most people think of
dopamine as the system

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.170
that creates pleasure but that's
actually a misunderstanding.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.710
I interviewed Dr. Kent
Barich, a leading researcher

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:31.240
in dopamine and reward
systems of the brain.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.130
And what he did is
this famous experiment

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.880
where he took the
dopamine out of lab mice

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.249
and he wanted to see
what would happen.

00:18:38.249 --> 00:18:40.790
And what he found was that the
mice could still feel pleasure

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.220
even with no dopamine.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.000
If you gave the
mouse sugar water,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.570
it would still find pleasure
drinking the sugar water.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.000
What happened though was that
the mice lost all motivation.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.420
These mice were so demotivated,
in fact, that they would rather

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.730
starve to death than eat.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.770
And almost all of them died
because they had no motivation

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.970
to live or to find
any kind of survival.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.340
And so dopamine actually
creates wanting.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.760
It creates a wanting
response in the brain.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.670
Opioids actually create
the actual pleasure.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.890
But when it comes to
attention, what's important

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.310
is our desire for something.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.790
We pay attention to
when we desire a reward,

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.890
whether it is an intrinsic
or extrinsic reward.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.060
Extrinsic rewards are
the kind of physical ones

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:27.030
that you're very well familiar
with-- money, food, sex.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.070
Very, very, clear things.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.610
And they really do capture our
attention in the short term.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.151
In fact, there was
a study that found

00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:36.210
that if you associate an
object with monetary gain,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.080
with money, even
just a few cents,

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.520
people's eyes will automatically
gravitate towards that object,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.780
even after that object is no
longer associated with money.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.700
But that's only
short term attention.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.220
Short attention.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.450
That doesn't capture
attention over the long term.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.160
Intrinsic rewards capture
attention over the long term.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.830
Things like self satisfaction
and purpose and mastery

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.620
and these kind of
self type of things

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.240
that motivate us in our jobs,
in our careers, in our lives.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.590
And family and order
and whatever things that

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.132
motivate you.

00:20:07.132 --> 00:20:08.548
Those are the kinds
of things that

00:20:08.548 --> 00:20:09.790
make people stay long term.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.810
You need both to capture
and maintain attention.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.840
But you can't just use one
or the other and succeed.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.040
And there are a couple
ways to create motivation

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.930
and to create
desire for a reward.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.950
One is the power of surprise.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.615
And so a couple years ago,
a company called Skopje,

00:20:25.615 --> 00:20:26.990
they wanted to
get more engineers

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.450
because it is obviously a
very, very competitive market.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.400
And so they're like, how do
we get some more engineers?

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.810
They're going to offer a bonus
of $11,000 for signing up.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:35.870
That's kind standard.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.020
But they decided,
you know, what we're

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.680
going to parody the most
interesting man in the world

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.480
campaign.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.285
So they wrapped $11,000
in cash in bacon.

00:20:42.285 --> 00:20:43.660
And then they
would also give you

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.300
Macoun 15, a oil
painting of yourself,

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.290
and my favorite, a harpoon gun.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.520
I don't know about you,
but I want a harpoon gun.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.710
Can I get a harpoon gun?

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:56.600
That would be nice.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.860
So this actually, this
campaign, got them

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.510
over 1,000 different
applications.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.770
And they were able to fill
their engineering seats.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.719
And so that surprise actually
helps capture attention

00:21:07.719 --> 00:21:08.760
when it comes to rewards.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.820
But it's also just the
fact of surprising people

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.725
with a reward.

00:21:11.725 --> 00:21:13.100
And so there was
a study that was

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.196
done-- there was a
study that what happened

00:21:16.196 --> 00:21:17.570
was that they
would have subjects

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.170
and they would
spray either water

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.910
or citrus into their mouths.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.440
And what they found was that
the people who could not

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.030
predict the order in which
citrus or water were going

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.850
to be sprayed into the mouths
felt much more pleasure,

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.370
had stronger member of
the task, and overall

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.560
paid more attention.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.450
It was a much more positive
and pleasant experience.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.130
And so most people deliver
rewards in incentive form.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.120
You do this, I'll give you this.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.720
And that is actually the least
effective type of reward.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.450
There many other better
types are rewards.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.370
There's a company
called Keep and what

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.430
they do is they specialize
in post action rewards.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.730
And what happens is
like, you do a task.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.520
Like you run two miles, you
get a high score in a game,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.100
and suddenly something
pops up being like,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.466
you've accomplished something.

00:22:02.466 --> 00:22:03.590
We want to give you a gift.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.910
A surprise gift.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.080
Maybe it's a Gatorade,
maybe it's an extra life,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.330
maybe it's some points.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.920
But that kind of surprise,
where people didn't expect

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.100
to get a reward
actually reinforces

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.300
behavior much
stronger and increases

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.450
attention and overall
is much stronger

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.670
when it comes to attention.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.170
Practically every other type
of reward delivery is better.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.990
Gifting, for example--
you're very used to it,

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.940
like in a social game being able
to give a life to your friends.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.784
Even though, as
you think about it,

00:22:30.784 --> 00:22:32.950
you're not actually giving
anything to your friends.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.590
It's actually coming
from the game.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.610
It just makes it look
like it's coming from you.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.500
But it actually creates
much more attention

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.220
because it feels like it's a
more personal sort of thing.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.320
Sneaky.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.080
Trigger number
five-- reputation.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.080
So I'm going to put this on
while we talk about reputation

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.440
in this interesting study.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.530
So a few years ago, there was
a study at Emory University

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.430
and what they did
was they looked

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.365
at the FMRIs of
students' brains as they

00:23:02.365 --> 00:23:04.350
were making economic decisions.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.910
I'm putting on a lab coat.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.700
I'll explain why in a moment.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.660
So they were looking at
the FMRIs of students

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.076
and they were
trying to figure out

00:23:12.076 --> 00:23:14.770
how the brain works while during
decision making in economics.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.922
And so they would have to
make economic decisions

00:23:16.922 --> 00:23:17.630
with their money.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.962
And as you could expect, the
critical thinking decision

00:23:19.962 --> 00:23:21.420
centers of the
brain would light up

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.628
whenever they were making
decisions with their money.

00:23:23.628 --> 00:23:25.210
And this is the
actual brain scans.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.730
But in half the cases, they
would have an expert come in

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:28.670
to give advice.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.280
In this case, an
economics professor.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.320
And it would always be
the conservative advice.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.850
And what they found was
when a subject was listening

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.960
to the expert, the decision
making centers of their brain

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.710
would completely shut off.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.860
It was as if they offloaded
the processing power

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.970
of their brains to the expert.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.130
And in fact, even
when the advice

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.520
that the expert was
giving was clearly wrong,

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.120
the subjects would more often go
with that advice than the other

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.530
because they're not thinking.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.209
And this is a phenomenon
known as directed deference.

00:24:00.209 --> 00:24:02.250
And directed deference
helps drive our attention.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.780
And so the reputation
triggers that we pay attention

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.620
to repeatable sources,
specifically authority figures,

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.130
the crowd, and most
of all, experts.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.300
In fact, and this
is a fun study,

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.505
if someone puts on a doctor's
coat and you tell them

00:24:17.505 --> 00:24:20.000
it's a doctor's coat,
and they do tasks,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.670
on average they will
have better attention,

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.570
they will make less mistakes,
and they will complete tasks

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:26.990
more effectively.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.070
Now if you give them
the very same coat

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.910
and you tell them
it's a painter's coat,

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.540
their attention will actually
go in the opposite direction.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.830
And they will
complete less tasks

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.490
and they'll be less effective.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:42.120
The mere perception of
expertise increases attention.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.750
That's why I'm wearing the coat.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.070
And so as I said before,
there are three key types

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.650
of reputable sources
that we pay attention to.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.516
Authority figures
have power over us

00:24:52.516 --> 00:24:54.140
and so we pay attention
as long as they

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.510
have that power over us.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.850
And the crowd kind of
acts like an expert.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.930
And you think about sites
like Yelp or a lot of others

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.534
where we go into those
the sites for ratings

00:25:03.534 --> 00:25:04.950
and we trust their
ratings because

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.700
of the collective
knowledge of the crowd.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.150
And we trust the crowd.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.890
So there's another reason why
we trust reputable sources

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:12.690
and experts.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.190
And the answer is actually
from this Edelmen Trust Survey.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.970
We trust them more than any
other type of spokesperson.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.200
And so you can see here the
most credible spokesperson out

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.110
of thousands and thousands of
people surveyed are experts.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:29.470
More than people like
you, more than executives,

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.970
and definitely more than CEOs.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.871
We really, really trust experts.

00:25:33.871 --> 00:25:36.120
And government officials are
somewhere in the basement

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.530
where they belong.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.360
And so key brands and
capturing attention

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.600
really revolves around
leveraging experts,

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.700
and leveraging the
power of experts,

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.770
and establishing your
credibility as an expert

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.740
as well.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.236
Odo-Ro-No did this by
leveraging the fact that it

00:25:51.236 --> 00:25:52.235
was created by a doctor.

00:25:55.837 --> 00:25:58.170
And leveraging the fact that
it was created by a doctor.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.900
And this is also the
same kind of reason

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.950
why things like Kickstarter
do very well because it's

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:07.050
the crowd's expertise showing
that a specific thing is

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.700
worth our attention and time.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.060
Two more triggers.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.040
Trigger number six.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.130
I can take this coat off.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.020
It's kinda hot.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.414
I'm stripping for you all.

00:26:16.414 --> 00:26:18.320
You're welcome.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.840
Mystery.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.940
So what movie is this?

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.590
Anyone want to guess?

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.080
That's right. "Cloverfield."

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.572
So I don't have time to
show the entire trailer

00:26:28.572 --> 00:26:29.280
of "Cloverfield."

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.100
But in the first trailer of
"Cloverfield," what happens

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.120
is there's people at a party,
suddenly there's a roar

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.630
and then the Statue of Liberty's
head falls into the street.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.050
There's no mention
of the movie's name

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.720
or what it's called
or what it's about.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.000
And this is a huge impetus
of the mystery trigger.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.680
And this is a JJ Abrams movie.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.220
He's a master at mysteries.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.781
At both using mysteries to
market his material because

00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:54.030
for example, we know barely
anything about "Star Wars"

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.390
and that's what he wants.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.970
And also in his storytelling.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.030
For "Lost," for example, famous
for having that cliffhanger

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.410
that would get people to
come back week to week.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.710
And so there are actually
two scientific reasons why

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.196
mysteries capture attention.

00:27:07.196 --> 00:27:09.320
The first is something
called the Zeigarnik Effect.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.730
So in the 1950s, there was
this Soviet researcher.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.910
Her name is Bluma Zeigarnik.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.940
And she is sitting
in a restaurant

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.920
and she's curious
about something.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.600
The waiters who are
taking her order

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.020
have perfect memory
of her orders

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.250
until they actually drop
it off over at the kitchen,

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.540
and suddenly, completely forget.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.400
Now why is that?

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.060
She's curious.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.670
So she gets a bunch of
students and a bunch of kids

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.370
and she has them do puzzles.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.320
But in half the case studies,
she takes their puzzles away.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.072
That's mean, right?

00:27:40.072 --> 00:27:41.780
A couple months later,
she would ask them

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.425
which puzzles they
would remember.

00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:44.050
And guess what.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.660
The only puzzles
they could remember,

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.080
the only tasks
they could remember

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.980
were the ones that
were incomplete.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.620
We have a much stronger memory
for incomplete the tasks,

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.460
incomplete thoughts,
incomplete storylines.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.790
Zeigarnik Effect.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.159
Now there's a second reason.

00:27:58.159 --> 00:27:59.950
Now, let's pretend you
and I are on a date.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.374
Actually, we'll go on a date.

00:28:01.374 --> 00:28:02.540
We've been on a date before.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.290
So pretend we're on a date.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.150
Now if we're on a first
date, what we're going to do,

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.920
typically, is small talk, right?

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.080
Kind of things like where are
you from, what do you like,

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.270
that sort of thing.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.610
And the reason why we do that
is actually because of a thing

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.220
called uncertainty
reduction principal.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.800
And essentially, we don't
like uncertainty in our lives.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.030
It makes us uncomfortable.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.800
And we meet a stranger, there's
nothing but uncertainly.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.536
We don't know anything
about each other.

00:28:26.536 --> 00:28:27.910
And so what we're
trying to do is

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.350
relieve the uncertainty so we
can figure out whether or not

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.808
I want to hang out
with this person

00:28:31.808 --> 00:28:35.210
or be friends or get the
fuck away as far as I can.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.310
All depends, right?

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.460
And so in the case of
uncertainty reduction

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.520
principle, it applies
all across the board.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.156
When we're left
with a cliffhanger

00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:44.530
and we're left
with a mystery, we

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.230
want to relieve
that uncertainty.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.809
We want to resolve
that storyline.

00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:49.600
And then when we don't,
we start filling it

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.532
in with speculation
and uncertainty.

00:28:52.532 --> 00:28:54.240
The Malaysian Airlines
disaster last year

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.120
is a perfect example of this.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.630
It's not the first
time a plane went down.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.780
But planes aren't
supposed to disappear.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.040
And so when this
one disappeared,

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.410
suddenly, it was on
the media for months.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.094
Why?

00:29:07.094 --> 00:29:08.510
Because we don't
like uncertainty,

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.210
so we start filling
with speculation.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:11.000
Especially CNN.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.890
They loved filling
it with speculation.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.190
Thank you, CNN.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.320
And they kept filling it
with all this speculation.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.320
Trying to-- what's going on?

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:17.850
Where did it go?

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:18.690
All that sort of thing.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.648
And the reason, again,
why is because we do not

00:29:20.648 --> 00:29:22.390
like that uncertainty.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.940
We have to fill it in.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.850
It's the same reason
also why, for example, I

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.240
don't know if anyone remembers
a year ago, Justine Sacco.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.220
She was an exec at IAC.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.650
And she before she
gets on the plane she

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.234
decides to tweet something
along the lines of "I'm

00:29:37.234 --> 00:29:37.900
going to Africa.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:38.830
Hope I don't get AIDS.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:39.470
Oh and wait.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.760
I'm white."

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.650
She does this.

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:42.890
She gets on a plane.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.210
And then she's off Wi-Fi.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.690
By the time she
gets off the plane,

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.690
she's the number one
trending topic in the world

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.880
and she's the most
reviled person on Twitter.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.070
And the reason why is
because she couldn't

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.450
close the uncertainty gap.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.150
She couldn't close
the mystery loop.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.410
Everyone started
filling speculation

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.380
of how is she going to react?

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.350
Who is this person?

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.670
Why would she say such a thing?

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.770
In fact, Steve Martin
tweeted something offensive

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.770
as well in the same
time period but nothing

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:06.850
happened to him because
he was able to delete

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.260
his Tweet within two
minutes and post an apology.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.300
Mystery done.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.020
Justine Sacco could
not and that's

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.605
why she became the number
one trending topic.

00:30:16.605 --> 00:30:19.230
And so there are a couple things
when you think about mysteries

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.200
to capture attention.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.220
The mystery trigger.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.680
One is to create suspense.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.305
And I don't think
the sound is working,

00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:27.290
but we're going to
try a video anyway.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.970
This was one of
the Budweiser ads

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.020
from this year's Super Bowl.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.380
And I love any reason to add
puppies to a conversation.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:39.110
And in this case, this was
one of the most popular ads.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:41.220
And part of the reason
is because of suspense.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.892
And so you know that Budweiser's
not going to kill the puppy.

00:30:44.892 --> 00:30:45.850
They're not Nationwide.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.435
But there is this moment to
moment suspense of what's

00:30:52.435 --> 00:30:53.810
going to happen
to the puppy, how

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.606
is it going to
escape the wolves,

00:30:55.606 --> 00:30:56.980
how is it going
to get back home.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.110
And there was a
study that actually

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.210
found that the more
moment to moment suspense

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:02.362
we feel in an advertisement,
the more memory we're

00:31:02.362 --> 00:31:04.320
going to have it, the
more we'll pay attention,

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.245
and the more positive reaction
we'll have to that ad.

00:31:07.245 --> 00:31:08.620
And that's part
of the reason why

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.744
I believe this one was one
of the most popular ones

00:31:10.744 --> 00:31:12.550
of this year's Super Bowl.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.660
And so another tool for
capturing attention.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.510
Can't do another one even
tough I love the puppies.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.080
So another key tool
is using cliffhangers.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.160
And so creating the
cliffhangers, whether it's

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.971
in advertising, or
in your storytelling,

00:31:25.971 --> 00:31:28.220
or maybe just a cliffhanger
to get people to come back

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.150
to the next meeting.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.770
Captures attention again
because of that uncertainty gap.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:36.770
You should use cliffhangers
when you can unless you're

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.370
going through a press crisis.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.380
Like that guy.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.780
So everyone knows that
guy or most of you

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.840
know that guy, maybe.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.210
And this is Brian Williams.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:50.320
And what happened with
him was he basically

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.700
lied about what happened
when he was in the war zone.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.830
And he put out what amounted
to a half-assed apology.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.430
It was kind of like, "I sort
of mis-remembered, blah, blah,

00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.930
blah."

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.110
What it didn't do was
complete the mystery gap

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.610
and complete the mystery.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:06.090
And so people filled in with
speculation until suddenly,

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:11.180
more reports came out to a
point where he had to step down.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.130
On the other hand, regardless
of what you think of this guy,

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.640
there was no mystery gap.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.240
When his allegations
came out, he

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.120
came out hard and being like,
here's exactly fact ABC.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.640
Go look.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.140
That's it.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:22.966
Done.

00:32:22.966 --> 00:32:23.590
And guess what?

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.400
He still has a job.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.600
Again, regardless of
what you think of him,

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.730
he's still in his chair
and Brian Williams is not.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.730
But there's actually a
couple good tech examples

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:31.730
of this as well.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.540
So a couple years
ago, Airbnb-- I

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.290
don't know if anyone remembers
this-- but they had a renter.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.576
They had a gal named EJ and
she rented out her place

00:32:39.576 --> 00:32:41.200
and she came back
and it was completely

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.770
ransacked-- destroyed,
burned, everything stolen.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.730
And Airbnb was kind of
slow to helping her our

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.250
in fixing the problem.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.610
So she wrote a
blog post about it.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:52.620
It went viral.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.890
Everyone wrote about it.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.520
And when it started
going viral, Airbnb

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.760
felt like it had to respond.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.030
So Brian Chesky wrote
that on Hacker News, which

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.160
basically says, "hi, everyone.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.690
We were shocked when we heard
about this unsettling event.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:08.340
We have been working closely
with the authorities, blah,

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.600
blah, blah, blah.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.531
It is written by a lawyer.

00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:12.530
It sounds like a lawyer.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:13.590
There is no apology.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:16.100
It doesn't resolve jack shit.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.210
Guess what?

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.040
The mystery continued.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.600
EJ put out another post.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.560
The thing went more viral.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.990
Airbnb looked even worse
until finally, they

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:26.470
put out the right statement.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.960
They put out this blog post.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.480
This one, which said, like,
with EJ, we got this wrong.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.370
We let her down.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.410
And we are sorry.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:36.720
And we fucked up.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.690
And here's how we're
going to fix it.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.900
When they did that,
the story was over

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.860
because they completed
the mystery loop,

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.709
the gap of uncertainty was
filled and the story died.

00:33:47.709 --> 00:33:49.750
And so when it comes to
a press crisis like that,

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:52.240
your number one goal
is to end the mystery.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.490
Exactly here is we
fucked up and here's

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.510
how we're going to fix it.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.600
Final trigger.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.516
And then questions, if
you have any questions.

00:34:00.516 --> 00:34:01.824
Think about your questions now.

00:34:01.824 --> 00:34:02.490
Acknowledgement.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.400
The most powerful of my
captivation triggers.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.211
And so there was this
one study that-- yeah,

00:34:09.211 --> 00:34:10.460
it was pretty cruel, actually.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.370
And what they did was
they strapped electrodes

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.449
to the ankles of married women.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.207
Yeah, pretty much.

00:34:18.207 --> 00:34:19.540
And there were three conditions.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.159
Condition one.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.750
Married woman sitting alone.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.030
Condition two.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:29.000
Married woman could hold
the hand of a stranger.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Condition three.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.530
Married woman could hold
the hand of her husband.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.920
And so what they
found was that when

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.598
the married women who had
no one to hold the hand of

00:34:39.598 --> 00:34:41.389
felt the most pain
because they had nowhere

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.210
to direct their attention.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.510
And the married women who
could hold the husband's hands

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.254
felt the least pain
because they had

00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:50.420
someone they love to direct
their attention towards.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.520
But what I found
fascinating about this study

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.300
was that there was
a direct correlation

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.240
between the strength of the
marriage and the amount of pain

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.590
that these women felt.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:03.040
The more connected they felt
to their spouse, the less pain

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:03.850
they felt.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:07.120
And it kind of shows how
powerful this acknowledgement

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.850
and this connection is.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.600
This connection is so
powerful that it can

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.180
reduce an even eliminate pain.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.250
And so the key to the
acknowledgement trigger

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.500
is that we pay attention to
the people and things that

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.250
pay attention to us and
provide us with validation,

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:23.050
empathy, and understanding.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.469
And one example of
this is actually

00:35:25.469 --> 00:35:26.510
in our celebrity culture.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.280
And so this is Adrian Grenier
from the show "Entourage"

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.850
and this is Dr.
Thomas de Zengotita.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.800
And I interviewed them
for "Captivology."

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.341
And you wouldn't think that they
would be experts in anything

00:35:35.341 --> 00:35:37.890
like this, but actually, they
did a documentary together

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:44.870
called "Teenage Paparazzo" on
a 15-year-old teenage paparazzi

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.079
and following him
around and exploring

00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:49.120
why we pay attention to
celebrities and celebrity

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:49.940
culture.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.110
And we had this long
conversation about why.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.060
And we kind of came
to the conclusion,

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.460
one of the major reasons we
pay attention to celebrities

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.930
is because they're, in a way,
a reflection of ourselves.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:00.270
They are a piece
of our identity.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.380
It says something about
you, whether you're

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.280
a fan of Justin
Bieber or Rachel Ray

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:10.150
or Sheryl Sandberg or
an Apple or a Google

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.450
or a whichever company.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.019
It says something about
you and your identity.

00:36:15.019 --> 00:36:16.810
And we are looking for
things that validate

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.780
our identity in some way.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.380
In fact, actually,
Buzzfeed, for example--

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.710
I interviewed Jonah
Peretti the CEO Buzzfeed--

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.760
and what I learned
from them is that they

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.980
do a lot of this kind
of validation aspect.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.730
One article that I
read about is that they

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.220
did was "54 Things
That Minnesotans Are

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.270
Too Humble To Brag About."

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.770
Now, this article went viral,
especially in Minnesota,

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:39.810
as you could imagine.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.226
But the reason why
is because it's

00:36:41.226 --> 00:36:44.420
a validation, a positive
affirmation of a key identity,

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.870
for a key demographic.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.570
And it's saying it's great
to be from Minnesota.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.160
And Buzzfeed puts these
articles and these quizzes

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.510
out all the time.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:58.367
'90s Kids or from Chicago
or works in X industry.

00:36:58.367 --> 00:36:59.450
They do this all the time.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.699
And it's always very positive.

00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:01.610
They affirm.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.550
They go for EQ over IQ.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:07.869
And it works really well for
capturing attention for them.

00:37:07.869 --> 00:37:09.535
So there's actually
a term for all this,

00:37:09.535 --> 00:37:12.060
and especially for our
relationship with celebrities.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.210
It's called the
parasocial relationship.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.970
And so it is our capability
to feel a two-way relationship

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.730
with a one-way figure.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.920
And I'll give an example.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.900
There is-- my old
boss at "Mashable,"

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.610
she works for Rachel Ray now.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.130
And what happened
was Rachael Ray

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.660
came out for Obamacare, right?

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.716
And what suddenly
happened was there

00:37:33.716 --> 00:37:36.090
was a whole bunch of women
who came out and they're like,

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.730
how could you do this?

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.690
You've betrayed me.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.420
I thought I knew you.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.290
The fuck?

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.660
How does this make any sense?

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.370
It makes sense
because people can

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.230
feel as deep of a
connection with a figure

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.040
like that as they can with their
best friend or their families.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.510
Parasocial relationship.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.000
It's why we can fall
in love with a brand

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.119
or a musician or an artist.

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:00.910
And the case, for
example, of Taylor Swift.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.290
She's a master at
parasocial relationships.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.630
So last year, she was
doing YouTube videos.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.320
And it was YouTube videos
of her wrapping gifts

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.310
and sending it to
a few of her fans.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:13.410
And this created a frenzy
in her entire community.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.640
She didn't have to give a
gift to every single member

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.550
of her community, to all
over fans-- just a few

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.530
to show that she cared
about them as a collective.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.910
And as a result, they
paid attention back

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:29.120
and made her album the number
one album of last year.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.490
She did a fantastic job
of building that community

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:32.820
and building that relationship.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.475
And she scaled her relationship
with her community.

00:38:35.475 --> 00:38:36.850
Now there are a
couple other ways

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.530
to build that kind of
identity and that validation

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.360
and that acknowledgement.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.980
And it is this way.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.990
It is through the
power of participation.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.530
So some of you may
know this story.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:52.400
In the 1950s, Betty Crocker
and all the big cake mixing

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.120
and food mixing companies at
the time like Duncan Hines

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.400
and Pillsbury, they were trying
to get cake mix off the ground.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.450
But cake mix wasn't taking off
with the female demographic,

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:04.020
not like Bisquik did.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.239
And they were stumped.

00:39:06.239 --> 00:39:07.780
Betty Crocker's
like, why is this not

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.230
being getting
bought by everybody.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.710
So they brought
in two researchers

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:14.230
to come in and give them
advice on what's going on.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.960
And they figured
it out, actually.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:21.520
The reason why it wasn't
taking off was eggs.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.574
Now back then, eggs actually
came in powdered form.

00:39:24.574 --> 00:39:26.990
You could just have the powdered
eggs, you just put it in.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:28.500
You didn't have to have
the fresh eggs with you.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.690
And in fact, if you
actually try these recipes,

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.190
there really isn't
much a difference

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:35.230
between a powdered
egg and a fresh egg.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:38.020
But what they found
was that women

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.070
didn't feel like
they were making

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:43.580
any contribution to the recipe
in the cake mix version.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.650
And so what Betty Crocker
did was literally make

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.210
their product harder to use.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.840
And the result was that their
sales went through the roof

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.780
and they won the
cake mixing wars

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:58.170
by making it so that you had
to break eggs into the recipe.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.442
And it worked
really, really well

00:40:00.442 --> 00:40:01.900
because they enabled
their audience

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.430
to participate and provide
some kind of validation,

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:05.890
to provide their input.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:07.640
It's the same kind of
reason, for example,

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.250
why Kickstarter is so powerful.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:12.250
Yes, Exploding Kittens.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.730
I can't wait to get my deck.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:16.360
And it's because not just
are you buying something--

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.040
it's pretty much
a buying website--

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.730
but you feel like that you're
providing some kind of input.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.574
You are helping a company
get off the ground.

00:40:24.574 --> 00:40:25.990
You are providing
something extra.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.850
You are part of that community.

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.654
A couple years ago, I remember,
Vitamin Water-- they actually

00:40:30.654 --> 00:40:32.070
asked their community
to help name

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.600
the next flavor of Vitamin
Water and actually create

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.440
the next flavor.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.330
And it was a campaign
and it went really viral.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.455
And they allowed their
audience to put their input.

00:40:40.455 --> 00:40:42.246
And they eventually
came up with one called

00:40:42.246 --> 00:40:43.790
"Connect," based off Facebook.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.450
And it did really well and
their sales went up as a result,

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:49.840
again because they allowed
their community to participate

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.270
and that alone created
that acknowledgement

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.180
with their audience.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.130
And so I've talked about
the seven key triggers.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:00.760
Automaticity, framing,
disruption, reward, reputation,

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.251
mystery, and acknowledgement.

00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:03.750
And you'll kind of
notice that these

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.490
triggers go across all
three stages of attention.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:09.205
Automaticity is very powerful
in immediate attention,

00:41:09.205 --> 00:41:11.580
while disruption is a very
powerful trigger for capturing

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.720
short attention, while mysteries
and acknowledgement are

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.800
powerful tools for
long attention,

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.542
get people to have
long term interest.

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:20.000
Because it's not
enough to just get

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.510
people to pay attention
to your ad or to your idea

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.680
or to your campaign.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.810
But you need people to become
customers and users and fans.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.130
And the last thing I
will say that I learned

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.850
from this process is
from all the interviews

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.350
I did with all these
masters of attention

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:41.330
is that the masters of attention
don't try to capture attention

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.605
for themselves.

00:41:42.605 --> 00:41:44.730
They're trying to get
attention for their products,

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:46.640
their projects, and their ideas.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.810
They're not trying
to be me, me, me.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.820
They're trying to get a cause
and to promote something

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.930
that is bigger and beyond them.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.880
And that is a much more powerful
version and much more powerful

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.880
form of attention.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.500
And I guess that is a
sign that it's done.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.320
So you know what?

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.824
Thank you, very much.

00:42:04.824 --> 00:42:11.015
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:11.015 --> 00:42:11.890
AUDIENCE: I am Darcy.

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.820
I am a hardware
reliability engineer,

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.620
and I'm curious about this
colors and competency study

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.280
thing.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.789
Is that dependent on culture?

00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:23.330
BEN PARR: It is
dependent on culture.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.663
And so I didn't mention in
this part of the presentation

00:42:25.663 --> 00:42:29.780
but the cultural associations
really do impact color.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.500
I was talking specifically
about US and Western.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.970
Couple different examples.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.159
Green is terrible
packaging in China

00:42:37.159 --> 00:42:39.700
because green is associated with
funerals and death in China.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.680
And in fact, it is a very poor
performing packaging color

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.190
in that country.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:47.200
Red has significantly
different associations

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.460
across different cultures.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.550
There are a few things
that are the same.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.234
Like for example, blue.

00:42:52.234 --> 00:42:54.650
If you, for example, there was
a study that actually found

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.410
that if you put schizophrenics
under blue light, regardless

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.750
of which culture,
they will be calmer

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.722
and they will be more relaxed.

00:43:01.722 --> 00:43:03.180
And if you put them
in a red light,

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.000
they will be more energetic
and they'll be more jumpy

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.380
and they'll be more agitated.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.050
So there are some
that are universal.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.383
But there's a lot that are
different culture by culture.

00:43:10.383 --> 00:43:12.670
And I actually provide
some resources in the book

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.944
and some links and examples
of different colors

00:43:14.944 --> 00:43:15.860
in different cultures.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.190
And there's actually
an amazing color wheel

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.560
that shows the associations
different cultures have

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.580
with different cultures.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.205
The reason why I
focus so much on color

00:43:22.205 --> 00:43:26.200
is because color provides the
majority of initial assessment

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.890
when people are
looking at a brand.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.710
If people look at a
symbol for the first time,

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.350
the majority of their assessment
will be purely from the color

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:34.800
as well.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.290
AUDIENCE: I'm actually
a video game designer.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:38.670
And I just wanted
to let you know

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:42.320
that I had seen
something very similar

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.600
that somebody had
described in trying

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.600
to figure out how to get people
to play early arcade video

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.990
games.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.260
A woman ran a company
and she talked

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.810
about the first quarter,
the second quarter,

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.310
and the thousandth quarter.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.550
And the idea that it's first
getting their attention

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.130
and then having them
have that reaction of OK,

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:02.080
I played it once.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.640
Now I want to try it again.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.130
And then having
something in there

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:09.240
that keeps them going
1,000 quarter drops later.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.270
And just the games
industry looks

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:15.250
at trying to keep people's
attention particularly

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:18.660
on social media games, as
you mentioned, like the stuff

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.970
on Facebook.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.990
So it seems like there are a lot
of commonalities in what you're

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.420
talking about there.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.310
BEN PARR: Exactly.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:26.550
One of the people I
interviewed and one

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:28.380
of my favorite
interviews for the book,

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.650
is Shigeru Miyamoto, the
creator of Super Mario.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:33.360
And I got to interview
him at E3 a few years ago.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.610
And he talked me
through why Mario

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:38.809
captures so much attention
across all three stages.

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:40.350
So I don't know if
you all know this,

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.810
but the original Super
Mario, when they first

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.312
created the character, they
only had 16 by 16 pixels.

00:44:45.312 --> 00:44:47.770
And they're like, how do we
make this guy more distinctive?

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:49.910
How do we have him
pop out on the screen?

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.540
Well, we got to make his nose
big because that's the only way

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.320
to see he even has a nose.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.936
So they made his nose big.

00:44:55.936 --> 00:44:57.310
But you couldn't
even tell he had

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:59.840
a nose so they put a
mustache on it so you

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.340
could define the nose.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.560
Now it was impossible to
do hair in 16 by 16 pixels.

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.450
So we're going to
give him a red cap.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:09.050
And a shirt didn't really pop
out at all, shirt and pants,

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:10.390
so they gave him overalls.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:15.020
And that's actually why Super
Mario has big nose, moustache,

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.190
a hat, and overalls.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.700
But that's just
immediate attention.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.100
They really focused on that
kind of gameplay element,

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.510
getting people to try to
achieve the reward of getting

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:24.968
that high score,
getting to the end

00:45:24.968 --> 00:45:26.940
of that level, and that
loop every single time,

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.490
within a specific game.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:32.330
But the reason why we play every
Mario game and love and all

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.205
that sort of thing is
because we fall in love

00:45:34.205 --> 00:45:35.120
with the characters.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.980
We know the key elements
of every single Mario game.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.460
There's always
going to be Koopas.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.400
There's always going
to be gold coins.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.586
There's always going to
be a Bowser somewhere.

00:45:43.586 --> 00:45:45.960
And that kind of element makes
us come back for each game

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.260
because we have the familiarity.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.426
While each game is different
enough in terms of game

00:45:49.426 --> 00:45:52.360
play to make us
find something new.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.770
Whether it's going to a Mario
galaxy or a new platform

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.910
or that sort of thing.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:58.420
And so that's part
of why Mario has

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.080
become an icon over decades.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.580
And so many other games
have fallen by the wayside.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.430
AUDIENCE: I am wondering
what suggestions

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.490
you have for getting people to
pay attention to and not only

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:11.310
pay attention to,
but take action

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:13.840
in regard to
environmental issues,

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.120
such as water conservation
and climate change.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.750
BEN PARR: Oh.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.890
Oh.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.951
I mean, I went through a
lot of framing research

00:46:21.951 --> 00:46:22.950
to think about that one.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:24.991
Because there's a couple
things that go about it.

00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:26.930
It's really a
framing issue, right?

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:32.300
It's elevating the
importance of that knowledge

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.930
to a level where people will be
forced to pay attention, right?

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.304
Because there's
a whole-- there's

00:46:36.304 --> 00:46:39.470
a segment of the population
that absolutely and thank

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.030
God believes that we
have huge issues coming

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:44.654
with water conservation
and climate change.

00:46:44.654 --> 00:46:46.070
And yet, there's
still a huge part

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.930
of the population
that will not even

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:51.240
listen to you if you mention
these things because they have

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.390
been indoctrinated
with years of hearing

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:57.340
a different side of the story.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.850
Now there's a couple different
ways to kind of go about it.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:02.058
You can find a way to adapt
to the frame of reference

00:47:02.058 --> 00:47:04.140
and not go directly and
be like, you're wrong.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.730
Because that will
actually not work.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:07.820
You have to find a
way to get actually

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.510
them to agree on a little thing
and that actually opens up

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:11.839
the door lot more.

00:47:11.839 --> 00:47:13.630
You get them to agree
on the smallest thing

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.730
and that will make them
more receptive to an idea.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:16.620
There's a couple other things.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.800
One interesting
thing I learned is

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.070
the illusion of truth effect.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.230
And this might not necessarily
help you get attention for it,

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:22.605
but it'll help
you understand why

00:47:22.605 --> 00:47:24.400
people believe what they do.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.760
And it is purely that the
more you repeat a phrase,

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.690
the more likely people
will believe it is true.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.660
And they did a study
where they would

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:38.040
have people go through like
30 or 40 phrases every couple

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.360
weeks and they would
rate how true they were.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.600
And every time they
went through it,

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.130
they would rate the statements
that they saw over and over

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:48.800
again as more true,
despite the fact

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.280
that repeating a
statement does not

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.880
make a thing more or less true.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.880
But it actually has that
kind of profound effect

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.780
in our brains and our minds.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.890
And so when it comes
to getting attention

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:00.576
for that sort of
thing, it's going

00:48:00.576 --> 00:48:01.700
through those three stages.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.430
It's how do you get
people to pay attention

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:04.471
to it in the first place?

00:48:04.471 --> 00:48:06.900
If they don't know anything
about it, disruption trigger.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.910
Getting people to violate
their expectations

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:10.993
with something that'll
make them turn their heads.

00:48:10.993 --> 00:48:13.440
I think about anti
smoking campaigns.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.210
In Thailand, they
had a campaign where

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:19.100
they had little kids with
cigarettes in their mouths,

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.400
asking adults for lights that
had cigarettes in their mouths.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.990
And the adults would be like,
you shouldn't be smoking.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:26.230
It's causes cancer.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.840
And the kids would be like,
then why are you smoking it?

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.040
And that went viral not just
in Thailand but all across

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.920
because it violated
people's expectations,

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.050
and it really drove
the point home.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:37.890
But then, it kind of
comes in long term.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.223
It depends on the audience
that you're really going for.

00:48:40.223 --> 00:48:42.670
I suspect that you
have a huge group.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:45.240
There's one group that just
will not believe what you say.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.050
And it's going to
require different tactics

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.290
and you have to really think
about the framing trigger.

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:51.520
And you have this audience
that thinks it's important

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.590
but maybe they're not
being active enough.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:55.532
And they know that
there's sort of a problem,

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:57.240
but they don't think
of it strong enough.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.760
And I think that maybe have
to violate their expectations

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.470
and jolt them out of their
complacency and be like, here

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:04.264
is what is effing happening.

00:49:04.264 --> 00:49:05.930
And I'm not sure what
that kind of thing

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:08.672
is but you need to jolt them
out of their expectations.

00:49:08.672 --> 00:49:10.130
I would love to
talk about that one

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:12.213
further because that's a
hard problem that I still

00:49:12.213 --> 00:49:15.560
haven't fully figured out
how we solve that one.

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.550
All right.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:17.800
I think that's good.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.340
So if you want to ask
me more questions,

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.690
feel free to email me or tweet
at me or Google+ me or all that

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:26.591
other fun stuff.

00:49:26.591 --> 00:49:28.090
And I hope you'll
check out the book

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:30.670
because it has a lot more
of that scientific research

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:32.620
and interesting stories
and more tips on how

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.290
you capture attention and
how attention really works.

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.665
So I want to thank you all
for being an awesome audience.

00:49:37.665 --> 00:49:40.050
