00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.500
Welcome to statistics,
the science of decisions.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.762
But before we get started with
the class Sean, Katie, and

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:11.020
I want to talk to you a little bit about
what our expectations are for you and

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.820
what you should expect
to learn in the class.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.420
&gt;&gt; As you know,
this is an online course and

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.770
online courses differ greatly
from in-class courses.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.420
First, you will not be coming to
a classroom two to three times a week.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.100
Instead, you'll be working from home or
wherever.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.040
Whether it's on a mobile device,
a tablet or a PC.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.942
One thing that you should notice is
that this is a self-paced course.

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:37.100
That means, you are responsible for
deciding when and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.200
where you complete the material.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.500
&gt;&gt; Because this is online and
this is self-paced,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.210
a lot of the responsibility
falls on you.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.100
You need to find the motivation
to come to class,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.530
and, by class, I mean going to
the online course every day.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.310
It's important that you distribute
your learning over time.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.470
Online courses,
it's easy to fall away and

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.200
forget about them because you're
not driving to a campus every day.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.410
So you have to remember to check in and
time manage, in a way, so

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.780
that you are learning a little
bit about statistics every day.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.430
That will make the learning better and

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.140
that will make the course
a lot more enjoyable.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.420
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is important for

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.150
you guys to take responsibility, but the
main objective is for you guys to learn.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.930
And, yes, you're going to struggle
sometimes, but that's the whole point.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.220
At Udacity, we want to give you
a quiz to make you struggle first, so

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.060
that you form your own ideas about this
concept before we start teaching you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.800
the formalized statistical
way of learning it.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.960
&gt;&gt; I would also encourage you to
take advantage of your classmates.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.650
There's a lot of knowledge out there and

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.280
there's a lot of knowledge about
statistics already, so use each other.
