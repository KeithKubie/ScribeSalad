DENNIS GIACINO: Hey everybody.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.750
Thank you.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.610
Thanks so much for spending some
time this afternoon with us.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.620
That's the director of
the show, Fiely Matias.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.260
He helped me co-create the
show with a GoPro of course.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.274
And so I'm going
to introduce you

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:05.690
to some of the ladies who are
going to sing with us today.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.720
But let me tell you about
the show real quick.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.940
So the show "DISENCHANTED!" is
about the original fairytale

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.420
princesses from the
old story books who've

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.430
really kind of have it up
to their crowns with the way

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.710
that they're portrayed
in today's pop culture

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.520
as helpless damsels in distress,
specifically the Disney films.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.550
So they've come to life.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.310
They've come out
of the story books

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.050
and onto the off Broadway stage
to tell the truth about happily

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.680
ever after.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.690
They bippity boppity bust
out a little princess show

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.720
of their own.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.439
So before we get
into the show, let

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.980
me introduce some
other folks who are

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.730
going to sing for you today.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.340
Let's see.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.064
First off, we have our
Princess who kissed the frog.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.105
That's Karen Burthwright.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:48.950
[CHEERING]

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.190
Right after her is our
Little Mermaid, Alison Burns.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.510
[CHEERING]

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.451
And then of course we
have Erin Leigh Peck,

00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:56.700
who we're going to talk about.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.950
She plays a whole slew of
princesses in the show.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.690
And of course, our Mulan,
and that's Lulu Picart.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.780
Great.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.010
Over at the piano is
Michael Raby on the keys.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.150
We're here all week.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.110
Try the Veal.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.360
OK, so the show itself.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.790
You know what it's about.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.680
Let's talk about how
we came up with it.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.560
So I used to be
history teacher and I

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.520
used to teach about
Pocahontas all the time

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.460
in American history to little
seventh and eighth graders.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.261
Thank god I'm
doing that anymore.

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.480
No, it was fun.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.220
It was great.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.450
It was great.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.930
Never grow older,
you're so cute now.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.300
So I taught history and
taught about Pocahontas.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.860
The real Pocahontas in
history, about the time

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.280
she supposedly met John
Smith, she was 10 years old

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.190
and she was little tomboy.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.280
And then of course,
out came the movie,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.330
the Disney movie in 1995.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.590
And there was Pocahontas
and she was all

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.040
growed up in all growed out.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.470
And she was about
20-something years old.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.460
And she was leaping
and doing swan dives

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.160
off waterfalls and leaves
were following her everywhere.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.020
And I thought, I wonder
what the 10-year-old tomboy,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.757
the real Pocahontas thinks
about this Pocahontas up

00:03:13.757 --> 00:03:14.340
on the screen.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.990
And so I wrote a song,
and I started to wonder.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.810
And Erin's like that's the
name of my song "I Wonder."

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.710
I'm up now.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.750
And so I started to wonder
what would the other princesses

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.940
from the Disney movies,
from the original tales

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.640
think about their counterparts
in the Disney movies.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.350
Look what the directory
does, he moves a mic stand.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.990
And--

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.500
ERIN LEIGH PECK:
That's really stealthy,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.760
you can't even see him.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.210
DENNIS GIACINO: $3,000 a week.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.876
ERIN LEIGH PECK: How
did that get there?

00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:41.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.930
DENNIS GIACINO: So I
started to wonder what

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.350
do the other processes think.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.186
And here's Erin Leigh Peck.

00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:48.936
One thing you should
know about Erin Leigh

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:52.130
is Erin Leigh Peck
plays, let's see,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.710
Snow White, Cinderella,
Sleeping Beauty,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.784
the Little Mermaid,
Rapunzel and Belle.

00:03:58.784 --> 00:03:59.700
ERIN LEIGH PECK: Bing.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.700
DENNIS GIACINO: She's
understudies all of those.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.340
She's learned every one of
those roles in the show.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.940
She's a superwoman.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.340
And she's going to sing a song.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.756
ERIN LEIGH PECK: Congratulations
for doing your job, Erin.

00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:11.237
DENNIS GIACINO: That's right.

00:04:11.237 --> 00:04:13.070
She's going to sing a
song called "I Wonder"

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.420
which sort of sums up how
I came up with the show.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.100
Here she is, Erin Leigh
Peck and "I Wonder."

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.390
[MUSIC ERIN LEIGH PECK, "I
 WONDER"]

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.650
ERIN LEIGH PECK: Wonder no
more because "DISENCHANTED!"

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.540
is here to tell you the truth.

00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:40.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.230
DENNIS GIACINO: Erin
Leigh Peck, terrific.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.240
Great.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.110
Now of course, one such princess
I wondered about, of course,

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.140
was the Little Mermaid.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.170
Now her story, all the way
back in Hans Christian Andersen

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:57.772
books, she starts out as this
little teenage girl who's

00:07:57.772 --> 00:07:58.980
swims around under the ocean.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.730
And she decides
to give up one day

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:06.240
her father, her fin, even her
voice, all her friends just

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.900
to net a man.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.870
And that man happens to
be in love with somebody

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.170
else who he falls
in love with her

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.354
and then she decides
oh well, I've

00:08:17.354 --> 00:08:18.520
got to get rid of that girl.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.656
So she decides I want
to kill that girl.

00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:22.280
And she goes to try
and kill that girl,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.363
but then decides she's
going to kill self instead,

00:08:24.363 --> 00:08:25.880
throws her overboard sorry.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.360
And throws herself overboard
and drowns in the ocean,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.980
becomes sea foam
forever and hovers over

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.230
hims like a stalker.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.059
Yeah, so it's not
a Lifetime movie.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.409
It's actually a Hans
Christian Andersen story.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.580
So I decided that
was a bit much.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.930
And Disney kind of kept
true to most of that

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.140
about this girl who
gave up everything

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.480
she had just to get a guy.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.020
Now, we've all been
in relationships

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.610
and we kind of do that right?

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.710
And we give up a little
bit of ourselves.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.510
So I decided I wanted to write
this song about the Little

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:04.670
Mermaid who gave up her
father, her fin, and her voice

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.570
just to get a dude
and then started

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.930
to regret the choices
that she made.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.680
It's in a song called "Two
Legs." and here's Alison Burns.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.320
Yes, I decided also
that I was going

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.630
to take the mermaid in
a different direction.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.380
So I was going to make
her sort of trailer

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.771
trashy and from the South.

00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:25.979
ALISON BURNS: I was typecast.

00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:27.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.970
DENNIS GIACINO:
She's from Tampa.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.300
So here is Alison
Burns, a little tipsy,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.591
singing the Little Mermaid
song called "Two Legs."

00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:42.280
ALISON BURNS: Yeah.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.231
All right, so you
can keep vamping.

00:09:47.231 --> 00:09:49.666
Thank you.

00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:51.114
I've been quiet a long time.

00:09:51.114 --> 00:09:51.614
Right?

00:09:51.614 --> 00:09:53.075
[GASPING]

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:54.536
Took my voice.

00:09:54.536 --> 00:10:01.841
But now I've got a lot
to say, got a lot to say.

00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:04.890
[MUSIC ALISON BURNS, "TWO LEGS"]

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.450
DENNIS GIACINO: Alison Burns.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:47.836
ALISON BURNS: Yeah!

00:13:47.836 --> 00:13:49.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.690
DENNIS GIACINO: Our
tipsy Little Mermaid.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:56.230
Well as you can tell, this isn't
quite the Disney movies right.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.730
Very good.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.842
By the way Allison plays
three roles in the show.

00:13:58.842 --> 00:14:00.050
She plays the Little Mermaid.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.560
She also plays Belle from
"Beauty and the Beast"

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.990
who sings a song called
insane, because she

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.368
talks to inanimate objects and I
don't know a little bestiality.

00:14:09.368 --> 00:14:11.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.360
It's all from Tampa.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.140
And then of course,
also plays Rapunzel

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.310
which is our German
princess in the show.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.820
So Alison Burns, we love her.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.080
OK, so there are a
whole slew of princesses

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.170
who have a bone to
pick on our show over

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.799
at the Westside Theater.

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:31.840
They have a bone to pick
with our old buddy Walt.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.160
All of them are ready to go
all Norma Rae on his ass.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.940
So one such princess is the
princess who kissed the frog.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.810
Disney finally came
out with a movie

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.780
after making movies about
cars and bugs and toys.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.500
They decided hey, you
know now it's time

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.060
to make a movie about an
African American princess.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.967
And so it was called, I think,
"The Princess and the Frog."

00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:52.550
Is that right?

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.990
We call ours the princess
who kissed the frog,

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.280
because in the Disney
movie this black princess

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.360
spent most of the movie
green because she was a frog.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.350
So hey, wait, great, terrific.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.042
So we decided that's not
really the right way to do it.

00:15:06.042 --> 00:15:07.500
So we decided we
were going to make

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.260
our African American princes
powerful, very empowered,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.570
and a lot of fun.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.530
So Karen Burthwright is
going to sing in this song.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.980
It's a song called "Finally."

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.670
She'll be introduced
by Erin Leigh Peck.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.288
Here we go.

00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:24.550
[MUSIC ERIN LEIGH PECK, KAREN
 BURTHWRIGHT, "FINALLY"]

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:17.944
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:17.944 --> 00:20:19.360
DENNIS GIACINO:
Karen Burthwright.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.870
So those are just a few of the
songs actually from the show.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.740
It's a fun show.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.870
It's 90 minutes,
no intermission.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.840
We're over at the
Westside Theater.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.800
Thanks to Erin Leigh
Peck today, Lulu Picart,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.600
Alison Burns Ken
Burnthwright, Michael Raby.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.920
And where's Alan?

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.410
I think we have a Q&amp;A that
comes up where you can

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.890
ask us anything about the show.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:45.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.280
Here he is.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.525
This isn't over.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.430
ALAN: Yes, so the show gosh,
why you wrote "DISENCHANTED!".

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.930
It all came from
ex-history teacher.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.170
Why were you
originally persuaded

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.887
to go from teacher to
play writer, songwriter?

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.970
DENNIS GIACINO: It's really
kind of a weird story.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:09.090
I was teaching one day and
I was very good friends

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.290
with the person in
the room next to me.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.540
And her husband came to school
one day just to pick her up

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.000
and say hello and stuff.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.950
And he heard me teaching
and he said hey,

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.654
I think I could be
a voice over artist.

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:22.180
This is how it happens right?

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.140
And so there I was teaching
probably about Pocahontas,

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.430
and I got discovered.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.360
I don't know.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.420
Before I knew it, I was in a
booth recording commercials

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.459
for Bank of America,
sorry, and life insurance.

00:21:37.459 --> 00:21:39.125
I was always the voice
of that guy, hey,

00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:40.291
I just got back from Hawaii.

00:21:40.291 --> 00:21:41.650
It was a great time.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.430
So I was the cheesy voice.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.060
And so I went into
voice overs which

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.560
brought me into New York City.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.320
And that's how I fell
in love with theater

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.180
and started to write.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.090
It was embarrassingly good
money, but soul sucking.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.010
So that's when I
moved onto writing.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.530
So, you do voice
overs don't you?

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.510
Everybody does a few.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:02.210
ERIN LEIGH PECK: Yeah.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.020
DENNIS GIACINO:
Yeah, so that's--

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:03.660
ALAN: I don't.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.220
DENNIS GIACINO:
You don't do voice.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.720
Really good money.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.770
ERIN LEIGH PECK: Nice
work if you can get it.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.603
DENNIS GIACINO: Nice
work if you can get it.

00:22:09.603 --> 00:22:11.631
Ten minutes and lots of money.

00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:14.130
ALAN: So the show, started out
in the New Jersey Playwrights

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.200
Contest in '09.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.130
Sold out performances in 2011
in the Orlando Fringe Festival

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.700
and then yeah, woo.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.630
And then had a limited run off
Broadway last year, correct?

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:30.130
And so now you're back,
open ended run right?

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.370
So that's wonderful.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.410
Lulu you've been in it
since the beginning.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:35.510
LULU PICART: True.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.580
DENNIS GIACINO:
Three plus years.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.650
ALAN: And so how, has the show--

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.010
More than three, but good.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.730
So how has the show
changed for you?

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.251
Or how have you seen the show
change over the five plus

00:22:51.251 --> 00:22:51.750
years?

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.583
LULU PICART: It changes
from night to night.

00:22:53.583 --> 00:22:55.747
However, I have
been really lucky

00:22:55.747 --> 00:22:57.830
because normally as actors
we don't get the chance

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.690
to go from a to z with a show.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.820
You usually stay in for
a little phase of it

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.361
and you're lucky
enough to have that.

00:23:03.361 --> 00:23:07.130
And then you may come in and
out of a show wherever it is.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.090
But because I've been
in with the beginning

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.260
with Dennis and Fiely,
we've changed cast sizes.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.070
Songs of gone away,
songs have come back.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.070
We didn't have costumes.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.110
Now, we have costumes.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.480
We used to have Dennis at the
piano by himself in the back.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.490
And now we have a band
and music on paper.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.240
I mean you know it's like
we're in the big time now.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.610
So Yeah, not to lie, we started
out making $40 a weekend

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.690
with the show, $25 a show.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.710
It was awesome.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.870
My parents are very proud.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.520
I'm still paying off college.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.390
And now it's really wonderful
to come to New York.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.720
We're in an open ended run,
which means that basically

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.860
they'll run it until they can't.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.290
We don't have an end date to
it, which is a lovely thing.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.373
It means there's a lot of
faith with the producers

00:23:50.373 --> 00:23:52.650
and with the public
and the ticket sales.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.750
So to go from a to z is
a luxury for an actor

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.321
that doesn't always happen.

00:23:57.321 --> 00:23:59.820
DENNIS GIACINO: And can we say
that she has gone all the way

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.150
from the Orlando Fringe to being
nominated for a Lucille Lortel

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:04.989
Award this year--

00:24:04.989 --> 00:24:05.489
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:06.467
--for this very role.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:10.963
Congrats.

00:24:10.963 --> 00:24:11.921
LULU PICART: Thank you.

00:24:11.921 --> 00:24:15.170
ALAN: So when Michael, the
music director, Fiely, director

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.751
director, actor director.

00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:20.530
You direct the music,
he directs the actors.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:25.640
When and how did you
guys come on board?

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.320
FIELY MATIAS: I've been on
board since, we've been working

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.830
together for over 20 years.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.130
So we've created shows
and this was a show

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.400
that we created
about five years ago.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.360
So that's it.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.577
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:39.410
DENNIS GIACINO: Wow.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.030
ALAN: All right, all right.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.220
MICHAEL RABY: And I came on
board for the last out of town

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.282
tryout in Tampa.

00:24:45.282 --> 00:24:47.490
They did a production before
coming to New York here.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.910
And it was great meeting
Dennis and Fiely right away.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.675
I'd worked with Lulu
before in some shows

00:24:51.675 --> 00:24:53.610
and actually Alison as well.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:54.994
But I loved the show.

00:24:54.994 --> 00:24:56.660
I'd seen the show
before I came on board

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.720
and fell in love with it and
they asked me to come on board

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.740
and come to New York.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.740
And it's been thrilling.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.115
It's such a wonderful
score and it's

00:25:04.115 --> 00:25:05.440
a lot of fun to do everything.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.550
ALAN: So OK, name all
the princesses for me.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.744
There's Snow White and
Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty.

00:25:10.744 --> 00:25:12.660
I'm trying to remember
which names I could say

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.510
and which ones I can't
for copyright reasons.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.700
DENNIS GIACINO: You
can't say Ariel or Tiana.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.950
ERIN LEIGH PECK: You just did.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:19.951
ALAN: But you just did.

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:21.200
DENNIS GIACINO: But you can't.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.699
ERIN LEIGH PECK:
TM, TM, TM, TM, TM.

00:25:22.699 --> 00:25:25.565
ALAN: We'll have to bleep those
out in the recording I guess.

00:25:25.565 --> 00:25:26.940
OK so there's
those three who are

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.610
like the emcees of the show.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.732
Why is Snow White
like the ring leader?

00:25:31.732 --> 00:25:34.190
DENNIS GIACINO: Oh well, she
was the first Disney princess.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:39.350
So all the way back in the
1930s, 1934, 2 something

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.000
like that.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.980
And so I thought that
has to be my ring

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.350
leader when I write the show.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.560
She was the first.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.194
Cinderella was the
second, so she's

00:25:46.194 --> 00:25:47.735
always playing catch
up to Snow White

00:25:47.735 --> 00:25:51.260
and thinks she could do Snow
White's job, but can't quite.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.136
She's a little ditsy.

00:25:52.136 --> 00:25:54.176
And then the third of
course was Sleeping Beauty.

00:25:54.176 --> 00:25:55.730
And that's sort of
the pecking order

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.210
as we go in through the show.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.440
Those are our main
three characters.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:05.400
Then we introduce this host
of both crazies in the show.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.510
LULU PICART: Typcast.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.630
DENNIS GIACINO: And
each one of them

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.950
one at a time with
Snow White at the lead,

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.210
they sort of take on
the princess complex,

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.840
this age old idea
where unless you're

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.840
pretty in a Bambi-like waif and
a helpless damsel in distress,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.700
you're not actually valid.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.880
And I thought,
well, that's fine.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.040
If you want to be
that way, that's OK.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.040
You can be a Disney princess.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.670
I just wanted everybody to know
that there are alternatives

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.600
to that and so we
tackle a lot of issues

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.500
in this comedy, issues
of sexual identity,

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:49.350
of race and color,
body image, and thought

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.460
we would put a layer
of comedy over that

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.610
to make it entertaining
with Snow White at the lead

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.400
saying no to the
princess complex.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.970
That's how Snow White became
the leader of this gang.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:02.560
She was first.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.310
ALAN: So you mentioned,
it was surprising,

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.940
you just said that
there are princesses

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.580
that were in the show and
now aren't, like there

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.120
were songs that were cut.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.996
This gets later on in
what I'm going to ask you.

00:27:13.996 --> 00:27:17.560
But what did you cut,
because you included so much?

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.225
And I feel like Lulu would
have fun doing all of them.

00:27:21.225 --> 00:27:22.100
DENNIS GIACINO: True.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.090
LULU PICART: Thank you.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.160
I hope that you come to my New
York Fringe Festival one woman

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.270
show next year where I
do all the princesses.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:27.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.130
Just kidding.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.270
No, actually we didn't
really cut that much material

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.860
song-wise correct?

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.180
What we did is we started
out with a cast of 11 women.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.820
And they reduced the cast
for production purposes.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.610
And so therefore, Alison and
I play three characters each.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.462
So that's kind of how it got
reduced but still managed

00:27:47.462 --> 00:27:48.920
to cover the same
amount of ground.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.720
Am I right?

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.430
DENNIS GIACINO: You're
absolutely right.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.950
Before it ever
reached a stage, there

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.260
were songs that we had written.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.187
We had other princesses in there
that weren't really princesses,

00:28:00.187 --> 00:28:01.770
but they were part
of the Disney over.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.510
So we had Jane Porter
who sang a song

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:08.350
with Belle called "Beast
of Burden" about the men

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.970
you fall in love with
and why, who knows.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.130
And that's a great
song, but it's gone.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.900
FIELY MATIAS: We
also had Peter Pan.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.830
We had Tinkerbell.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.760
We had Peter Pan as a
princess going well,

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.066
there's not going to be a
princes show without me.

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:23.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.070
DENNIS GIACINO: Right.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.082
And yeah, so we had
Tinkerbell at one point.

00:28:27.082 --> 00:28:28.040
LULU PICART: Esmerelda.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.240
DENNIS GIACINO: Esmerelda was
in there at one point too.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.190
So yeah.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.850
We're fine tuned the show
and brought it to six actors

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.910
with 10 characters, I think now.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:40.840
Yeah.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.360
ALAN: Allison, all
your characters

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.919
are like drunk or crazy.

00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:46.460
DENNIS GIACINO: It's
the crazy track.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.350
ALAN: Yeah.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.620
Jordan get that image ready.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.790
We pulled the image of her as
Rapunzel off of the Facebook

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:56.807
page.

00:28:56.807 --> 00:28:58.890
So Yeah you can throw that
up there when you want.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.090
DENNIS GIACINO: The
German princess.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.950
So this is here.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:04.890
I want you guys
imagine this in light,

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.570
imagine this with costumes.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.760
The costumes in this
show are incredible.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.252
Yeah, I told you
it came off the--

00:29:11.252 --> 00:29:12.710
ALISON BURNS:
Subliminal messaging.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.430
ALAN: This came off
the Facebook page.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:15.888
We just ripped it
off the internet.

00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:17.390
ALISON BURNS: It scares you.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.880
ALAN: Yes, so you've got
Belle who's literally

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.010
in a straitjacket who starts
out getting rolled almost

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.040
off the edge of the
stage in your chair.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.304
And then who's next?

00:29:30.304 --> 00:29:31.220
ALISON BURNS: Mermaid.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.220
ALAN: Then you've got mermaid,
who's got a wonderful wig

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:39.220
and shaving cuts from not being
able to shave your new legs.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.254
And then going to Rapunzel.

00:29:41.254 --> 00:29:43.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.500
And then Rapunzel
which looks like look

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.150
like that, who is a dominatrix.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:48.970
ALISON BURNS: Yes.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:49.680
There she is.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.569
ALAN: Yes.

00:29:50.569 --> 00:29:51.860
ALISON BURNS: She's got a whip.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.720
ALAN: She does and
hair that stretches

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.900
around the circumference
of the equator.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.912
ALISON BURNS: Yeah.

00:29:57.912 --> 00:29:59.870
ALAN: Which is your
favorite character to play?

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:01.102
ALISON BURNS: That's so hard.

00:30:01.102 --> 00:30:02.310
ALAN: You've got to pick one.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.700
ALISON BURNS: I feel like
it changes every night

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.150
because there are some nights
that, for instance, Rapunzel

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.560
really gets to talk to the
audience, which I love.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.220
I never know what's
going to happen.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.980
And sometimes you
have crazy people that

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.210
will literally stop the show.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.040
ALAN: Oh, so she divides up
it's a singing contest where

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:18.820
she has--

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.236
ALISON BURNS: Woah,
spoiler alert.

00:30:20.236 --> 00:30:22.847
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:22.847 --> 00:30:24.471
ALAN: My arms are
just stuck like this.

00:30:24.471 --> 00:30:25.914
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:25.914 --> 00:30:26.876
I'm sorry.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:31.210
Do you want?

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.070
I can stop.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.270
ALISON BURNS: Nice recovery.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.070
ALAN: So she divides
up the audience

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.770
and there is audience
participation.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:36.520
ALISON BURNS: Yes.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.100
And depending on how much
they've had to drink or--

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.140
ALAN: What is it's one red cent.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.090
Not one red said.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:43.880
Not one red cent.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.630
ALISON BURNS: Yes.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.069
ALAN: Very, very dominatrixy.

00:30:46.069 --> 00:30:47.485
I assume that's
how they all talk.

00:30:47.485 --> 00:30:49.440
ALISON BURNS: Yes.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.400
I did a lot of
character research.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.359
ALAN: Typecast,
typecast, typecast.

00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:54.400
DENNIS GIACINO: In Tampa.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:54.875
ALAN: In Tampa.

00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:55.400
ALISON BURNS: In Tampa.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.160
ALAN: All dominatrix in Tampa.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.118
ALISON BURNS: Florida
where everything happens.

00:30:58.118 --> 00:30:58.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.570
ALAN: So what--

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.195
MICHAEL RABY: We love
Tampa by the way.

00:31:01.195 --> 00:31:02.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:03.230
For a visit.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.860
ALAN: What is the craziest
thing or a story or two,

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.573
craziest things that
have happened to you?

00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:07.360
ALISON BURNS: OK.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.315
There was one night at
the old theater where

00:31:09.315 --> 00:31:11.490
a gentleman in the
front row, I end

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.870
the song it's
supposed to be over

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:17.250
and he stands up and
went not one red cent,

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.000
like right next to me.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.750
If you see, I have in
the picture a unibrow.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:27.105
And I decided to take the
unibrow off and hand it to him,

00:31:27.105 --> 00:31:28.730
like if you would
like to run the show,

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:32.180
by all means wear the unibrow.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.344
And then the other
day, this gentlemen--

00:31:35.344 --> 00:31:37.010
I don't know if you
were there for this,

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:40.770
but you'll love this--
so you know she's German.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:44.250
And I walk over and I
happened to pick on a couple

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.360
people in the audience.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.560
And I picked on this gentleman
and told him to do something

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.520
and he looked at me
and said, I'm Jewish.

00:31:53.955 --> 00:31:55.330
ERIN LEIGH PECK:
I don't know why

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.200
you think I would love that.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.740
ALISON BURNS: (WHISPERING)
Because you're a Jew.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.573
ERIN LEIGH PECK: What
are you talking about?

00:31:59.573 --> 00:32:01.590
ALISON BURNS: OK, so I lost it.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.450
I am very good at staying
in that character.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.660
But not that time.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.400
He yelled that
and I was shaking.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.830
And I told him out loud this
is the first time I've ever

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.724
been speechless.

00:32:14.724 --> 00:32:16.390
It kind of stopped
the show for a while.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.350
Everyone was laughing.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.680
Snow White walked off stage.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.410
I ended up throwing my
whip down and just turning

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.200
like it was over.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.991
So things like that
happen all the time.

00:32:24.991 --> 00:32:27.240
So all of you are going to
come and be like what can I

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.627
do to mess her up.

00:32:29.627 --> 00:32:31.710
DENNIS GIACINO: Because
the show is a conversation

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.460
with the audience.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.180
These princesses come to life
and they talk directly to you.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.150
There's no fourth wall in the
show so anything can happen

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.580
and every show is
pretty much different.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.310
And people come
back five, six times

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.140
because it changes
every night based

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.080
on what the audience gives us.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.107
ALAN: Lulu you've got improv
experience says your credits.

00:32:53.107 --> 00:32:53.792
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:53.792 --> 00:32:55.000
ALISON BURNS: On your resume.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.666
LULU PICART: OK.

00:32:55.666 --> 00:32:58.640
ALAN: So I'll just.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.660
ALISON BURNS: It's on the
screen now her resume.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.740
ALAN: Buy tickets now.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.872
We can switch back, it's fine.

00:33:05.872 --> 00:33:09.210
It's scaring me, scaring me.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:13.815
Yes, she down a airplane
bottle before she came on.

00:33:13.815 --> 00:33:15.190
Yeah, so Lulu,
you've got improv.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.730
I feel like are you
going out of your way

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.840
to try to make everyone
crack every night?

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.090
LULU PICART: Are you asking
me am I putting out 100%?

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:27.542
What exactly is the
question that you're asking?

00:33:27.542 --> 00:33:28.880
ALAN: Do you give 110%?

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.080
LULU PICART: Well,
you know to be honest,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.540
I've been in the show
for three years now.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:39.307
And so in order to make
it fresh every day,

00:33:39.307 --> 00:33:41.140
it's not that you make
a deliberate decision

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.950
to change up what you do.

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:44.700
But you have to make
a deliberate decision

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.030
to react to whatever
happens, especially

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.270
since what Dennis was saying.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.780
We start the show off with a
direct address to the audience.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.970
So when you see a normal play,
you're having a conversation

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.345
and you're the fly on the wall
watching the conversation.

00:33:55.345 --> 00:33:57.370
In our show, you are
part of the conversation.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.120
So if something happens
from the audience,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.245
or if there's a reaction
we've never gotten before,

00:34:01.245 --> 00:34:04.810
or if the laughter
stops the scene,

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:08.739
we have to realize that and
make that part of the scene.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.600
That in its own sense is where
my improv training comes in,

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.309
because in improv training,
whatever happens happens.

00:34:15.309 --> 00:34:16.100
That's the reality.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.683
If it happens, it
happens in the room.

00:34:17.683 --> 00:34:18.380
You accept it.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.159
You say it out loud.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.159
You say oh, yeah you
walked in through the door.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:24.100
And then you walk
through the door.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.620
There's no negating
anything that

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.590
happens which is a fantastic
way to A, go through life and B,

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.880
go through the show.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.317
So that training I am absolutely
using it every single day.

00:34:36.317 --> 00:34:37.400
ALAN: That's a little fun.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.670
So Erin and Karen,
the two of you

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.870
are understudies for pretty
much everybody right?

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.159
ALISON BURNS: No, not
her, because she's black.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:48.880
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT: Yeah so
that. (SINGING) I'm limited.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.566
ALISON BURNS: So she only
covers the black girl.

00:34:52.566 --> 00:34:54.052
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT: Oh!

00:34:54.052 --> 00:34:55.760
ALISON BURNS: No,
she's our dance captain

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.080
if you couldn't tell.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:57.540
ERIN LEIGH PECK:
She has to know.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.206
ALISON BURNS: Karen
is our dance captain

00:34:59.206 --> 00:35:01.700
and she teaches us how to
how to crunk and stuff.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.980
ALAN: Right, right, OK.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.545
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT: Nice dude.

00:35:04.545 --> 00:35:05.920
DENNIS GIACINO:
She's from Tampa.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.780
ALAN: Because she's from Tampa.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.200
So what is it like, Erin
for you, you have to know.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.520
Karen you know all the tracks.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:14.980
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT: I know
everyone's track yeah.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.490
ALAN: Everyone's tracks.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:16.910
Erin, you know
everyone's vocal tracks.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:17.690
So there's dance tracks.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:18.564
There's vocal tracks.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.385
Erin for you, which one do you
enjoy going on for the most?

00:35:24.385 --> 00:35:26.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.340
ERIN LEIGH PECK: Well,
I mean did least--

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.390
ALAN: Song-wise.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.690
ERIN LEIGH PECK: Right.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.523
Well, the one that
doesn't scare me the most

00:35:31.523 --> 00:35:33.940
is the one I've done the
most of, which is Snow White.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.360
I happen to have done the
most shows as Snow White.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.430
So I actually have a little
bit of an idea of what I'm

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:40.970
doing when I set foot on stage.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:44.010
There has been a
time or two when

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.470
we were in the very early
stages of production

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:50.390
and you know these ladies
who do the show every night

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:53.550
were rehearsing during the day
and making changes to the show

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.800
and doing it at night.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.720
And the understudies,
we were just watching.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.240
We hadn't really
been rehearsed yet.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.180
We hadn't really
learned anything yet.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.950
And I think I'd been
at work maybe two weeks

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.560
and had to go on
for Sleeping Beauty.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.660
And literally, would like
to go out do a number,

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.740
go offstage, this crazy one
would meet me in the wings,

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.100
teach me the next number.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.740
And then, they would
push me out there.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.440
I tried to protest,
but they made me.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.300
And then I would go out
there and do another number

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:20.960
and come back.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.620
So those kind of experiences
make me a little trepidatious

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.680
about certain tracks.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:29.670
But I think if I knew what
I was doing everywhere

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.700
in every second of
the show, Cinderella

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:35.820
would be my favorite because
Cinderella, the way that Dennis

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.500
has written her, just can
get away with anything,

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.130
because she just
doesn't know any better.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.630
And she sees the
good in everything,

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.755
including every single
thing that she does herself.

00:36:45.755 --> 00:36:48.240
So I think that
would be my favorite

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.606
because she's the freest.

00:36:49.606 --> 00:36:51.480
DENNIS GIACINO: And to
back up, that's great.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.390
Yes, it's sort of like the
Golden Girls or South Park.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:54.931
They can say anything
because they're

00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:58.700
cartoons or mature women, and
they just get away with it.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.620
That's very much the Cinderella.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.100
Karen has I think a
great story to add

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.650
onto this about
the one night she

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.180
went on as the frog princess.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:06.710
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
Knocked it out.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.084
DENNIS GIACINO:
The frog princess

00:37:08.084 --> 00:37:10.820
got stuck in a train--
only in New York--

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.252
and couldn't actually
get to the show.

00:37:13.252 --> 00:37:15.710
You have to show up I think,
what, half an hour beforehand,

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:17.479
or you're out that night.

00:37:17.479 --> 00:37:19.020
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
No, I had nothing.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:19.730
FIELY MATIAS: She
didn't have a put in,

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.670
nor did she have a costume read.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.760
So tell us what happened.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.380
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
So I don't know

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.088
if you guys remember,
I remember it well,

00:37:25.088 --> 00:37:29.150
December 11, 2014, the day that
the trains were a hot tranny

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.090
mess and no one
could get anywhere,

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:32.680
that's the night in question.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.305
Yeah, absolutely I did.

00:37:34.305 --> 00:37:35.440
Quote me.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.701
Ironically, we were
in rehearsal process

00:37:37.701 --> 00:37:39.200
and Erin was going
on for Snow White

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.730
that night for the first time.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.990
So as the dance captain
of this amazing cast

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.530
and this amazing
company, everything

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.530
was geared to getting her
prepped for that show,

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.530
because it was the first
time anyone had gone on

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.940
and we knew about it, which
is what normally happens.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:52.952
So we had rehearsed.

00:37:52.952 --> 00:37:54.910
We'd done her put in that
day, and of course, I

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:57.870
come to the theater for my girl,
supporting, proud den mother.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.470
I can't wait,
focus, focus, focus.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:02.780
No makeup, backstage,
doing the do, prepping her.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.490
Half hour.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.190
Do you need anything girl?

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.780
I got you.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.964
You're going to be fantastic.

00:38:06.964 --> 00:38:07.630
Put your wig on.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.170
I'm here for you.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.530
I'm not going to get in your
space, blah, blah, blah.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:11.130
Trains.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.879
No one can get anywhere
and even that day,

00:38:12.879 --> 00:38:14.477
I was later than I wanted to be.

00:38:14.477 --> 00:38:16.060
We has set a time
to get there, but it

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.750
was really hard to get to work.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.800
So we get there and
people are coming late.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800
The audience is delayed.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.900
It's that type of day.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.820
So our Joy, who plays the frog
princess, is stuck in Queens.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.930
She lives at the border
of Long Island and Queens.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.087
So it takes her eight
hours to get to work.

00:38:30.087 --> 00:38:31.670
And there's no express
option for her,

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.830
so she stuck on the train and
just letting the stage manager

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:34.040
know.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.498
But this is way before half
hour, because I was there early

00:38:36.498 --> 00:38:39.750
for her, focus on her.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:43.580
Long story short, half hour
comes, she's not there.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.110
Problem is, yes, she
has a delayed entrance

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.125
in the show, which is fabulous,
but our union rules and the way

00:38:49.125 --> 00:38:51.250
we run this show just for
you guys in the audience,

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.000
normally, if none of
you are in the business,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.820
if you're not there at
half hour call, that

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.110
presents a problem
because that's when you're

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.040
supposed to be there to prep.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.740
And everything can
happen from there.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.490
So at half hour, I was
like to our stage manager,

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:02.652
she's not here yet.

00:39:02.652 --> 00:39:03.610
What you want me to do?

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.340
Do you want me to
get her stuff ready?

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.040
I was in denial, because I
teach, and those that can't do,

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.730
teach.

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:09.860
So in my head, I'm not going on.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:10.860
She's going to get here.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.490
What can I do to expedite
that process once it happens?

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:14.115
Actor's denial.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.912
So half hour was 7:30.

00:39:18.912 --> 00:39:19.620
She wasn't there.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.140
7:45 comes around, he
has to make the call now.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.600
So I'm sitting backstage, still
prepping Erin for her debut

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.339
as Snow White.

00:39:27.339 --> 00:39:28.880
We're waiting, she
doesn't get there.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.930
8:12, there's an announcement
that goes over this backstage

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:34.670
that I'm going on.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.170
Me.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:35.990
ALAN: Did the show
start at 8:00?

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.650
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
No, It was delayed

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.060
because audience members were
holding because no one can

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:39.810
get there on time.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:40.690
Everyone was delayed.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:42.970
So long story short,
I'm getting her ready.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.560
There's places,
everyone's upstage.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.350
Nothing, me in just
normal clothes.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.687
My costume's in a bag with pins
in it because of my fitting.

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:52.020
All I did was try it on once
and there's pins everywhere

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.710
to fit it to make it whatever.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.527
So I'm going on, lights go down.

00:39:55.527 --> 00:39:56.610
Dennis is in the audience.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.110
So he hears as the writer, the
creator of the show-- Fiely

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.050
wasn't actually there
that night-- Dennis

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.490
hears sitting out in the
audience waiting for the show

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:02.840
to start.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.140
And at this
evening's performance

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.973
the role of the princess
who kissed the from

00:40:05.973 --> 00:40:07.670
will be played by
Karen Burthwright.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:08.130
DENNIS GIACINO: I was like--

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.671
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
This is brand new.

00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:11.160
DENNIS GIACINO: --what?

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.661
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:11.661 --> 00:40:13.035
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
So backstage--

00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:14.994
DENNIS GIACINO: But she
doesn't have a costume.

00:40:14.994 --> 00:40:16.618
FIELY MATIAS: I get
a text from Dennis.

00:40:16.618 --> 00:40:18.142
DENNIS GIACINO:
Karen's in tonight.

00:40:18.142 --> 00:40:19.380
FIELY MATIAS: Ugh.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.130
DENNIS GIACINO: She
doesn't have a costume

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:22.430
and we haven't rehearsed her.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:23.320
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT: So it was--

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:23.960
ALISON BURNS: You did it.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.210
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
I did something

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:24.710
DENNIS GIACINO: She killed it

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.350
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT: --awesome.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.050
ERIN LEIGH PECK: The
story was she was amazing.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:28.758
DENNIS GIACINO: She
was great that night.

00:40:28.758 --> 00:40:30.020
Yeah, didn't miss a beat.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:30.440
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
Anything can happen.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.760
This business is
full of surprises.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.570
We all have firsts.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.370
FIELY MATIAS: You more of a
dance captain, so you do--

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:36.410
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
Right, right, and that

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:37.610
helps in terms of whatever.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:38.318
But it was funny.

00:40:38.318 --> 00:40:40.670
Sorry guys, you're about to
hear me warm up backstage.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:41.520
And it happened.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.340
I'm sorry I couldn't watch
Erin in her performance.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.881
I was watching
offstage when I could,

00:40:44.881 --> 00:40:47.030
but I was what are
the words to my songs.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.350
What's happening?

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:49.589
Where's my green eye shadow?

00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:51.630
So it's just an amazing
show and it's so much fun

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.090
to play with these guys
and just act the fool

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.080
and make people laugh and bring
these lyrics and these stories

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:57.580
to life.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.815
It's so much fun.

00:40:58.815 --> 00:40:59.940
And it appeals to everyone.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.266
The cross section of
our audience is unreal.

00:41:02.266 --> 00:41:03.640
There's a 50-year-old
drag queen,

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.765
there's a straight couple,
there's 300 gay couples,

00:41:05.765 --> 00:41:07.309
there's 300 tourists.

00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:08.600
It's like everybody it's great.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.230
ALAN: And that's just on stage.

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:10.646
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
And that's just

00:41:10.646 --> 00:41:12.122
on stage. [EXAGGERATED LAUGHTER]

00:41:12.122 --> 00:41:15.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.290
It's so much fun you guys.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.810
It's so foolish.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.060
ALAN: So we do have
microphones in the aisles.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.320
If you guys have any
questions for the cast,

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.667
please pop up and ask.

00:41:25.667 --> 00:41:27.000
DENNIS GIACINO: Don't be afraid.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.670
ALAN: Don't be afraid.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:28.545
They don't bite hard.

00:41:28.545 --> 00:41:29.630
It's cool.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:33.090
So the characters, all of
you have extensive resumes

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.100
and it's very impressive,
and everybody's

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.470
got roles that are very
traditional and very

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.469
like there's a fourth wall and
we will not break it and screw

00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:42.010
the audience.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:45.030
We are singing to each other.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.890
Anybody, how are your roles now?

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:50.870
Do you like it now different
from the traditional sense

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.530
of theater or a little
bit column A a little bit

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:56.170
of column B?

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:56.965
Anybody?

00:41:56.965 --> 00:41:57.820
LULU PICART: Oh, is that mine?

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.694
ALAN: Anyone, anyone.

00:41:58.694 --> 00:42:00.290
LULU PICART: I've got it.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:03.030
I like both.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.012
As actors, we kind of
get into this business

00:42:05.012 --> 00:42:06.970
because we like to
experience different things.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.428
We like to live in
different lives.

00:42:08.428 --> 00:42:10.910
We like to live in
different stories.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.174
So this is wonderful
and normally we

00:42:13.174 --> 00:42:14.590
don't get to talk
to the audience.

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.980
As an audience member, you don't
get to have that conversation.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:18.830
So that's wonderful.

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:20.455
And since I have the
improv background,

00:42:20.455 --> 00:42:21.720
that's home base for me.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.369
But I also love
really boring plays

00:42:24.369 --> 00:42:26.910
where you sit in a room and just
talk to somebody about life.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:28.570
And then you move
to different bench,

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.320
and you talk about
life even more.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.430
I love doing those
plays too, the ones

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.280
that my sister's
like great, can't

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.060
wait to see you in that play.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:40.670
Oh, it was so interesting
when you touched your face

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.870
when you felt something.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:45.520
So I also really love
that because as an actor

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.953
I crave those moments also.

00:42:48.953 --> 00:42:49.722
Come see the show.

00:42:49.722 --> 00:42:50.430
ALAN: I can tell.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:53.699 --> 00:42:55.852
Anybody else have
anything to add to that?

00:42:55.852 --> 00:42:57.310
ERIN LEIGH PECK:
One of the reasons

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.435
I really love doing this
show is because I'm a mom.

00:42:59.435 --> 00:42:59.950
And I've--

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:00.340
ALAN: Of two.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.840
ERIN LEIGH PECK:
--had to-- of two--

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.670
and I've had to suffer through
the princess complex and all

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:05.700
of the marketing.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.360
I remember my daughter,
who's 11 now actually,

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.940
was vehemently against
anything princess.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.200
She took a very, very
firm stand about it.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.290
And I was always
it was a problem,

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.280
because I need diapers.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.510
But the only diapers,
literally, at the store

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:21.770
all had princesses on them.

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.580
I need a bowl a fork.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.310
I couldn't buy
anything that didn't

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.930
have a princess or Dora on it.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:28.659
And it's really hard
to avoid all of it.

00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:30.450
So to be able to come
out on the other side

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.490
now-- and she's a
young lady-- and be

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.050
able to do a show that makes
fun of all those images,

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:36.190
it's really fun.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.650
I get a little bit of
evil delight from it.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.081
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:41.081 --> 00:43:43.550
ALAN: Well, that
leads me to, I guess,

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.290
the true message
of the show is kind

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.970
of like the women are strong.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.920
We don't need no stinking men.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.155
The princess complex is
really like unnecessary

00:43:53.155 --> 00:43:54.870
in today's day and age, right.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.329
So with your two daughters,
two daughters right?

00:43:57.329 --> 00:43:59.370
ERIN LEIGH PECK: No, I
have a son and a daughter.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.750
He likes princesses.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:02.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:03.880
He's completely into it.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.520
He thinks it's awesome that
mommy plays a princess.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.480
She's like really.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.262
ALAN: So does your
daughter get the show?

00:44:10.262 --> 00:44:11.970
Does she get the
message behind the show?

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.761
ERIN LEIGH PECK: Yeah,
totally, absolutely.

00:44:13.761 --> 00:44:15.505
Look, our show is very PG-13.

00:44:15.505 --> 00:44:16.880
It's not a kid's
show and I would

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.290
say that my uber mature New
York 11-year-old is probably

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.990
the border of about how
young a kid can be to see it.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:28.970
But I was very excited to share
it with her because the message

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.920
is ultimately so positive.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.850
It's such an empowering
message about girls

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:39.770
and getting away from this
image of the damsel in distress

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:43.390
and empowering yourself
to be what you want to be

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:47.790
and not having to fit into a
preordained mold physically

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.390
or emotionally.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:52.510
And yeah, we tell a lot of
dirty jokes to get there,

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:56.640
but I think that the value of
live theater outweights that.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.440
So I was really excited
to share that with her.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.545
ALAN: That's really cool.

00:45:00.545 --> 00:45:02.354
I'm going to shift gears
for a second real quick

00:45:02.354 --> 00:45:03.770
in the final moments we've got.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:07.630
Michael your kind of
your own character

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:09.370
off to the side of the stage.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:13.769
So in the show itself,
there's the audience

00:45:13.769 --> 00:45:15.060
and we're looking at the stage.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.320
Then tucked off to the
corner where you can see them

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.790
and they can see you, is
Michael playing his keyboard

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:21.630
over there.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:24.250
They interact with you
nonstop to the show

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:26.190
just like everybody else.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.737
Is that kind of
thing new for you?

00:45:27.737 --> 00:45:28.570
MICHAEL RABY: Oh no.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:32.139
I have a cabaret background
where I'll play and sing too.

00:45:32.139 --> 00:45:34.180
They're talking about
doing the show every night,

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.784
it's such a thrilling
aspect that the musicians do

00:45:36.784 --> 00:45:38.700
because every night is
a little bit different,

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.650
and we roll with
the punches too.

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:41.580
And we're in there.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.667
I play slide whistle as well.

00:45:43.667 --> 00:45:44.941
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:45.440
Yes.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:49.476
But yes, it's--

00:45:49.476 --> 00:45:50.350
[SLIDE WHISTLE SOUND]

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:51.091
Yes.

00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:52.840
Yes, and I had a lot
of training for that.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.357
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:53.357 --> 00:45:54.940
But no, it's a lot
of fun every night.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.950
And all the girls, you're always
on that edge of our piano bench

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:00.910
waiting to see what
happens each night.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.417
And there's a bass player
and drummer as well.

00:46:03.417 --> 00:46:04.500
We're having a great time.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:04.960
ALAN: Where are they?

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.730
They're not on stage.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:07.120
MICHAEL RABY: They're
in back of the stage.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:07.570
ALAN: Really?

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.486
MICHAEL RABY: So we have
a little video camera

00:46:09.486 --> 00:46:11.390
so they see me and
I can talk to them.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.762
ALISON BURNS: They're
in their pajamas.

00:46:13.762 --> 00:46:15.220
ALAN: You know,
video conferencing,

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.595
work from home in
your underwear.

00:46:16.595 --> 00:46:17.470
Yeah, question.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:19.160
DENNIS GIACINO: Awesome, yes.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.044
AUDIENCE: OK, so the
show sounds awesome.

00:46:22.044 --> 00:46:23.637
ALISON BURNS: Thank you.

00:46:23.637 --> 00:46:25.470
AUDIENCE: Hey, I can't
wait to see it myself

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:27.630
and I can't wait to take
my kids to see it someday.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:32.310
But what are the plans
for the merch, the books,

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.510
and the action figures
and all that stuff?

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:35.117
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:35.117 --> 00:46:36.200
When's it going to happen?

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.064
ALISON BURNS: Yes, t-shirts.

00:46:39.064 --> 00:46:39.980
ALAN: I want an Alis--

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.740
LULU PICART: Did he
say action figures?

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.120
I love figures.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.610
DENNIS GIACINO: Action
figures would be bobble heads.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.564
ALAN: I want an Alison
Rapunzel action figure.

00:46:44.564 --> 00:46:46.887
ALISON BURNS: Yes, one where
you pull the Rapunzel hair

00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:48.262
and it just keeps
getting longer.

00:46:48.262 --> 00:46:50.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:52.020
DENNIS GIACINO: Yeah
you know merchandise,

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.090
that's a funny subject
because we just started it.

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:59.890
So we of course have these
t-shirts, which this logo here

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:05.290
was created by Frank Fraver who
did the "Lion King" poster, you

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.560
know the yellow and black
one that you see everywhere.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.630
And he's awesome.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.920
It's kind of a fun
sort of loving poke

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.680
at Disney, almost
a personal roast

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.390
that they have a good time with.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.910
So yeah, of course
there's merchandise.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:24.910
It is a princess show
after all and so there are

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:27.786
mugs and t-shirts and magnets.

00:47:27.786 --> 00:47:28.660
ALISON BURNS: Tiaras.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:29.390
DENNIS GIACINO: What?

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:30.280
ALISON BURNS: Tiaras.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.766
DENNIS GIACINO:
Tiaras if you want

00:47:31.766 --> 00:47:33.140
to wear those
because again we're

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.820
not trying to say in
the show that you have

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.640
to be this type of princess.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.450
We're saying you can be
any type of princess.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:46.090
You can be a tiara wearing
princess, boy or girl.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:50.110
There are alternatives
to that as well.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.510
And the show really
is our happily ever

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.972
after, our answer to--
Disney's happily ever

00:47:55.972 --> 00:47:57.430
after is you have
to look like this

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:59.138
and your waste has to
be smaller than you

00:47:59.138 --> 00:48:01.320
neck size and the whole thing.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:07.260
Our answer is no, living happily
ever after is loving yourself

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.220
for who you are.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.450
Just be perfectly,
perfectly you.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.780
That's our answer
in "DISENCHANTED!".

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.340
Another question, yes.

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.090
AUDIENCE: So my
two-year-old is obsessed

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.990
with "Frozen," which has a very
different take on the Disney

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.510
princess.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.220
What do you think about that?

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:21.800
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT:
Never heard of it.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.970
Never heard of the movie.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:24.050
Don't know what
you're talking about.

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.300
DENNIS GIACINO: What?

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.090
LULU PICART: "Frozen," you said?

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:27.220
ALAN: Let it go, let it go.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:27.720
It's fine.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.390
It's fine.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:29.050
DENNIS GIACINO: That's
a great question.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.470
We actually have a
Frozen joke in the show.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.570
But did you want to take
this one on "Frozen?"

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:35.092
OK, great.

00:48:35.092 --> 00:48:36.550
LULU PICART: Well,
I actually think

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:40.410
that we're kind of on
the cusp of getting this

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:41.652
as a mainstream topic.

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:44.110
And I think the "Frozen" is a
really great example of that.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.010
So you have a lot of
female-led comedy right now

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:52.220
that's out, female-led casts,
female-led dramas on TV.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.660
You also have these
princesses that

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.304
are stepping outside
the normal role.

00:48:56.304 --> 00:48:57.720
So the whole thing
about "Frozen,"

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.390
there's no main love
interest that saves the day.

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:03.530
The sisters save each other
through their own powers,

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:06.840
even though they're supernatural
powers but whenever.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:11.070
So that is absolutely
something that we're seeing

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.180
us fit into that movement.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.260
And so to be kind
of timed correctly

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.610
to be in with that
is really exciting.

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:22.120
I actually sang on the
"Frozen" Blu-ray of "Frozen."

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.220
So I'm in both worlds.

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.527
It's crazy.

00:49:26.527 --> 00:49:28.860
But I think that that's one
of the things that resonated

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:30.760
with the audiences
so much in "Frozen"

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.470
is the girls were
like it's just me.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.800
I can be a princess
and it's just me.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.760
Everything is based
around what I do.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.535
And that's kind of in the world
right now, which is beautiful.

00:49:39.535 --> 00:49:41.910
DENNIS GIACINO: And Disney is
making strides in that too.

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:44.070
You've probably seen the
ads where Disney is trying

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:46.390
to redefine the word princess.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:48.760
And they'll put out a
strong princess or two

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.676
like "Frozen" or "Brave."

00:49:51.676 --> 00:49:53.050
And then they'll
turn out 10 more

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.090
that are just like Cinderella.

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:58.160
Afterwards, they go
there, we gave you one.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.140
No, I think Disney is
also making that turn too.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.490
When we started this
five or six years ago ,

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:06.990
we were sort of ahead of that
curve and that was great to be.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:11.260
Now, the wave has come in and
it's a good wave for everybody

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:11.989
to ride.

00:50:11.989 --> 00:50:13.030
So it's a great question.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.680
Yeah.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.820
LULU PICART: Even the, sorry
I'm totally going to elaborate.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:20.550
The UN speech that Emma
Watson made a while back

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.820
where they started
the movement of you

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.530
don't have to be woman
to be a feminist.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:26.740
All of that is in there.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.050
So you have kind of the
highbrow conversation about it

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:31.679
and then you have the more
mainstream conversation

00:50:31.679 --> 00:50:33.970
about it that we're kind of
using Disney as a reference

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:37.720
for because everyone has that
reference in their wheel house.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.380
So it's nice to kind
of be that gateway

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.570
for those conversations.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:42.740
DENNIS GIACINO: You're
absolutely right.

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.960
I'm going to elaborate on your
elaborate on my elaborate.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.910
ERIN LEIGH PECK: You
guys, you know what?

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:46.720
We're going to go.

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.010
DENNIS GIACINO: OK.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:47.509
No.

00:50:47.509 --> 00:50:50.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:55.340
But no, we want to
be clear about it.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.260
This is not a Disney
hating musical at all.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.305
As a matter of fact,
I worked for Disney

00:50:59.305 --> 00:51:00.180
at Walt Disney World.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.640
You worked for Disney.

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.050
You worked for Disney.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:07.050
I mean, quite a few
of us up here have,

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.490
one of the producers.

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:12.070
And the idea is that we just
want to offer alternatives

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:13.220
as I've said before.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:14.880
But it's not Disney hate.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.010
I actually really like
the Disney product.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.090
I just think it
could be widened.

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:20.300
And that's all we're doing.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.240
So yeah.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.554
ALAN: Yeah, last question here.

00:51:22.554 --> 00:51:24.470
AUDIENCE: Actually, that
leads to my question.

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:27.140
Has the Disney corporation
given you any flak for this?

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:27.320
DENNIS GIACINO: Yeah.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:28.510
No, that's always
a great question.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:30.910
The first question I usually
get is how'd you come up it.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:32.910
and the second one is do
you have a good lawyer.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:34.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.070
Yeah, a lot of Disney higher
ups have come and seen the show.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:42.410
One specifically is a guy
who has actually shut down

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:46.160
other shows, or a bar named
Grumpy's up in Michigan,

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:46.660
I think.

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.110
Yeah.

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:49.970
A Disney lawyer loved the show.

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:56.430
There's really nothing in the
show that warrants any-- it's

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:59.410
great question-- that
warrants any kind of copyright

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:00.720
infringement or legal action.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.780
As a matter of fact, I
went to the same well

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.180
that Disney did which is
the public domain princesses

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.410
from the original fairy tales.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:13.070
We make it very clear these are
my versions of the princesses

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:16.240
from the original story books,
which are all in public domain.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.410
Disney has their versions.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:19.360
That's why it's called
Disney's Snow White.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.677
This is Dennis
Giacino's Snow White.

00:52:21.677 --> 00:52:23.760
So there's that, and of
course then there's always

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.885
that First Amendment thing.

00:52:24.885 --> 00:52:27.639
ALAN: You don't actually say
Disney in the show do you?

00:52:27.639 --> 00:52:28.930
DENNIS GIACINO: A couple times.

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:29.220
ALAN: Do you?

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.596
I know you say
Walt all the time.

00:52:30.596 --> 00:52:31.762
DENNIS GIACINO: We say Walt.

00:52:31.762 --> 00:52:33.340
ALAN: Walt could be anybody.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.764
Walt Thompson's Cinderella.

00:52:34.764 --> 00:52:36.930
ERIN LEIGH PECK: I think
we're pretty clear on which

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:37.912
Belle's talking about.

00:52:37.912 --> 00:52:38.620
ALAN: Oh does it.

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.380
Oh OK.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.990
ALISON BURNS: And I say Mickey.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:42.640
ALAN: That could mean Mickey
Thompson, Walt's brother.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.556
DENNIS GIACINO: Right.

00:52:43.556 --> 00:52:46.680
There are some references, but
again it's a good loving poke.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.260
And at times it's
almost an homage

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:55.700
really to some of the Disney
over of princess films.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.640
But no, nobody has ever
given us any troubles.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.160
As a matter of
fact, they love it.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.674
They get it, just like
everybody else does.

00:53:04.674 --> 00:53:05.840
ALAN: Well that's wonderful.

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.010
We are out of time, if
there are no more questions.

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:12.460
Go to go/disenchanted-discount
to get your tickets please.

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.110
The show is wonderful.

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:17.760
Again, Westside Theater
Upstairs on West 43rd,

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.760
disenchantedmusical.com.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.099
Are you guys on
the social medias?

00:53:21.099 --> 00:53:21.890
ALISON BURNS: Yeah.

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:22.840
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT: We
love the social medias.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.360
ALAN: What?

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.200
DENNIS GIACINO:
@disenchantedNYC is our Twitter.

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.990
Facebook is Facebook.com
backslash disenchantedmusical.

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:32.835
Go join and we don't bother you.

00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:34.450
You can go and see
all the pictures

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:38.390
and there's backstage insider
info and stuff like that.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:39.610
ALAN: Well, thank you all.

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:40.450
FIELY MATIAS: We love it here.

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:42.200
So anytime you want us
back, we'll come back.

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:42.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:43.340
KAREN BURTHWRIGHT: Yeah,
thanks for having us.

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.430
DENNIS GIACINO: You
have a hell of a cafe.

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:46.055
LULU PICART: Your
pizza is really good.

00:53:46.055 --> 00:53:46.740
The pizza was--

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.640
ERIN LEIGH PECK: I had my entire
week's worth of vegetables

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.348
at the cafeteria.

00:53:49.348 --> 00:53:51.185
So I don't have to have
any more this week.

00:53:51.185 --> 00:53:51.996
ALAN: And froyo.

00:53:51.996 --> 00:53:53.620
LULU PICART: I heard
you have nap pods?
