00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.010
If at first you fail, try again.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.629
If at second you fail, then...you might actually
be better than the rest of us.

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:14.080
Hey failures, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.200
Imagine a world without failure.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.530
We wouldn’t have Dr. Seuss (he was rejected
27 times before his first book deal), Disneyland

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.880
wouldn’t exist (Walt was once fired from
a newspaper for “not being creative enough”),

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.070
and there’d be no Harry Potter guys (JK
Rowling was divorced, jobless, and broke before

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.890
her famous book series)!

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.210
So is failure actually good for us?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.410
Perhaps so, especially in the startup culture
we have today where events like FailCon exist.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.800
It’s exactly what it sounds like, a conference
where hopeful startup founders learn about

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160
the failures of other startups so they don’t
make the same mistakes.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.800
It’s a classic trope that those who don’t
learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.800
them.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.800
Really?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800
Doomed?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.380
That’s kind of a strong word and may not
be the best way to encourage success.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.640
Or at least according to one study, which
looked at whether there were any benefits

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.550
to telling students that it’s okay to fail.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.189
The study gave 111 students very difficult
tasks.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.180
Before they began, some were given an “failure
is ok” pep talk, while others were not.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.409
At the end, no one was able to complete the
task successfully.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.310
However, those who received the pep talk had
better working memory capacity, which can

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.659
predict academic achievement like reading
comprehension and problem solving.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.200
The study also suggested that those who didn’t
get the talk may have felt more incompetent,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.630
which may have interfered with their working
memory7.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.189
So stop telling kids they’re all doomed!

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.130
It’s okay, bud, make mistakes, we all do.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.950
And if you fail, that might actually make
you smarter in the long run.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.719
In a study from the journals of Cognitive
Science, two groups of students were asked

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.010
to solve math problems.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.619
The first was taught the concepts and procedures
ahead of time, while the second had to try

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.020
and figure it out for themselves before they
were given a lesson.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.099
Predictably, the second group failed at solving
the problems before instruction.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:57.170
But in a post-test, that group actually outperformed
the students who had instruction first.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.079
They also did better on questions about higher-level
concepts that weren’t taught to either group.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.399
The results suggest that letting students
fail first could be helpful, at least in math.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.659
But before you intentionally crash and burn,
another study out of MIT suggests that success

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.209
might have a more positive influence on your
brain than failure.

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.340
Researchers gave monkeys a task and rewarded
them when they responded it correctly.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.790
When a monkey was successful, the neurons
in the reward centers of their brain sent

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.879
out a signal that lasted several seconds,
into the next task.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.640
During those seconds, the monkeys were more
likely to get that next task right too, suggesting

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.299
a chain reaction in your brain of success
leading to more success.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.319
No such signal was sent out when the monkey
failed.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.430
So success isn’t a bad thing, of course,
but neither is learning from your failures.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.549
In the end, what matters more is that you
are actually DOING the activity you are trying

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.530
to learn and taking chances.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.600
So keep doing!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.910
Even if you fail, and then fail, and fail
again…

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.360
So does this mean that it’s better to try
and praise kids and boost their self-esteem,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.390
even if they fail?

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.390
Maybe not.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:12.329
Find out why in this video from Julia 
and Amy.

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:20.409
What’s one thing you’ve failed at?
