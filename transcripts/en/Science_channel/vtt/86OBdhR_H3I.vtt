Narrator:
MAKING THIS MID-SIZE YACHT

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.000
STARTS WITH THE MOLD
FOR THE HULL.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.167
THE TEAM SPRAYS A GEL COAT PAINT

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.767
ON TO THE ENTIRE INNER SURFACE
OF THE MOLD.

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:18.334
THIS PAINT WILL TRANSFER
TO THE HULL DURING MOLDING.

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:24.100
THEY LAYER FIBERGLASS STRIPS
AROUND A PVC FOAM CORE

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.968
AND CREATE A SERIES OF
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR RESIN.

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:31.801
THE CREW NOW DRAPES AN ENORMOUS
SHEET OF CLEAR PLASTIC

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:36.100
OVER THE MATERIALS AND THE MOLD
AND SEALS THE EDGES WITH TAPE.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.133
THE CREW LEAVES A LOT OF SLACK
IN THE PLASTIC

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.834
TO CONFORM TO THE MOLD'S
DEEP RECESSES.

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:46.534
A VACUUM HOSE SUCTIONS OUT
THE AIR BENEATH THE PLASTIC.

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:50.000
THE CREW THEN CONNECTS PLASTIC
TUBING TO THE PORTS

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.033
THE RESIN SATURATES
THE FIBERGLASS STRIPS

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:57.567
THAT SURROUND THE PVC FOAM CORE.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:01.167
THE VACUUM SUCKS THE LAYERS
INTO A TIGHT SANDWICH

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:04.133
AND PULLS OUT MORE AIR
AND EXCESS RESIN.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.868
THE RESIN CURES AND
THE FIBERGLASS LAYERS HARDEN.

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:11.767
THE NEXT DAY, THE TEAM REMOVES
THE PLASTIC SHEET

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.567
FROM THE MOLDED PART.

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:23.400
A CRANE LIFTS THE NEWLY MOLDED
HULL OUT OF THE MOLD.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.734
THE GEL COAT HAS ADHERED TO IT,
GIVING IT A GLOSSY FINISH.

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:33.567
NEXT THEY CREATE THE DECK.

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:38.434
LIKE THE HULL, THE CREW MAKES
THE DECK MAINLY FROM FIBERGLASS.

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:44.067
A WORKER CUTS OUT THE STRIPS
IN DIFFERENT SIZES.

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:47.234
AFTER ARRANGING SOME OF THE
FIBERGLASS STRIPS IN THE MOLD,

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:49.801
THE CREW BUILDS UP THE DECK
IN CERTAIN AREAS,

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:51.334
USING PIECES OF BALSA WOOD.

00:01:53.334 --> 00:01:55.734
A WORKER LAYS
MORE FIBERGLASS STRIPS

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:57.567
ENCAPSULATING THE BALSA WOOD.

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:01.901
THEY'LL LAMINATE THE LAYERS
WITH RESIN

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.801
THE WAY THEY DID WITH THE HULL.

00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:08.133
THE CREW ALSO MAKES THE ROOF
STRUCTURE THE SAME WAY.

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.501
A BOAT BUILDER APPLIES PUTTY
TO THE FIBERGLASS

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.734
TO EVEN OUT ANY IRREGULARITIES.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:18.000
AND AFTER GRINDING THE HARDENED
PUTTY SMOOTH,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.300
THEY SPREAD POLISHING COMPOUND
ON ALL THE YACHT'S BODY PARTS.

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:29.534
USING A ROUTER, THE CREW CUTS
OUT HOLES FOR LIGHTS, PORTHOLES,

00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:31.100
AND OTHER FEATURES.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.834
AND NOW THE BIG MOMENT.

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:39.634
AFTER SIX MONTHS OF WORK,
LET THE GOOD TIMES BEGIN.
