second yeah so the first question is
from a mogu had robot and the question

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
from a mogu had robot and the question
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.550
from a mogu had robot and the question
is try most all the OS released by

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
is try most all the OS released by
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.300

Android have a good task killer but

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
Android have a good task killer but
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.399
Android have a good task killer but
still in for dot 0 i see a lot of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
still in for dot 0 i see a lot of

background is there a way developers can

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
background is there a way developers can
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.190
background is there a way developers can
minimize the rapa consumption this

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
minimize the rapa consumption this
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.730
minimize the rapa consumption this
version ok so the question is can we

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
version ok so the question is can we
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.109
version ok so the question is can we
have a more effective way of producing

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119
have a more effective way of producing
 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.999
have a more effective way of producing
ramp consumption by using a task killer

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
ramp consumption by using a task killer
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.440
ramp consumption by using a task killer
so as far as we know after gingerbread

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
so as far as we know after gingerbread
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.649
so as far as we know after gingerbread
it's not possible to kill a task so even

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
it's not possible to kill a task so even
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.230
it's not possible to kill a task so even
if you kill a process in which an

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
if you kill a process in which an
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.270
if you kill a process in which an
application is running whether it's a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
application is running whether it's a
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.800
application is running whether it's a
full-grown process or a background

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
full-grown process or a background
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.319
full-grown process or a background
process the process manager will try to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
process the process manager will try to
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.440
process the process manager will try to
restart that process again even if you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
restart that process again even if you
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.990
restart that process again even if you
kill it using your third party

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
kill it using your third party
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.459
kill it using your third party
application so so are based on the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
application so so are based on the
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.280
application so so are based on the
understanding i have i think trying to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
understanding i have i think trying to
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.240
understanding i have i think trying to
kill a process to optimize ram usage is

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
kill a process to optimize ram usage is
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.380
kill a process to optimize ram usage is
like a non-starter so other

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
like a non-starter so other
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.730
like a non-starter so other
developers need to look at other options

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
developers need to look at other options
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.280
developers need to look at other options
to optimize the ram that they are not

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
to optimize the ram that they are not
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.770
to optimize the ram that they are not

use bundles its most partners which are

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560
use bundles its most partners which are
 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.710
use bundles its most partners which are
available when you when you're on

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720

so these bundles are passed and when you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
so these bundles are passed and when you
 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.310
so these bundles are passed and when you
get when ondestroy scored you can

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320
get when ondestroy scored you can
 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.380
get when ondestroy scored you can
actually use these bundles to store

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390
actually use these bundles to store
 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.229
actually use these bundles to store
those activities now so that is like a

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239
those activities now so that is like a
 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.990
those activities now so that is like a
easier option so you also might want to

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000
easier option so you also might want to
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.479
easier option so you also might want to
override this and store this in a local

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489

alternate persistence mechanism you can

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610
alternate persistence mechanism you can
 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.390
alternate persistence mechanism you can
do that so now bundle is n built

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400
do that so now bundle is n built
 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.330
do that so now bundle is n built

mechanism provided by Android the only
 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.509
mechanism provided by Android the only
thing is you need to override these

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519
thing is you need to override these
 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.509
thing is you need to override these
activity lifecycle methods and when the
