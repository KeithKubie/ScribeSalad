[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.630
SPEAKER 1: Today, we have JD
Stier, Kwame Marfo, and Jim

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.930
Three of them are
here to provide

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.540
three different unique
perspectives on the issues

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.030
that we're going to see
in this documentary.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.470
JD is the Director of the
campaign Stand With Congo.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.284
And Kwame Marfo
has vast experience

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:26.700
working in development
investments

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.290
across the African continent.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.820
And then we have Jim, who
is a national of the DRC,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.510
and he'll kind of give us that
perspective of someone who has

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.347
lived and seen this firsthand.

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:39.930
So when we have the
panelists, they'll

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.610
just give a kind of
spiel and tell you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.620
what their perspectives
are on the issues.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.661
Afterwards, we'll open up
for questions, anything

00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.760
that you want to ask
or want to learn about.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.340
JD STIER: I produced this
film in part to educate.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.170
Sitting here at
Google headquarters,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.680
I think being cognizant of
the impact all us broadly

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.600
are having through
our technology sector,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.640
it's important to be aware.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.170
But primary motivation
is to really demonstrate

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.340
the human impact that our
previous practices have

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.130
had on life, and that it just
doesn't need to be this way.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.940
We can advance our society
without having a harmful impact

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.040
on humanity or the environment.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.180
There's lots of examples of this
in Congo now in recent years.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.330
In 2012, we really focused our
activist efforts on Apple--

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.920
the world's largest device
manufacturer at the time--

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100
and Intel--

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.640
the world's largest chip
manufacturer-- and calling

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.690
for positive reform,
calling for positive change.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.350
We organized on 165
campuses that year.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.060
Apple's CEO, Jobs and then
Cook and then Brian Krzanich,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.020
at Intel, leapt
at the opportunity

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.824
to do the right thing.

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:08.490
They really did.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.660
When they became aware of
this, these individuals

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.300
moved their companies
in the right direction.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.010
And Brian Krzanich at
CES in January of 2013

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.080
took the stage
with Robin Wright,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.500
who I had the honor of
taking to Congo back in 2011.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.750
And she's been a strong
advocate for well

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.880
over a decade for
women and girls

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.570
who are paying the largest
price for this in Congo.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.350
And Brian announced
at CES that every chip

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.390
they shipped from
that moment forward

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.140
would be Congo conflict-free.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.366
Apple, doing what Apple
does, said, OK, we

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:46.490
want to do the right thing.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.290
And then they
disappeared for a while,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.390
never heard anything
from them again.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.710
They came back in 2014 and
had the largest publish

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.060
of their supply chain
ever, as a big transparency

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.110
measure for them.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.730
So each of these
companies took big strides

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.790
for the right reasons.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.390
So your sector is a relatively
small player in the minerals

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.640
trade out of Congo.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.240
You heard from
strategic minerals

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.210
and military to heavy machinery,
aeronautics, and other sectors,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.390
but it's your industry
that's leading the way.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.830
And your industry is now
becoming the role model

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.030
that us activists get to take
when we go now directly talking

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.580
to mining companies and others.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.210
With Google having
relatively recently emerged

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.100
as a leading player, a strong
force in the device space,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.990
you're off to a
phenomenal start,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.210
but you also have
the opportunity

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.250
to kind of create a new way
to engage on this issue.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.240
Being the newest players and
the one of the biggest players,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.940
you can really double down
and can double down on the way

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.480
in which you're confronting
the supply chain issue

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.660
and how it relates to
transparency, government

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.010
corruption, and the like.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.730
I wanted to say three very
concrete things that we can

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.710
do together to have an impact.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.839
Number one, signing the
petition at StandWithCongo.org,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.640
so tech is not alone.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.560
We're asking government
leaders to make it

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.760
an industry-wide,
minerals-wide effort.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.370
So it's not just falling
on tech's shoulders,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.000
sharing that petition
in your networks.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.570
Number two is raising awareness.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.720
Stand With Congo is eager
to partner with entities--

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.000
Google would be
chief among them--

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.190
to raise awareness in
Congo and internationally.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.120
This is our 116th
screening event

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.810
in 17 countries in
just under a year.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.040
We launched together.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.420
We were all together on May
16 at the Tribeca Film Center

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.620
to launch this campaign.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.490
116 events and 17
countries later,

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.370
we've met from LSE in Oxford
to Colombia and inside Congo

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.670
and throughout Belgium and from
Jakarta to Cyprus to Tel Aviv.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.950
The world is very much paying
attention to tech minerals

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.110
but getting beyond that, how
we as millennials, as leaders,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.600
can use technology,
can use our platforms,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.320
can use our resources
through our employers

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.500
to raise awareness,
to plan events,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.070
to plan community
engagement events.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.820
Third-- sign the
petition, raise awareness,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.160
and I think I'd really
love to have conversations

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.040
with folks here about ways
in which we can partner

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.340
to bring events to schools,
to bring events to students,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.250
and find a way for
Google to speak

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.290
about the steps it's taking.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.840
Private sector
solutions are really

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.410
the way that we're going
to pave a new path,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.750
and you're going to be hearing
about this from our panelists

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.660
tonight.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.940
The last way that we can have a
real impact is direct support.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.310
I would love at
some point for Jim

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.666
to mention a project
that he's piloting

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:23.290
through his organization
in partnership

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.420
with Stand With Congo as
a way for business leaders

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:34.600
to really help boost human
capital and capacity in Congo.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.180
So from direct
support, mentorship,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.930
to hardware and software,
the needs are there,

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.370
and we have the facility and the
connections and relationships

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.680
to be able to facilitate
that kind of direct support.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.770
And so looking forward
to engaging Q&amp;A

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.580
with everybody online, but
I'd like to now kick it over

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.550
to Kwame, who is our
international executive

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.290
producer who's been a
guiding force behind bringing

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:07.180
this platform and this
dialogue around what

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.770
are the barriers
to entrepreneurship

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.510
on the continent--

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.580
Congo, but Africa at large--

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.590
and what are the ways
in which we can better

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.736
support a more rapid
development of the economy.

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:19.470
Kwame Marfo.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.162
KWAME MARFO: Can
you guys hear me?

00:07:25.162 --> 00:07:27.530
Hi, thank you, JD, for
your kind introduction.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.280
So I think it might
be helpful to give you

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.710
a bit of a background on how I
got involved in this project.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:40.540
So I got frustrated
with events in Africa,

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.780
and I think the easiest thing
to do is criticize, right?

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.160
And most of the criticism is
often leveled at our leaders.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.240
I came to the view that one,
as an instrument of change,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.090
criticism is actually a
spectacularly blunt one.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:03.330
And secondly, I came to the view
that leadership, if you will,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.750
the knowledge that really
comes to mind is will.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.810
So you have government,
the civil society,

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.100
and there is business.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.046
So the fact that most
governments in Africa

00:08:15.046 --> 00:08:16.420
don't live up to
the expectations

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.050
should not preclude us from
being change agents in business

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.860
and civil society.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.900
And one of my early
inspirations was from Nollywood

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.900
in Nigeria, which
by some estimates

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.294
is the second or third
largest employer in Nigeria.

00:08:32.294 --> 00:08:33.210
So I grew up in Ghana.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.274
So I had the--

00:08:34.274 --> 00:08:38.260
I saw Nollywood basically
become an economic engine out

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.730
of nothing.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.669
And if you studied the
industry quite well,

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:47.230
most of the people that
are actually driving change

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.030
have very little formal
education in filmmaking.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.900
But they're mostly, in
Nigerian parlance, hustlers

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.630
who have been able to
create opportunities,

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.760
and Nollywood has
been able to thrive

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.180
in spite of an
ineffectual government

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.200
apparatus in Nigeria.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.050
So my challenge to people,
like myself with fancy degrees

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.710
and work titles, was, look at--

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.120
Nollywood is getting things
done in spite of the fact

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.507
that governance in
Nigeria is not optimal,

00:09:12.507 --> 00:09:14.590
in spite of the fact that
most them lack training.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.580
What can we do?

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.820
So we took that
conversation further

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.760
by forming an investment
platform called

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.600
Diaspora Capital.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.180
[INAUDIBLE] Citizen Capital from
the African diasporan community

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.850
have been able to mobilize
quite a bit of funds, invested

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.000
in countries in Ghana,
Liberia, Zambia,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.490
and most recently, in Penang.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.700
Along the way, in spite
of your best efforts,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.010
we run into a number of issues
that affected our ability

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:45.940
to do business.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.150
So I was working on
chronicling the challenges

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.180
that we face as investors
and also the businesses

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.870
we invest in in doing
business in Africa.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:10:00.070
And the goal was to convert
the lessons into an easily

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.100
digestible visual format--

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.880
i.e. a documentary-- with
a case study on the Congo,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.850
and that is when I run
into JD and his team.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.220
And they already had their
well-developed product

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.610
so I felt it probably would
make sense to work with them

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.530
as opposed to trying
to reinvent the wheel.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.310
So does my involvement, and one
thing I also want to emphasize

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.500
is I'm not from the Congo.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.259
So the question
is why the Congo?

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:26.800
Well, first of all,
I'd like to thank

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.300
[INAUDIBLE] and the
team from Google

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.280
for giving us this
opportunity to be here.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.730
We have tried to run this by
a number of organizations,

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.590
including African focus
organizations, and some of them

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:42.250
have flat out told us they
didn't see any alignment,

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.240
which I personally have
found quite perplexing.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.270
Even from a purely
humanitarian perspective,

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.800
5.4 million people have
died from the war in Congo.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.814
This is, to put it
in context, about 2/3

00:10:56.814 --> 00:10:58.480
of the population of
New York or London,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.170
bigger than the
population of Norway.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.830
These Black Lives Matter, too.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.505
The second point
I'd like to raise

00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:10.825
is the fact that Congo
is too big to fail.

00:11:10.825 --> 00:11:12.700
When I was in grad
school, one of the lessons

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.510
I learned was the best
predictor of war in a country

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.990
is war next door.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.630
And looking at the Congo,
it's destabilizing forces

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.080
have led to nine other
countries been plunged

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.788
into one conflict or the other.

00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:31.870
The other point I'd
like to raise also

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.760
is that strategically
speaking, I

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.470
would argue that
Congo is probably

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.260
the most strategically
important,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.200
the most strategically important
country in Africa, at least

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.049
throughout history.

00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:43.840
I mean, if you look at
the main events that

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.050
have shaped our
global economy, Congo

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:51.240
has had a say starting from
the Industrial Revolution.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.136
The rubber that was used to
power the Industrial Revolution

00:11:56.136 --> 00:11:58.810
was sourced from the
forest in the Congo.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.000
Looking at the
First World War, 75%

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.024
of the brass casings
that came from the war

00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:06.190
were sourced from the Congo.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.280
Going down to Second
World War, the uranium up

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.290
to today in the [INAUDIBLE]
and cobalt that are

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.550
used to power mobile telephony.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.280
So the misfortune with
the Congo is its knack

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.230
for producing the
right resources at most

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.560
critical times have lead
to a bit of a scramble

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.720
for its resources, starting
with the European colonialists

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.440
to the actors in the Cold War to
most recently local insurgency

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.340
groups.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.640
And lastly, the reason why I
think the Congo is important

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.850
and why we should
all care is I think

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.940
there is an existential crises,
not just in Congo, but in most

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.760
of Africa, which
is a lack of jobs.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.850
There aren't too many
examples of countries

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:52.840
moving from grinding poverty to
emerging or developed countries

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.190
status without having
a manufacturing base.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.625
And the reason why
Africa's industrial hub

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.750
hasn't taken off, in spite
of the fact that we have

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.390
a number of advantages,
is due to the fact

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.690
that we don't have
access to electricity

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.130
at an affordable price.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.870
And Congo has the resources--

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.110
I mean, the Congo River
itself has a potential

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.770
to generate up to 100,000
megawatts of electricity.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:22.260
That's 13% of the world's
hydroelectric potential.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.060
And the beauty with
the Congo River

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.720
is, unlike most river
basins in Africa, which

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:33.660
tend to dry out during the
dry season, the Congo River,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.970
the [INAUDIBLE] basin sits
north and south of the equator.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.880
So at any given
time, a part of it

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.910
experiences the rainy season.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.670
So the only way we could
realize Congo's potential

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.640
is to create this environment
to bring the best out

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.350
of it and its people.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.666
Thank you.

00:13:50.666 --> 00:13:51.790
JD STIER: Thank you, Kwame.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.500
And Kwame and I have
been doing these events

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.320
all around the world for the
better part of the past year,

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.460
and we are proud to
stand in solidarity

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.590
but give respect for the
Congolese people, for whom this

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.640
is their struggle.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.100
And Kwame and I have
found many ways in which

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.290
we attempt to be supportive.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.140
But now let's take a back
seat and introduce Jim,

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.260
a business leader from Congo--
and actually just returned from

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.550
a trip--

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.720
who has ushered in some amazing
new ideas and progresses,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:31.200
but really, in my opinion,
is a phenomenal example

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.280
of the hope of the future, the
hope of this new generation,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:43.380
and millions of young Congolese
ready to reap the benefits.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.970
JIM N.: Thanks
for the intro, JD.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.504
So my name is Jim [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:46.504 --> 00:14:48.420
And just to give you a
quick background on how

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.900
I got involved on the management
team for a organization called

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.330
Young African MBAs,
and despite our name,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.010
you don't have to
be young, African,

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.390
or have an MBA to be a member.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.400
Those are just the
characteristics

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.949
of our founders.

00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:03.990
And basically, we formed
a partnership with Stand

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.476
With Congo earlier this year.

00:15:05.476 --> 00:15:07.350
We're just trying to
figure out ways to raise

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.070
awareness of this film.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.580
And the most recent
we were in talks

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.950
right now to talk about how we
can really beyond just raising

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.450
awareness of the
film, having also

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.910
more of an impact on the
ground through mentorship

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.930
for entrepreneurs.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.805
So that's something
we're piloting right now.

00:15:20.805 --> 00:15:22.770
We're going to get
started very soon.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.510
And as JD and Kwame
mentioned, I'm

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:29.949
from DRC so I'm very aware that
if it wasn't for who my parents

00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:32.490
and grandparents are, I could've
been one of these victimized

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.150
kids.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.560
So this makes me even try even
harder to find ways to make

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.350
a difference in the country
because beyond the fact that it

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.680
could be me, just even
if I wasn't from Congo,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.680
I still feel like it's--

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.755
from a humanitarian
standpoint, it just--

00:15:45.755 --> 00:15:46.380
it's not right.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.600
I know life isn't fair,
but there are some things

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.910
that we shouldn't tolerate
as people living here.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.550
So I just want to do what
I can to help change things

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.630
and really help empower the next
generation so that in 20 years,

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.100
there isn't the
next JD coming up

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.290
with another movie about the
plight of the Congolese people,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.789
that things are actually moving
forward and there's progress

00:16:03.789 --> 00:16:04.680
and there's hope.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.719
So that's how I got
involved, and thank

00:16:06.719 --> 00:16:07.635
you guys for watching.

00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:12.879
And thanks leading a
forum, making this happen.

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:15.420
JD STIER: Yeah, thanks everyone
for coming out, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.050
Google.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.360
And let's open it up
for Q&amp;A, but could you

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.412
please come to the
microphone because we're

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:21.870
going to be streaming
And so please

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.262
ask any questions that you
might have into the microphone.

00:16:25.262 --> 00:16:27.720
And we'd love to talk about
what's happening on the ground.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.886
We'd love to talk about
entrepreneurial and business

00:16:29.886 --> 00:16:30.919
opportunities.

00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:33.210
We'd love to give an update
on the political situation.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.450
So whatever curiosities you
may have, please whether it's

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.120
online in chat or
on the microphone,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.420
we're looking forward to engage.

00:16:46.634 --> 00:16:48.500
AUDIENCE: Hi, I don't
really know much about

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.370
Congolese politics
so I would love to--

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.480
I think I had trouble
following along because it

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.570
was pretty complicated.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.710
I guess the current President,
his term expired last year,

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.230
but it was extended.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.170
What was the constitutional
mechanism through that--

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.460
allowed that to happen?

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.200
And what's going to happen?

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.849
I mean, I think they had a
new Constitution in 2006.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:14.140
Are they going to have
another new Constitution?

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.069
Thanks.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.349
JIM N.: So there was no real
constitutional mechanism

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.840
for the lack of elections.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.589
Literally, four months
before it happened,

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.589
they were like, there's
no budget for elections.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:24.859
They're not going to happen.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.760
So that really pretty
much is what happened.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.495
They said, you know, we have
no money to finance elections.

00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:31.520
We went through the new census
so let's just put this on hold

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.750
for a little bit.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.670
And then there was
some chance of riots

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.790
so they, the opposition,
met with the powers that be,

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.620
and they talked about--

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.360
they found, I guess,
a temporary plan

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.250
whereas Kabila could be
the Interim President

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.730
until the next elections.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.209
That was supposed to
happen this December,

00:17:47.209 --> 00:17:48.250
but I was there in April.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.458
When I asked if it's going
to happen, people laughed.

00:17:50.458 --> 00:17:53.570
So basically, I think that
the consensus that elections

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.550
are not going to
happen this year,

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.800
but everybody is aware
that they should happen

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.920
so just a matter of I
guess how far they're

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.540
willing to hold
onto power and what

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.790
they're willing to do to
make sure the elections never

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.510
happen.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.230
But really there
was no mechanism.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.230
Really just-- I guess
they just strong-armed it,

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.600
if we're going to be honest.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.230
JD STIER: Trevor Noah said that
Kabila found a really easy way

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.080
to stay in power, and it's
to not hold elections.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.070
And there are some
very stark similarities

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.570
between the United
States government

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.660
today and the
Congolese government

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.810
and this kleptocratic
form of rule,

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.560
where you enrich yourself and
your immediate family members

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.360
and buy off or intimidate
or suppress the opposition.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.640
Kabila's tactics are
starting to look very similar

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.470
in our own White House.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.240
In addition to--

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.100
I'd say since December 19
when President Kabila ignored

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.430
his constitutional mandate
to leave the presidency,

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.360
he's been buying off the more
prominent opposition members.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:01.010
And so at a time when the
elite are consolidating power

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.800
and increasingly
suppressing, Stand With Congo

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.930
had recently released
a series of videos

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.430
of young, nonviolent,
pro-democracy activists.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.670
Many of them are
individuals your age who've

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.090
graduated with law degrees
and medical degrees,

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.740
and there are no economic
opportunities for them at home.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.350
They've decided to join
a social movement, which

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.930
looks very akin to
Black Lives Matter here,

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.600
very akin to the
Anti-Apartheid Movement,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.810
the Civil Rights
Movement in this country,

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.087
and are calling
out for elections.

00:19:33.087 --> 00:19:34.670
They're getting
increasingly organized

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.660
throughout the country.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.680
And so what we're
hoping to support

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.840
is really this
confluence of factors

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.710
of the elite
consolidating power,

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.510
but a growing sentiment
demanding elections.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.200
And with the youth
movement throughout country

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.500
active in six provinces,
there is still

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.120
some hope that given the
fact that Kabila is extremely

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.480
unpopular broadly throughout
the whole country,

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.620
that if the public can be tapped
into by those brave enough

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.560
to take action, that there
is yet hope this year.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.340
And so we all are engaged
in standing in solidarity

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.560
and supporting the
youth movement,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.660
as are local church leaders--

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.900
a voice that's necessary
to show unity--

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:25.850
the few remaining opposition MPs
that have not been bought off

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.120
by Kabila, and civil society.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.910
Congo has one of the
strongest and most developed

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.180
civil societies on the
continent and in the world.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.460
And they've been
increasingly organized

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.020
and effective in
recent years, and there

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.370
is a lot of courage to
speak out about corruption

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.980
throughout the Congo.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.000
And so there is
some hope, and there

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.070
are individuals in
the country that we've

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.740
worked with that are
leading that charge

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.229
and trying to raise up
that message of hope

00:20:54.229 --> 00:20:55.520
for their countrymen and women.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:04.920
Thank you very much for
coming to give this screening.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.580
My question is how
much of a record trail

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:12.110
is available for where
the minerals are going

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.830
and who's benefiting from them.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.520
I know you mentioned Apple
and a couple other tech

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.850
companies that have
done their research

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.730
to try to find out
how they're connected

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:30.920
to the minerals in Congo
and to make changes,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:38.530
but how much of a record trail
is there that is accessible.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.850
I feel like that'd be
a really good place

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:44.060
to start, to surface
that information

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:48.440
and show the culpability
of all the players

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.490
in the tech industry,
including all of us,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.120
by the way, because we are
consumers of tech products.

00:22:00.286 --> 00:22:02.720
JD STIER: On our website,
StandWithCongo.org,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.600
we have reports that have
extensive documentation.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.220
We have some leading
organizations,

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.220
from Kofi Annan's
Africa Progress

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.090
Panel to Global Witness,
really the world's

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.450
leading transparency
organization.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.290
Both of these are NGOs,
civil society organizations.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.187
If you really plug
into the news,

00:22:26.187 --> 00:22:27.770
you'll remember about
a year ago there

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.070
was a scandal called
the Panama Papers.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.050
And so it was a legal
entity in Panama

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:38.360
that set up myriad offshore bank
accounts for corrupt business

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.350
dealings.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.221
And President
Kabila, his sister,

00:22:42.221 --> 00:22:44.720
and many of his family members
showed up in those documents,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.630
and so there was a
real watershed moment

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.171
for having it in writing and
seeing some of the ledgers.

00:22:51.171 --> 00:22:52.670
But if you go to
our website, you're

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.810
going to get to see from Africa
Progress Panel to Bloomberg

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.380
to Global Witness and
others the paper trail,

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.990
and there are some groups that
have done amazing research

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.920
and documentation.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.740
Bloomberg's lead the
way, Global Witness

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:11.030
has used much of their reporting
to enhance their reports,

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:15.410
and locally here, there's an
NGO in Washington DC called

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.030
the Enough Project.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.430
And there are individuals
within your corporation

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.500
that are working
with Enough Project

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.330
to show the steps that
Google is taking, and I had--

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.350
I worked at the Enough
Project from 2011 to 2014

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.780
while I was producing
this film, and I

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.600
was leading the consumer
tech conflict-free

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.870
push that resulted
in Apple and Intel

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:38.150
and some others
taking some big steps.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.400
I spoke with my colleagues
who continue that work

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.060
and continue to rank the
world's leading tech companies,

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.980
and they had good things
to say about Google.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.510
But this will be
the very first time

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.270
you're included in those
rankings, which are set

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.130
to come out in the near future.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.780
And so those are
some great resources,

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.500
and all of those organizations
and all of those resources

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.192
are published on our
website, StandWithCongo.org.

00:24:01.192 --> 00:24:03.650
KWAME MARFO: And I would add--
so there's actually a longer

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.650
version of this documentary--
which you watch on Netflix--

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:11.070
which highlights a
number of other entities.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.590
So it's not just tech.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.781
Looking at Congo, it has
virtually almost any resource

00:24:16.781 --> 00:24:17.780
that you could think of.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.655
You know what I mean?

00:24:18.655 --> 00:24:21.020
So you have countries
like Rwanda,

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:27.729
which has over a couple of
years been sort of raiding Congo

00:24:27.729 --> 00:24:28.520
every now and then.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.725
So it cuts across
various sectors.

00:24:30.725 --> 00:24:34.550
You have multiple state and
non-state actors involved.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.470
And that actually feeds into
that title for the documentary,

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:42.020
which is when you have different
players, heavyweights, fighting

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.560
over resources, the
little ones are the ones

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.940
whose rights get trampled upon.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.940
So it's across from mining to--

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.770
you name it.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:56.890
Everyone has had a stake in
the Congo historically and now.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.440
But there is a ton of
information available

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.920
that we're happy
to share with you

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.830
on the back of this
documentary if you're

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:07.850
keen on helping follow the
trail and joining this advocacy

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.070
movement to promote transparency
in mining in the Congo.

00:25:14.274 --> 00:25:15.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.420
to share your time and
your information with us.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.850
So I was curious
about whether there's

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.910
been any progress on the
governmental or policy side

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.590
where these minerals are going.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.020
Because I can
imagine how hard it

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.911
is to change things in Congo
because there's a lot of flux

00:25:30.911 --> 00:25:31.410
there.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.740
But has there been any progress
over the years in terms

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.010
of countries where the minerals
are going creating policies

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:41.670
to actually prevent minerals
coming in from places where

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.820
they're sourced illegally?

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.890
KWAME MARFO: Is this specific
to the Congo only or--?

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.410
AUDIENCE: Well,
it's specifically

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.677
to the Congo in this context
but also just generally.

00:25:52.677 --> 00:25:54.510
JD STIER: I can speak
to Congo, and then you

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.190
can speak to Africa, or
the other way around.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.540
KWAME MARFO: Right.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.330
Yeah.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.010
Absolutely.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.740
AUDIENCE: So you have countries
like the US or Belgium or--?

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.990
JD STIER: Sure I'll
touch on Congo specific,

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.840
and then Kwame can broaden
it to the continent resources

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.250
at large.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.020
You saw early on in the film,
which is available on Netflix.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:11.895
So please feel free--

00:26:11.895 --> 00:26:14.019
I think if you're asking
people to sign a petition,

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:15.540
just include a link to the film.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.670
They can watch it on
Netflix, but it's also

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.380
available worldwide on Amazon.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.780
So we just want it
to get out there

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.880
for free or for
a couple of bucks

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.965
to anyone who wants to
learn about this issue

00:26:25.965 --> 00:26:27.750
or is willing to kind
of hear what you've

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.150
been learned about today.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.580
In the film, they
really broke down--

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.760
which is a very complex sector
and one of the largest mining

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.200
sectors on earth--

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.690
into the east of Congo
and the south of Congo.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.150
And as you heard,
the human atrocities

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.250
are unparalleled in the east.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.090
Conservative estimates say
that over 6 million people have

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.400
died since the 1996
war in the east,

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.200
and many experts agree
it's many millions more.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.391
There's myriad armed groups,
dozens of semi-autonomous armed

00:26:58.391 --> 00:26:58.890
groups.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.380
Yes, a few of the biggest,
most well-funded groups

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.210
are Rwandan backed.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.880
Uganda plays a role
in that as well,

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.760
and the Congolese elites
have a role in some

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.620
of those groups as well.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.920
In that melee of
competing armed groups,

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.230
the humans on the ground are the
ones paying the price for that.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:21.090
They use sexual violence as a
tactic of war, intimidation,

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.630
child soldier recruitment,
and other human atrocities,

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.380
mass atrocities, to control
those mineral areas.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.290
Now the human rights
push originating

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.560
in Congo with youth movement
leaders that I mentioned--

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.845
LUCHA is the French acronym
"fight for change"--

00:27:38.845 --> 00:27:40.620
it is an entity that's
really been leading

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.550
the push for transparency
and for better

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:45.630
governance on the ground.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.650
They've been joined by
Congolese living in the diaspora

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:53.330
and international
citizens in solidarity,

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.100
and this is where this
large push since 2010,

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.040
2011, has resulted in some
of the world's major tech

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.200
companies taking aim.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.370
And by having Intel, Motorola
Solutions, and others actually

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.490
go visit with
mineral mining rights

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:12.000
associations and Congolese
civil society organizations,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.830
whereas five years
ago, there were

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.040
no certified mines
in the east, there

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:21.480
are now many dozens of
certified mines in the east.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.370
I was there in January
with our film team,

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:28.530
and we visited one of the
largest mines in eastern Congo.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.200
There's a minimum wage,
there's safety requirements,

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.270
there are labor requirements,
there are no more

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.280
children working in
the mines, and you're

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.910
seeing this type of operation
spreading in the east.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.160
And it's happening because
there's solidarity,

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.350
because you have some large
purchasers in the West,

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.740
like yourselves,
joining a coalition,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.280
joining conversation,
Congolese-led solutions

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.460
on the ground.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.240
There is no shortage of
Congolese entrepreneurs

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.550
that want to do sustainable
long term and safe business.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.350
It's the corruption
and the armed groups

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.400
that get in the way.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.680
But when you have a critical
mass of stakeholders

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.560
come together, the
unity is strong enough

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.800
where they can pilot
and now flourish

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.540
with conflict-free models.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.910
This extends beyond
mining in the east.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:18.180
There's Congo coffee
peace project.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.080
A former rebel commander,
General [? Cassango ?] is now

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.800
a part of a 2,500 person-strong
fair trade coffee operation,

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.560
which fills up a large, Masisi--

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.520
area of the Masisi
province north of Goma.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.780
This is 2,500 men that used to
be in local armed groups that

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.860
are now all working in the
coffee trade, fair trade coffee

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.370
trade.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.690
There's almost no violence and
no theft in Masisi anymore,

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.530
and everybody has a
reliable full time income.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.130
And so this push
and really the need

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.350
for some international
solidarity--

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.840
and not just civil society
leaders and business

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.060
leaders like ourselves--
but corporations

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:05.010
and powerful entities showing an
interest changes the dynamics.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.090
I remember getting a call
from Fidel Bafilemba,

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.140
a prominent activist
featured throughout the film.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.720
One of the leading experts
on mining and transparency

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.340
in the east gave me a call
shortly after the Intel

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.730
presentation at the Consumer
Electronics Show in January

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.090
2013 said that he got a
call from one of the most

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.700
notorious armed commanders
in Congo and said, Fidel,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.020
I know you're working with
these people in the West

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.180
and these companies.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.010
If someone wanted to
hire me and my men

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.660
to be like a
security contractor,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.500
we're open for that.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.920
And so even from
who we would want

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.750
to call the bad guys
of which there's

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.980
nothing that simple and
nothing black and white,

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.840
and from many child soldiers
and army commanders and soldiers

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.310
that I've met and gotten to
know their stories pretty well,

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.980
a pretty common scenario
is your mother is raped,

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.830
your father is killed,
and you're recruited.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.530
And so when we take a
look back at the influence

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.260
and the corruption, it's just
not black and white and good

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.220
guys and bad guys.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.560
It's much more complex
and nuanced than that,

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:12.700
and the one uniting factor and
a real strong reason for hope

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.660
is development.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.760
It's business development,
it's transparency,

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.410
and it's having a reliable, safe
way to make your livelihood.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.020
And the appetite is so strong.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.500
Now it gets to the other part
of my answer to your question,

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.380
and that's kind of some of
the good news in the east.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.680
The south, where Bloomberg
analysts referred

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:36.310
to as the real money, the
billion dollar deals, that's

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.000
handled by Kabila
and his regime,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.900
Gecamines, the state
mining industry.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.150
Very little signs
of progress, and I'd

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:44.550
just almost love to say, no.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.420
There's no progress.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.960
Global Witness, a British-based
transparency organization

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.060
that you can find
through our website,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:56.770
continues to document instances
of multimillion dollar bribes

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.930
from Glencore, which
is based in the UK.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.350
If you look in, some of
their major shareholders

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.500
are our own American-based
retirement funds

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.090
that we select for our 401ks.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.540
There's a lot of pressure
we could put, especially

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.700
through shareholders,
on Glencore.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.490
Glencore is one of the major
financiers of the Kabila

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:20.080
regime, his family, maintaining
the status quo of corruption.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.700
Congo-- in just a
couple of years,

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.460
looking at just a few
deals, the Congolese people

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.820
lost over a billion
dollars to corrupt deals

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.650
whereas President
Kabila would personally

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.230
get a bribe in the
millions of dollars

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.530
and then sell off Congolese
mining concessions

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.720
at billions under market value.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.850
That practice continues
today, and that's

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.040
what many experts agree
is the reason why he's

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.100
ignoring the Constitution
and is relatively immune

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.810
from international pressure.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.760
He has a virtual blank check.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.190
And that's all connected
to our mining industry

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.320
and the minerals that we
rely on in our industries

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.620
and in our lives.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.130
And so while public pressure
has improved some conditions

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:00.190
in the east and there an
increasing number of certified

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.610
conflict-free minds and other
entrepreneurial ventures

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:07.120
in the east, the state
as a whole and the sector

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.340
in the south, where the
real money has been made,

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.627
I think is the thing that
we need to continue to focus

00:33:11.627 --> 00:33:13.960
on, and we're going to continue
to advocate for and look

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.050
for increasing partnerships
for, but really put pressure

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.060
on the Western
mining companies--

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.280
Glencore chief among them--

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.150
to end their support
of the Kabila regime

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.640
and for really being the
root of corruption in Congo.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.860
KWAME MARFO: Quickly,
so within a continent,

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.960
I know a number of countries--

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.690
I know Ghana, for example--

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:37.950
recently discovered oil
and has been exporting.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.530
In terms of petroleum bills,
we actually got a bit of help

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:44.845
from Norway in terms of
building up our capacity.

00:33:44.845 --> 00:33:48.530
So on paper, we have some
quote "best practices."

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.880
But in practice,
[INAUDIBLE] events in Ghana,

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.260
we're doing really well.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.060
GDP growing at 8%.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.880
For five years, we discovered
a new and economy imploded.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.550
So when the rubber
did hit a tire,

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:06.880
the resource infrastructure
has been deemed to be 110.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.330
I know countries like Botswana
has done a pretty good job.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.750
Senegal recently
discovered large deposits

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:15.790
of natural resources,
and there's

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.110
conversation around doing that.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.050
Outside of Africa,
I know it was--

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.580
so with the last
US administration,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.699
so during the passage of the
Dodd-Frank Financial Reform

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:28.510
Bill--

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:32.650
so there's a provision in
it which basically requests

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:37.120
that companies doing mining
to publish what they pay,

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.120
which is designed to
bring transparency.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:45.280
And US taking that initiative
led the EU and Canada, which

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.550
I believe collectively
make up 75% of revenue

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.820
generated within the
sector, to also raise

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.489
the bar for companies
operating in these regions

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:59.300
to publish what they pay to
expose any corrupt practices.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.210
Unfortunately, the
new administration

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:06.910
here in the United States is
looking at reversing this bill.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.940
The good thing is I think this
went through Congress so it

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.910
cannot be unwound through
an executive action.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.470
It would have to go
through Congress.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.270
But we know the current
Secretary of State

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.740
has been in favor of
this bill, a good number

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.640
of the Senators on the other
side of the political spectrum

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.260
were on the same
side as the President

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.130
now so not very much in favor.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:31.200
So I guess we're in
watch and see mode.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.250
We also had a
conversation with the UN,

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.970
UNDP, about three
weeks ago, and there

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.760
is a conversation around the
screening this documentary

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.970
and what the UN is doing.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:43.270
And part of what really
piqued their interest

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:44.940
with this documentary
is they've been

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.220
spend a lot of time working with
countries that have recently

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:51.880
discovered natural resources to
help build up their capacity.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.890
That said, I think most of
the current bills in place

00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:00.280
have been largely focused
on natural resources

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.680
and how to make
the most out of it.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.830
Unfortunately, I
think the challenge

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.880
and why I think these
bills aren't really working

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.910
is the focus has been
largely on the resources

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:17.180
and how to get the best
price, how to negotiate.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.390
My view-- and this
is one thing we've

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.390
been working with
JD to get across--

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:25.360
is Africa's most valuable
resources are not

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.350
what lies underneath the Earth.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.780
They're hiding in plain sight.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.470
It's just people.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.520
So to the extent that we could
engage policy makers to channel

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.430
these resources towards
investing in the human capital,

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.920
I think that will be
the right way to go.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.420
So most of the
current conversations

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.380
I've been around setting
up sovereign wealth funds,

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.400
trying to find ways to
increase the bargaining powers,

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.990
and it's all a bit
resource-focused.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:53.140
I think if we could channel
that discussion away from,

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.230
you know, to
investing in people I

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:00.490
think that can drive
the change and lead

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:04.510
to more sustainable
growth on the continent.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:07.360
JD STIER: We're really grateful
to have this opportunity

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.540
and get to speak about a more
hopeful future and a way we can

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.880
work together to achieve that.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.470
If there's a small
part of you that

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:19.494
would be open to exploring a
way that you can help out--

00:37:19.494 --> 00:37:21.160
you know whether it's
signing a petition

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.751
and sharing a petition, helping
raise awareness, explore

00:37:24.751 --> 00:37:27.250
some innovative ways that we
can engage students and youth--

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.370
if you're interested in that
or if you want to explore ways

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:33.880
to give direct support
or you can rally

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.770
some folks on your team
or more broadly here

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.940
for some direct support,
please take my card before you

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.260
leave the room.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.240
We're really grateful
to have had opportunity.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.940
For all of you watching it
online and for those of you

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.860
here in the room,
thank you very much,

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.530
and we want to just have some
closing remarks from Jim.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:52.115
So thank you all very much.

00:37:52.115 --> 00:37:54.490
JIM N.: [INAUDIBLE] thank you
all for watching this film.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.740
And again, as JD said if
you want more information,

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.350
want to know how you
can help further,

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.875
definitely a lot of great
resources on the website.

00:38:00.875 --> 00:38:03.310
Again, I just want to add again
I was in Congo last month.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:05.990
It was my first
time in 19 years.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.320
So it was my first time
going there as an adult,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.670
and basically, one thing
that's common in the people

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:14.770
you talk to is that there's just
frustration and exasperation

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.746
because everybody wants to work.

00:38:16.746 --> 00:38:18.620
People want opportunities,
but a lot of time,

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.245
there's powers that
be that pretty much

00:38:20.245 --> 00:38:24.310
prevent them from building their
version of the Congolese dream,

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:25.420
if you'd say.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.890
So basically, I just want you
to be aware that the Congolese--

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.750
I think as a Congolese
sometimes you're kind of worried

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.550
about these documentaries
because it's

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.670
like your people are painted
as helpless folks just looking

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.760
for help, looking for
outsiders to intervene.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.110
That's not the case.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.370
There are Congolese
solutions on the ground.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.203
There are Congolese who
really want to work,

00:38:44.203 --> 00:38:48.040
but there are powers that be a
lot of times from very wealthy

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.135
interests with big money, real
money, that really cannot--

00:38:52.135 --> 00:38:55.720
that really would be hurt by
Congo taking control of its

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.860
resources.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.320
So there's a lot of
major interests at heart.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.720
So it's really important
that to just also

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.010
be aware that the Congolese--

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.509
I just want to make
sure that people

00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:07.150
don't leave this
thinking, poor Congo,

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.740
I feel bad for the Congolese.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.020
They're in really bad shape.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.370
There are some problems, but
also there's a lot of pride

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:13.060
there.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.700
And as Congolese, we definitely
want to make sure that people--

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.249
that perception of us as a
poor, helpless bunch of people

00:39:19.249 --> 00:39:21.790
doesn't exist, that we don't--
we want to make sure that kind

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:22.464
of stops.

00:39:22.464 --> 00:39:24.880
But that if you want to support
that, again, you check out

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.550
the resources, make
sure you understand

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.720
where your 401ks going,
that you make sure

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.660
that if you want to support
an activist, then do that.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.825
And also one last thing
specifically to Google--

00:39:33.825 --> 00:39:35.950
when I was in Congo basically,
the American Chamber

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.840
of Commerce told me
that Google will be

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.800
going to Congo this December.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.000
They'll be helping set
up some fiber optics,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.530
I guess wiring and cables to
make for Wi-Fi connectivity.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.230
So again, I don't know how close
Google here and Google in Congo

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.796
works but basically, I think
it will be great if when

00:39:53.796 --> 00:39:55.420
Google is in the
country that they make

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.070
sure that they employ locals.

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.929
A lot of times foreign
companies they go elsewhere,

00:39:59.929 --> 00:40:01.720
and they just bring
their people with them,

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.880
and they don't have as
much as big of an impact

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.110
as they could in a
local population.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.260
So basically, if any
of you are interested

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.077
or are aware of how Google
Congo would operate,

00:40:11.077 --> 00:40:13.660
I definitely want to encourage
you to maybe talk to your team,

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.076
talk to your leaders
and make sure

00:40:15.076 --> 00:40:17.470
that there is a plan
in place to ensure

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.200
that when goes is in
Congo, it has as much

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.270
of a positive effect as it can.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.770
Thank you.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.820
[APPLAUSE]
