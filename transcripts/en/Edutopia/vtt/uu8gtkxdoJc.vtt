&gt;&gt;Come and get a card,
come and get a card.

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These students
from the Rocky Mountain School

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:17.116
of Expeditionary Learning in Denver
are voluntarily trading their

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.906
privileged status as Americans
for a night to cast their lot

00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:22.676
with the less fortunate of the world.

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:23.546
&gt;&gt;Thailand.

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:24.446
&gt;&gt;I'm really excited.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.906
&gt;&gt;What if you get in Thailand?

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Part National
Geographic, part Survivor,

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:33.536
this unique learning experience,
the Global Gateway Program,

00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:36.746
plays out on the Heifer Ranch
in Perryville, Arkansas.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:40.806
&gt;&gt;Holly: It's a program that is
designed to help kids really walk

00:00:40.836 --> 00:00:42.046
in somebody else's shoes.

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:46.196
Our program focuses on
hunger and poverty mostly,

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:47.806
a little bit on sustainable
development.

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:51.336
&gt;&gt;Pretend that you're in charge
and they'll follow suit, okay?

00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:54.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Heifer International
is best known as a nonprofit

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:57.836
that promotes sustainable
development by donating livestock

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.046
to impoverished families
around the world.

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:03.566
It also raises awareness
about hunger and poverty

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:06.066
through educational
programs like Global Gateway.

00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:10.386
&gt;&gt;Woman: So once you guys have had a
chance to look around, you guys can--

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:12.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Shortly after
they arrive here, the students

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:15.806
and teachers get a tour of what
will be their home for the night.

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:17.376
&gt;&gt;Are those two the shacks?

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:18.806
&gt;&gt;They're not shacks,
those are homes.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Spread over
five acres of the ranch,

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:23.406
the global village
features structures

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:26.406
that represent living
conditions in Guatemala.

00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:29.576
&gt;&gt;Boy: This house has solar
paneled lights on the ceiling.

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:33.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Thailand, and Zambia,

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:42.926
as well as a generic urban slum
Appalachia, and refugee camp.

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:45.276
&gt;&gt;Holly: Now if they get chosen
to live in the refugee camp,

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:50.116
not only can you not speak English
or any other language to anybody else

00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:53.146
in the village, but you also
don't have a place to have a fire.

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:55.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At each
stop, students read a bit

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:58.076
about the living conditions
in the various countries.

00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:00.966
&gt;&gt;Student: Wood, thatch
and other materials

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:03.586
which can be easily
found in the forest.

00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:07.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They also discuss issues
like sanitation, poverty and hunger.

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:09.016
&gt;&gt;Holly: Give me a description

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:11.796
of what you think a
hungry person looks like.

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:16.566
&gt;&gt;Student: Probably really weak and
probably can't do a lot of things.

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's one thing to
talk about hunger and poverty

00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:20.326
and quite another to live it.

00:02:20.756 --> 00:02:23.056
And just before sunset,
the students brace

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:24.846
for a night they will long remember.

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:27.566
&gt;&gt;Holly: 'Cause I'm gonna call some
numbers, I need you to please come

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:29.536
to the front of the room.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:30.966
Number twenty-nine.

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:32.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As their
numbers are called, students

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:35.786
and one adult chaperone are
combined to form a family,

00:02:35.836 --> 00:02:38.406
and assigned sleeping
quarters for the night.

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:42.496
&gt;&gt;Holly: Okay, you visit these folks
tonight, if you want to make soup,

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:44.436
because they have all
the water rights.

00:02:44.436 --> 00:02:46.286
So say hello to Guatemala.

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:48.336
&gt;&gt;I love my life.

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:50.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While the
lucky inhabitants

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:54.136
of Guatemala will have all the water
they need, they will have to bargain

00:02:54.136 --> 00:02:55.926
with their neighbors in
the Appalachian village

00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:57.536
for the wood they'll
need to make a fire.

00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:58.626
&gt;&gt;Holly: Number eighty-two.

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:01.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Each family
receives a bucket of resources

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:05.876
which might include matches,
flashlights, dishes or raw food,

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:08.736
but no one will have everything
they need for the night.

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:11.646
And the refugees will have nothing.

00:03:12.136 --> 00:03:14.616
&gt;&gt;Holly: Everybody else who's in
there needs to feel really lucky,

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:19.586
because this is going to be
our refugee family tonight.

00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:22.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To further
complicate matters,

00:03:22.996 --> 00:03:26.756
one member of each family
becomes instantly pregnant.

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:27.946
&gt;&gt;It's a water balloon?

00:03:28.216 --> 00:03:28.966
&gt;&gt;Yep.

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:32.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Another suddenly
loses the use of one arm.

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:36.296
&gt;&gt;The last time I see my hand.

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:38.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As night falls,
and the temperature plummets,

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:42.026
the scramble for food
and resources is on.

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:44.556
&gt;&gt;Hey, do you guys know
how to build a fire?

00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:47.656
&gt;&gt;Okay, you guys are--
if this is gonna work,

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:49.606
we really need to cooperate.

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:50.936
&gt;&gt;Okay, How to make--

00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:51.466
&gt;&gt;Be quiet, Jonah.

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:52.506
&gt;&gt;A cook fire, okay?

00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:54.376
&gt;&gt;Claire: We had to cook our
food, which was, I think,

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:56.546
one of the big challenges
for our group,

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:58.856
because we in the beginning
really didn't know how

00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:00.716
to communicate to each other.

00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:06.466
We had to stop arguing and we were
like, we need to be able to fix this.

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:07.796
&gt;&gt;He wants-- what do you want?

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:10.256
&gt;&gt;Powdered milk and water.

00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:13.426
&gt;&gt;Student: He wants-- no, that's
a small carrot, by the way.

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:14.586
Are you trading that to us?

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.996
&gt;&gt;He has nothing to
trade, he's a refugee.

00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:18.576
He doesn't have anything.

00:04:18.856 --> 00:04:20.166
&gt;&gt;What is he asking for?

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.386
&gt;&gt;We have powdered milk.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:21.896
&gt;&gt;Powdered milk.

00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:22.536
&gt;&gt;How do you know?

00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:25.076
&gt;&gt;'Cause he's pregnant, and
he's going "Ooh, ooh, ah, ah."

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:27.216
&gt;&gt;And he's a refugee,
so he doesn't have--

00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:29.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The adults in each
family can decide whether they want

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:34.386
to play the role of the elder, or
as in this case, a two year old.

00:04:34.386 --> 00:04:35.536
&gt;&gt;Oh, no, no, no, not there.

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:37.836
&gt;&gt;Holly: One of the things we
talk about with the adults is,

00:04:37.836 --> 00:04:40.446
if they step back,
the kids will step up.

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:43.326
Another way of talking about
that is failing forward.

00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:48.046
The things that we learn best as
people are lesson that we've had

00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:49.336
to learn kind of the hard way.

00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:50.906
&gt;&gt;Can't believe you just did that.

00:04:50.996 --> 00:04:53.326
&gt;&gt;Do we have anything we
can trade for more firewood?

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Throughout the
evening, negotiations proceed.

00:04:55.756 --> 00:04:59.346
&gt;&gt;Do you have any extra
food, any kind?

00:04:59.546 --> 00:05:00.416
&gt;&gt;No, we don't.

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:01.526
&gt;&gt;I don't think so.

00:05:01.526 --> 00:05:02.386
&gt;&gt;She needs food, Stop calling.

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:03.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Conflicts arise.

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:03.696
&gt;&gt;Stop.

00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:04.496
&gt;&gt;Hey, guys, we need--

00:05:04.496 --> 00:05:06.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And alliances are formed.

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:07.676
&gt;&gt;They're gonna give us
food if we cook for them,

00:05:07.676 --> 00:05:09.436
but whoever doesn't cook
for them doesn't get food.

00:05:09.436 --> 00:05:11.586
&gt;&gt;Marlon: I ended up as a refugee.

00:05:11.756 --> 00:05:15.326
We didn't have any supplies like
some other kids, so we had to go

00:05:15.326 --> 00:05:19.186
around begging without speaking, or
without speaking the same language.

00:05:19.546 --> 00:05:23.766
What ended up happening is, the urban
kids, they shared their food with us.

00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:25.106
That was really nice.

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:27.386
It was funny, 'cause they
didn't have any food at all,

00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:29.466
like barely any food
to start out with, so.

00:05:29.826 --> 00:05:33.266
&gt;&gt;Student: Hey, cooking people,
tell me how you like this idea.

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:34.336
We're gonna boil the--

00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:39.666
&gt;&gt;Zak: It was really cool, just being
to work together to get your food

00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:41.176
and make sure everybody gets fed.

00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:45.746
And I think the highlight of
it was just being independent.

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:48.756
&gt;&gt;This is way better than
what the other people have.

00:05:48.756 --> 00:05:51.596
&gt;&gt;Zak: I know, this is ten times
better than what people really have.

00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:54.196
They don't start out with rice.

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:58.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the morning, as
the class enjoys a meager meal,

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:01.476
they begin to share their
thoughts about the experience.

00:06:01.476 --> 00:06:03.216
&gt;&gt;Marlon: I still knew
in the back of my mind

00:06:03.356 --> 00:06:08.286
that I was gonna get food tomorrow,
but I think if I really was poor,

00:06:08.406 --> 00:06:10.496
that I wouldn't know that and
I think it would be a totally

00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:11.506
different experience.

00:06:11.506 --> 00:06:14.206
&gt;&gt;Holly: I just heard kids
last night going to bed,

00:06:14.546 --> 00:06:17.546
"This is really hard,
but it's really good.

00:06:17.946 --> 00:06:20.146
This is really helping
me think about things.

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:22.946
This is making me think
about people who are hungry

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:26.176
or the different choices or
where people sleep in the world."

00:06:26.606 --> 00:06:30.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After breakfast,
there are chores to tend to,

00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:32.986
like preparing wood for
the next group of villagers

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:35.636
and feeding some of the farm animals.

00:06:35.636 --> 00:06:37.046
&gt;&gt;Open the door, we're
coming through.

00:06:37.216 --> 00:06:39.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: During a
structured time for reflection,

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:43.466
students perform skits about some
memorable moments of the experience,

00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:46.476
like when the Guatemalan
villagers refused to give

00:06:46.476 --> 00:06:49.386
out water unless the others
washed and cleaned for them.

00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:50.546
&gt;&gt;We need water.

00:06:50.546 --> 00:06:51.046
&gt;&gt;Why?

00:06:51.116 --> 00:06:53.146
&gt;&gt;We need breakfast.

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:55.486
&gt;&gt;No, clean our dishes and our
house and we'll give you water.

00:06:55.486 --> 00:06:57.426
&gt;&gt;Well, we need-- we have to cook--

00:06:57.426 --> 00:06:59.416
&gt;&gt;You shouldn't have
forced us to make--

00:06:59.416 --> 00:07:02.286
&gt;&gt;Well, you know what, we have
an unlimited supply of water

00:07:02.286 --> 00:07:04.526
and you guys have nothing,
so clean our house.

00:07:04.526 --> 00:07:08.506
&gt;&gt;Holly: As a teacher, I'm often
trying to pose big questions.

00:07:08.506 --> 00:07:09.896
How do we solve this problem?

00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:11.416
How do we grapple with this dilemma?

00:07:11.876 --> 00:07:13.836
And so it couldn't
have been any better

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:16.686
that Guatemala decided they weren't
giving water out this morning.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:20.466
It truly allowed us to come to
a place where we had to wrestle

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:22.686
and grapple with some choice.

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:27.106
&gt;&gt;Aly: They ended up giving us
water, but not very happily,

00:07:27.916 --> 00:07:29.806
so that was really
hard, because I felt

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:32.726
like they were being very
selfish, because they could,

00:07:32.726 --> 00:07:36.546
would make everyone else hungry and
make everyone else upset and just

00:07:36.546 --> 00:07:38.506
so they didn't have
to do their dishes.

00:07:38.776 --> 00:07:40.076
&gt;&gt;No, but it tastes burned.

00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:46.546
&gt;&gt;Aly: This experience really opened
my eyes to like how people truly live

00:07:46.546 --> 00:07:50.936
out of the comfort zone, and
this past twenty-four hours,

00:07:50.936 --> 00:07:55.806
I got to live like they lived
and understand why I need

00:07:55.806 --> 00:07:58.186
to be taking action in my community

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:01.956
and I hope everyone
else took that away.

00:08:02.276 --> 00:08:05.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Heifer has added three
more facilities around the country

00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:08.786
where students can experience
the Global Gateway program.

00:08:08.786 --> 00:08:12.586
There are also classroom
initiatives like Read to Feed,

00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:15.576
a third through sixth
grade reading program

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:18.426
that highlights different cultures
and animals around the world,

00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:22.436
and a standards based curriculum
for grades six through eight.

00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:26.106
It shows how US consumer
choices affect others.

00:08:26.676 --> 00:08:30.626
But for making a lasting impression,
nothing beats living the lesson.

00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:31.546
&gt;&gt;Wait, where's the firewood.

00:08:31.716 --> 00:08:32.446
&gt;&gt;Give us a carrot.

00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:33.326
&gt;&gt;Jonah, move; Where's the firewood?

00:08:33.476 --> 00:08:37.096
&gt;&gt;Holly: It's not just, "Wow, we had
a great experience and now we go home

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:40.216
and turn on our lights and
go about our daily business

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:41.556
and not think about this again."

00:08:42.036 --> 00:08:44.766
It's meant to affect people to
think, "Okay, what can I do?

00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:47.776
I have the power and the
choice to make a new decision,

00:08:47.776 --> 00:08:50.346
because I have new knowledge,
so what is that choice

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:55.946
or decision going to be?"

00:08:56.046 --> 00:08:57.136
