Speaker 1:          00:01          Bear was telling me that he did a Carolines in New York City was like, it was almost like a college gig. He's like, people are so sensitive now in New York.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Oh, you know, he and I just did a, the VFW hall and Hollywood and, uh, then, uh, the it and I was calling him about another comic that I wanted. I was just talking to the bar. I thought he was really funny. Uh, and I now can't remember his name. Uh, Joe Derosa and I called him and he goes, yeah, I know. He's really good. And uh, and, and uh, he goes, how about I come over and do it? And I'm like, well, of course, Bill, whatever you want to do, time on it. Come on over. Well, he was doing a bunch of Trump stuff and, and uh, you know, and I guarantee you my fans are pretty split down the middle, but it did not go over well and he didn't give a fiddlers fuck about it. And so he just made him mad and stirred them up for about 20 minutes. And then we both, uh, I did my set and we smoked a cigar and uh, he, you know, he's not drinking either for like a year.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Yeah. He looks great. He looks really good. He looks thin and healthy. Yeah. Yeah. That the Trump jokes or interesting because uh, I don't remember anybody getting mad at you for Bush jokes. Right. It's different. His jokes, right? Yeah. Yeah. Even if you were a, like a Bush supporter, you could crack a joke about the way he spells potato or something. Like nobody gave a fuck. They didn't care. It was a different thing. Even if people were supporting and Bush, by the way, that's spelled potato wrong. Quail. Quail. That's right. That's right. That's how these rumors get started, man is I don't think it's data. You conspiracy dude over here. It off. This who spelled potato wrong shit. Oh, that's right. It was him. Um, Bush. Fuck some things up too though. Didn't he? Well, didn't fuck stuff up. There's the whole album, like the wit and wisdom of George W. Bush.

Speaker 1:          02:01          She says like, fool me once. Shame on you. Shame on me again. I don't know. You know what's interesting about Bush is when he was running for governor of Texas, he had a completely different way of communicating. He talked like a really smart guy. He's very articulate. I mean he was a smooth, smooth talker, like argument. Wwe does a video of him from back in the day when he was running for governor and he's great. You'll listen to him like glue, this energetic, intelligent guys articulate. He seems like one of us and then there's, they had a side by side video comparing him to like Bush after seven years in office, like he's barely hanging on because I pay attention to shit. He's given the reins to heaven and Hell to Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney is in a bunker, seven miles underground making the ferries decisions. You know? I mean it was weird. It was a weird time, but you can make fun of Bush all day long. Nobody gave a fuck. You make fun of Trump today. People want to kill. You got almost got into a scuffle the other day at the gas station.

Speaker 2:          03:00          This guy just starts spouting out stuff. He was putting gas in his car right over there and, and, and just, and by the first word that you is that came out of his mouth from nowhere, hadn't said a word to the guy, didn't say hi to him. Nothing. Nancy Polosi is the dumbest person that ever lived on this planet. And, and I get baited so easy. I just said probably not. Probably not that you're probably wrong, it's probably not. Oh, Obama was an idiot. He graduated number one from Harvard law. So yeah, views politically aside, we can start with, he's probably not stupid. And what a good speaker. He was the best. Oh yeah, it was smooth. Most presidential, he was a, he was a guy that you were happy to have represent you whether you believe with, you know, believe in him and support his ideas are not as a representative of our culture of our civilization.

Speaker 2:          03:59          That guy was smooth and measured and articulate and, and off the book, you know it most of the time, but you know, he was just, he was saying what he thought and he wasn't reading off a of scripted, well, you know the story about Clinton. I know, I know. Saw, know with being off the book, Clinton was such a good orator that the teleprompter went off. It broke like five minutes into his fucking speech and he did all that shit by memory. You see the whole goddamn thing by memory. And I played the nine holes of golf with him. Was he like, and uh, it was, well, there's still security secret service all around him. And so it was a private golf course. Uh, Larry Ellison a that owns oracle. Oh Wow. Uh, owns this private golf course. It has 14, he's a big tennis guy, so he puts on the tennis stuff out in palm springs and nobody plays his course and he doesn't play golf.

Speaker 2:          04:56          And uh, it's just his privacy as a deal as own course. Got his, yeah, he's got his own courses. He played through our group and shadow creek and Beverly Hill. I mean, I'm in Vegas. It really exclusive course, impossible to get on. And he was playing by himself and he was gone the tee box and I said, as lonely at the top end. And Larry, he goes, yeah. And he was balling and went off by himself and uh, but he wasn't even there but, but Clinton was, and he told me a story goes his friend of his a record producer rap records, big. I, you didn't tell me who it was and didn't tell me who the artist was either, but the artists was all thugged out and he was in a Ferrari store and, and uh, and uh, the salesman, he goes that you thinking about buying this car and the guy goes, no, I'm going to buy the car. I'm thinking about pussy. So the Clinton told me his story that had the word pussy in it and Clinton Clinton told me that that's a great

Speaker 1:          05:58          fucking story. That is a great story. That poor bastard. He's almost like a comic. Like you could just be free. Yeah. If think if he got divorced and just started going on the honest Bill Clinton fucked her. Yeah, I did. I didn't want to either. Going to do, what would you do? Would you do? You're in my position. Would you do, you're smart. You know, you don't got the 40 years left to live out a show of lap Prager ride in her mouth. That's what I love. The whole idea of being the fucking number one guy. You gotta be so Goddamn Pussy hungry to want to be the number one guy, 100% you got to have big appetites that for sure. For everything. Yeah. For everything. For everything. Yeah. That'd be super conqueror. Yeah. And all those guys aren't seeing, I'm not all those guys. I don't want to generalize, but, but it's really, really common for men that are in power positions to just be horny as fuck all the time.

Speaker 1:          06:55          Of course. I mean, we got to go back. The way we want these people to behave is so contrary to the way any king ever behaved ever in history. Like the stories of kings throughout history was always decadents. It was always, you know, all these women and why is food and more food and feeding them vast open sores and cutting off the fucking ex wives heads and shit. Like that's what you think of ordering armies, people protecting them. It's like those people were just gluttons the super gluttons of the world and we don't like that. So then we tried to turn someone into some fucking Norman Rockwell person. Right? And that doesn't work either. It's not, you don't have enough, uh, you don't, you, you don't have enough charisma to lead. Maybe, you know, Trump is showing us that, like, you could talk shit about him 24, seven, 365 days a year. He's not adjusting anything. In fact, he digs his heels in. He the same fucking guy.
