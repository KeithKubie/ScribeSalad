00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's do some more problems
that involve

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.450
the ideal gas equation.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.550
Let's say I have a gas in a
container and the current

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.455
pressure is 3 atmospheres.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.455
And let's say that the volume of
the container is 9 liters.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.230
Now, what will the pressure
become if my volume goes from

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.260
9 liters to 3 liters?

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.500
So from the first ideal gas
equation video, you can kind

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.980
of have the intuition, that
you have a bunch of-- and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.610
we're holding-- and
this is important.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.670
We're holding the temperature
constant, and that's an

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.420
important thing to realize.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.840
So in our very original
intuition behind the ideal gas

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.470
equation we said, look, if we
have a certain number of

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.340
particles with a certain amount
of kinetic energy, and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.480
they're exerting a certain
pressure on their container,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.710
and if we were to make the
container smaller, we have the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.010
same number of particles.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.300
n doesn't change.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.010
The average kinetic energy
doesn't change, so they're

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.470
just going to bump into
the walls more.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.030
So that when we make the volume
smaller, when the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.020
volume goes down, the pressure
should go up.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.500
So let's see if we can calculate
the exact number.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.250
So we can take our ideal gas
equation: pressure times

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.860
volume is equal to nRT.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.220
Now, do the number of particles
change when I did

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
this situation when I
shrunk the volume?

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.640
No!

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.920
We have the same number
of particles.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.880
I'm just shrinking the
container, so n is n, R

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.480
doesn't change, that's a
constant, and then the

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.030
temperature doesn't change.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.560
So my old pressure times volume
is going to be equal to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.740
nRT, and my new pressure times
volume-- so let me

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.280
call this P1 and V1.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.500
That's V2.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.500
V2 is this, and we're trying
to figure out P2.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.230
P2 is what?

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.610
Well, we know that P1 times V1
is equal to nRT, and we also

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.770
know that since temperature and
the number of moles of our

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.580
gas stay constant, that P2
times V2 is equal to nRT.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.280
And since they both equal the
same thing, we can say that

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.040
the pressure times the volume,
as long as the temperature is

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.220
held constant, will
be a constant.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.020
So P1 times V1 is going
to equal P2 times V2.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.290
So what was P1?

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.725
P1, our initial pressure,
was 3 atmospheres.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.580
So 3 atmospheres times 9 liters
is equal to our new

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.550
pressure times 3 liters.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.760
And if we divide both sides of
the equation by 3, we get 3

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.965
liters cancel out, we're left
with 9 atmospheres.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.010
And that should make sense.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.960
When you decrease the volume
by 2/3 or when you make the

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.890
volume 1/3 of your original
volume, then your pressure

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.230
increases by a factor
of three.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.390
So this when by times 3, and
this went by times 1/3.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.890
That's a useful thing
to know in general.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.180
If temperature is held constant,
then pressure times

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.290
volume are going to
be a constant.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.840
Now, you can take that
even further.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.920
If we look at PV equals nRT,
the two things that we know

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.930
don't change in the vast
majority of exercises we do is

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.640
the number of molecules we're
dealing with, and obviously, R

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.680
isn't going to change.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.990
So if we divide both sides of
this by T, we get PV over T is

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.200
equal to nR, or you could say
it's equal to a constant.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.960
This is going to be a constant
number for any system where

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.510
we're not changing the number of
molecules in the container.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.310
So if initially we start with
pressure one, volume one, and

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.360
some temperature one
that's going to be

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.410
equal to this constant.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.150
And if we change any of them, if
we go back to pressure two,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.750
volume two, temperature two,
they should still be equal to

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.970
this constant, so they
equal each other.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:59.150
So for example, let's say I
start off with a pressure of 1

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.010
atmosphere.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.590
and I have a volume of-- I'll
switch units here just to do

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.200
things differently--
2 meters cubed.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:20.070
And let's say our temperature
is 27 degrees Celsius.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.310
Well, and I just wrote Celsius
because I want you to always

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.600
remember you have to convert to
Kelvin, so 27 degrees plus

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:39.600
273 will get us exactly
to 300 Kelvin.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.530
Let's figure out what the new
temperature is going to be.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.300
Let's say our new pressure
is 2 atmospheres.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.820
The pressure has increased.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.920
Let's say we make the container

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.380
smaller, so 1 meter cubed.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.350
So the container has been
decreased by half and the

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.740
pressure is doubled by half.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.260
Let me make the container
even smaller.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.590
Actually, no.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.490
Let me make the pressure
even larger.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.470
Let me make the pressure
into 5 atmospheres.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.250
Now we want to know what the
second temperature is, and we

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.780
set up our equation.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:26.810
And so we have 2/300 atmosphere
meters cubed per

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:33.010
Kelvin is equal to 5/T2, our new
temperature, and then we

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:39.990
have 1,500 is equal to 2 T2.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.330
Divide both sides by 2.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.440
You have T2 is equal to 750
degrees Kelvin, which makes

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.290
sense, right?

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.560
We increased the pressure so
much and we decreased the

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.120
volume at the same time
that the temperature

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.460
just had to go up.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.410
Or if you thought of it the
other way, maybe we increased

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.850
the temperature and that's what
drove the pressure to be

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.420
so much higher, especially since
we decreased the volume.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.550
I guess the best way to think
about is this pressure went up

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.800
so much, it went up by factor
of five, it went from 1

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.040
atmosphere to 5 atmospheres,
because on one level we shrunk

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.920
the volume by a factor of 1/2,
so that should have doubled

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.870
the pressure, so that should
have gotten us to two

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.840
atmospheres.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.890
And then we made the temperature
a lot higher, so

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.340
we were also bouncing
into the container.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.910
We made the temperature 750
degrees Kelvin, so more than

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.280
double the temperature, and then
that's what got us to 5

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.820
atmospheres.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.310
Now, one other thing that you'll
probably hear about is

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.500
the notion of what happens
at standard

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.790
temperature and pressure.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.980
Let me delete all of the
stuff over here.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.290
Standard temperature
and pressure.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:52.498
Let me delete all this stuff
that I don't need.

00:07:52.498 --> 00:07:56.620
Standard temperature
and pressure.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.610
And I'm bringing it up because
even though it's called

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.930
standard temperature and
pressure, and sometimes called

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:06.800
STP, unfortunately for the
world, they haven't really

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.990
standardized what the standard
pressure and temperature are.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.810
I went to Wikipedia and
I looked it up.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.720
And the one that you'll probably
see in most physics

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.910
classes and most standardized
tests is standard temperature

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.250
is 0 degrees celsius,
which is, of

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.740
course, 273 degrees Kelvin.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.030
And standard pressure
is 1 atmosphere.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:36.919
And here on Wikipedia, they
wrote it as 101.325

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:40.905
kilopascals, or a little more
than 101,000 pascals.

00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:44.130
And of course, a pascal is a
newton per square meter.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.470
In all of this stuff, the units
are really the hardest

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.620
part to get a hold of.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.780
But let's say that we assume
that these are all different

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.550
standard temperatures and
pressures based on different

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.840
standard-making bodies.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.150
So they can't really agree
with each other.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.060
But let's say we took this as
the definition of standard

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.360
temperature and pressure.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.630
So we're assuming that
temperature is equal to 0

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:11.030
degrees Celsius, which is equal
to 273 degrees Kelvin.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.430
And pressure, we're assuming,
is 1 atmosphere, which could

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:22.430
also be written as 101.325
or 3/8 kilopascals.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.060
So my question is if I have
an ideal gas at standard

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:33.940
temperature and pressure, how
many moles of that do I have

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.330
in 1 liter?

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.630
No, let me say that
the other way.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.500
How many liters will
1 mole take up?

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.690
So let me say that a
little bit more.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.290
So n is equal to 1 mole.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.900
So I want to figure out
what my volume is.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.810
So if I have 1 mole of a gas,
I have 6.02 times 10 to 23

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.580
molecules of that gas.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.150
It's at standard pressure, 1
atmosphere, and at standard

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.390
temperature, 273 degrees, what
is the volume of that gas?

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.590
So let's apply PV
is equal to nRT.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.970
Pressure is 1 atmosphere, but
remember we're dealing with

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.660
atmospheres.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.500
1 atmosphere times volume--
that's what we're solving for.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:24.500
I'll do that and purple-- is
equal to 1 mole times R times

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.100
temperature, times 273.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.080
Now this is in Kelvin;
this is in moles.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.840
We want our volume in liters.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.210
So which version of
R should we use?

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.860
Well, we're dealing
with atmospheres.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.410
We want our volume in liters,
and of course, we have moles

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.550
in Kelvin, so we'll use
this version, 0.082.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.790
So this is 1, so we can ignore
the 1 there, the 1 there.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:11:00.820
So the volume is equal to
0.082 times 273 degrees

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:10.790
Kelvin, and that is
0.082 times 273 is

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:19.210
equal to 22.4 liters.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.690
So if I have any ideal gas,
and all gases don't behave

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.800
ideally ideal, but if I have
an ideal gas and it's at

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.150
standard temperature, which is
at 0 degrees Celsius, or the

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.105
freezing point of water, which
is also 273 degrees Kelvin,

00:11:32.105 --> 00:11:36.700
and I have a mole of it, and
it's at standard pressure, 1

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:42.590
atmosphere, that gas should take
up exactly 22.4 liters.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.370
And if you wanted to know how
many meters cubed it's going

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:50.780
to take up., well, you could
just say 22.4 liters times--

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.570
now, how many meters cubed are
there-- so for every 1 meter

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.060
cubed, you have 1,000 liters.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.740
I know that seems like
a lot, but it's true.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.460
Just think about how big
a meter cubed is.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:09.250
So this would be equal to
0.0224 meters cubed.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.930
If you have something at 1
atmosphere, a mole of it, and

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.580
at 0 degrees Celsius.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.580
Anyway, this is actually
a useful

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.680
number to know sometimes.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:24.280
They'll often say, you have 2
moles at standard temperature

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.070
and pressure.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.950
How many liters is it
going to take up?

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.920
Well, 1 mole will take up this
many, and so 2 moles at

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.750
standard temperature and
pressure will take up twice as

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.340
much, because you're just
taking PV equals

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.750
nRT and just doubling.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.265
Everything else is being
held constant.

00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:41.040
The pressure, everything else
is being held constant,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.480
so if you double the number of
moles, you're going to double

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.570
the volume it takes up.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.780
Or if you half the number of
moles, you're going to half

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.640
the volume it takes up.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.670
So it's a useful thing to know
that in liters at standard

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.980
temperature and pressure, where
standard temperature and

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.850
pressure is defined as 1
atmosphere and 273 degrees

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:01.040
Kelvin, an ideal gas will take
up 22.4 liters of volume.
