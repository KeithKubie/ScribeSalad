00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.302
- From 1925 to 2014 the
United States corn yield,

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:07.660
measured in bushels per
acre, bushels per acre,

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:12.293
grew by approximately 2.41% per year.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:15.523
By contrast, during the same time period,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.564
soybean yield grew by approximately 3.5

00:00:19.564 --> 00:00:22.801
bushels per acre every 10 years.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.503
Alright, so there's something
interesting going on here.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.729
They've given us how
much the corn yield grows

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:33.406
in percentage terms, on a
per year percentage terms.

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:36.061
While for soybeans yield they
tell us how much it grows

00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:40.677
in absolute terms, 3.5 bushels
per acre every 10 years.

00:00:40.677 --> 00:00:44.550
I guess you could say on average
0.35, if you divide by 10

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.294
0.35 bushels per acre per year.

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:57.598
A NASS survey showed that in 1959

00:00:57.897 --> 00:00:59.140
the corn yield was,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.512
actually let me make a little table here.

00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:02.511
I'm already sensing this'll be useful.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:04.468
So, let's think about this.

00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:07.779
So, we're gonna say, so
an NASS survey showed that

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:10.863
in 1959 the corn yield was

00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:13.551
51.2 bushels per acre.

00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:16.979
So, this is gonna be corn,
then they talk about soybean

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.647
a little bit so soybean.

00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:22.978
So, in 1959.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.178
In 1959 the corn yield
was, so we're gonna assume

00:01:27.178 --> 00:01:30.529
everything's in bushels per
acre, 51.2 bushels per acre

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:32.494
and the soybean yield was

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:37.391
23.5 bushels per acre.

00:01:37.987 --> 00:01:40.588
Based on the information
above which of the following

00:01:40.588 --> 00:01:42.477
is the best estimate for
the difference between

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:47.095
the corn yield and the
soybean yield in 1974?

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:51.882
So, 1974, so how many years have gone by?

00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:55.313
Let's see this is going to be 15 years.

00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:58.470
So, this is gonna be +15 years

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.416
from our 1959.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.128
So, actually the soybean is a
little bit easier to calculate

00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:07.261
'cause they just tell us the
absolute number of bushels

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.827
per acre every 10 years.

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:13.850
So, 15 years, if you do 3.5
bushels per acre every 10 years,

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.898
well 15 years is just gonna
be half more of that again.

00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:20.572
So, this is just gonna be 23.5

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:22.467
so in 10 years it'll grow

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:25.501
by 3.5 bushels per acre,
that's what they tell us.

00:02:25.657 --> 00:02:28.676
And then in another 5 years
it'll grow by half of this.

00:02:28.676 --> 00:02:31.541
Half of 10 years, well this
is gonna grow by let's see,

00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:34.513
half of 3.5 is what?

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:38.816
It is 1.75, and so

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:40.143
what is that going to be?

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:45.416
Let's see 23.5+3.5 gets us to

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:48.549
27, then 27

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:55.605
+1.75 is 28.75

00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:57.648
bushels per acre in 1974.

00:02:57.648 --> 00:02:58.630
Did I do that right?

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.429
23.5+3.5 is gonna be 27,

00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.969
28.75, yep.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:07.969
So, if we grow 3.5 bushels
per acre in 10 years

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.103
we're gonna grow 1.75 bushels per acre in

00:03:10.103 --> 00:03:13.089
the next 5 years so that's the 15 years.

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.182
Right over here this is
10 years plus 5 years,

00:03:15.532 --> 00:03:17.719
so we get to 28.75.

00:03:18.444 --> 00:03:20.827
Now corn, what's corn going to be?

00:03:21.248 --> 00:03:23.733
Well, here we're going by
a percentage every year.

00:03:24.072 --> 00:03:28.135
So, this is going to be
51.2 and we are growing,

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:30.246
we're going to multiply this times

00:03:30.246 --> 00:03:35.169
1.0241.

00:03:35.813 --> 00:03:39.125
If you're growing by 2.41
percent that's the equivalent

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:43.560
of multiplying by 1.0241.

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.855
You grow, you keep what you have

00:03:45.855 --> 00:03:50.249
and add 2.41% right over here.

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.815
And, you're going to multiply
that by as many years

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:55.930
as you have, so it's going
to be to the 15th power.

00:03:56.554 --> 00:04:00.812
Well, I don't know what
1.0241 to the 15th power is

00:04:00.812 --> 00:04:03.270
but luckily this is one of the
questions where a calculator

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.039
is encouraged, so let's figure this out.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.432
So, let's figure out, let me
make sure it's all cleared out.

00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:14.552
1.0241

00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:18.852
and let me raise it to the 15th power

00:04:19.146 --> 00:04:21.454
is equal to 1.42 all of this business

00:04:21.454 --> 00:04:23.716
and then multiply that by 51.2.

00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:28.777
So, times 51.2 is equal to

00:04:29.177 --> 00:04:33.592
73. roughly 73.18.

00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:38.753
So, this is approximately 73.18.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.697
Now what they want is
what's the best estimate

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.054
for the difference between the corn yield

00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:44.604
and the soybean yield.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:49.317
So, the difference 73.18 minus 28.75

00:04:49.616 --> 00:04:51.282
and they have a couple
choices that are kinda close

00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:53.041
so let me just make sure
I do the math right.

00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:55.459
I can do this on paper
but we have our calculator

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:56.406
so I'll just use that.

00:04:56.406 --> 00:05:01.221
So, minus 28.75

00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:02.446
to calculate the difference

00:05:03.088 --> 00:05:06.724
gets us to about 44.4
and if we're gonna round

00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:10.611
to the nearest whole it be 44.

00:05:11.072 --> 00:05:15.183
So, it's this choice, that
choice right over there.
