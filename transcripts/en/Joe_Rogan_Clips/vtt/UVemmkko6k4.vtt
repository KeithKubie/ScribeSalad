1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
You can imagine if you found out,

2
00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:05.340
how ironic would it be if you found out that like Stanford and Harvard had

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:08.580
banded together to try to stop this from coming out because it would kill their

4
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:12.640
business.
Yeah.

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.490
All got together and it was like,
you know,

6
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:19.140
just like how this college admission scandals going down.
It's so great.

7
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:23.940
If there was a scandal that all these higher universities had banded together to

8
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:25.980
try to stop this cause he was going to kill their business.

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.570
Everybody can know everything.

10
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:31.800
We tell them more than everything we tell them I'm going on some college tours

11
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:35.850
already.
Jesus Christ.
Oh my God,

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.400
I really makes you think.
I'm like,
what dad did they really need this?

13
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.250
This is expensive.
Oh yeah,
man,
do they really need a degree and all of this?

14
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.470
I don't know.
It's a weird businessman.
It's a total weird business.

15
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.290
Don't know why it costs so much.
I'll tell you why.
Why?

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.240
Because the administrators are all making bank.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.290
It's all your [inaudible].
What's going on?
So all these kids,

18
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:04.680
generations are in debt because they have to take these student loans because

19
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.880
college is more expensive than ever before.
Well it's,

20
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.190
it hasn't changed running the university,
leading the teachers,

21
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.910
it's the administration of these giant,
um,

22
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.790
universities are making so much money.

23
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.210
They're making millions and they keep cranking it out and they keep,

24
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.820
keep needing to up the up the rate and then they make money accessible for the

25
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:30.600
students through loans and then they keep feeding themselves.
It's horrible.

26
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.370
It's a horrible corrupt system.
And it's um,
it's also subsidized,

27
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:39.360
right?
Well the government will subsidize somebody.
Yeah.
Yeah.

28
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.130
How much does the government subsidize private education?
Private education,

29
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.870
I don't think can it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You get fast full on though.
Yeah.

30
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.750
It's so expensive.
I mean,
you know,
isn't that weird too?

31
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:55.350
There's like state schools,
private schools.
Yes.
They're all costs money.

32
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.720
Everything costs money.
Yeah.
Like what does it like?

33
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.040
Well like six hours to get to like USC.
How much is it like a semester at USC?

34
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.780
70,000?
No,
not a master.
A year.
A year.

35
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.530
Cause it's 70,000.
Probably 70.
50.
For the year.
Yeah.
That's like the,
that's the,

36
00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.880
that's the online Google search thing.

37
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.500
That's 50 plus your room and board plus all the rest of if your kid fucks off.

38
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.150
Yes.
Which of course they're going to do.
And by the way,
to have 50 grand,

39
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:28.000
you need to make like 80 right or taxes out yet.

40
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.100
How to make 80 grand.
Yeah.
For a whole year of your kid being in school.
Yeah.

41
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.190
And if your kid's just doing bong hits.
Totally

42
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.240
pawn and shit.

43
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.750
My father dropped me off to school at school and I was like a sophomore.

44
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.830
It just drove me into,

45
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.160
into college and drop off my stuff and I was so psyched to go see my friends and

46
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:57.390
I was like,
just come,
you know,
just work hard.
Be Responsible.
Okay Dad.
Okay.
Okay.

47
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.880
I go running into my dorm room.
My buddies are there.

48
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:05.050
I haven't seen them all break Tom,
they hand me a bong.
Hey,

49
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.440
I light up.
As soon as I walk up my bags and I haven't even trapped,

50
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.730
I light it with my lighter in this huge flame comes out almost like lights my

51
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.650
kicks on fire.
I'm like,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Hey Papa,

52
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:20.830
your dad's outside.
He's in the van.
I had forgot something.

53
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:25.690
I forgot a lamp in the van.
He's like,
I go running out there.
I'm like,

54
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.950
Hey,
what's up?
You know,
hoping I don't smell.
He goes,
hey,
you forgot your,

55
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.600
what happened to your eyebrow?
Your eyebrows burnt off.

56
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.070
What did you do in the two minutes?
I just took the lamb.
Thanks Dad.
See

57
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.460
checks.
He's writing checks for me to go do.
Yeah,
it's brutal.

58
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.820
Jesus.
Actually more than I was just tuition.
I saw,
let's see,

59
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:56.821
75 $75,000 USC one year room and boards 15 three that's got to be low because

60
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.000
that's just about it.
Over a thousand a month.

61
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.630
That's gotta be a man and that's without like if your kid,

62
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.930
if you live on these coasts and you're flying your kid back and forth and all

63
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:09.980
the rest of it.
Look at personal expense.

64
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.270
Personal and miscellaneous 1400 bucks for the year.

65
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.270
For the hundred bucks a month.
Get Out.
Yeah,
it's crazy at it.

66
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:17.910
Forget it always a week.

67
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.590
Books are going to be way more than a hundred bucks a month to the books are

68
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.520
going to be 1200 a semester.
Probably.
You should go to state school.

69
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.690
You pay a quarter of that.
Stay in,
get your undergrad.

70
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960
Things like you could have a no nonsense education like me where he just read

71
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:37.510
things that you're interested in and then you never get like a real base

72
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:41.620
education.
Like I don't have a degree in anything.
You didn't go to college?

73
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.030
I went to college but I fucked off.
I barely paid attention.
Yeah.

74
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.170
What do you mass Boston,
so yeah,
that's when my sister went.

75
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.220
I didn't even take my sats.
Oh really?
No.
There was like a,

76
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:53.440
they had like a continuing education program.

77
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:55.930
You can just sign up and start taking classes there.
Oh,
nice.

78
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.950
Did you go the whole way?
No,
I went for three years.

79
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.090
I was barely paying attention.
Three years.
Yeah,
I did.

80
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.700
I guess I realized I was doing it a little bit while I was still doing stand up

81
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.450
while I started doing stand up.
Uh,

82
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.590
it was literally only so that people didn't think I was a loser.

83
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.143
Right.

84
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.810
I just wanted to let people know I'm doing something I didn't pay attention at

85
00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:21.010
all.
Right.
I will.

86
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:25.480
All I was thinking about was a martial arts competition and then it was stand
up,

87
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.710
right?
Well,
yeah,
the transition right there.
Yeah.
Once that happens,
forget it.

88
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.400
Once I realized that people made money doing stand up,
that's when I quit.

89
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.070
It depends on what you want to go do.

90
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.000
Like there's certain you want to go into law or you want to do certain,
you know,

91
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.781
medicine.

92
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:45.460
There's certain routes where you need a degree where you really need a degree

93
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.060
and there's definitely something good to going to school and being around other

94
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:52.270
people from around the country and all kinds of thinking for sure.

95
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.660
It's all positive,
but you should not go into debt.

96
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.090
I have all these nephews that they got out of school,

97
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.730
$30,000 in debt.
Right.
This is the start of your life as an adult.

98
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.940
The worst 30,000 in debt.
They can't keep up with the payments.

99
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.420
So then the interest kicks in and after four years,

100
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:16.421
now they owe 50,000 and they're constantly chasing it and now they asked their

101
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:19.940
parents to help them out and they co sign.

102
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:23.900
Now you have two generations and they probably hate taxes.
Right.
And,

103
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.290
and they're now on their second job where no one cares anymore.

104
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.080
Where you went to school.
They never even asked the question.
They don't know.
Not,

105
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:36.590
not,
no,
no.
In certain places.
Yeah,
in certain rounds.

106
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.970
Really depends on what you're trying to do,
right?
You've got to be a doctor.

107
00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:41.680
I think they care.
Yes.
I think take care.
Oh yeah.

108
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.870
Well maybe it depends on what kind of doctor.
There's a lot of,

109
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.580
she's applying for jobs as a history professor,
go into television production,

110
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:51.410
whatever.
No one gives a shit.
That's true.

111
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.020
If you're going to do Hollywood type jobs.
Yeah.
Nobody gives a fuck.

112
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:58.110
Now go working in construction.
You could do what when again,

113
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.330
my whole thing is,
and I keep trying to say this to my daughter,

114
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:06.440
is that you should never don't jeopardize your future for this degree.

115
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.820
You can get degrees,
there'll be important,
they'll help you,

116
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.680
but you should not strap yourself with debt.
That's wise advice.
Yeah,

117
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.510
very wise advice.
And she's like,

118
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.050
how about you work harder and just pay for it and I won't have to be in debt

119
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.920
does.
That's a good thing for her to say.
Yeah.
It's clever.

120
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.610
Very smart.
[inaudible] and my other daughter,

121
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:33.080
I'm just going to give her headshots $300 head shots right in the business.

122
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.780
The business done that old show business.
Hey,

123
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:42.290
everybody is crazy.
But I thought showbiz people crazy.
Everyone's crazy.

124
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.170
Every of your crazy.
I'm crazy.
Yeah.

125
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.620
The people who you think insurance salesmen,
people are fucking crazy.

126
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.930
They're just better at hiding it all day.
Yeah.
That's what they're doing.
They,

127
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.310
that's what they do.
They hide it.
They hide it all fucking day.

128
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.480
If you were really smart,
he just go into plumbing lists.

129
00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:02.210
There's not a lot of plumbers out there need plumbing.
Yeah.

130
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.760
And you make a really good living at it and there's not a lot of people that are

131
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:06.050
learning these skills anymore.

132
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.320
That's what you should go do or do something you really want to do.

133
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.320
Find something you really want to do.
Yeah.

134
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.120
Maybe you don't want them to be a plumber should be a requirement that they know

135
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:19.820
what they want to do before they go into college.
No.

136
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.910
But the see what college should be is education would,

137
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.720
it really seems to be more as like prepping you for the job for us,
you know,

138
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.960
I mean there's education as well,

139
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:35.260
but it's prepping you for the job force and nowadays at least in a certain

140
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:37.380
segment of the population,
you're,

141
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.450
you're getting these colleges that are also like socially indoctrinating kids,

142
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.670
socialist ideas and a lot of ideas that you know,

143
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.210
just are contrary to what probably their parents taught them.

144
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.480
So then there's this internal dispute and who's right and who's wrong and do I

145
00:08:56.011 --> 00:09:00.990
rebel against my parents and yeah.
Go full social justice warrior.
Yeah.

146
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.300
Yeah.
Join the young Republicans on campus and you know,

147
00:09:04.301 --> 00:09:07.590
the kids are just trying to find who they are.
Yeah.
There's definitely,

148
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:10.110
when you walk onto these campuses,
even just to tour them,

149
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.350
which I never did when I was,
I just picked one out and went.

150
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.790
But you go in if the personality of each university is so dominant,

151
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:21.510
as soon as you walk onto the campus and went to some small,
uh,

152
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.600
really left liberal arts schools and you just feel like the posters and

153
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:31.320
everything,
you're just like as a,
as a white male,
you're not welcoming at all.

154
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.800
And then you go to some other places and it's just kind of free flowing and

155
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:38.730
everybody's just into this.
They're just all about the football team.

156
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:40.650
Have you ever seen the poster?
It says,
I was a white male.

157
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:44.520
You're not welcome here.
Yeah.
Where in my daughter's room.

158
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:49.260
[inaudible]

159
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.990
that's hilarious.
No,
but you know,
you get like just like very,

160
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.880
very progressive and very,
you know,
every,
everything is uh,
an issue and you know,

161
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.350
that's where you develop those idea eight boy I'm saying is you can really learn

162
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:07.530
from going on these campuses like,
oh,
this is,
well,

163
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:12.531
there's a vibe you get in doc indoctrinated into whatever vibe the campus holds.

164
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:18.140
You get social points for like following those ideas as far as,

165
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.160
as hardcore as you can.
Yeah,
it's right.
It's really interesting.
Yeah.

166
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.060
If you take yourself out of whichever way you lean,
if you lean left,
you can say,

167
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:29.160
well,
it's because they're young and they're passionate and they're right.

168
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.450
Raylene,
right?
Like,
oh,

169
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:34.260
they're babies and they're being taught by people who never made it in the real

170
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:37.700
world.
They only just an academia and there.
Yeah.
Just look at,

171
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.820
instead of looking at like that,

172
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.410
look at it where you don't have a fucking dog in the fight and just step back

173
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:44.520
and go,
this is fascinating.

174
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.230
It's like people are just trying to change and influence people's thinking and

175
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:52.630
behavior and some of it is to justify their,

176
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.040
their own thinking and behavior.
Some of it is because peep,

177
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:57.930
some people just like controlling people,

178
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.890
like getting people to listen to them and some of it is because they genuinely

179
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:04.950
think that this is for the best for the human race and it's all these things are

180
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.440
competing together.
Yeah.

181
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.490
That's why you have some people that are activists and you meet them.

182
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:09.540
They're not annoying at all.
You're like,

183
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:12.570
God damn you are really cool because they're doing it with the right heart,

184
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.470
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of activists that are so what knowing,

185
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.890
why are they so annoyed?
Because they're not doing it for the right reasons.

186
00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:23.760
They're now doing it to try to change people because they want to poke you.

187
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.330
They want to,

188
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.820
they want to have a reason to be upset at you because you're not listening to

189
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:29.880
them.
You're not following their ideas,
write them and their,

190
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:30.870
those are the key words.

191
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:35.550
It's about them and their status and their power over you and yeah.
No.

192
00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:38.130
I know there's a couple people,
you know,

193
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.470
there's a couple of people I know that have gone that way so hard that you can't

194
00:11:43.471 --> 00:11:47.670
even have conversations with them on both sides.
It doesn't help.
It doesn't.

195
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.770
All it does is create more,

196
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.090
more conflict like that can now combative attitude creates more conflict.
