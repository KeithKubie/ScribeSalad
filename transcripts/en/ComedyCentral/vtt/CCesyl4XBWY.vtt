00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:02.301
Opposers...

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:05.972
this weekend, Trump is heading
to the G7 Summit,

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.741
a meeting of the top
economic powers in the world.

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:11.878
Not to be confused
with the Furious 7 Summit,

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:16.082
a meeting of the top
Vin Diesel fans in the world.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:19.118
That's where Don Jr. will be.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.220
This year the G7 is being held

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:23.990
in America's
most dangerous enemy--

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:25.291
Canada.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:27.460
A country that Trump
recently slapped

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:31.397
with some long overdue,
very badass economic sanctions

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.200
for reasons
of national security.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.569
Now, the lying media
would have you believe

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.571
that Trump is being ridiculous,

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:40.339
that Canada is an ally

00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:43.676
and the world's greatest source
of hot Ryans.

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:45.311
(laughter)

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.547
But...

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.949
They are good-looking Ryans.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.384
We know the truth.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.686
Canada is hanging
over America's head

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.988
like a maple-scented
Sword of Damocles.

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:59.125
And Trump's done playing nice.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.161 line:0%
President Trump and Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.497 line:0%
according to our sources, Wolf,
had a testy phone call

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.732 line:0%
late last month over new tariffs

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.935 line:0%
imposed by
the Trump administration.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.237 line:0%
Trudeau pressed the president
on how he could justify

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.806 line:0%
these tariffs as
a national security issue.

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:15.408 line:0%
In response, Wolf,

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.376 line:0%
we're told Mr. Trump quipped
to Trudeau,

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.079 line:0%
"Didn't you guys burn down
the White House?"

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:23.149 line:0%
This was an apparent reference
to the War of 1812.

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:25.952
Yeah, that's right, Trump.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.387
Don't let that go.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.623
(laughter)

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.793
Canada did burn down
the White House in 1812,

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:35.762
and we have the footage
to prove it.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.134
Ooh. Ooh.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:44.036
Man.

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.640
The past was so high-def.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:52.211
And in 1812,
that was our only helicopter.

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.981
And even though nerdy historians
are quick to point out

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.517
that Canada didn't burn down
the White House,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.286
that it was, in fact, British
forces that set the fire,

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.021
and that the reason
they did it was, ironically,

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:05.525
because of a trade dispute.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.527
(laughter)

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.395
Fact checkers be damned.

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.197
I'm with Trump on this one.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.400
Hey, Canada, do you think Trump
is gonna let this thing slide?

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:17.103
Trump doesn't let
anything slide.

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:19.639
He doesn't even
let himself slide.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.240
No, too dangerous.

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.776
There could be sharks
down there.

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.145
Trump knows that those
who forget the past

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:27.914
are doomed to be hit with steel

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.715
and aluminum tariffs
200 years later,

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:31.584
during peacetime.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:33.486
And Canada
is still attacking us.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.121
Just this month, they dispatched

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:37.490
one of their rhyming Mounties
with a dope fade

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.393
to harass one
of America's finest,

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.496
unregulated
pharmaceutical pushers.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.498
(laughter, whooping, applause)

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.501
A disgrace. A disgrace.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.236
And sly Canadian operatives

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.905
are pulling off attacks
like this every day.

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:55.341
Don't let Prime Minister Abs
sway you.

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:58.811
Our soldiers who had fought and
died together on the beaches

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:02.248
of World War II, and the
mountains of Afghanistan,

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:04.150
this is insulting to them.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:06.485
The idea that we are somehow

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:09.222
a national security threat
to the United States is,

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.691
quite frankly, insulting
and unacceptable.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.826
You know what? I will tell you
what's insulting:

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.430
having a national anthem that
doesn't mention bombs once.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.432
(laughter)

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.000
What? You think these tariffs

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.336
were politically convenient
for Trump,

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.304
and he called you
a national security threat

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:27.807
because it's the easiest reason
to enact them?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.408
Please.

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:33.246
If you believe that, we got
a Stanley Cup to sell you.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.314
Seriously, we keep winning it
from you

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:39.051
and we don't care
about hockey at all.

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:41.153
It's embarrassing.

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:42.455
Just take it.

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.789
We'll...

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:48.361
We'll give it to you
for basically nothing.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.830
Opposers, the fact is,

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.399
Trump is heading into enemy
territory this weekend.

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:55.735
So, President Trump,
I know you're watching.

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:57.737 line:0%
Might I recommend going to
our online store

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.572 line:0%
theshopposition.com,

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:02.808 line:0%
and picking up our
Canadian War Prep Kit,

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:05.678 line:0%
complete with geese
distraction crumbs,

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:08.481 line:0%
a bottle of good-tasting
American ketchup,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.784 line:0%
and a specialized
anti-politeness flak jacket

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:15.688 line:0%
that can stop an "I'm soorry"
at close range.

00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:17.323
So God speed, Trump.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:19.558
Go show Canada
what you cana "do.”

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:20.326
The fight continues.
