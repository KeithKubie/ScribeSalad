00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's look at the answer
to our inclusion quiz.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.260
If the two caches do
maintain inclusion property,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.010
the block that was in L1
still is in L2 as well.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.190
So when we want to write it back,
it will be a level two hit and

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.980
it cannot be a level two miss
because inclusion guarantees that,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.290
that block still exists in L2.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.840
After we do the write back, we can
try to bring the new block into L1.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.280
And that may replace this
block from both L1 and L2.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.170
But until it's written back,
it's a block that exists in L1.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.708
So it also is in L2.

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:37.220
Thus the write back is a hit.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.960
In contrast, if we make no
attempt to maintain inclusion

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.450
when a dirty block is replaced
from the level one cache.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.660
That block may or may not be in
the level two cache as well.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.950
So we may have a write back
be a level two right hit or

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.208
if the block is not in L2
anymore it will be a miss.

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:04.560
So write back handling
becomes slightly easier if

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.770
you do maintain the inclusion property.
