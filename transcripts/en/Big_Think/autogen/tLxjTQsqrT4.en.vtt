into it the misconception that you
referenced is that the idea the goal is

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370
referenced is that the idea the goal is
 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.750

into the hospital they spend less and

their quality of life their length of
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.640
their quality of life their length of
life is increased that's what we can do

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650
life is increased that's what we can do
 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.150
life is increased that's what we can do
if we really do it right so yes we need

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160
if we really do it right so yes we need
 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.030
if we really do it right so yes we need
to save money but we will save money as

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040
to save money but we will save money as

a byproduct of having a system that
 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.710
a byproduct of having a system that
works better we're not going to save

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720
works better we're not going to save
 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.510
works better we're not going to save
money by taking a meat axe and just

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520
money by taking a meat axe and just
 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.130
money by taking a meat axe and just
clawing off some part of health care

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140
clawing off some part of health care
 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.140
clawing off some part of health care
spending that's what a lot of the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150
spending that's what a lot of the
 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.609
spending that's what a lot of the
alternative is if we don't do this

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619
alternative is if we don't do this
 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.550
alternative is if we don't do this
what's going to happen probably a lot of

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560
what's going to happen probably a lot of
 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.020

health plan with very high cost share
 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.900
health plan with very high cost share
and you go out and deal with it

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910
and you go out and deal with it
 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.729
and you go out and deal with it
everything we know is that people will

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739
everything we know is that people will
 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.590
everything we know is that people will
stop taking their medications they'll

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600
stop taking their medications they'll
 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.090
stop taking their medications they'll
save money and their health will

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100
save money and their health will
 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.240
save money and their health will
deteriorate we have to find a way and we

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250
deteriorate we have to find a way and we
 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.090
deteriorate we have to find a way and we
believe there are ways where we can save

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100
believe there are ways where we can save
 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.210
believe there are ways where we can save
money and we can improve health and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220
money and we can improve health and
 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.729
money and we can improve health and
people know this people know that the

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739
people know this people know that the
 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.530
people know this people know that the
health care system costs more than it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540
health care system costs more than it
 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.570
health care system costs more than it
should and a part of that is because the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580
should and a part of that is because the
 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.490
should and a part of that is because the
thing just doesn't work right and you

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500
thing just doesn't work right and you
 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.759
thing just doesn't work right and you
wind up having people in very expensive

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769
wind up having people in very expensive
 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.380
wind up having people in very expensive
circumstances after the fact when you

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390
circumstances after the fact when you
 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.570
circumstances after the fact when you
could have prevented it so I don't think

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580
could have prevented it so I don't think
 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.509
could have prevented it so I don't think
that convincing people of that

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519
that convincing people of that
 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.210
that convincing people of that
presumption is that hard I think what we

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220
presumption is that hard I think what we
 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.670
presumption is that hard I think what we
have to do is one make sure we do that

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680
have to do is one make sure we do that
 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.920
have to do is one make sure we do that
make sure we put the steps in place to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930
make sure we put the steps in place to
 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.930
make sure we put the steps in place to
do that and second is we need to make

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940
do that and second is we need to make
 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.460
do that and second is we need to make
sure we don't demagogue it so we just

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470
sure we don't demagogue it so we just
 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.259
sure we don't demagogue it so we just
say to people oh what the president

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269
say to people oh what the president
 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.259
say to people oh what the president
wants is to ration your care or what

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269
wants is to ration your care or what
 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.060
wants is to ration your care or what
senator Kennedy wants is to make sure

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070
senator Kennedy wants is to make sure
 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.830
senator Kennedy wants is to make sure
you don't get so we need to get away

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
you don't get so we need to get away
 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.570
you don't get so we need to get away
from that because people without it's

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580
from that because people without it's
 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.039
from that because people without it's
complicated enough no one's going to

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049
complicated enough no one's going to
 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.930
complicated enough no one's going to
understand all the details and if people

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
understand all the details and if people
 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.490
understand all the details and if people
hear those things and they get scared

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500
hear those things and they get scared
 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.590
hear those things and they get scared
then they'll be tempted to back off and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600
then they'll be tempted to back off and
 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.759
then they'll be tempted to back off and
that would be just the worst of all

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769
that would be just the worst of all
 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:13.800
that would be just the worst of all
situations

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810
situations
 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.870
situations
