00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
(audience applauding and cheering)

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.110
- Hello, everybody.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.793
Thank you so much.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.950
Thank you very much.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.810
Thank you.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.310
Please, everybody have a seat.

00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:12.049
Thank you.

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.050
Thank you very much.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.220
Well, first of all,
thank you so much, Jack,

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.673
for that really kind introduction.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.561
And I like the socks.

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:24.100
(audience chuckling)

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.760
I also want to thank you and
Rose and Tatiana and your dad

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.870
for sharing Caroline with
us the past few years

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.993
as America's Ambassador to Japan.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.793
Caroline, you, true to form,
did your country proud,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.710
and I'm sure your father, mom

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.310
would have been proudest of all.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.483
I sure was proud, and I'm
grateful for your friendship.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.460
I wanna thank Ken Feinberg for his service

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.830
as Chairman of the John F.
Kennedy Library Foundation

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.180
these past 12 years.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.380
He also rendered outstanding
service to my administration

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.380
when we were dealing with
the BP oil spill, 9/11.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.540
He has rendered public service
again and again and again.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.720
We're very grateful for him.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.844
It is wonderful...

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:22.094
(audience applauding)

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.360
It is wonderful to see

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.470
Senators Markey and Senator Warren,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.990
my dear friend and former
governor, Deval Patrick,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.342
and his lovely wife Diane,

00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:37.020
(audience applauding)

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.423
governors and members of
Congress, Cardinal O'Malley,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.000
one of the finest secretary of states

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.960
ever to represent
America around the world,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.733
John Kerry, (audience
applauding) and Theresa,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.000
and the best vice president

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.331
this country's ever known, Mr. Joe Biden.

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:06.581
(audience applauding and cheering)

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:14.717
I also wanna thank Michelle Obama

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.470
for after the presidency

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.551
sticking with me.

00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:25.370
(audience laughing)

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.860
Because I think she felt an obligation

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.403
to the country to stay on.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.874
But once her official duties
were over, it wasn't clear.

00:02:36.874 --> 00:02:39.957
(audience laughing)

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.203
I love my wife.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.858
And I'm grateful for her.
(audience applauding)

00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:51.858
And I do believe that it was
America's great good fortune

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.179
to have her as First Lady.

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.512
(audience applauding and cheering)

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.220
So I am humbled by this
evening and to be honored

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.140
by a family that has given
this country so much,

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.480
a family that's challenged
us to ask what we can do

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.033
for our country, to dream and say why not,

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.860
to seek a cause that endures,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.633
and sail against the wind in its pursuit.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.540
That's what this family
has done for America.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.720
And to all the members
of the Kennedy family

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.370
that are here tonight, thank you.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.340
I could not be more grateful

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.620
to the Profile in Courage
Award Committee for this honor.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.750
I'm also grateful that, unlike
the Nobel Prize Committee,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.865
you waited until I was out of office.

00:03:45.865 --> 00:03:48.948
(audience laughing)

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.980
How fitting that we
gather here this month,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.960
the 100th anniversary of
President Kennedy's birth.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.900
I was born the year he took office,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.410
which makes me 55 years old.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.950
Had he lived to finish two terms,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.650
he would have been just 51.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.143
And he remarked on that possibility once.

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:19.267
"It has been suggested," he said,

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:22.963
"that whether I serve one or
two terms in the presidency,

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:26.097
"I will find myself at
the end of that period

00:04:26.097 --> 00:04:29.627
"at what might be called the awkward age,

00:04:29.627 --> 00:04:32.577
"too old to begin a career and too young

00:04:32.577 --> 00:04:34.057
"to write my memoirs."

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.460
Now, I hadn't seen this quote

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.286
when I wrote my first memoir at 33.

00:04:43.286 --> 00:04:46.670
(audience laughing)

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.457
I'm now in the middle of my second.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.200
Moreover, I expect to be busy
if not with a second career

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.043
then at least a second act.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.130
But it is true that I'm at the age,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.100
at that turn in the road,
where one looks back

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.100
as well as forward to remember
one, where one has been,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.963
so as better to chart where one is going.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.710
And one thing I'm certain

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.080
is that I was lucky to be born

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.533
into that New Frontier, a new world,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.893
and a new generation of Americans.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.180
My life in many ways would
not have been possible

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.080
without the vision

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.580
that John F. Kennedy etched

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.580
into the character and hearts of America.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.810
For those of us of a certain
age, the Kennedys symbolized

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.200
a set of values and
attitudes about civic life

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.683
that made it such an attractive calling.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.510
The idea that politics in fact could be

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.250
a noble and worthwhile pursuit.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.750
The notion that our
problems, while significant,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.463
are never insurmountable.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.160
The belief that America's
promise might embrace

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.750
those who had once been
locked out or left behind

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.820
and that opportunity and
dignity would no longer

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.303
be restricted to the few
but extended to the many.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.800
The responsibility that each
of us have to play a part

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.163
in our nation's destiny,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.403
and by virtue of being Americans,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.173
play a part in the destiny of the world.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.090
I can say truthfully that the example

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.130
of Jack and Bobby Kennedy
helped guide me into politics

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.800
and that the guidance of Teddy Kennedy

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.030
made me a better public servant

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.973
once I arrived in Washington.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.210
I have to imagine it would
give them great pride

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.290
to see a new generation
of Kennedys, like Joe,

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.643
carving their own proud
paths in public service.

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:17.536
(audience applauding)

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.550
For whatever reasons I receive this award,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.210
for whatever the scale, the
challenges that we overcame,

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.390
and the scope of progress
we made over my presidency,

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.530
it is worth pointing out that in many ways

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.910
the times that President
Kennedy confronted

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.793
were far more perilous than the
ones that we confront today.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.453
He entered the Oval Office at just 43,

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.550
only a few years after Khrushchev

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.683
had threatened to bury America.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.910
Wars raged around the world.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.620
Large swaths of the country knew poverty

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.430
far deeper and more widespread

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.323
than we see today.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.830
A young preacher's cause
was just gaining traction

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:11.393
across a land segregated not
only by custom but by law.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:18.410
And yet in that volatile
tinderbox of a time,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.853
President Kennedy led with a steady hand,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.750
diffusing the most perilous
moment of the Cold War

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.680
without firing a single
shot and forcing the rights

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.270
of young black men and women
to study at the university

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.123
of their choice.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.360
Unleashing a corps of young
volunteers as ambassadors

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.963
for peace in distant corners of the globe.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.020
Setting America's sights on the moon

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.980
precisely because it was
hard, unwilling to consider

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.140
the possibility that we
might not win the space race

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.960
because he had an unwavering
faith in the character

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.960
of the people that he led:
resilient, optimistic,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.503
innovative, and courageous.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.740
It's worth remembering this,

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.513
the times in which
President Kennedy led us,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.790
because for many Americans
I know that this feels

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.663
like an uncertain and even perilous time.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.130
The forces of globalization and technology

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.050
have upended many of our
established assumptions

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.273
about the economy.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.130
They've provided great opportunity,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.380
but also great inequality and uncertainty

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.173
for far too many.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.283
Our politics remains filled
with division and discord,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.860
and everywhere we see the risk
of falling into the refuge

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.200
of tribe and clan

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.400
and anger at those who don't look like us

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.400
or have the same surnames
or pray the way we do.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.473
And at such moments, courage is necessary.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.140
At such moments, we need
courage to stand up to hate

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.363
not just in others but in ourselves.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.650
At such moments, we need
the courage to stand up

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.990
to dogma not just in others

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.083
but in ourselves.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.610
At such moments, we
need courage to believe

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.110
that together we can tackle big challenges

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.333
like inequality and climate change.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.750
At such moments, it's necessary
for us to show courage

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.570
in challenging the status quo
and in fighting the good fight

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:49.420
but also show the courage
to listen to one another

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.420
and seek common ground and
embrace principled compromise.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.090
Courage, President Kennedy knew,

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.103
requires something more than
just the absence of fear.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.153
Any fool can be fearless.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.750
Courage, true courage,
derives from that sense

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.650
of who we are, what are our best selves,

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.283
what are our most important commitments,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.680
and to believe that we can dig deep

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.233
and do hard things for the
enduring benefit of others.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.653
And that's why JFK's first
inaugural still rings true.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.023
That's why Bobby's campaign
still means so much.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.740
That's why Teddy's cause endures

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.473
and we still love him so much.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.333
Because of the tragedies
that befell each of them,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.400
sometimes we forget how
fundamentally the story they told us

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.183
about ourselves changed
the trajectory of America.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.960
And that's often where courage begins,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.270
with the story we tell
ourselves about who we are

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.820
and what's important and
about our own capacity

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.913
to make a difference.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.630
We live in a time of great
cynicism about our institutions.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.270
That's one of the few things
that Democrats and Republicans

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.103
can agree on.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.830
It's a cynicism that's most corrosive

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.313
when it comes to our
system of self-government,

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.620
that clouds our history

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.260
of jagged, sometimes tentative

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.063
but ultimately forward progress,

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.440
that impedes our children's
ability to see in the noisy

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.520
and often too trivial pursuits of politics

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.163
the possibility of our
democracy doing big things.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.670
Of course, disdain for
elected officials is not new,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.273
as many of you in the
room can tell others.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.700
60 years ago President
Kennedy quoted a columnist

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.290
in Profiles in Courage who had written,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:18.950
people don't give a damn

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.810
what the average senator
or congressman says.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.140
The reason they don't
care is that they know

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.860
what you hear in Congress
is 99% tripe, ignorance,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.283
and demagoguery and not to be relied upon.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.733
Which is perhaps a little harsh.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.976
99% seems high.

00:13:38.976 --> 00:13:42.059
(audience laughing)

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:44.839
85?

00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:47.922
(audience laughing)

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.550
But President Kennedy also
wrote that the complication

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.370
of public business and the competition

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.480
for the public's attention
have obscured innumerable acts

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.290
of political courage, large and small,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.043
performed almost daily.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.030
Innumerable acts of political
courage large and small

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.813
performed almost daily.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.460
And that is true.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.110
I have seen it.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.010
I've witnessed it.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.660
I've been thinking on this
notion of political courage

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.820
this weekend, in particular
about some of the men and women

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.160
who were elected to Congress
the same year I was elected

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.110
to the White House.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.710
Many of them were new to Washington,

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.820
their entire careers ahead of them.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.980
And in that very first term,
they had to take tough vote

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.433
after tough vote because
we were in crisis.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.250
They took votes to save
the financial system

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.593
and the economy, even when
it was highly unpopular.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.150
They took votes to save the auto industry

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.213
when even in Michigan people
didn't wanna see bailouts.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.150
They took votes to crack
down on abuses on Wall Street

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:11.733
despite pressure from lobbyists
and sometimes their donors.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.840
And they found themselves in
the midst of a great debate,

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.653
a debate that had been
going on for decades,

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.800
a debate that the Kennedy family

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.313
had participated in and helped lead,

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.830
a debate about whether a nation

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.700
as wealthy as the United States of America

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.980
would finally make
healthcare not a privilege

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.573
but a right for all Americans.

00:15:40.442 --> 00:15:43.692
(audience applauding)

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:48.810
And there was a reason
why healthcare reform

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.673
had not been accomplished before.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.453
It was hard.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.900
It involved a sixth of the economy

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.473
and all manner of
stakeholders and interests.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:08.790
It was easily subject to
misinformation and fear mongering.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.820
And so by the time the vote came up

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.693
to pass the Affordable Care Act,

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.610
these freshmen congressmen and women

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.153
knew that they had to make a choice.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.710
That they had a chance to insure millions

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.710
and prevent untold worry and
suffering and bankruptcy,

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:36.640
and even death, but that this same vote

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.583
would likely cost them their new seats,

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.763
perhaps end their political careers.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.550
And these men and women
did the right thing.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.590
They did the hard thing.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.980
Theirs was a profile in courage.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.110
Because of that vote, 20 million
people got health insurance

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.410
who didn't have it before.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.240
And most of them,

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.407
(audience applauding)

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.033
and most of them did lose their seats,

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.780
but they were true to what
President Kennedy defined

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.603
in his book as a congressional
profile in courage.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.720
The desire to maintain a
reputation for integrity

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.023
that is stronger than the
desire to maintain office,

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.800
the desire to maintain a
reputation for integrity

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.253
that is stronger than a
desire to maintain office,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.260
a conscience, personal standard of ethics,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.260
integrity, morality that is
stronger than the pressures

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.973
of public disapproval
or party disapproval,

00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:00.030
a faith that the right course

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.513
would ultimately be vindicated,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.143
a faith that overcame
fear of public reprisal.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.833
It was a personal sacrifice.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.740
But I know, because I've
spoken to many of them,

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.693
that they thought and still
think it was worth it.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.200
As everyone here now
knows, this great debate

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.813
is not settled but continues.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:39.310
And it is my fervent hope
and the hope of millions

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.683
that regardless of party, such
courage is still possible,

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:52.060
that today's members of
Congress, regardless of party,

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.740
are willing to look at the
facts and speak the truth

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.320
even when it contradicts party positions.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.770
I hope that current
members of Congress recall

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.010
that it actually doesn't
take a lot of courage

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.833
to aid those who are already powerful,

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.683
already comfortable, already influential.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.720
But it does require some courage
to champion the vulnerable

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.053
and the sick and the infirm,

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.350
those who often have no access

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.693
to the corridors of power.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.690
I hope they understand that courage means

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.340
not simply doing what
is politically expedient

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:48.340
but doing what they believe
deep in their hearts is right.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:56.653
And this kind of courage
is required from all of us.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.330
Those of us who consider
ourselves progressives,

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.650
those of us who are Democrats,

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.070
we've got some soul-searching to do

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.270
to see what kind of coverage we show.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.773
We have our own dogmas.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.920
Those of us not in elected office

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.010
have to show some courage.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.480
And we're prone to bestow the
mantel of courage too easily

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.370
on the prominent and the
powerful and then too eager

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.900
to wrap ourselves in cynicism
when they let us down

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.273
because they weren't perfect.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.700
We lose sight sometimes
of our own obligations,

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.360
each of ours, all the
quiet acts of courage

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.350
that unfold around us every
single day, ordinary Americans

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.790
who give something of
themselves not for personal gain

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.593
but for the enduring benefit of another.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.410
The courage of a single
mom who's working two jobs

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.360
to make sure her kid can go to college.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.430
The courage of a small business
owner who's keeping folks

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.050
on the payroll because he
knows a family relies on it,

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.890
even if it's not always
the right thing to do

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:17.890
for his bottom line.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.680
The courage of somebody who
volunteers to help some kids

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.513
who need help.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.113
When we recognize these acts of courage,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.640
we then necessarily recognize
our own responsibility

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.570
as citizens and as part
of the human family

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.633
to get involved and to get
engaged and to take a stand,

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.363
to vote, to pay attention.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.550
I'm reminded of a story
that Teddy once told me

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.100
about his experiences many
years ago when Teddy, Jr.,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:58.100
now State Senator Ted Kennedy, Jr.,

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.180
was sleeping after one
of his cancer treatments.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.630
And Ted would wander the
halls of the hospital

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.030
and talk with other parents, keeping vigil

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.230
over their own children.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.510
These parents lived in constant
fear of what might happen

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.853
if they couldn't afford
the next treatment.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.400
Some calculating in their own minds

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.600
what they might have to sell
or borrow just to make it

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.260
for a few more months,
some bargaining with God

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.660
for whatever they could get.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.953
And right there in the quiet of night,

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.530
working people of modest means

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.390
and one of the most
powerful men in America

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.990
shared the same intimate

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.433
and immediate sense of helplessness.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.490
And Ted could, of course,
afford his son's treatment.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.340
But it was that quiet
dignified courage of others

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.740
to endure the most
frightening thing imaginable

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.230
and to do what it takes on
behalf of their loved ones

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.440
that compelled Teddy

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.473
to make those parents his cause,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.060
not out of self-interest

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.503
but out of a selfless
concern for those who suffer.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.240
That's what the ordinary
courage of everyday people

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.290
can inspire when you're paying attention,

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.750
the quiet sturdy courage
of ordinary people

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.170
doing the right thing day in and day out.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.450
They don't get attention for it.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.290
They don't seek it.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:32.570
They don't get awards for it.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.423
But that's what's defined America.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.230
I think of women like my grandmother

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.040
and so many like her
who worked their way up

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.600
from a secretarial pool to management

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.550
and in the process
pushed the glass ceiling

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.150
just a little bit higher.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.990
I think about people like Michelle's dad

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.210
who, despite MS, got up
every single morning.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.720
Had to wake up an hour
early to button his shirt up

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.130
and put on his clothes and
take those two canes he used

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.590
and go to work every
single day to make sure

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.880
that he was supporting his family,

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.593
not missing a dance recital
or a basketball game.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.420
I think of the troops and the
cops and the first responders

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.280
that I've met who've put
themselves at risk for strangers

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.543
they will never know.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.810
Business owners who make
every kind of sacrifice

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:29.340
they can to make sure that
their workers have a shot.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.460
Workers who take the risk
of starting a new career,

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.513
retraining at my age.

00:24:36.493 --> 00:24:38.980
(audience chuckles)

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.420
Kids in the Peace Corps
working to build bridges

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.790
of understanding in other nations

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.340
and to spread the same values

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.780
that helped bring down an Iron Curtain,

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.363
banish the scourge of apartheid,

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.043
expand the boundaries of human freedom.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.250
I think of Dreamers who suppress
their fears to keep working

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.610
and striving in the only country

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:05.860
they've ever called home.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.200
And every American who
stands up for immigrants

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.940
because they know that their parents

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.700
or grandparents or great
grandparents were immigrants too,

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.730
and they know that America is an idea

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.860
that only grows stronger
with each new person

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.993
who adopts our common creed.

00:25:28.048 --> 00:25:29.748
(audience applauding)
I think of,

00:25:35.551 --> 00:25:38.410
I think of every young activist
who answers the injustices

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.010
still embedded in our
criminal justice system

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.350
not with violence, not with despair,

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.700
but with peaceful protest and analysis

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.453
and constructive
recommendations for change.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.200
I think of the powerless
who crossed a bridge

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.593
in Selma and discovered they had power.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.300
Those who gathered at Stonewall

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.200
and discovered they had a voice.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.810
Those who marched on Washington
because they believed

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.403
that they, without an army,

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.910
without great wealth,

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.730
could somehow change the very fabric

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:21.240
of the greatest power on Earth and kept on

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.900
until they stretched the lofty ideals

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.313
of our founding to encircle everyone.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:34.290
Every citizen inspired by that history

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:39.880
who dips their toes in the
water of active democracy

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.810
for the first time and
musters up the determination

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:47.563
to try and fail and try again,

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.403
and sometimes fail again
and still try again,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.900
knowing their efforts aren't
always rewarded right away,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.180
because they believe in
that upward trajectory

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.953
of the American story,

00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:05.940
a story that nobody told better

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.903
than John F. Kennedy.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.350
That very Kennedy-esque idea

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.920
that America is not the
project of any one person

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.440
and that each of us can make a difference

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.373
and all of us ought to try.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.810
That quiet sturdy citizenship that I see

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.640
all across the country
and that I especially see

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.530
in young people like Jack and Rose

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:41.530
and Tatiana, Malia and Sasha,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.013
and your kids.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.610
I don't know whether President
Kennedy's aide and friend,

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.710
historian Arthur
Schlesinger, Jr., was right

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.640
when he wrote that
history unfolds in cycles,

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.133
but I do know that it doesn't
move in a straight line.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.080
I know that the values and
the progress that we cherish

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.963
are not inevitable, that they are fragile,

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.193
in need of constant renewal.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.400
I've said before that I
believe what Dr. King said,

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.157
that "the arc of the
moral universe is long

00:28:21.157 --> 00:28:23.460
"but it bends toward justice."

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.070
But I've also said it
does not bend on its own.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.913
It bends because we bend it,

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.070
because we put our hand on that arch,

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.920
and we move it in the direction of justice

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.970
and freedom and equality

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.930
and kindness and generosity.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.563
It doesn't happen on its own.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:51.870
And so we are constantly
having to make a choice

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.113
because progress is fragile.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:00.580
And it's precisely that
fragility, that impermanence,

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.330
that is a precondition of
the quality of character

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.443
that we celebrate tonight.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.410
If the vitality of our
democracy, if the gains

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.660
of our long journey to
freedom were assured,

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.710
none of us would ever
have to be courageous.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.630
None of us would've ever
have to risk anything

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:21.463
to protect them.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.170
But it's in its very precariousness

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:33.593
that courage becomes possible
and absolutely necessary.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.990
John F. Kennedy knew that our best hope

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.580
and our most powerful answer
to our doubts and to our fears

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.190
lies inside each of us, in our willingness

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.833
to joyfully embrace our
responsibility as citizens,

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.250
to stay true to our allegiance

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.323
to our highest and best ideals,

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.370
to maintain our regard and concern

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:05.370
for the poor and the aging
and the marginalized,

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.960
to put our personal or
party interests aside

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.650
when duty to our country calls

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.443
or when conscience demands.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.080
That's the spirit that
has brought America so far

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.700
and that's the spirit
that will always carry us

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.623
to better days.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.430
And I take this honor that
you have bestowed on me

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:38.430
here tonight as a reminder
that, even out of office,

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.820
I must do all that I can to
advance the spirit of service

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.073
that John F. Kennedy represents.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:47.670
Thank you all very much.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:48.639
May God bless you.

00:30:48.639 --> 00:30:49.670
(audience applauding)

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.890
May he bless these
United States of America.
