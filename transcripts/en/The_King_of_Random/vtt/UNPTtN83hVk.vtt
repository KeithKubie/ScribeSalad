In today's video,
we're making some rubber knuckles.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.740
Proto putty in a shape that looks
kind of like brass knuckles,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.600
but in reality, will act
more as a punch protector

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.702
than any sort of weapon.

00:00:08.702 --> 00:00:17.640
[Music]

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.700
A while back, Grant showed how
to take some foam core sheets

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.700
from the dollar store,
and cast them in brass

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.700
to make these functional brass knuckles.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.800
There's the spikeless version
and the spiked version.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.100
Frankly, there's very few situations
where you'd actually need these,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.000
and you really shouldn't ever use them
because that's a dangerous weapon.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.800
However today, what we're going
to be doing is looking

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.400
at how to create something
quite similar to this,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.200
but using soft Proto putty.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.600
You can wear them
on your hands.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.200
They can feel kind of
like brass knuckles,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.600
but in the end, they're going
to be more cushion than weapon.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.120
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.500
We've got a couple
of pieces of wood.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.900
We're going to cut the negative shape
out of one of them,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.600
glue it down to another board,
and use some Proto putty pressed into

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.792
the gap to make a rubber set of knuckles.

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:01.100
To start out, we printed off
these styrofoam knuckles template

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.220
that we used before,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.040
and we're going to be
cutting this shape out,

00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:08.742
tracing it onto a piece of wood,
and then cutting this out on a scroll saw.

00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:17.320
[Music]

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.100
We've got the basic
shape cut out.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.500
Let's use a little bit
of spray adhesive over the back,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.500
then stick it down to our board
so we can trace it.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.900
I cut this little divot out,
but that was an attachment

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.000
for one of the spikes,
and I don't think I'm going to use that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.900
So that's just going
to get trimmed off as well.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.280
[Music]

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.400
This is our basic shape.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.100
While we've got that down though,
let's cut out these circles,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.800
and also attach those onto the board
so we know where that's going to go to.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.000
The circles won't actually
have to be lined up perfectly.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.560
This whole piece is going
to get removed from the board,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.400
and we're just going to
have a hole that shape.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.100
That will get glued down
onto another board, and all

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.600
of the Proto putty will get pressed in.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.900
So we are going to have
to cut those circles out,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.000
but we can actually just cut those shapes
out of any part of the board,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.300
and then glue them in,
but we'll just trace them on

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.540
so we know where they go.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.400
We've got the shape,
and that's where we need

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.300
to cut out of the board.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.100
We've got some very intricate turn
around little loop spots,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.500
and that's why we're going
to be using a scroll saw.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.200
Scroll saws have
a very fine blade.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.700
They're really good
for tight little corners.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.100
We also want to cut just
out of this piece here,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.500
and we don't want to have
to cut a line into there.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.280
So we're going to start
by drilling a hole,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.380
and that's what we'll use
as sort of our access point.

00:02:26.382 --> 00:02:28.632
We'll then thread our saw blade
through that hole,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.620
attach it onto the saw,
and cut everything from there.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:03:06.120
[Music]

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.200
We've got our negative.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.400
This will get attached
to that board, and now,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.552
we need to cut these five pieces out,
and attach them in there as well.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:25.220
[Music]

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.580
Not bad, not bad.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.300
We've got our five pieces.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.840
And now, we need to glue
everything down in place.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.500
Before we do that though,
I am just going to take

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.640
a little bit of sandpaper,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.500
smooth out those edges in there,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.992
and just try to make them a little nicer.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.180
[Music]

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.300
Let's use some glue, attach these,
maybe add some clamps.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.400
Just hold it on place,
then we should have

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.980
our rubber knuckle mold.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:28.260
[Music]

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.900
I'm gonna try and
make two colors at once rather

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.300
than a single colored punch protector.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500
I'm going to try and
have sort of a marbled effect

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.180
by mixing two colors.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.300
I'm not going to mix them
some so thoroughly,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.700
it becomes one color again.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.100
I'm just going to try
and get two colors all swirled together.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:05:02.900
[Music]

00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:04.962
Use a ventilated area
for Proto putty.

00:05:04.992 --> 00:05:06.020
It gets intense.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:36.700
[Music]

00:05:36.712 --> 00:05:37.392
Random fact:

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.200
John L. Sullivan, the last ever
bare-knuckle boxing champion,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.462
once fought a 75 round fight
which lasted over two hours.

00:05:45.462 --> 00:06:04.700
[Music]

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.000
Well, I made
a little bit of extra.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.200
You can see I've got some
that didn't get used,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.000
but I got enough.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.400
Better to have too much
than too little,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.700
because patching more
on there would have been annoying.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.800
So now we just have to let this cure,
and I do have this extra piece

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.400
as a sample.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.100
So I'll know that
once this one's ready,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.082
that one should be ready.

00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:23.200
I think our Proto
putty has cured.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.202
Let's see if we
can pop this out.

00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:41.740
[Music]

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.000
We lost one of our finger holes, which,
I mean it'll be easy to attach back down.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.752
It just popped off.

00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:53.400
Probably could have made
it easier to get everything out

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.400
if I had angled everything.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.500
Like sanded it at more of an angle,
or something like that.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.500
But I want to be able
to use the same molds

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.300
for both the left and right hands,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.700
and so, I just had
to leave it straight up

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.080
and down, which makes it
so it does grip quite a bit.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:15.700
[Music]

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.380
There is our first one.

00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:21.492
It was a little tricky to get out,
but it did come out.

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:24.472
Fit our fingers
through the holes.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.392
That worked pretty great.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.600
It's actually does a pretty
good job of padding.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.880
I would not want to punch something
that hard without something on my hand,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.300
but it's just kind of bouncy.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.572
Let's make another one.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.780
[Music]

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.800
Our mold worked great.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.622
We've got two sets
of rubber knuckles,

00:07:46.622 --> 00:07:49.700
our Proto putty punch protecting knuckles.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.600
These are really not going
to do a darn thing

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.400
about making you punch harder.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.100
But what they are going to do
is kind of protect your fingers

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.500
if you are punching something.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.220
Now, I'm not a doctor.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.340
I'm not a boxer.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.380
I'm not an expert who
can tell you that like,

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.222
Oh , yeah. These are great for...

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.760
What they're good for is looking
like brass knuckles,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.100
but not having to worry about injuring
yourself or someone else as much.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.200
Not saying you should punch people
with the rubber knuckles on.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.160
You'll hurt them,
you might hurt yourself,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.400
but it's just kind of fun.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.280
They look cool.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.500
Anything cool you would like to see
us try making out of Proto putty,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.700
let us know down in the comments.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.412
We're always looking
for some good ideas.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.180
Guys, time for some
questions and answers.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.200
You asked the questions.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.520
We're giving you answers.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.700
Sir Spork @CaptainSpork3 asks,
how do we come up with ideas

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.000
for our videos?

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.700
Sir Spork, that's...

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.960
That's an interesting question.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.700
So when I joined the channel,
Grant had already been coming up

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.200
with ideas for years and years.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.400
He had seven years worth
of ideas just put onto a list,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.500
and when I applied to be his assistant
on the channel, I submitted my own list

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.700
of about 80 ideas,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.100
and it was really just sitting down,
and thinking of what are some things

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.000
that I think would be cool to build,
or some experiments that I think I

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.800
would like to try.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.780
I literally just sat down and thought,
what would be a good thing to build?

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.400
What would be a cool
experiment to try out?

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.400
And some of those, I tried,
and they didn't really work out.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.800
I've had some experiments where
I tried them, and there

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.800
was like no cool result whatsoever,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.800
and I was like, well that's really dumb,
and not exciting at all.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.500
But we do keep trying
to come up with things.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.120
We think what
would be fun to build?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.800
What would be fun
to experiment with?

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.260
What have we never
seen anyone else do?

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.900
Or what's a weird way
to use a material that

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.400
everyone's familiar with,
that we could present in

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.000
an entirely different direction.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.200
I think those ones are pretty fun
because there's all sorts of things

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.700
we interact with daily
that we don't think

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.800
of other uses for them as much,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.100
and that's one of my favorite ways
to come up with ideas is to take

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.232
something that we use regularly
and use it irregularly.

00:09:47.582 --> 00:09:49.082
Thank you, Sir Spork
for question.

00:09:50.052 --> 00:09:52.100
Guys, thanks for watching,
but the fun does not end here.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.962
That box up at the top
will transport you to our last video,

00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:56.000
and you should go check that one out.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.800
you should be watching next.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.700
And if you're not yet a subscriber,
just hit this bomb to get in the club,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.500
and that way, you'll never
miss out on the fun.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.800
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:06.400
Talk to you then.
