00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:13.789
So you just strained a muscle
and the inflammation is unbearable.

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.807
You wish you had something 
ice-cold to dull the pain,

00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:21.305
but to use an ice pack, you would have had
to put it in the freezer hours ago.

00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:23.420
Fortunately, there's another option.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.057
A cold pack can be left at room temperature
until the moment you need it,

00:00:28.057 --> 00:00:33.834
then just snap it as instructed
and within seconds you'll feel the chill.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.141
But how can something go from 
room temperature to near freezing

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:38.927
in such a short time?

00:00:38.927 --> 00:00:41.434
The answer lies in chemistry.

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:44.404
Your cold pack contains water
and a solid compound,

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:49.657
usually ammonium nitrate, in different
compartments separated by a barrier.

00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:52.588
When the barrier is broken,
the solid dissolves

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:55.644
causing what's known as an 
endothermic reaction,

00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:58.521
one that absorbs heat from its surroundings.

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:00.598
To understand how this works,

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:04.538
we need to look at the two driving forces
behind chemical processes:

00:01:04.538 --> 00:01:07.186
energetics and entropy.

00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:13.027
These determine whether a change occurs in
a system and how energy flows if it does.

00:01:13.027 --> 00:01:17.380
In chemistry, energetics deals with
the attractive and repulsive forces

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.317
between particles at the molecular level.

00:01:20.317 --> 00:01:26.184
This scale is so small that there are
more water molecules in a single glass

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:29.454
than there are known stars in the universe.

00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:31.527
And all of these trillions 
of molecules are

00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:36.181
constantly moving, vibrating 
and rotating at different rates.

00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.785
We can think of temperature as
a measurement of the average motion,

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:42.800
or kinetic energy, of all these particles,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.906
with an increase in movement
meaning an increase in temperature,

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.732
and vice versa.

00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:51.596
The flow of heat in any 
chemical transformation

00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:54.836
depends on the relative strength
of particle interactions

00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:57.910
in each of a substance's chemical states.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.761
When particles have a strong mutual
attractive force,

00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:03.843
they move rapidly towards one another,
until they get so close,

00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:07.614
that repulsive forces push them away.

00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:09.694
If the initial attraction was 
strong enough,

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:13.286
the particles will keep vibrating back
and forth in this way.

00:02:13.286 --> 00:02:16.384
The stronger the attraction,
the faster their movement,

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:18.764
and since heat is essentially motion,

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:22.463
when a substance changes to a state
in which these interactions are stronger,

00:02:22.463 --> 00:02:24.150
the system heats up.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.437
But our cold packs do the opposite,

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:29.209
which means that when 
the solid dissolves in the water,

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.336
the new interactions of solid particles 
and water molecules with each other

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:37.363
are weaker than the separate interactions
that existed before.

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:40.741
This makes both types of particles 
slow down on average,

00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:42.492
cooling the whole solution.

00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:47.051
But why would a substance change to a
state where the interactions were weaker?

00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:51.228
Wouldn't the stronger preexisting
interactions keep the solid from dissolving?

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:53.380
This is where entropy comes in.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.271
Entropy basically describes 
how objects and energy

00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:59.825
are distributed based on random motion.

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:03.535
If you think of the air in a room,
there are many different possible arrangements

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:05.902
for the trillions of particles 
that compose it.

00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:09.317
Some of these will have all 
the oxygen molecules in one area,

00:03:09.317 --> 00:03:11.898
and all the nitrogen molecules in another.

00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:14.513
But far more will have them 
mixed together,

00:03:14.513 --> 00:03:17.700
which is why air is always
found in this state.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.976
Now, if there are strong
attractive forces between particles,

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:24.209
the probability of some configurations
can change

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.290
even to the point where the odds
don't favor certain substances mixing.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.250
Oil and water not mixing is an example.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.196
But in the case of the ammonium nitrate,
or other substance in your cold pack,

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:38.619
the attractive forces are not 
strong enough to change the odds,

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.625
and random motion makes the particles
composing the solid separate

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:47.313
by dissolving into the water
and never returning to their solid state.

00:03:47.313 --> 00:03:50.895
To put it simply, your cold pack gets 
cold because random motion

00:03:50.895 --> 00:03:55.470
creates more configurations where 
the solid and water mix together

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.220
and all of these have even weaker
particle interaction,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.700
less overall particle movement,

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.193
and less heat than there was 
inside the unused pack.

00:04:05.193 --> 00:04:08.122
So while the disorder that can result
from entropy

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.513
may have caused your injury
in the first place,

00:04:10.513 --> 00:04:14.948
its also responsible for that
comforting cold that soothes your pain.
