Hi everyone. My name is Zillah Mupanda from
Zimbabwe. I'm a global change maker from the

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.169
British council initiative. My views on stating
the benefits for the world cup in Africa is

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.750
that because I'm a Zimbabwean. I think that
the benefits are temporary because the borders

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.180
have been open to Zimbabweans without further
notice really. So that means that Zimbabweans

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.210
are free to come into South Africa and work.
But the question is how long will that be

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.220
sustainable because the second world cup starts
and Zimbabweans will have to come back. And

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.320
obviously the situation still remains the
same at home. So the benefits although are

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.899
to a great extent right now, in the future
they are going to be non existent and Africa

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.940
will still be in a position of suffering.
For the moment I think that we've put ourselves

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.129
in a position as Africa to prove that we're
capable of hosting something this big. So

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.379
I actually am really proud of South Africa
and actually Africa as a whole for doing this.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.070
So I'm behind it full force. But just concerned
with the outcome of it. But yeah.
