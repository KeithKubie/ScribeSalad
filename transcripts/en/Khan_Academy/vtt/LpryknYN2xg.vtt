00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:02.177
- [Voiceover] All right, Part D.

00:00:02.177 --> 00:00:04.837
To investigate the claim
that exposure to light

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:08.581
overrides the genetically-controlled
circadian rhythm,

00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:10.873
the researchers plan to
repeat the experiment

00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:12.972
with mutant mice lacking a gene

00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:15.525
that controls the circadian rhythm.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.903
Predict the observed activity pattern

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:21.374
of the mutant mice
under L12:D12 conditions

00:00:21.374 --> 00:00:24.607
and under DD, continuous
darkness conditions,

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.494
that would support the
claim that light overrides

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.596
the genetically-controlled
circadian rhythm.

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:34.134
All right, so let me write
this down. So, Part D.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:37.222
So under some mutant mice,

00:00:37.222 --> 00:00:41.152
mutant mice,

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:43.587
under, so let me make two columns,

00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:46.872
mutant mice under L12,

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:50.152
L12:D12, and then

00:00:50.152 --> 00:00:55.054
under continuous, continuous
darkness, what would I expect?

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.870
What would I expect?

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.155
So they predict the
observed activity pattern.

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:01.183
So the mutant mice, they don't have,

00:01:01.183 --> 00:01:04.087
they have some, they're lacking genes

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:07.286
that control circadian
rhythm, but under L12:D12,

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:10.496
they don't need the
genetic circadian patterns,

00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:13.119
the genetically-influenced
ones, because they get the ones

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.663
from their environment,
the light and the darkness.

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:17.518
They didn't get, this isn't a gene

00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:20.157
that somehow makes them
not sensitive to light.

00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:23.510
So I would assume under the L12:D12,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.364
they would behave, they
would have activity pattern

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:30.982
similar to non-mutant mice, activity

00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:36.100
same as non-mutant,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.020
as non-mutant,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.927
mutant mice,

00:01:44.927 --> 00:01:49.890
non, or inactivity, inactivity

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.468
during L12,

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:59.442
activity, activity

00:02:00.612 --> 00:02:04.591
during D12.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.707
That's what I would expect.

00:02:05.707 --> 00:02:07.356
They still could react to the light

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:08.394
and the darkness the same way

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.119
that a non-mutant mice would.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.084
Now, what about continuous darkness?

00:02:12.084 --> 00:02:14.215
The non-mutant mice, we said that they,

00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:16.533
they went off of a 24-hour cycle,

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:18.994
but they still had a cycle
where they were inactive,

00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:23.350
active, inactive, active,
and it was less than 12 hours

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.367
for each cycle, but it was close to it.

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:28.149
It was maybe 9, 10, or
11 hours of activity,

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.354
followed by 9, 10, or
11 hours of inactivity.

00:02:31.354 --> 00:02:33.135
I would guess that a mutant mouse

00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:35.466
that has no, that doesn't have some

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.841
of these genes for circadian rhythm,

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:39.409
well, for them, it's just gonna be,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.486
it's just gonna be random,

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:43.090
it's just gonna be much more sporadic.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.353
So, much, much

00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:51.491
more sporadic,

00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:54.779
sporadic activity,

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:59.779
activity, fewer,

00:02:59.836 --> 00:03:03.370
fewer continuous,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.610
continuous,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.925
or I would say, maybe,
less continuous periods,

00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:12.036
or shorter continuous periods,

00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:16.289
shorter continuous

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:20.912
periods of activity

00:03:20.912 --> 00:03:22.896
and inactivity,

00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:25.165
activity slash

00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:29.016
inactivity.

00:03:29.016 --> 00:03:32.798
All right, now let's look at Part E now.

00:03:32.798 --> 00:03:35.652
So that was my predictions
that I would see

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:37.316
for mutant mice in either of these.

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:39.664
So now let's go to Part E.

00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:42.172
In nature, mice are potential prey

00:03:42.172 --> 00:03:46.109
for some predatory birds
that hunt during the day.

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.667
Describe two features of
a model that represents

00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:51.748
how the predator-prey relationship

00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:55.202
between the birds and the
mice may have resulted

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:56.705
in the evolution

00:03:56.705 --> 00:04:01.304
of the observed activity pattern of mice.

00:04:01.304 --> 00:04:06.304
Well, if the birds hunt during the day,

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:11.174
if birds hunt

00:04:11.174 --> 00:04:15.617
during day

00:04:15.617 --> 00:04:16.697
a mouse is more likely

00:04:16.697 --> 00:04:21.275
to be eaten by a bird if
it's active during the day.

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:25.052
Mouse, then,

00:04:25.052 --> 00:04:29.337
then the mouse

00:04:29.337 --> 00:04:34.277
is more likely

00:04:34.277 --> 00:04:38.536
to be eaten,

00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:42.510
eaten if it is

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.398
active during the day,

00:04:44.398 --> 00:04:47.036
if it is active

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:51.987
during the day.

00:04:53.548 --> 00:04:54.721
And if it is, I guess you could say

00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:57.440
that's one, that's one
feature of our model,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.761
that you're just more likely to be eaten

00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:02.009
if you're active when
the birds are hunting.

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.969
And then the second one
is, if you're more likely

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.268
to be eaten, then you're
less likely to reproduce.

00:05:08.268 --> 00:05:11.350
If, actually that should be capital I,

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.480
if, if the mouse

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.172
is more likely

00:05:22.172 --> 00:05:25.422
to be eaten

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:29.189
by being

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.540
active

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.755
during the day,

00:05:37.765 --> 00:05:40.727
then it is less likely to reproduce,

00:05:40.727 --> 00:05:44.628
then it is less

00:05:44.628 --> 00:05:46.728
likely

00:05:46.728 --> 00:05:49.393
to reproduce.

00:05:49.393 --> 00:05:53.091
And if I were, if I were
taking the AP test here,

00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:55.220
I would try to put as
much context as possible,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.435
because you're not exactly sure

00:05:56.435 --> 00:05:58.920
how they're, they're
going to mark this thing,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.544
to grade this thing, so
you could give more context

00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:04.646
that therefore, the mice

00:06:04.646 --> 00:06:06.852
that are active during,

00:06:06.852 --> 00:06:11.659
therefore, therefore,

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.110
mice that are

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.708
active

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:21.348
during night,

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:22.954
they have to be active sometime,

00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:27.075
active during night and inactive

00:06:28.185 --> 00:06:31.972
during day

00:06:31.972 --> 00:06:36.214
will be selected for, will

00:06:36.214 --> 00:06:40.520
be selected for,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.558
less likely to be eaten, less likely

00:06:45.558 --> 00:06:48.714
to be hunted,

00:06:48.714 --> 00:06:53.438
I guess you could say, and
more likely to reproduce,

00:06:53.438 --> 00:06:58.403
more likely to reproduce,

00:06:58.403 --> 00:07:02.535
reproduce, and we are done.
