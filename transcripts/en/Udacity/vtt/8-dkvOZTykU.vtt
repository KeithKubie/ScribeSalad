00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's look at the solution
to our page size quiz.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.747
Our physical memory's 2 GB.

00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:09.030
Our page size is 4 kB.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.140
How many page frames we have?

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.690
Well, a page frame is a place in
physical memory where a page might fit.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.190
So, the number of frames is simply 2 GB,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.120
the physical memory size,
divided by the page size.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.110
The frame is the same size as a page
because it's basically a place for

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.980
a page to be in.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.360
When we are doing things like this,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.120
usually it's a lot easier to think
about this as what power of two is it.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.992
So, 2 GB is 2 to the 31st bytes.

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:46.860
4 kB is 2 to the 12th bytes, so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.520
we end up with 2 to the 19th frames,
so the answer here is 2 to the 19th.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.020
How many entries do we
have in each page table?

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.210
We need one entry in a page table for
each page in the virtual memory.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.240
So the answer here is 4
GB divided by 4 kB, and

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.780
that is 2 to the 20th, or
one mega entry as they would say.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.600
Note that we need a separate
page table for each process.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.250
Each process is 4 GB of virtual memory.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.975
So each process in our system will
need a page table that is this large,

00:01:23.975 --> 00:01:28.510
2 to the 20th or
slightly more than one million entries.
