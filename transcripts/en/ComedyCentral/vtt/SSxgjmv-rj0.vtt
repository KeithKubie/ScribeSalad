00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.380
This whole hand is still numb.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.100
Okay, let us know
what naughty places

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.840
you've put your sticky fingers
in the comments.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.750
And cut. Good show, guys.
Ryan, you were off key.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.960
When I speak?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.660
Ahh, pitchy.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.450
Yes. I just got an audition

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.230
for a Shepland car
dealership commercial.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.590
Why are you auditioning for a
local car dealership commercial

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.440
when you're Comedy Central?
Digital?

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.510
No small parts.
Just small purple.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.210
That is wrong.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.700
Hmm, it's scripted but it says
they encourage improv.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.480
Okay. So I'm a car dealer
and I love slashing prices.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.200
Okay, best friends
listen to this:

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.020
"We take high prices
and gut them like fish."

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.970
Maybe something more
family friendly.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.670
Right. Kids don't like fish.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.520
"We gut prices
like little baby bunnies."

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.780
No!

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.560
I feel like this
isn't constructive.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.760
All right, this is ridiculous.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.160
Where's Natasha, she's not
responding to my emails.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.580
She's been off
running her audition all day.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.900
She's obsessed.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.320
Yeah, I don't usually like think
about other people

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.070
but I'm worried she's way
too into this role.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.690
What do you mean?

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.370
Oh, hello.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.470
Might you be looking to buy
a car at a low, low price.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.560
I sure hope so
because at Shepland

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.870
we make prices bleed out.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.100
Natasha, I think maybe
you've been improvising

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.560
a little bit too long,
all right,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.130
so why don't you put
the knife down, okay.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.350
Oh, this thing.
Yeah.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.640
Put it down?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.040
Yeah.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.480
Dudes, you gotta check out
the Street Fair outside.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.860
Jordan, it's not the best time.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.820
Peep these bomb ass shades.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.920
Haaaa! Ahhh! What the ...?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.740
Ha ha ha, you think
you're so cool, Mr. Dollar Sign.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.540
Is that a knife? I can't see.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.880
You know what I do
to prices like you?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.550
She's way too deep
into character.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.910
I'm gonna slice up the belly
of this unreasonable price

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.880
and let all the coins spill
out of his money tummy.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.880
She can't slice me,
my face is my money maker.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.880
Is that why you as poor
as you are ugly?

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.700
That's funny.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.760
Sick burn, dude,
but it is not the time.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.960
Wait, if Jordan dies
we have to do his work.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.480
Ahh!
It's okay.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.720
It's okay.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.400
Mrs. Price Slasher,
I know you're mad.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.600
Very mad.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.290
Some things in this world
aren't fair,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.310
like when you get charged
for things you shouldn't.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.790
Like when you have to pay
extra for guac.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.490
Or having to pay
for PornHub Premium.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.130
Or having to tip.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.940
Ew.
Come on.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.480
It's not a thing in Europe.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.000
Okay, but even if you
slash this one price,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.750
what about the other millions
of high prices out there?

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.040
I don't know. I ...

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.180
Mrs. Price Slasher,
you have a family.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.250
She does?
I do.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.860
A knife daughter
and two shiv sons.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.560
Think about them, they need you.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.390
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.020
And scene. That was great.
Wish me luck.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.560
What the ... was that?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.359
That means she was acting.
She good.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.350
So come on down to Shepland
Car Dealership

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.740
where we make prices bleed out.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.600
Okay. Maybe the next one
is closer to the script.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.609
I feel like that's compromising
my vision.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.320
And I won't do that
in front of my children.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.120
Momma loves you.
