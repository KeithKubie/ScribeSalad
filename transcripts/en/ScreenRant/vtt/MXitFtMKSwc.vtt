00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.530
No writer can predict the future, but in today’s
world, it’s almost impossible to tell a

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.550
story without injecting pop culture references
somewhere.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.253
They aren’t always used properly, but sometimes,
an inside joke or throwaway line from a writer,

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:22.340
director or actor can wind up being more relevant
or prophetic than anyone could have ever known.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.470
Are these crazy coincidences or actual planned
events?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.480
Let us know what you think in the comments
below!

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.180
Here are Screenrant’s Movies That Actually
Predicted Other Films.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.190
Tuff Turf

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.820
To find a new villain to tear Marvel’s Avengers
apart, director Joss Whedon turned to the

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.510
super-intelligent robot Ultron – a creation
brought to life by actor James Spader.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.789
His early leading roles as a handsome bad
boy were far from Ultron, but in 1985’s

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.390
Tuff Turf, a bit of graffiti offered a strange
hint of what lay ahead in the actor’s future.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.880
“The New Avengers” tag was obviously a
play on the Marvel comic series, but Spader’s

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.280
character didn’t have time to look it over,
since he was mugged soon after.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.020
But who showed up to patch his wounds?

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.770
That’s right, Robert Downey, Jr., sharing
the scene with Spader a full thirty years

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.750
before they’d do battle as Iron Man and
Ultron.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.580
Following

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.820
Christopher Nolan made himself one of Hollywood’s
most respected directors in record time, but

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.510
even geniuses need to start somewhere.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.480
For Nolan, that was Following, a story about
a young man who spies on a well-dressed burglar

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.780
until he’s swept into a life of crime himself.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.610
The low-budget movie gave plenty of hints
at Nolan’s future style, with a time-jumping

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.340
structure, and a well-dressed man named Cobb
– the same name as Leonardo DiCaprio’s

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.340
character in Inception.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.750
But the tiniest detail is the most shocking:
one apartment broken into by the characters

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.350
is marked not with a number, but the Batman
symbol.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.590
The director could never have guessed that
seven years later he’d be on his way to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.560
making a nearly two billion-dollar Batman
trilogy, changing comic book movies forever

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.610
and even giving his Following lead actor a
cameo in Batman Begins as a water board technician.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.510
Halloween

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.210
In the world of horror movies, there’s no
understating just how much John Carpenter’s

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.360
Halloween changed the game.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.480
Following the masked killer Michael Myers
as he went on a Halloween killing spree would

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.900
go on to become one of the greatest horror
movies of all time – but the film also included

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.519
a hint that Carpenter would be known for more
than one masterpiece.

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.499
Throughout the movie, the kids are shown watching
the 1951 movie “The Thing From Another World,”

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:28.209
a story of an alien stranded in the Arctic,
and the men who find it.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.519
The title card alone should tip off horror
fans to this strange coincidence, since it’s

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.500
the same movie Carpenter would be hired to
remake just four years later in 1982.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.239
And just like the classic slasher flick, “The
Thing’s place in horror history is beyond

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.280
guaranteed.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.359
The Terminal

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.650
The story of a stranded airline passenger
making his home in an airport terminal was

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.769
inspired by a real event, but may end up being
better remembered for predicting the future.

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.620
Among the employees befriended by Tom Hank’s
characters is an immigration officer played

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.540
by a young Zoe Saldana.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:10.239
When Hanks questions her for a friend admiring
her from a distance, she lets a secret slip.

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.629
Yeoman Rand may be her cosplay of choice,
but just five years later, the Star Trek-lover

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.010
would be cast as Lieutenant Uhura in J.J.
Abrams’ big screen reboot.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.920
It’s a good things she’s a fan of Vulcans,
since her romance with Spock ended up playing

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.670
a major role in the series.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.670
Braindead

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.859
Long before Peter Jackson was directing the
Lord of the Rings movies, he was still finding

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.019
ways to inject big ideas into small-scale
productions.

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.349
In the case of Braindead, the story of an
exotic rat-monkey whose bite turns people

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.040
into zombies, Jackson opened the film with
a throwback to the classic King Kong.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.870
Instead of a colossal ape, it was a tiny creature
he was stealing from the enraging natives,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.779
but the reference was clear.

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:52.379
Luckily for the director, he would get the
chance to repeat the homage with a much, much

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.709
bigger budget.

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.360
The 2005 remake of King Kong may be a more
impressive sight to behold, but getting to

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.310
reference a classic film, then being entrusted
with remaking it is any director’s dream

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.930
come true.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.930
The Godfather

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.590
It’s the job of Hollywood production designers
and set dressers to make a modern street look

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.019
like it’s been sent back decades in time.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.700
Usually, their job is done if you don’t
notice it at all – but sometimes, they’re

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.299
just as likely to make an incredible prediction.

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.500
When Vito Corleone goes to shop for some oranges
just before being wounded in Martin Scorsese’s

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.360
Godfather, a poster promoting an upcoming
boxing match is prominently featured in frame.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.810
Once movie fans realize it’s advertising
a fight of Jake LaMotta, things get interesting.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.610
Robert De Niro would win his first Oscar for
playing the younger version of Corleone in

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.720
The Godfather Part 2 two years later – and
his second for portraying LaMotta in Raging

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.319
Bull four years after that.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.270
So even though De Niro auditioned for The
Godfather and was cut loose, his two greatest

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.430
roles sharing the screen has to make up for
the loss.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.580
Raising Arizona

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.370
Long before Nicolas Cage and the Coen Brothers
were household names, they joined forces to

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.591
deliver Raising Arizona, one seriously underrated,
screwball comedy following Cage’s character

00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:07.120
from a career stick-up man to a loving husband
and hopeful father.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.960
Part of his going straight means finding a
job at Hudsucker Industries, according to

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.060
the name stenciled on his uniform.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.060
Fans of the Coen Brothers will recognize the
name from the directors’ other film, The

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.130
Hudsucker Proxy, set at the same company.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.620
But Raising Arizona came first by a full seven
years.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.400
The brothers had developed the Hudsucker script
with director Sam Raimi years before making

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.639
either film, and decided to plant an easter
egg ahead of time – one that will continue

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.190
to confuse new fans for years to come.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.560
Forgetting Sarah Marshall

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.310
Jason Segel proved his leading man comedy
chops by showing that musicians don’t even

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.909
get dumped like the rest of us, turning to
a piano to cry out his heart when the girl

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.069
the movie’s named for breaks his heart.

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.770
But this is a comedy, which means one song
he uses to pour out his grief took audiences

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.740
by surprise.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:00.240
But he didn’t need to cry for long – just
three years after weeping through The Muppets’

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.631
theme song, Segel would be co-writing and
starring in the group’s return to the big

00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:06.040
screen in The Muppets Movie.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.600
Sarah never knew what she was missing.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.979
So what is your take on all of this?

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.430
Coincidences or totally planned occurrences?
