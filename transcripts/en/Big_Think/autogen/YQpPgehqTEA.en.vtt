well there's two gaps there one is a gap

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870
well there's two gaps there one is a gap
 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.440
well there's two gaps there one is a gap
between ability to diagnose and cure and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450
between ability to diagnose and cure and
 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.730
between ability to diagnose and cure and
there's other cases where we have the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
there's other cases where we have the
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.039
there's other cases where we have the
ability to cure but not diagnose the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
ability to cure but not diagnose the
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.109

small set of people who will react very

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
small set of people who will react very
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.750
small set of people who will react very
negatively both of these I think are

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
negatively both of these I think are
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.349
negatively both of these I think are
going to see major progress there have

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
going to see major progress there have
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.689
going to see major progress there have
already seen some major progress but for

responses this is a personal decision if
you see some if you get diagnosed firs

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
you see some if you get diagnosed firs
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.970
you see some if you get diagnosed firs
if you are offered the ability to get

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
if you are offered the ability to get
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.410

know that other people will say I want
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.690

to know that but I'm not do anything
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.200
to know that but I'm not do anything
about it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
about it
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510
about it
and the third set say oh we're gonna

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
and the third set say oh we're gonna
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.900
and the third set say oh we're gonna
we're gonna embrace this we're going to

we're gonna embrace this we're going to
 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.760
we're gonna embrace this we're going to
become experts on this disease even even

there are many cases of this where

there are many cases of this where
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179
there are many cases of this where
people will become the poster their

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
people will become the poster their
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.830
people will become the poster their
family will become poster children for

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
family will become poster children for
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.770

and Betty Ford for cancer and substance

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009

abuse and so forth

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
abuse and so forth
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700
abuse and so forth
and so I think that's a really a big

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
and so I think that's a really a big
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.219
and so I think that's a really a big
opportunity is to take ownership of all

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
opportunity is to take ownership of all
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.780
opportunity is to take ownership of all
the things that are special about your

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
the things that are special about your
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.690
the things that are special about your
family both positive and negative and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700
family both positive and negative and
 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.920
family both positive and negative and
link up with other families that have

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
link up with other families that have
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.920
link up with other families that have
the same alleles the same changes in

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
the same alleles the same changes in
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.539
the same alleles the same changes in
their DNA same variations to make them

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549
their DNA same variations to make them
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.550
their DNA same variations to make them
different from the average and see how

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
different from the average and see how
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.690
different from the average and see how
it plays out differently in different

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
it plays out differently in different
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090
it plays out differently in different
families you know maybe that some of

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
families you know maybe that some of
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.160
families you know maybe that some of
them have much more severe traits than

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
them have much more severe traits than
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.690
them have much more severe traits than
others and you can find by sharing that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
others and you can find by sharing that
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580
others and you can find by sharing that
information you can see what lifestyle

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
information you can see what lifestyle
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.859
information you can see what lifestyle
changes might be correlated with a less

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
changes might be correlated with a less
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.899
changes might be correlated with a less
severe outcome so I think that embracing

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909
severe outcome so I think that embracing
 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.670
severe outcome so I think that embracing
things that don't have cures whether

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
things that don't have cures whether
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.880
things that don't have cures whether
they're severe or not is an opportunity

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
they're severe or not is an opportunity
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.480
they're severe or not is an opportunity
that we'll see more

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490
 
 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.290
 
could certainly in that I would say in

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300
could certainly in that I would say in
 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.550
could certainly in that I would say in
the short term but since these are

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560
the short term but since these are
 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.410
the short term but since these are
exponential technologies it's actually a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420
exponential technologies it's actually a
 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.170
exponential technologies it's actually a
very long time and say an internet time

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
very long time and say an internet time
 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.920
very long time and say an internet time
okay

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
okay
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.240
okay
is that we will I think that most people

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250
is that we will I think that most people
 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.860
is that we will I think that most people
will get access to their genetic

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870
will get access to their genetic
 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.900
will get access to their genetic
information a lot of people will want it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910
information a lot of people will want it
 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.220
information a lot of people will want it
and they will get it this will be a

it'll probably be affordable this year
so that's not you know that's not very

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550
so that's not you know that's not very
 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.510
so that's not you know that's not very
long even an internet time but then to

in ancient days because you know
