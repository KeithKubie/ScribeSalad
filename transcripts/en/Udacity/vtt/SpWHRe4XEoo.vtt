00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
And the answers here are that the shortest path from A to B has length 10,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.950
so, for example here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.890
and the number of shortest paths from A to B is still 2.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.250
If you start on A, and once you've made the decision to go up here,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.250
the only way to continue the shortest path is like this,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.520
because otherwise he would be visiting a city more than once,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.910
and then the path gets longer than 10 edges.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.600
If, on the other hand, you start out by going down,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.190
then there is no other way to go along the shortest path than this here.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.560
So again there's 2 diffferent possibilities of going from A to B

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.250
along the shortest path that visits all vertices,

00:00:40.250 --> 99:59:59.000
and the length of that shortest path is 10.
