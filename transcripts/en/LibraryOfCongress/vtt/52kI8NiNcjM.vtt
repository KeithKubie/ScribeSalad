00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:24.490
[ Pause ]

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.810
&gt;&gt; Peg Clifton: I would like to
introduce to you Mr. Kirk Rascoe,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.990
the Director of the Office
of Opportunity, Inclusiveness

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.510
and Compliance here at the library
who will introduce our speaker.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.650
[ Noises ]

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.690
&gt;&gt; Kirk Rascoe: Thank you, Peg
Clifton [laughter] for this --

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.480
for the honor of having
to appear up here today.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.990
The Library of Congress is
unique in the federal service.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.750 position:56%
It is the largest library in the
world, the research arm of Congress,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.550
an exhibition center, an
international tourist destination,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.450 position:56%
a national cultural center and more.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.120
As such, the diversity of American
society should be represented

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.050
at the Library in all of
its programs and activities.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.450
The American people, members of
Congress, donors to the library,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.330
scholars and dignitaries,
guests and visitors all expect

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.620
to experience the diversity
of the nation when they seek

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.190
to access the services and
programs of the library.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.130
The Office of Opportunity,
Inclusiveness

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
and Compliance assists the
library fulfill its obligation

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.910
by exploring new avenues on which
to broaden the scope of services

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.440
and programs and to more fully
reflect the American experience

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.200
and all of its aspects.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.210
In keeping with that mission,
we are responsible for assisting

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.160
with implementation of the
Americans with Disabilities Act.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.670
The American with Disabilities
Amendment Act, ADAA --

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:24.140
there's the ADA and the ADAA -- and
Library Congress Regulation 2025-8.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.720
Our advice covers the full spectrum
of obvious and hidden disabilities

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.280 position:56%
in the following categories, death,
hard of hearing, blind, blind death,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.030
low vision, dexterity, mobility,
medical and cognitive disabilities.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.790
We also collaborate with the
assistive technology demonstration

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.310
center, a facility dedicated to
the evaluation and assessment

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.780
of assistive technology, some of
which you will learn about today

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.720
from today's speaker,
Dr. Michael Chorost.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.150 position:56%
Dr. Chorost is a technology theorist
with an unusual perspective.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.390
His body is the future.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.620
In 2001, he went completely deaf
and had a computer implanted

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.000
in his head to let him hear again.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.530
This transformative experience
inspired his first book entitled

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.240
"Rebuilt: How Becoming Part
Computer Made Me More Human."

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.840
I guess it's like Frankenstein
in reverse [laughter].

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.190
He wrote about how mastering his
new ear, or cochlear implant,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.860
enabled him to enhance his
greater potential as a human being.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:53.670 position:56%
In 2006, "Rebuilt" won the PEN USA
Book Award for Creative Non-Fiction.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.110
Born in New Jersey, Dr. Chorost
earned his B.A. at Brown University

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.000
where he studied computer
programming, Renaissance drama

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.080
and cultural theory
on the way to his PhD

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.090
at the University of
Texas at Austin.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.140 position:56%
After graduate school, he worked
briefly at a dotcom in San Francisco

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.810
and then spent four and a half
years doing research in education

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.800
at SRI International in
Menlo Park, California.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.120
His second book entitled "World
Wide Mind: The Coming Integration

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.860
of Humanity, Machines and
the Internet" proposes

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.710
that humanity can incorporate the
computer into its collective soul

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.010
in a way that enhances communities

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.090
and creative work instead
of diminishing them.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.690
As a freelance science writer,
he has written for "Wired",

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.700
"The Washington Post",
"Technology Review",

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.420
and "The Scientist", among others.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.600
He wrote the screenplay
for a television special

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.140
on brain implants entitled
"The 22nd Century",

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.390
which aired on PBS
in January of 2007.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.370
He sits on external advisory
boards for neuroscience research

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.380
at Northwestern and Brown.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.130
He now resides in Washington, D.C.
with his wife and their two cats.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Michael Chorost.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.010
[ Applause ]

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:41.750
[ Noises ]

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: Thank you
very much for the introduction,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.640
and I'm very grateful to
the Library of Congress

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.530
for inviting me here today.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.350
So before I go on,
let's do a sound check.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.410
I want to make sure everyone
can understand me all right.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.280
Are you hearing me okay in back?

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.190
Okay. Very good.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.760
Okay. If [inaudible] not, please
raise your hand and let me know,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.520
because as a deaf person

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.350
with cochlear implants I have
a volume control on my ears,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.980 position:56%
so I am never quite sure of how loud
anything really is, so I always rely

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.980
on [inaudible] to let me
know if I can be heard.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.090
So my talk today is called
"How to Put Your Brain

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.660
on the Internet: Lessons
from a Cyborg."

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.570
So this is the webcast on
YouTube, you can see directions,

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:37.050
and also I have a Twitter feed at
mikechorost, and if you want to put

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.920
out some tweets about
it, I'd be grateful.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.980
So there's a hashtag chorostloc.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.450
So my talk is going to start
with the lesson from the Cyborg,

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.000
grounded in my experience
as a cochlear implant user

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.820
and then it's going to talk
about how to put your brain

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.620
on the Internet, and
would you want to.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.500 position:56%
So let's talk about what brings me
here -- what brings me to this place

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.130
and talking about these
things, and the answer is

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.490
that I went abruptly deaf in 2001.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.440
The story is that I was born with
severe to profound hearing losses.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.080
I was not diagnosed until I
was about three and a half.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.970
It was at that point
that I got hearing aids

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.880
and I began to learn English.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.910
So I wore hearing aids
until I was 36 years old,

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.740
at which point I had dropped and
lost all of the remaining hearing

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.180
in my good ear, which
was my left ear.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.570
So at that point I was too deaf to
get any benefit from hearing aids.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.710
Nobody knows why that
happened, by the way.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.910
The reason I was born deaf was
because my mother had rubella

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.860
when she was pregnant with me.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.320
But why I went abruptly
deaf in one day

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.330
on July 7th, 2001 is still unknown.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.810
Anyway, while the cause was
unknown, the treatment was not.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.690
So I got a cochlear
implant in October 2001,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.950
and at that point I immediately
started writing a book

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.960
because I'm a writer by nature.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.360
I like to write about the
things that I go through.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.910
So that experience resulted in
the publication of my first book,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.230
"Rebuilt: How Becoming Part
Computer Made Me More Human",

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.140
and you can see the
hard cover edition there

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.450 position:56%
and that's my own skull on the cover

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.730
and you can see the
implant in my skull.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.160
So I'd like to think I'm the
only author in publishing history

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.760
with a picture of his head
on the outside and the inside

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.300
of the book jacket [laughter].

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.580
The book came out in paperback, and
so there's the paperback "Rebuilt:

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.970
My Journey Back to the Hearing
World," different subtitle,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.360
the book is exactly the same
except that I fixed one typo.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.720
And then a few years later I
published "World Wide Mind:

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.610
The Coming Integration of Humanity,
Machines and the Internet."

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.830
I was always fascinated by
technology and computers.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.270
I did a lot of programming,
so when I ended

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.490
up getting a computer
inside my head,

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.510 position:56%
I just ran with that opportunity
and starting writing books about it.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:23.040
So let me walk you through
cochlear implant 101

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.830
so that you understand the kind
of technology that's in my head.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.620
So let's start by pretending
that this is a normal ear,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.110
without all this interesting
circuitry unit.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:39.710
In a normal ear, sound will
come in through the ear canal,

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.910
hit the ear drum, which
makes these bones vibrate.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.060
That vibration is transmitted
through the cochlea,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.620
which is a hollowed tube filled
with liquid and tiny cells

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.300
that resonate in response to sound.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.240
As those hear cells resonate,
these send sound signals

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.640 position:56%
down the hearing nerve to the brain.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.700
The reason that most
people are deaf is

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.530
that they lose those tiny
hair cells inside the cochlea.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.830
It's like stripping the
keys off of a piano.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.650
The strings are still there.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.720
The piano can still create sound,
except that there's no keys

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.490
to trigger those strings.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:27.030
Similarly, in my case, the
auditory nerve is intact,

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.890
it's just that there are no tiny
hairs left inside my cochlea

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:36.410
to vibrate in response to
sound, that's why I'm deaf.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:41.690
So what a cochlear implant does is
it replaces that mechanical system

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.720
with an electronic system.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.160
So let me walk you
through how that works.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.140
Let's start with the outside.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.540
So on the outside you can see
this thing called a "headpiece".

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.420
Now, that corresponds to this disc

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.060
that you see here,
specifically this thing.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.590
Now, that headpiece, as you can
see, it actually sticks to my head.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.670
Okay. Stupid implant
tricks [laughter].

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:16.520
That's because there's a magnet in
the headpiece that makes it stick

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.010
to a magnet inside
the implant itself,

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.400
so that explains why the
headpiece sticks there.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.610
But, what is the headpiece?

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.580
Well, the headpiece
is taking a radio --

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.960
or rather it's taking an electronic
signal from the thing on my ear,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.330 position:56%
which is a string of ones and zeros.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.940
It's digitized sound.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:43.260
And it is sending that string of
ones and zeros through my skin

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:49.080
to the implant which is embedded
in my skull underneath the skin.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.110
It's not inside my skull.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.400
It's a not a brain implant.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.090
It's on top of the skull,

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.590
countersunk into the
surface of the skull.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.910
And I'll show you a wonderfully
gory picture of that in a moment.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.940
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the warning.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.850
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: Sorry, did
I hear somebody ask a question?

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.780
Yes?

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.750
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible], said
thanks for the warning.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: Okay.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.370
So the implant picks up the radio
signal and its job is to send

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.880
that signal down this wire
which terminates in a string

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.600
of electrodes inside the cochlea.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.790
In this close-up, you can see that
string of electrodes [inaudible]

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:32.730
up inside the cochlea and here
are the little electrode plates.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.650
Those are tiny electrodes
made of platinum and iridium,

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:41.660
and those electrodes are strobed
on and off in complex patterns

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.510
to activate the nerves inside
the center of the cochlea,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.130
so this is the beginning of that.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.740
So as these things trigger on
and off sending little shocks,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.180
they force the nerves inside
the center of the cochlea

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.560
to send sound information down
the auditory nerve to the brain.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.840
So that's what a cochlear
implant does.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.500
It replaces the mechanical
system of the inner ear

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.470
with an electronic system
that sends digital information

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.270
into the auditory cortex
of the brain.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.550
Amazing technology.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.070
So that's cochlear implant 101.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.030
Now, let me show you a
real cochlear implant.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.420
And this is a slide
that I love to show just

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.890
after lunch hour [laughter].

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.860
So you can see here, this
is a cochlear implant.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.880
It's not my cochlear
implant, by the way;

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.390
it's somebody else's
cochlear implant.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:46.770 position:56%
It has just been installed in the
surface of the skull and you can see

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.540
that the skin is still retracted,

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.740
so the surgeon has
not yet closed it up.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.640
But you can see that the surgeon
has countersunk it into the skull

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.670
so that the surface is almost
flush with the top of the skull.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.720
You can also see that he has
tied it down with metal sutures

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.050
so that it doesn't go anywhere.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.490
And if you look closely, you can
also see that there's a little bit

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.800 position:56%
of brand information on the implant.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.330
It says "Advanced Bionics,
[inaudible] Platinum II, Model,"

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.650
such and such, "This
side out [laughter]."

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:28.630
I just love the fact that I have
a part of my body and labeled

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.830
"This side out [laughter]."

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.670
And if you think about it for a
minute, the reason is obvious.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.120
If [inaudible] one side out, the
magnet will be facing the wrong way

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.080
and the headpiece would fly off
of my head instead of sticking.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.210
So the two magnets have to
stick to each other to make

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.630
that radio signal go through.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.910
And you can see here the
beginning of the electrode array,

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.370
which is going down through a
tunnel that the surgeon has drilled

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.790
through the bone down
to the inner ear.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.510
That drilling goes in
about an inch and a half.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.940
The electrode array -- if you
take an x-ray of my skull,

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.140
the electrode array is right
behind the pupil of my iris.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.750
Okay? So if you look in my
eye you can see how deep

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.370
that electrode array
is going into my head.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.140
So it's quite a remarkable surgery.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.170
By the way, it goes very fast.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.810
My first implant was installed
in about an hour and a half,

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.350
the second one in about 41 minutes.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.970
I went in the morning, went home
the afternoon and newly wired up.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.820
You know, if you could open up
that casing and look inside,

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.890
this is what you would see.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:43.590
You would see a bunch of
chips, a bunch of resistors

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.120
and all sorts of little wires.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.900 position:56%
So when I first went deaf, I went to
an audiologist and she showed me one

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.190
of these things and I felt it
in my hand and stared at it

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.100
and I thought, "Oh my God.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.110
They're really going to
put this thing inside me.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.940
What's that going to be like?

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.090
How will this mask of silicon

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:11.400
and resistors actually
replace a part of my body?"

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.110
So I'll tell you a
little bit about that.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:18.320
So very briefly, this is
how the software works.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.240
So I showed you before that
the electrode array is curled

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.320
up inside the cochlea.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.270
It's got 16 electrodes.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:31.850
The electrodes that are all
the way at the basal end here,

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:36.290
when those electrodes flash on
and off, they stimulate nerves,

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.350
they're used to code in
high frequency sounds.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.730
When the electrodes all the way the
tip of the array flash on and off,

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:49.770 position:56%
these stimulate nerves that are used
to getting low frequency sounds,

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.750
so the software breaks
up sound by frequency.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.740
It takes all the high pitches
and sends them down here.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.610
It takes all the low pitches
and it sends them down there.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.440
So it takes sound apart kind of the
way a coin sorter would take coins

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.440
and sort them by the
size of the coin,

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.260
and it will send the
appropriate frequencies

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.730
to the appropriate
part of the cochlea.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.400
So you may wonder, how many
people have this technology.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.130
Is it new?

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.640
Is it experimental?

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.010
The answer is, no, it's not.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.550
It's been around the 1990s.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:29.070
And there's about 219,000
people with implants worldwide

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:34.990
since the technology became
commercial in the very late 1980s.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.770
So you may wonder, is
that a lot or a little?

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.310
Well, to give you a
little bit of perspective,

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:46.270
in the United States alone
there are about 500,000 people

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.860
who have hearing losses severe
enough to make them candidates

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:55.350
to get a cochlear implant; half
a million in this country alone,

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.180
and yet worldwide there's
less than a quarter

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.900
of a million implant users.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.730
So what that tells you is that
this technology is still very much

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.910
underused, that there are
many people who could benefit

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.950
from this technology
who don't have it.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.380
And there are many reasons
for that, economic reasons,

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.880
reasons of knowledge, reasons of
what doctors believe and so forth.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.130
So even though the technology
has been around for decades,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.500
it is still very much
an emergent technology.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:31.530
So now, let me give you an
inkling of what the world sounds

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.030
like to me with a cochlear implant.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.800
So I'm going to play you
a couple of sound files

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.290
and let me tell you
what this is about.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:46.940
You're going to hear what
sounds like an English sentence

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.350
that has been electronically
filtered to resemble the output

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.440
of a cochlear implant, and your
challenge will be to figure

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.680
out what the sentence is.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.240
I'm going to play you a couple
of versions of that sentence.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.320
The first version, the four-channel
version, roughly corresponds

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.570
to what some of the
very earliest users

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.880
of experimental cochlear
implants heard,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.640
because at that time they had
only four or six electrodes.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.830
They were very primitive
devices by today's standards.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.720
When my first cochlear
implant was first turned on,

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.030
the software gave me the
equivalent of eight electrodes.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.670
I'm simplifying here because at

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.630 position:56%
that point even though there were 16
electrodes in the electrode array,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.400
the software treated
each pair of them

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.820
as if it was a single electrode.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.550
So I got, in effect, eight
electrodes worth of information.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.890
Then a year later, I got new
software that made each electrode

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:56.190
in individual channel,
giving me 16 channels.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.810
So I'm going to play
you four, eight and 16.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.310
Let's see if you can figure
out what the sentence is.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:06.290
&gt;&gt; [Sound recording]
I like to play tennis.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost:
I'll play it again.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.720
&gt;&gt; [Sound recording]
I like to play tennis.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost:
Can anybody make that out?

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:16.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.540
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: No takers?

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.120
&gt;&gt; I like to play to tennis?

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.190
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost:
I like to play tennis.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.210
Any other guesses?

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.250
&gt;&gt; Shush?

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost:
Shush [laughter]?

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.090
Well, if you listen to it, you can
actually kind of hear that shush.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.860
Let me play that again.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.850
That's a finer pointer.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.290
It always gets lost on this slide.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.220
&gt;&gt; [Sound recording]
I like to play tennis.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: I think
[inaudible] end, you sort of hear

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.900
that [makes sounds] kind
of sound, don't you?

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.870
Okay. So who thinks it's,
I like to play chess?

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.840
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible response].

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: Okay.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.410
It could be that, right?

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.120
All right, now eight channels.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.110
And when you hear this, you'll
hear a pretty good rendition

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:03.590 position:56%
of what things sounded like to me on
that first day back in October 2001.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:08.340
I have to find a pointer.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.240
&gt;&gt; [Sound recording]
I like to play tennis.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost:
Okay, any guesses?

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.970
Well, I'm seeing people nodding.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:23.260
Okay. How many people feel sure
that it's, I like to play tennis?

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.380
[Background talking]
Okay, a bunch of you.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:30.900
You know, about a year later, in
2002, I was upgraded to 16 channels

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.640 position:56%
and that was not a surgical process,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.030
they just put new software
in the processor.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.150
There's actually a little data port

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.470
in which the audiologist
can plug a port

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.520
and they just transferred new
software into the processor,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.520
so it's very easy to get upgraded.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.870
Here's 16 channels.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.270
Let's use the finder.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.670
There we go.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:58.620
&gt;&gt; [Sound recording]
I like to play tennis.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.020
&gt;&gt; Wow, [inaudible] [laughter].

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: So
you can hear the difference.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.880
You hear that the 16-channel
version is smoother

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.170
than the 8-channel version.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:12.800
But now let me play you the
original unedited sound file.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.160
&gt;&gt; [Sound recording]
I like to play tennis.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost:
Big difference, right?

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.220
So there are two lessons to
be drawn from this slide.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.430
The first lesson [background
sounds] is

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.350
that a cochlear implant does not
give you super human hearing.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:35.240
It is not Jamie Summer's Bionic
Woman, X-man kind of hearing.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.290
On the other hand,
it is usable hearing.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.270
It allowed me to use the
telephone, listen to the radio,

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:45.400
have conversations, even in
noisy rooms and in restaurants.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.480
So that's a lesson to be
drawn from that slide.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.640
Okay. So now we've done
cochlear implant 101 --

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.580
cyborg 101, or rather,
modern-day cyborg 101.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.390
So we'll talk about what this
technology means for the future.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:06.450
So let's talk about some emerging
neuroprosthetic technologies.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.860
So this is a video --
there's no sound in the video,

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.450
it's just the video -- that
shows a double amputee.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.110
He lost both of his arms.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.060
He was an electrical linesman.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.580
He was electrocuted;
both of his arms had

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.240
to be amputated at the shoulder.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.340
So people are working on building
externally wearable prosthetic arms

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.880
for him to use.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:38.170
So, these arms are getting their
information from those electrodes

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.260
that you can see on his
back; they are picking

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.840
up the twitches of his muscles.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.710
And in fact, surgeons have actually
moved around the nerve [inaudible]

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.000
to different places on his
back and his shoulder so that

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.200
when he imagines a given
set of muscle motions,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.270
muscle will actually twitch
in his back and on his chest

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.870
and the electrodes pick
up those twitchings --

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.330
those twitches and they figure
out what he is trying to do

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.540
and they make the arm do it.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.830
So this is an example of
what's state-of-the-art

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.750
in prosthetic arms today.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.820
And you'll notice, by the
way, he's wearing goggles,

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.960
so they're clearly not
entirely sure of the safety

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.510
of these devices yet [laughter].

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:27.150
So let me tell you
two things about this.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.380
On the one hand, it's
incredibly impressive.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.060
He's actually controlling
this thing fairly well.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.000
On the other hand, it
still falls very far short

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.020
of reproducing a natural arm.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.000
First of all, he gets no
sensory feedback from the arm,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.710
so he only knows where
it is by looking at it.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:52.110
Second, the software is
only sophisticated enough

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:55.650
to decode one motion at a
time, so, it's hard for them

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.730
to just move smoothly and
do several things at a time.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.320
It's more like he's
got to move the elbow,

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.640
move the wrist and move the elbow.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.790
He has to decompose the motion
and execute them one at a time.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.270
So it is both impressive and
underwhelming at the same time.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.100
So this shows you kind
of the cutting edge

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.630
of how much information we can
get of what the brain wants

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.460
and reading muscles on
the outside of the body.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.610
There's nothing going on with
the technology in his brain

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.440
for this particular technology.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.320
So what if you could
go to the brain?

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.590
Now, this is something that I
wrote about in a story I wrote

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.260 position:56%
for "Wired Magazine" last year, it's
called "Waiting for the Bionic Man."

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.120
So you can actually just find it
online by doing a Google search

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:50.150
for "wired bionic arm" and my last
name, "Chorost," C-H-O-R-O-S-T.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:55.270
It's how I explored some of the
things that prosthetic arms can do,

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.840
but also why it is still so
difficult to make them behave

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.430
as well as naturally
performing arms.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.670
Okay. People are trying to get into
the brain itself to figure out how

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.370
to read information out of
the brain because that's

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.880
where the information is.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:16.160
It's like this is my [inaudible]
because that's where the money is.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.280
This is why researchers are trying
to get in the brain because that's

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.800
where the code is that tells you
what the brain is trying to do.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.260
So this is very primitive
technology that I actually tried.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.790
Now, that's me wearing
a cat with electrodes

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:35.770
and what this does is I'm
looking at that computer screen

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.620
and various letters are
flashing on and off.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.260
It's flashing one letter at a time.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.140
And I'm just looking at a letter
and waiting for it to flash.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:50.240
When it flashes, there's a
perceptible signal that goes

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.670
on in the visual cortex where the
visual cortex is saying, "Hey,

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.720
something just happened."

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.580
When that happens that a peer
knows that what I was looking

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.060
at it has just been lit
up and it puts that letter

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.190
on the screen up on top here.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.840
So it's actually very
simple technology.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.960
It's just looking for
activation in the visual cortex

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.610
and it works surprisingly well.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:19.420
I was able spell out "Hello
out there" just by looking

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.980 position:56%
at different letters on this screen.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.920
So it's a really interesting
technology

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.170 position:56%
but it's still external to the body.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.610
Okay. What if I go inside?

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.250
Well, this is a new video
-- well, not that new.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.980
It's about two years old now.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:41.640
This is of a woman who is
paraplegic, completely paralyzed,

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.450
and she had implants installed
in her brain in the motor cortex,

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.450
the part that controls the arm.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.330
And that implant is being used

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.130
to drive the robotic
arm that you see here.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:00.110
So you can see on the top of
her head, that is the plug

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.930
that is actually picking

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:06.150 position:56%
up electrical signals put inside
her motor cortex, data is being sent

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.730
to the computer and the
computer is trying to figure

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.480
out from her brain
activity what she is trying

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.700
to do with the robotic arm.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:21.940
And you can see that A, it
does kind of work and, B,

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.720
it's not ready for prime time.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:30.240
So, again, we have that combination
of amazing and underwhelming

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:37.510
and you will see in a moment
she will get it up to her mouth.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:46.280
[ Pause ]

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.420
So I was told by John Donahue
[assumed spelling] who is the PI,

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.280
the principal investigator, of this
study that this was the first time

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.000
since she had been paralyzed that
she was able to pick up a cup

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.510
and bring it to her
own mouth by herself.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:27.010
[ Pause ]

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.010
[ Laughter ]

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.010
[ Inaudible Conversations ]

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:37.060
[ Pause ]

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.510
Now, she's got to get it
back down on the table.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:53.010
[ Pause ]

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:58.040
[ Applause ]

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:02.070
So it's really quite amazing
what the technology can do,

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.380
but we're still trying to
grapple with the question

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.480
of how much further can you go
with this kind of technology.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.230
Well, I'll show you a short clip
from a TV show that I wrote back

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.640
in 2007 asking, well, how
do you get inside the brain?

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.850
And here's one possible way.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:25.570
And this video does have
audio, so if you can't hear it,

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.950
raise your hand and
I'll turn the volume up.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.090
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] excited because
for the first time there was a way

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:36.320 position:56%
to access the brain [inaudible], and
the brain being such a vital organ,

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.790
it's quite understandable
you want to leave it alone.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.840
So the technology is there.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.280
Now, the question will be,
[inaudible] you actually put

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.860
in the nanowires exactly
at the place you want.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.560
The answer is no, you can't.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:57.050
But, nanowires are very small,
so [inaudible] is very small

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:01.350
which is [inaudible] that's
about, you know, 100 times less

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.940
than the thickness of your hair.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.050
How do you push the
electrode to the brain?

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:11.810
So what you do is you actually send
a certain number [inaudible] bundle

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.010
and then the bundle
would probably be --

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:20.400
I mean, nanowires would be allowed
to float into the blood stream

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.420
until they can go no further.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.960
At the moment we can wire a rat.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.430
We can [inaudible] the
electrodes in the spinal cord.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.160
We want to know if we do so,

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.530
how long would the wires
continue to work properly.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.970
We're talking about five years

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:43.680
where it's a very basic
research that needs to be done.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: So, that's
one idea that's being floated

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:53.190
around of actually wiring up
the brain from the inside.

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:57.800
I personally am not too optimistic
about that particular technology

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.240
because the issues of tangling
and clotting seem to me just to be

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:07.480
so formidable as to pretty much
rule this out as a possibility.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.080
But there are other possibilities

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.860
which are actually quite
a bit further along.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.510
So, a year or two ago I wrote
another story in "Wired"

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.920
about a technology
called optogenetics.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.990
It's not a very glamorous
sounding name.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.230
Optogenetics, what's that?

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.440
What it is is its using light

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.810
to make genetically altered
neurons fire or stop firing.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.700
So let me explain a little bit
further what optogenetics is

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.560
all about.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.350 position:56%
With a technology like optogenetics,

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.230
you start by putting
altered genes --

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.180
or rather, you start by
putting genes inside the neurons

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.640
in a particular part of the brain.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.210
Well, what genes?

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.650
You take genes from plants.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.330
What genes from plants?

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:56.150
You take the genes from plants
that make them respond to light.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.270
So we know that plants
do respond to light.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.420
A leaf will move toward the sun.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.660
Plants are phototropic.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.600
You could actually take the gene
that makes plants do that and put

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:13.790
that gene inside a neuron
inside the mammalian cortex.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:19.250 position:56%
And so when a light is shown on that
neuron, it will then actually fire.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:23.100
So you can set it up -- the details
get very complicated and I talk

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.060
about them at length in my book,
"World Wide Mind", but you can set

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.290
up a neuron so that when you're
showing blue light on it,

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.990
that neuron will start to
fire and only that neuron.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.440
The other neurons around
it don't fire.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.470 position:56%
It's possible to make this
technique so specific you can choose

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:46.100 position:56%
to fire only selecting neurons out
of a bunch of thousands or millions.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.900
Conversely, you can also use yellow
light to make your own stop firing.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.120
When you're showing a yellow
light, the neurons are inhibited.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.530
So you can actually turn on
and off selected neurons just

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.860
by showing new lights on them.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:06.700 position:56%
And a way to do this is to put light
emitting diodes underneath the skull

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.500
on top of the brain where they
actually illuminate brain tissue

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.830
with red and yellow light and
other wavelengths as well.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.660
So you actually get to control
neurons on the cortex of the brain

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.580 position:56%
which is where most cognition takes
place without actually having to cut

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.730
into the brain or to try to
send nanowires into the brain

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.740
from the other direction
through the capillaries.

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.920
So this is opening
up the possibility

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.180
of creating brain implants that
just sit on top of the brain.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:41.490
And let me show you a mouse to
whom this has actually been done.

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:44.420
So this video, I'd like to
show it to you twice for you

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.230
to really understand
what's going on.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:51.090
So you're going to see a mouse
[inaudible] plastic tank.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:55.440
What you can't see is that there is
a fiber optic cable that is hanging

00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.780
down and going into the mouse's
brain; and that cable is being used

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:06.390
to send blue light into the mouse's
motor cortex, or more accurately,

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:09.930
into one-half of the
mouse's motor cortex.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:14.330
So when blue light illuminate,
half of the mouse's motor cortex

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.970
that controls the arms
and legs on one side,

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.570
both arms and legs start to run.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:23.370
Since the other ones are not
being stimulated, what happens?

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.930
The mouse goes in a circle, right?

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:29.150
If you think about it, if you could
only move your right arm and leg

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:33.510
and you were on all fours, it
would end up going in a circle.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.330
So that's what's going on here.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:39.440
So I'll play it again and watch
very carefully for the blue light

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.420
that shines in the mouse's head
and as that blue light turns on,

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.880
the mouse will start to run
in a counterclockwise circle.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.300
When the light is turned
off, the mouse will stop.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.780
Okay, watch again.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:36:00.070 position:56%
Okay. So light's not on yet, so in
a second it's going to be turned on.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.940
Now, okay, it's running around
because it can't help it.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.800
Its brain is being forced to fire,
the neurons in his motor cortex

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.670
that make the legs on one side
move; and when it stops, it stops

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.760
and so it looks up, you know, "What
the heck just happened [laughter]?"

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.060
So it doesn't look dramatic.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.290
There's a mouse running around
in a circle, but what's dramatic

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:25.150 position:56%
about it is, it's showing it the use

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:30.610
of information light that's being
used to precisely control one thing

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.620
that a mouse does and that's
doing one precise thing.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.280
It's running around in a circle.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.960
It's not having a convulsion,
it's not pressing levers,

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.920
it's not feeling hungry; it's
just doing one particular thing.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:46.290 position:56%
So what is this telling us that when
you're beginning to figure out --

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.160
and I really mean just beginning --

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.400
beginning to figure out how to
decompose activity in the brain

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.700
to figure out what it means?

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.480
When this neuron, that neuron and
this neuron and that neuron fire,

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.340
what does that correspond to?

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.770
We're just trying to figure out
those kinds of relationships

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:07.600
and here's an example of the paper
that came out a few years ago.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.080 position:56%
In the early [inaudible] of the
concepts of nest in the mouse brain.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.830
So to figure out which
neurons activate

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.700
when the mouse sees its nest.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.080
So the ultimate idea is that
all the things that we think

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.760
of as immaterial thought is
our ideas, our perceptions,

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.070
our feelings, our bodily
sensations, our hungers,

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.710
all of these are ultimately
represented and caused

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:38.100
by specific pattern of
neural activity in the brain.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:43.110
You know, in reality, it is
extraordinarily complicated.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:48.340
Researchers have found that when
animals like monkeys make but looks

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:52.190
like the same motion, different
sets of neurons will fire.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.520
So it's clearly very complicated.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.390
It's not a simple as oh,
neurons X, Y, Z fire,

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.840
that means that this is happening.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.730
The relationships are much
more complex than that.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.050
That's partly because the
brain is constantly changing

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.410
and it's constantly learning.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.600
So, for example, when you
train a mouse to move its arm

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.360
in a certain way and
watch neurons fire.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.840
If you then put a weight on
that monkey's arm so that it has

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.010
to work a little bit harder
to make the same motion,

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.890
you'll see different neurons fire
because the brain is adjusting,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.570
to learn how to make the arm
move the same way even though the

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.970
situation has changed.

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:34.480
So the neural code is not
[inaudible] a solid thing

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.310
like an alphabet or a language;
it is a constantly changing thing.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:40.990
And the challenge is trying to
figure out how to understand

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.990
that well enough to be able
to actually intervene in it,

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:49.410
to figure out what it means
and to make neurons fire

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:54.460
to make the brain experience a
particular sensation or taste

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.670
or hunger or thought or feeling.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:01.030
Now, if you think this
sounds completely outlandish,

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.540
consider for a moment

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:07.380
that my cochlear implant is sending
electrical signals to my brain

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.560
that makes my brain
believe that it's here.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.760
I'm completely deaf.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.160
I have no biological hearing
and yet researchers had figured

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.930
out the auditory code of the
brain well enough to enable me

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:24.000
to hear something that sounds
pretty much like normal English.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.210
So to give [inaudible] details
[inaudible] optogenetics.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:34.040
So as I said before, it can fire
or inhibit just one type of neuron,

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.180
let's say, motor neurons,

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:41.190
that control the arm while
leaving all the others unaffected.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:45.230 position:56%
And because you're injecting viruses
into the tissue to insert the gene

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:49.490
into those neurons, you can very
much limit where it happens just

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.660
by only injecting the viruses

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.350
that carry those genes
into particular areas.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:59.560
And so with refinements, which I
talked about in "World Wide Mind,"

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:04.190
it's potentially possible to
activate only specific neurons

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:09.110
and to detect only, when to
detect which neurons fire

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:11.680
when a given action
or a given perception

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.800
or a given thought happens.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.560
So optogenetics has really
transformed neuroscience.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.390
It's allowed researchers to really
begin dissecting the actual neural

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.270
basis of thought and action.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:28.440
So here's a paper that came out
just recently and got quite a lot

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.480
of press, you may have
heard about it.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.680
In fact, I haven't
given you a reference

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.510
because you can just find
it by Googling phrase like

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:40.460 position:56%
"brain-to-brain interphase real time
sharing," the paper will come up.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.880
It's an Open Access paper.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:47.670
And this was in the lab of Miguel
Nicolelis at Duke University,;

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:52.350
and he reported that he had
gotten one rat to be able

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:57.080
to send a mental signal to another
rat to tell that rat which lever

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.940
to press, the right
one or the left one.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:03.610
Okay? So let's dig
into that a little bit.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.240
When I first read about the study,

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.740
here's what I thought
they were doing.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:12.770
So, they had two rats and they both
have arrays of electrodes implanted

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:17.210 position:56%
in their brains and those electrodes
can both detect neural activity

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.350
and trigger neural activity.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.980
It goes either way.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.990
So what I thought they were doing
is they were having the sender rat

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.810
pressing a left or
a right bar, okay,

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:31.210
depending on which
light flashed above it,

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:36.370
and then the computer picked up a
certain pattern of neural activity

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.020
that they had previously
learned and corresponded

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.760
to pressing, say, the left bar.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.520
And that they sent a
simple code, you know,

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.180
it's like a certain
sensation to another mouse

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:52.090
with an implanted electrode
array and that mouse had learned

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.120
when I had this sensation,
I pressed the left bar,

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.950
when I had that sensation,
I pressed the right bar.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.290
That's what I thought it
was, so, I was like, oh,

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:03.210
that's not such a big deal
because you just do that just

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:07.010
by implanting electrodes and
training a mouse to do something

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.780
when it has a certain sensation.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.640
Big deal. So what?

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.330
Well, I read the paper very
carefully a couple of times

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.250 position:56%
and this is what's really happening.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:20.950
So the sender mouse, which is the
one on the left, presses the left

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:24.400
or the right bar -- let's
say it's the left bar.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.350
The pattern neural activity that
corresponds to that is picked up

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:33.730
and recorded and it's processed to
basically clean it up a little bit,

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:39.080
and then that actual data, the
cleaned-up version of that data,

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.830
is sent to the receiver's brain.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:47.690
So whatever neural pattern fires,
whatever they detect in the sender,

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.140
they clean it up a little bit

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.680
and they send it to
the receiver's brain.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.960
So the receiver mouse is getting
a slightly filtered version

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.190
of what's actually going on
in the sender rat's brain.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:05.500
And if that mouse actually
presses the left bar,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:10.450
the sender mouse gets a reward; the
sender mouse gets a drink of water,

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.930
so that when the sender
mouse gets it right,

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.630
it gets rewarded for that activity.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:19.270
So it learns, if I press the
bar this way, if I just do it

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.410
in this certain way, I get rewards.

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:26.600
So there is actually a kind of
circular communication going

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.240
on here between the mice.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.300
Now, I started asking
some questions.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.840
The success rate of this
was between 60% and 72%,

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.690
which is not actually incredibly
good when you think about that

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:41.920
by chance alone you will
get a 50% success rate.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.570
Okay? So clearly there
were lots of times

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.450
when the sender pushed the left bar
and the receiver either did nothing

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:52.800
or pressed the other bar, so
it's clearly not fool-proof yet.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:56.370
You can kind of see this pattern
of [inaudible] up is both amazing

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:58.250
and underwhelming, right?

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.810
This idea comes up
over and over again,

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.170
but it raises some very
interesting questions.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:08.750
So do the rats think they're
communicating or do they just think

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:12.030
that stuff is happening in their
heads and they're pressing bars?

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.490
And the paper really doesn't answer
that question as far as I can tell.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:16.960
Can the rats see each other?

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.260
Do they actually know that
they are communicating?

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.370
I'm not clear on that.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:24.360
The other question I think is
actually more interesting is

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.910
that the receiver rat feels that
it's responding to a signal;

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.680
is it thinking, "Oh, I'm
getting this kind of sensation,

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.190
I'm going to press the left bar,"
or, is it actually being forced

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.710
to press the left bar because the
neurons in his brain [inaudible]

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:43.020
when the left bar gets pressed is
actually -- are actually firing.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.960
So [inaudible] just pushing
that bar because it thinks just

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.180
as if it had decided
to do it itself.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.550
So that's a very interesting
question.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.900
We may not know the answer to
that until we are able to get --

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.240
stop working with rats and
start working with people

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.070
because you can't interview
a rat and say, "Well,

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.990
what do you think happened?"

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.150
It raises all these very
interesting questions.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.280 position:56%
So in the paper, I was looking at --

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.540
quoted you what it said at
the very end of the paper,

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:14.410
which is kind of both mind
blowing and [inaudible] okay.

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:20.530
So he says, "In theory, channel
accuracy," and this is the accuracy

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.340 position:56%
of how well it works, "can be
increased if instead of [inaudible],

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:30.480
a whole grid of multiple
reciprocally interconnected brains

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.760
are employed."

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.320
So let's talk about wiring
together a whole bunch of rats.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.540
All right.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.270
Well, what do you get from that?

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:41.340
Such a computing structure
could define the first example

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.490
of an organic computer capable
of solving heuristic problems

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:50.700
that would be deemed non-computable
by [inaudible] machine.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.570
Well, this will mean more
if you're a computer geek.

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:59.800
Okay? But what they're saying
in plain English is that, A,

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.620
if you connect a whole bunch

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.100
of rats together we think
something interesting is going

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.350
to happen but we're not sure what.

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:12.120
And they're suggesting that
maybe this interconnected set

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.600
of rats will be able to do things
that rats have never been able

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.480
to do before, whatever that is.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.020 position:56%
So, I started thinking about,
"Well, could you do this to people?"

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:28.840
And [inaudible] that the answer is,
in theory, yes, okay, in theory.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.720
There's obviously a lot
of technical challenges

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.940
to solve, but in theory, yes.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.610
So let's say you had an
implanted optogenetic array

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:39.610
in the left person's brain and
that person thinks of an apple,

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.310
a certain set of neurons fire.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:45.240
So that person's implanted
array picks up that set

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.640
of firings and decodes it.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.620
Oh, this means a person
is thinking of an apple.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:54.080
And then sends a code over the
Internet which just consists

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.120
of the word "apple," okay,
nothing very complicated,

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.890 position:56%
just the word "apple", and
[inaudible] the array, picks that up

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:04.890
and it knows which neurons to
activate in that person's brain

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.460
so [background talking] you
then have the perception

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.960
of seeing an apple.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.340
So you've sent a perception
of seeing something

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:16.150
through the Internet, these would
be literally two brains connected

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:19.350
by this kind of Internet system.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.720
And in "World Wide Mind" I
called this "telempathy,"

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.850
to talk about the fact that this is
nonverbal information that's being

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.370
sent, and that would be
the interesting thing.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:33.740
Sending speech, well, we've
got a technology to do that,

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.450
it's called a cell phone.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:38.550
What's more interesting is sending
things that we cannot now send

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.890
over the wires, feelings,
perceptions,

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:45.250
sensations, ideas, eventually.

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:46.290
So let me just [inaudible]
a whole bunch

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:49.670
of long disclaimers as I wind down.

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:52.020
We are still struggling to
understand the neural code.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:57.480
It is still essentially
impossible to just look at a brain

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.920
at its neural firing and figure
out what that brain is doing.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.830
All we can really do now is
record a brain's activity

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.890
as it does something where we know
what it's doing, pressing a lever,

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:13.630
seeing an apple, and then, if we
see the brain doing that, again,

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:18.300 position:56%
we figure, oh, the brain must be
seeing an apple or pressing a lever.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.580
It's a one-to-one correspondence.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:22.560
But there's no way as

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:26.100
yet of understanding the
general code of the brain.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.330
If this electrode -- [inaudible]
this neuron, that neuron,

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:30.670
that neuron, that neuron,
these neurons fire,

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.550
all that means is a person
thinking of the "Wizard of Oz".

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:35.350
[Inaudible], okay?

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:39.480
And I think [inaudible]
is stupendously difficult.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.230 position:56%
It's kind of like Robert Goddard
launching his first rocket that went

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:46.300
up 30 feet and then extrapolating
from that [inaudible] say, "Oh,

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.400
we'll be able to get to the moon."

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.260 position:56%
Well, we could, it's just that we're
still at that Robert Goddard stage.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.850
I also argued in "World Wide Mind"

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:57.770
that this technology would not
work unless you had [inaudible]

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.580
communicative context.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:03.490
So unless person A and person B
are in a context where thinking

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:06.980
about an apple makes sense, just
sending these signals is just going

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:09.620
to seem like nonsense, so
they're going to need a way

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:13.440
of actually having a contact in
which these signals make sense.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.410 position:56%
And finally, you need safe, easy and
cheap brain surgery, which is going

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.120
to be something [inaudible] to
get past the FDA [laughter].

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:25.790 position:56%
Okay? Still, to wrap up, and we have
a couple of minutes for questions.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:30.120
I just wanted to point out that
cochlear implants were a crazy idea

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.570
in 1975.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:36.280
Otolaryngologists at that time
were saying, it's impossible.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.620
You couldn't fit that much
computational power inside

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:39.620
the brain.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.780
You couldn't figure out the
auditory code of the ear.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.050
You couldn't surgically implant it.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:44.580
Forget it.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:45.760
That's nonsense.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.540
And yet indeed, it did happen.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.800
So with that note I want
to say thank you very much

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.510
for coming and for listening.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:59.040
[ Applause ]

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.950
So we have about six
minutes for questions, okay.

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:06.340
So I'm inviting you to raise a
question, and if I can't hear you,

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.670
I may just trot over, or, you know,

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.460
maybe you can just [inaudible]
question [inaudible] hear it better

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:11.090
than I can.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.740
Okay. Yes, sir?

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:20.390
&gt;&gt; You're talking about stimulating
the nerve endings with [inaudible],

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:23.590
do you know any research
[inaudible] with multiple sclerosis

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:28.920
where the brain is damaged
and it might be possible

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.660
to rewire the damaged
part of the brains,

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.260
[inaudible] to regain mobility?

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:36.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: Okay.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.810
I've heard parts of that
but I'll need some help.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:39.130
&gt;&gt; Multiple sclerosis...

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:39.960
&gt;&gt; Hmm-mm.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.580
&gt;&gt; ...if the brain is --
is there any research done

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.780
to rewire the brain?

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:46.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: Okay.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:46.580
[Inaudible].

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:47.920
So the question is, is
there a research going

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.730
on to actually use a
technology to help people

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:53.240
with brain disorders
like multiple sclerosis?

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.330
I don't know about MS,
but for Parkinson's, yes.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.080
So there is actually quite a bit
of research going on especially

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.200
at Stanford to look at
what the brain stops doing

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.300
with patients [inaudible]
Parkinson's.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:11.670
And so there is active talk of
creating optogenetic technologies

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:15.990
to implant in Parkinson's
patients to stimulate the neurons

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:20.380
that are not firing or are firing
because the patient has Parkinson's

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:24.100
to replicate that person's
ability to control their body.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.080
So, yes, the optogenetics
is very much being thought

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.590
up as a possible treatment
for those kinds of problems.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:36.400
And in fact, I wrote a story about
this in "Wired", so if you go to --

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.660
if you do a Google search -- well,
it's actually powered by photons,

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.050
so if you Google search with
"powered by photons," you'll come

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:46.120
to the story I wrote in "Wired"

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.580
where the principal
investigator started

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.090
with that as a main motivation.

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.510
He wanted to figure out
how to cure Parkinson's.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:54.780
And he started doing
research on mice

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:56.790
that actually had Parkinson's
disease;

00:51:56.790 --> 00:52:00.130
they were genetically engineered
to have Parkinson's, and they found

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:02.650
that there were [inaudible] ways
actually of making them walk again.

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:06.250
So, yes, this is very much an
active area of research right now.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:07.390
Okay, question.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:08.790
Yes, sir?

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:21.180
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm [inaudible] and I have
a couple of questions for you.

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:28.080
I'm curious about your use of the
word "cyborg" in one of your books.

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:37.030
I thought that can be kind
of offensive to deaf people.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:44.610
And also you're talking about the
500,000 people who are deaf here

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:49.060
in America that you mentioned and
you're trying to cure them or,

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.650
I mean, [inaudible] genocide?

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:51.050
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: Okay.

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:56.810
This is a very complex issue and
I'm glad you raised that question.

00:52:56.810 --> 00:53:00.130
I actually talked about it in
length in both of my books.

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:03.700
So I also spent a year
at Gallaudet University,

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:07.550
so where I was learning a
little bit of sign language.

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:13.700
I don't know enough to
really have a conversation

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.520
because I never learned
sign while growing up,

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:20.940
but I've certainly
thought about this question

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.410
in a great deal of depth.

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:29.510
So it's very -- there's very much
a split in the deaf community

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:34.660
between people who are
native sign users and people

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:39.300
who have been brought oral, who
grow up using English like me.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.460
So just to give the
audience some background,

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:47.060
people who are native sign
language users, who are immersed

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.300
in that community, are
concerned that the use

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.600
of cochlear implants will
undercut that community.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:54.740
Because if a child gets
a cochlear implant,

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.210
they often can hear well enough
to grow up speaking English

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:58.040
or another spoken language instead
of going to a sign and deaf school

00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:58.700
and learning sign language.

00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.240
So that's the concern.

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.920
So I know I'm not answering your
question yet, but let me ask you,

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.580
would you like to follow up?

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:02.510
&gt;&gt; I have one more.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:09.120
[ Silence ]

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:09.740
You mentioned -- [inaudible]
[laughter].

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:14.640
&gt;&gt; Talk about the use
of the "cyborg"...

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:17.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: That's okay.

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:22.270
&gt;&gt; For hearing people [inaudible]
hearing [inaudible] channels,

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:29.300
so I'm not sure [inaudible]
if we would call

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.160
that [inaudible] successful
putting them

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:36.410
into children [inaudible] hearing,
but also [inaudible] I think

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:39.090
that people -- it makes
us seem like it's

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:45.370
against deaf people [inaudible]
use of that term, "cyborg,"

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:53.030
it seems like you kind
of hate deaf people.

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:58.610
I mean, I grew up in
[inaudible] school,

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:06.220
it's not that I wasn't
successful there, and [inaudible].

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.780
So my question is, I'm asking
you, do you hate deaf people?

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost:
Okay, challenging question.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.330 position:56%
Of course, I don't hate deaf people.

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:19.350
Okay. That's the simple
answer to your question.

00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:27.220 position:56%
I went and spent a year at Gallaudet
University, I'm deaf myself.

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:30.070
Here's what I think is going on.

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:38.900
96% of deaf children are born to
parents who have normal hearing.

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:42.350
Those parents don't
know sign language.

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:47.310
They have no exposure
to sign language .

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:55.010
96%. So the doctors says to those
parents, "I have a technology

00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:57.510
that will enable your
child to hear and to grow

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.650
up speaking your language."

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:00.550
What do you think those
parents will do?

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:02.110
In almost every instance, they
will take the cochlear implant.

00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:02.890
So there's no conspiracy here.

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:05.140
Nobody hates deaf people, it's just
that 96% of deaf children are born

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.850
to parents who don't know anything
about deafness, and those parents,

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.350
very understandably, I would
say, they want to raise a child

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:09.370
in their own language
in their own culture.

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:10.510
So that's what's going on.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:14.010
[ Silence ]

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:20.000
[ Noises ]

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:37.760
&gt;&gt; We have a limited amount of time
for questions in the program today,

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:44.630
so we can continue this discussion
after the program outside.

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:48.950
If there are any other questions...

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:50.060
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:54.600
&gt;&gt; ...otherwise, we'll wrap up.

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.690
Any other questions.

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:58.370
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: So
we'll take one more question.

00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.770
Yes, sir?

00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:02.430
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] to using this kind
of technology, or these kinds

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:06.640
of technologies to
transmit a nonnative sensory

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.620
and put it into humans?

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:16.110
So take all kinds of data that
on the Internet, for example,

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:18.540
and transmitting data to the mind?

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:18.940
&gt;&gt; Dr. Michael Chorost: Okay.

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.740
So the question is, iss
there any research into --

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:23.500
you used the word "nonnative" into
[inaudible] say "nonstandard" kind

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:27.210
of information, things we don't
normally hear or feel or see?

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.450
It's a fascinating question.

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:33.250
I think that's an idea
that many people have.

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:38.920
At this point it's a -- I
wouldn't quite say it's a fantasy,

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.580
but it's a hope.

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:43.420
I think that's the kind of thing
that Miguel Nicolelis was talking

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:48.900
about at the end of his article
when he talked about linking groups

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.470
of brains together, to
see what would happen,

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.750
to see what is possible.

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:57.600
So in my book "World Wide Mind,"
I suggested that this kind

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:02.000
of technology could be used to
facilitate group communication

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.220
in a way that's imagistic.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:07.390 position:56%
So, for example, if you have a group
of people in a dangerous situation

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:10.880
and one of them gets
hurt, you may be able

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:17.330 position:56%
to transmit a [inaudible] sensation
of pain immediately to everyone else

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:22.910
in the group so that
everybody instantly knows, "Oh,

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:26.260
John has just been injured,"
[inaudible] immediately reacts

00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:29.540 position:56%
to that rather than to have to shout
and try to explain and so forth.

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.060
So, I think the most exciting
use of these technologies is not

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.650
to do better things that we do
today, but rather to enable us

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:35.120
to do entirely new things that
we can't even imagine now,

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.380
and this is what the
Internet has been all about.

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.300
So when email came out in the
1990s, most people thought, "Oh,

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.170
this is just a better way
to write [inaudible]."

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:40.700
But of course, as we all know,
it completely changed corporate

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:41.990
and personal and social
communication in a way

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.830
that could not have been imagined.

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:43.730
And I would expect to
see [inaudible] to go

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.110
on if this technology ever
becomes safe and useful.

00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:45.740
Okay, we have to wrap up.

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:46.400
So I've got books out there.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.140
I'd be delighted to sign any books
that you would be delighted to buy,

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:49.190
and thank you all so
much for coming out.

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.760
I really appreciate it.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
