00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.840
We're on Test 5, Section
9, on page 679.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.530
Let's do some problems.
Problem number 1.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.560
If 6 cars out of 10 on an
assembly line are red, what is

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.320
the probability that a car
selected at random from the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.700
assembly line will be red?

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.390
Well, 6 out of 10 are red.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.640
So if I take a random one, I
have a 6 in 10 chance of

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.640
getting a red car.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.310
If you look at the choices,
there is no 6/10, but you can

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.080
see that this can be reduced.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.010
If you divide the top and the
bottom by 2, you get 3/5.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.330
So this is really just an
exercise in reducing a

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.370
fraction to its lowest common
or simplified form, so the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.930
answer is B.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.965
Problem 2.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.240
Let me draw that diagram.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.520
So I have a triangle.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.460
Let me try my best
to draw this.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.830
There's an altitude that
comes down the center.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.380
Let's put a 2.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.000
And then what do they write?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.090
They write this angle
right here is w.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.320
This is x, y, z over here.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.170
And they say, note: figure
not drawn to scale.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.760
AB is equal to BC.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.395
Oh, I didn't draw
the letters in.

00:01:26.395 --> 00:01:32.740
So A, B, C, and then D.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.330
So they say that AB
is equal to BC.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.010
So immediately, a trigger should
go off in your head.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.490
If two sides are equal, what
does it say about the base

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.180
angles or their corresponding
angles?

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.800
That means that those are
also going to be equal.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.700
So if those two sides are equal,
then we also know that

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.410
these two angles are equal.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.480
That should immediately be a
trigger in your head, that we

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.330
know that w is equal to z.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.890
What's the next part
of the information?

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.900
And BD, this is BD,
bisects AC.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.220
so bisects means it essentially
intersects it at

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.039
its midpoint.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.380
So that also tells us that this
distance here from A to D

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.080
is the same as the distance
from D to C.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.320
Which of the following
cannot be concluded?

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.050
That w is equal to x.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.850
Actually, immediately, I
don't even know how I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.470
can conclude that.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.920
Let's look at the
other choices.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.190
w is equal to z.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.760
Well, w is equal to z can
definitely be concluded.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.990
That's choice B.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.410
So we know that choice
B is w is equal to z.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.050
We know that this isn't it
because we concluded that

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.770
immediately.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.020
Choice C is that x
is equal to y.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.370
That actually can
be concluded.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.090
How do we know that?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.730
Well, since this bisects this
line and this is an isosceles

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.560
triangle, even though that's
not how I drew it.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.390
This triangle is completely
symmetric.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.930
Maybe I should draw a
little bit better.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.240
How do I know it's completely
symmetric?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.860
Because this side is equal to
this side, that is equal to

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.980
that, and this side is
equal to this side.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.290
And of course, this side
is equal to that side.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.930
And actually, we can also
conclude that this is a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.970
90-degree angle, because if this
was anything other than a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.870
90-degree angle, this wouldn't
be able to bisect at the base.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.340
So choice C, we actually can
deduce that x is equal to y.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.060
So that's not the answer.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.880
Choice D is AD is equal to DC.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.120
Well, they essentially
told us that one.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.460
They said BD bisects AC, so
that's not our answer.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.100
Choice E.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.100
DB is perpendicular to AC.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.130
And I just said the triangle
is completely symmetric.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.620
And given that it's an isosceles
triangle, the only

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.410
way that BD can bisect this
bottom line is if it's

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.220
perpendicular.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.570
So we can also rule out E.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.380
So our answer really is A.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.550
And really, there was no way
that we could figure out.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.780
And a good way of thinking
about that is actually we

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.560
could make this point-- we could
make the length of this

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.339
line, this length BD,
arbitrarily high because they

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.670
gave us no information.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.600
The triangle could
look like this.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.792
It could look like that, or it
could look like this based on

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:27.270
the information they gave us.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.610
So these angles could
change arbitrarily.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.770
So we really don't know
what those angles are.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.280
Next problem.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.530
Problem 3.

00:04:42.844 --> 00:04:44.420
Switch colors.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.214
About to sneeze.

00:04:46.214 --> 00:04:47.060
[SNEEZES]

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.540
Excuse me.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:59.550
If 30% of m is 40, so 0.3
m, what is 15% of m?

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.100
What is 0.15 of m?

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.070
You could solve this.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.540
Divide both sides by 0.3,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.010
But the important thing to
recognize is that 15%, or

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.130
0.15, is half of 0.13.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:20.160
So if 15% is half of 0.3, or
30%, then 15% m is going to be

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.460
half of whatever 30% m is, so
it's going to be equal to 20.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.060
Another thing you could have
done, if that's not completely

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.770
obvious, take this
top equation and

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.760
multiply it by 1/2.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.415
Then you'll get 0.15m
is equal to 20.

00:05:35.415 --> 00:05:37.560
And that's choice B.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.690
Problem 4.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.940
If n is any negative number, so
n is less than 0, which of

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.390
the following must
be positive?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.110
So I can already tell you that
the only way you can take a

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.120
negative number and make it
positive is either if you

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.160
square it or if you multiply it
by another negative number.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.150
So let's see.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.715
Or if you subtract it, actually,
now that I look at

00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:02.670
the choices.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.335
So I could tell you an/2, that's
definitely going to be

00:06:05.335 --> 00:06:06.710
a negative number.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.800
B is definitely going to
be a negative number.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.890
You're multiplying
by a positive.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.130
C, you're just adding something
to it, so it still

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.500
could be negative, if that's
like negative 10

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.820
or something, right?

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.350
D, you're just subtracting from
it, so you're just going

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.780
to make it more negative.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.050
E.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.540
2 minus n.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.190
This will definitely result
in a positive number.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.360
Why?

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.190
Because let's say that you could
express n as the product

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.960
of a negative number.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.330
Let's say n is equal to
minus p, where p is

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.520
some positive number.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.050
You can represent any negative
number like that.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.430
Then 2 minus n is the same
thing as 2 minus minus p,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.730
which is the same thing
as 2 plus p.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.730
And we said p is a
positive number.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.510
So there we go.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.670
So choice number 4
is definitely E.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.410
And you could try it
out with a number.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.400
Try it out with the number n
equals negative 10, and I

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.560
think it should work out.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.520
Next problem.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.530
Problem number 5.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:15.640
The ratio 1.2:1 is equal to
which of the following ratios?

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.990
So they give us a bunch
of choices.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.390
1.2:1, so it's a little
bit more than 1:1.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.610
So we could look at 1:2.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.750
No, that makes no sense, because
1 is smaller than 2.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.250
12:1.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.910
12 is 12 times 1,
not 1.2 times 1.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.585
So you're just looking for a
ratio where the first number

00:07:36.585 --> 00:07:38.660
is 1.2 times the
second number.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.450
5:6, that's choice C.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.080
That doesn't work, because
5 is less than 6.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.680
Choice D.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.800
6:5.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.170
I think we hit it because 6 is
just a little bit more than 5.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.840
And actually, if you wanted to
confirm that, why don't you

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.630
divide the top and
the bottom by 5?

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.900
So 5 goes into 6
how many times?

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.490
5 goes into 6 one time.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.530
How many times does
5 go into 10?

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.390
It's 2.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.200
5 goes into 6 1.2 times.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.280
So the answer is 6:5.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.080
Next problem.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.140
Let's see if I have
time to do this.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.180
Clear image.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.680
Invert colors.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.750
The legend of a certain
pictograph shows that this

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.260
thing is equal to 5
million new homes.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.750
Approximately how many
new homes are

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.360
represented by the symbols?

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.180
So they drew that
3 and 1/2 times.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:40.110
One, two, three, and then
they draw half a house.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.900
That's half a house.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.270
So these three are
going to be what?

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:50.280
This is 3 times 5, which is
equal to 15 million homes.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.560
And then this is half a house.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.430
That's what I tried to draw what
they drew in the diagram.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.290
So half a house is what?

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.620
2.5 million houses.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.880
It's just half of
the 5 million.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.850
So it's 15 million plus 2.5.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.470
It equals 17.5 million homes.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.330
And that is choice D.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.380
You might be tempted to say that
this represents half a

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.840
million homes, but remember,
this represents half of one of

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.445
these pictures.

00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:17.600
And one of these pictures
represents 5 million homes.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.140
