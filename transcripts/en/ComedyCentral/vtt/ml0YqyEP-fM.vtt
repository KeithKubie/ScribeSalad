I don't mind telling you

I never miss a shot of the week.

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.180

with a day your lawsuits

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:22.715
would like me
to do it every hour.

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.851
But you know what
makes it special is the fact

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.153
that it's once a week
it's anticipation.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:31.357
It's like flirting
is sometimes more fun than sex.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.759
&gt;&gt; Yeah I miss sex though.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:37.297

enjoy heating it up first.

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:41.267
