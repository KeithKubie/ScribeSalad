00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.708
There are over one billion cars
in the world today,

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:13.371
getting people where they need to go,

00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:16.262
but cars aren't just
a mode of transportation,

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:18.781
they're also a chemistry lesson
waiting to be taught.

00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.280
The process of starting your car
begins in the engine cylinders,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.793
where a spritz of gasoline
from the fuel injector

00:00:24.793 --> 00:00:26.810
and a gulp of air
from the intake valve

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.844
mix together before 
being ignited by a spark,

00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:33.310
forming gases that expand and push the piston.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.137
But combustion is an exothermic reaction,
meaning it releases heat.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.632
Lots of it.

00:00:38.632 --> 00:00:41.161
And while much of this heat escapes
through the tail pipe,

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:46.324
the heat that remains in the engine block
needs to be absorbed, transported, and dissipated

00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:49.745
to protect the metal components
from deforming or even melting.

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:51.633
This is where the cooling system comes in.

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.451
A liquid gets circulated
throughout the engine,

00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.833
but what kind of liquid
can absorb all that heat?

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:59.210
Water may seem like an obvious first choice.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.836
After all, its specific heat,

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:03.517
the amount of energy required
to raise the temperature

00:01:03.517 --> 00:01:05.959
of a given amount
by one degree Celsius,

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.393
is higher than that of
any other common substance.

00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:10.893
And we have a lot of heat energy to absorb.

00:01:10.893 --> 00:01:13.134
But using water can get us
into deep trouble.

00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:16.760
For one thing, its freezing point
is zero degrees Celsius.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.016
Since water expands
as it freezes,

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:23.102
a cold winter night could mean
a cracked radiator and a damaged engine block,

00:01:23.102 --> 00:01:24.531
a chilling prospect.

00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:26.757
And considering how hot
car engines can get,

00:01:26.757 --> 00:01:30.143
the relatively low boiling point
of 100 degrees Celsius

00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:32.970
can lead to a situation
that would get anyone steamed.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.511
So, instead of water,
we use a solution,

00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:39.511
a homogeneous mixture consisting
of a solute and a solvent.

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:44.261
Some of the solution's properties will differ
depending on the proportion of solute present.

00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:48.075
These are called colligative properties,
and as luck would have it,

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:51.399
they include freezing point depression
and boiling point elevation.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.985
So, solutions have both a lower freezing point
and a higher boiling point than pure solvent,

00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:00.003
and the more solute is present,
the bigger the difference.

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.369
So, why do these properties change?

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.348
First of all, we need to understand that
temperature is a measure

00:02:05.348 --> 00:02:07.727
of the particle's average kinetic energy.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.305
The colder the liquid,
the less of this energy there is,

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:12.310
and the slower the molecules move.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.839
When a liquid freezes,
the molecules slow down,

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.222
enough for their attractive forces
to act on each other,

00:02:17.222 --> 00:02:20.280
arranging themselves into a crystal structure.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.543
But the presence of solute particles
gets in the way of these attractions,

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:27.949
requiring a solution to be cooled down further
before the arrangement can occur.

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.769
As for the boiling point,
when a liquid boils,

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.900
it produces bubbles filled with its vapor,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.928
but for a bubble to form,
the vapor pressure must become as strong

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:40.312
as the atmosphere constantly pushing down
on the surface of the liquid.

00:02:40.312 --> 00:02:43.073
As the liquid is heated, 
the vapor pressure increases,

00:02:43.073 --> 00:02:45.688
and when it becomes equal
to the atmospheric pressure,

00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:48.281
the bubbles form and boiling occurs.

00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:51.400
A solution's vapor pressure is lower
than that of pure solvent,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.333
so it must be heated
to an even higher temperature

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:56.792
before it can match 
the strength of the atmosphere.

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:59.361
As an added bonus,
the pressure in the radiator

00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:01.208
is kept above atmospheric pressure,

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:04.903
raising the boiling point
by another 25 degrees Celsius.

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:07.914
The solution commonly used 
for a car's cooling system

00:03:07.914 --> 00:03:11.389
is a 50/50 mixture of 
ethylene glycol and water,

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:17.532
which freezes at -37 degrees Celsius
and boils at 106 degrees Celsius.

00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:21.225
At the highest recommended proportion
of 70 to 30,

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:25.156
the freezing point is even lower
at -55 degrees Celsius,

00:03:25.156 --> 00:03:29.026
and the boiling point rises
to 113 degrees Celsius.

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:31.616
As you can see,
the more ethylene glycol you add,

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:34.705
the more protection you get,
so why not go even higher?

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:37.483
Well, it turns out you can have
too much of a good thing

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:38.754
because at higher proportions,

00:03:38.754 --> 00:03:41.834
the freezing point actually
starts to go back up.

00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:45.269
The properties of the solution head towards
the properties of ethylene glycol,

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.264
which freezes at -12.9 degrees Celsius,

00:03:48.264 --> 00:03:51.288
a higher temperature than we 
attained with the solution.

00:03:51.288 --> 00:03:54.978
The solution flows through the engine,
absorbing heat along the way.

00:03:54.978 --> 00:03:57.734
When it reaches the radiator,
it's cooled by a fan,

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:00.280
as well as air rushing through
the front of the car

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.872
before returning to the hot engine compartment.

00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:04.840
So, an effective and safe engine coolant

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.418
must have a high specific heat, 
a low freezing point, and a high boiling point.

00:04:09.418 --> 00:04:13.407
But instead of searching all over the world
for the perfect liquid to solve our problem,

00:04:13.407 --> 00:04:15.844
we can create our own solution.
