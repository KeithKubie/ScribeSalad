Kevin Young
“Thataway”

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.588
Was walking. Was
walking

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.508
&amp; then waiting
for a train,

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:11.343
the 12:40
to take us thataway.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.261
(I got there early.)

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.725
Wasn’t a train
exactly but a chariot

00:00:16.893 --> 00:00:19.770
or the Crescent Limited come
to carry me

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.563
some
home I didn’t yet know.

00:00:23.063 --> 00:00:26.275
There were those
of us not ready

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.195
till good
Jim swung from a tree

00:00:29.523 --> 00:00:32.990
&amp; the white folks crowded
the souvenir photo’s frame—

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.335
let his body blacken,

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.745
the extremities
shorn—

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:41.790
not shed,
but skimmed off

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.543
so close it can be shaving

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:46.170
almost.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:50.001
An ear
in a pocket, on a shelf,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.926
a warning where a book
could go.

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:56.180
So
I got there early.

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.850
See now, it was morning
a cold snap,

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.811
first frost
which comes even here

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:05.731
&amp; kills the worms
out the deer.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.228
You can
hunt him then

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:11.738
but we never did want,
after, no trophy

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:15.783
crowned down
from a wall, watching—

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.826
just a meal,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.288
what
we might make last till spring.

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.666
There are ways
of keeping a thing.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:29.713
Then there are ways
of leaving, &amp; also the one way.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.300
That
we didn’t want.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.593
I got there early.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.221
Luggage less sturdy
(cardboard,

00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:41.685
striped, black)
than my hat.

00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:46.146
Shoebox of what I shan’t say,
lunch on my lap.

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:49.108
The noise the rails made

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400
even before the train.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.905
A giant stomach growling.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.616
A bowed belly.

00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:00.286
I did
not pray.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.886
I got there
early.

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:07.126
It was not
no wish, but a way.
