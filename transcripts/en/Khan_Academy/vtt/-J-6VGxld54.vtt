00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.130
Charles built a
rectangular table

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:09.160
that has a perimeter of 20 feet
and an area of 24 square feet.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.870
The table is longer
than it is wide.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.650
What are the length
and width of the table?

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.190
The length and width
are whole numbers.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.790
So it's longer than it is wide.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.550
So let's draw this table here.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.470
So the table might
look something

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:33.190
like this-- where this dimension
right over here is the length.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.849
So this distance right
over here is the length.

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:38.390
We could also write
length here if we

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.250
want to show that
this is the same,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.880
these two sides have
the same length.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.530
And then we could call this
dimension right over here--

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.280
this is the width.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.600
And this is also, of
course, the width, as well.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.140
This is a rectangle.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.610
So these two sides are
going to be the same.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.950
Now, they tell us
that the perimeter

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.670
is 20 feet, which is
another way of saying

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:13.790
that the width plus the width
plus the length plus the length

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.085
is equal to 20.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.100
And they tell us that the
area is 24 square feet.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.900
That's another way of saying
that the width times the length

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.950
is going to be 24.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.540
So we could write that down.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:37.660
Width times the length is
going to be equal to 24.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.160
Now, there's a lot of ways
to solve this problem.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.130
And later on when you
learn more algebra,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.190
there's fancy algebraic
ways to do that.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.760
But we won't have
to resort to this.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.260
They tell us that the length
and width are whole numbers.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.634
So we really should just be
able to try out some numbers,

00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:53.760
because we know that the
width times the length is 24.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.760
So we just have try out
all of the whole numbers

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.220
that when I were to take
their product, I get to 24.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.290
Essentially, the
factors of 24, and then

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.750
figure out which of those
satisfy the perimeter up here.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.570
Where if I take the width plus
the width-- essentially 2 times

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.660
the width plus 2
times the length--

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.610
I am going to get to 20.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.290
So let's figure that out.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.450
So let me make two columns here.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.330
So one column, I'm going
to call it a width column.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.630
Another column I'm
going to call it length.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.650
And then I'm going to
write down the perimeter.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.080
I'll write perimeter.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.320
I'll just shorten it
with per-- maybe peri.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.960
I'll just write out the
whole word, perimeter.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.775
And then let's write out area.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.340
Actually, let's do all that-- I
could write it just like that.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.160
Let me try out--
make it a table here.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.170
So I have a table here.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.260
And then I can try things out.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.080
And what we can do is just make
sure that everything we try out

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.250
has an area of 24 square feet.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.450
So let's just think
about the factors of 24.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.690
Well, it could be 1 and 24.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.790
So this literally could be 1, a
width of 1, and a length of 24.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.430
1 times 24 is 24.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.472
And they tell us that the
length is longer than the width,

00:03:15.472 --> 00:03:17.180
that the table is
longer than it is wide.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.620
So we want the larger
number under length.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.570
So let's see, 1 times 24 is 24.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.520
But what is 1 plus
1 plus 24 plus 24?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.830
Well, that's going to be
2 plus 48, which is 50.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.360
So this doesn't
meet our condition

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.100
that the perimeter is 20.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.450
So let's cross that out.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.020
So this one right over
here does not work out.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.900
Let's try the other
factors of 24.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.040
It could be 2 and 12.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.380
Once again, 2 times 12 is 24.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.950
But what's 2 plus 2?

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.560
It's 4, plus 12 plus 12.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.250
So it's 4 plus 24.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.640
That's going to be 28.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.550
Well, that doesn't meet
our perimeter constraint.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.590
So we can-- that's
not going to be right.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.860
Well, what about-- let's see,
3 times 8 is also equal to 24.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.040
And what's 3 plus 3-- is
6, plus 8 plus 8 is 16.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.102
6 plus 16 is 22.

00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:15.810
Well, we're getting
close, but it's still

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.769
not a perimeter of 20.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.779
So that's not going to be right.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.760
Now, what about 4 and 6?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.560
Once again, 4 times 6 is 24.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.720
And what's 4 plus
4 plus 6 plus 6?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.170
Well, that's 8 plus 12,
which is indeed equal to 20.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.650
So that works out.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.900
Our width is going to be
4 feet, and our length

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.510
is going to be 6 feet.
