00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's make things interesting. Let's introduce some trigonometry into the equation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So here's Robin and you can tell by her determined face that she really wants to

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
push this cart through this brick wall and it seems like she is not having very much luck.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In this example, something is different from last time.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Robin isn't pushing exactly to the right or exactly to the left.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
She is pushing at some angle and let's call that angle here α.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm sure you can already see the triangles forming in your head. Let's take a look at what's going on.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Over here I'm going to draw a diagram for the cart, the force diagram.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Of course as always we have the carts weight playing downwards

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and noticed that I didn't even tell you what m was, you don't even care.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We have seen normal force pointing upwards. We know because the car isn't falling to the ground.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We have Robin who is pushing, well looks like she is pushing down into the right.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm actually going to put that force over here and let's label it FR for Robin,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and we can't forget that the wall is pushing to the left.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Of course if the wall weren't there the cart would be free to roll but since it is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and it's stopping the motion, the wall itself must be providing a force.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Let's call that FW for wall. Now when I look at this force diagram something jumps out to me.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I've got these forces which are both vertical.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The wall force which is exactly to the left and then the force of Robin pushing

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which is causing me some pain.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's not to the right. It's not straight down. It's some combination of right and down.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Wait a second though, I know how to handle this.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is just me breaking down the vector into it's components.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's make a right triangle with this would be the hypotenuse.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Well here's a right triangle and now we see we get our angle α back again and let's label these sides.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Well this is the horizontal component of Robin pushing and this is the vertical component.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm going to label them FRx and FRy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
One thing that's important to remember is that by writing FR

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
as these two together, we can now get rid of FR.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This is the exact same trick we did last unit

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
when we had some initial velocity and we have some angle alpha.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We broke that velocity into x and y components.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You are doing exact same thing but with forces and just like with velocity

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
once we have expressed it in terms of components x and y, we didn't care about this guy anymore.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Likewise, we're now using the x and y component of Robin's pushing

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and we're not going to think about this too much anymore.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But we still have to answer the question, "What are these values

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
for the x and y components of Robin's pushing?"

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Let me give you some numbers so that this is less abstract.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Let's say that the force Robin is pushing with is a 100 N total that's FR

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and this angle she's pushing at is 30°.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Can you use your knowledge of trig to tell me what is FRx and what is FRy?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Enter your answers here and here to one decimal place.

00:02:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I'll be very impress if you can get this right on your first try.
