[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.610
REBECCA MOORE: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.829
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:10.870
My name is Rebecca Moore.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.420
I'm Director of Google Earth.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.329
And I'm very pleased to welcome
my dear friend, Dr. Victoria

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.850
Sweet, who just published
a new book called, "Slow

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.240
Medicine, the Way to Healing."

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.880
I've known Victoria
for several decades,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.690
since nearly the start of
her journey as a physician,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.460
including her 20 years
practicing at Laguna Honda

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.630
Hospital in San
Francisco and taking time

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.190
to get her PhD in the
history of medicine.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.010
During this period, she's
been on the front lines

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.860
of dramatic change
in her profession,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.800
as practicing medicine
has transformed

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.880
into delivering health care,
and not always for the better.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.610
Her first book, "God's
Hotel," won widespread awards

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.730
and acclaim, leading to
a Guggenheim Fellowship.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.640
And the time-- pay attention to
that word because you will hear

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.990
it today a lot--

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.710
the time for her to synthesize
and develop her ideas further,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.130
around what she calls slow
medicine and fast medicine

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.850
and how these two approaches
are both complementary and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.590
necessary.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.260
Googlers will
particularly appreciate

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.990
that Victoria got her
undergraduate degree

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.075
in mathematics from Stanford.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:25.130
Go Stanford.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.259
So please join me in
welcoming Dr. Victoria Sweet.

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.012
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:30.095
VICTORIA SWEET: Thank you.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.650
Thank you very much, Rebecca,
for that introduction.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.630
Thank you all for
being here today.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.280
And thanks to Google for
doing something this--

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.040
really unusual for a
big for-profit company

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.650
to be willing to sponsor
books and speeches by authors.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.180
It's a really wonderful
thing, and special I think.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.980
It tells a lot about Google.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.519
I would like to
add that not only

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:01.060
did I get my mathematics degree
at Stanford, it was my major.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.400
But my minor was classics.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.790
And that is a stream, as two
things have woven their way

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.560
through my life.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.230
So what I would like
to do this afternoon--

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.510
I'll speak for about 40 minutes.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.374
And I'll be explaining kind of
how I actually got right here.

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:21.790
That's the first
part of the talk.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.570
And the second
part of the talk, I

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.520
want to talk about
what's gone on

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.870
with medicine during my
career and what I think

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.860
we can do to make it better.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.370
So I'm going to start with my--

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.440
yes.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.690
So the first thing you
should know about me

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.380
is that I don't consider
myself a natural-born doctor.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.100
And by that I mean Growing up
I never watched doctor shows

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.370
or went to volunteer
in a hospital.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.820
And if somebody was sick, I
didn't want to hear about it

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.570
or have anything to do with it.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.986
And, in fact, the
first time I had

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:01.040
to draw blood in medical
school, I passed out.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.990
So definitely not a
natural-born doctor.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.292
What happened was at
the end of college,

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:07.250
I was looking for a way
to synthesize these two

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.410
parts of myself, the
mathematics, the classics,

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.960
the history, the humanities,
and the sciences.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.010
And I ran into the writings of
Carl Jung, the psychiatrist.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.470
He'd written a memoir
called "Memories, Dreams

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.760
and Reflections."

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.940
And I ran into it by
accident in the library.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.610
And I found myself enthralled.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.010
I was enthralled, first
of all, by the meaning

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.550
he expected from his own life
and also by the kind of life

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.890
he set up for himself.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.060
This is a stone house he had
built himself on Lake Zurich.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.950
And this is where he saw
patients in the morning,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.810
neurotic, well-paying
patients in the morning,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.570
and illuminated manuscripts
and studied alchemy

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.890
in the afternoon.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.304
I thought this was a great life.

00:03:50.304 --> 00:03:52.220
And that's what I wanted
to do when I grew up.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.803
And that's how I got
to medical school

00:03:53.803 --> 00:03:57.140
because I was going to
be a union psychiatrist.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.180
Then it turned out I
liked medical school

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.930
a lot more than I thought I
would, especially the last two

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.120
years of medical school,
when you finally get

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.850
a chance to see real patients.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.670
I loved what's
called the work-up.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.660
I loved the history,
taking the history,

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.330
trying to figure out the
patient's story because there

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.700
was so much psychology to it.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.839
Hearing what the patient said
and didn't say, seeing what--

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.820
the way he said or she said,
the answer to the question.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.480
And then I was
examining the patient.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.760
And it turns out I actually
liked touching people.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.050
I particularly liked
the physical exam

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.660
because there was
so much I could

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.110
learn from that about what the
patient had and didn't have.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.180
And then there was
putting it all together

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.640
in a diagnosis, and the
treatment, and the plan.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.610
It was a logical,
brilliant method.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.800
Nevertheless, I
continued my first idea.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.810
And I went into a
psychiatric residency.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.180
And I was a little bit naive.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.730
So my psychiatric
residency took place

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.180
in the only locked psychiatric
ward in our county.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.670
So consequently, the
patients were not

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.970
Jung's well-paying, neurotic,
articulate patients.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.310
They were severely psychotic.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.780
And they responded a lot
more to the, um, medicines

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.006
we used than they did to
the talk therapy I tried.

00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:15.630
So after I got my license, after
that first year of internship,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.080
I just went out and practiced
medicine for several years

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.530
in various clinics.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.524
And it was fascinating.

00:05:22.524 --> 00:05:24.690
Because the county clinics
and the community clinics

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.570
would get waves of
immigrants every time

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.760
there was a war
or a rumor of war.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.700
And they would bring with
them their diseases and also

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.584
their different way of
looking at the body.

00:05:36.584 --> 00:05:38.000
I saw everything
in those clinics.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.510
I saw three cases of leprosy.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.350
And this is right around
here, when I did this.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.450
I saw most every
parasite there was

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.299
and saw many unusual diseases.

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:51.340
And I was also interested
in these different ways

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.298
of looking at the body.

00:05:52.298 --> 00:05:55.454
And so after a while, I
decided that I might as well

00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:56.620
admit that I liked medicine.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.434
I went back and did three years
of a regular medical residency.

00:06:00.434 --> 00:06:02.350
And then I went back to
the community clinics.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.530
And the longer I practiced
medicine, the more impressed

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.350
I was by the logical
method of writing out

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.600
a diagnosis and a treatment.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.640
But I was also more
and more impressed

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.200
by what this medicine, modern
medicine, left out, which was,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.840
of course, anything
that wasn't logical.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.280
So after a while, I started
reading alternative medicines,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.570
naturopathy, homeopathy,
Chinese medicine,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.590
and Ayurvedic medicine.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.190
And for a while, I even
thought about learning Chinese,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.530
so I could understand
Chinese medicine

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.780
from the inside;
or Sanskrit, so I

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.480
could understand Indian
medicine from the inside.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.030
But eventually, I
decided that even

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.640
if I did get to that point,
that I could understand them,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.250
their cultures were still
too different from my own

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.310
to understand their different
ways of looking at the body.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.790
It was this rather
discouraging moment

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:00.501
that I discovered the writings
of a very unusual 12th century

00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:01.000
woman.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.990
Her name was Hildegard of
Bingen. And she was a mystic.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.390
She was a composer.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.130
She was an artist.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.570
She was a theologian.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.660
But she also, as it turned out,
was a medical practitioner.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.400
And she'd written a
book on her medicine.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.630
And as I stood there and read
her book, in the library again,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.100
I was impressed by the medicine
that she was recounting.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.000
Because it wasn't the medieval
medicine I'd expected,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.190
the tongue of newt,
eye of frog medicine I

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.120
expected from a
medieval medical text.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.890
It was real medicine,
for real patients,

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.320
with real diseases
I could recognize.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.530
But it was based on a completely
different model of the body

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.530
from our modern medical model.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.772
I couldn't quite put my finger
on how it was different.

00:07:47.772 --> 00:07:49.230
But I decided then
and there that I

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.813
was going to go back
to school and get

00:07:50.813 --> 00:07:54.530
a PhD in medical history,
with Hildegard as my focus.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.040
But I didn't want to
stop practicing medicine.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.640
I wanted to do this half-time.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.550
And I spent a couple of
months looking around

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.150
for a half-time
position, which was

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.650
rather difficult at the time.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.030
Until finally I discovered--

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.240
I was offered a position
at a very unusual hospital

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.150
in San Francisco, which
was called Laguna Honda

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.684
Hospital, in San Francisco.

00:08:13.684 --> 00:08:15.350
And when I drove over
for the first time

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.660
and saw it high on that
hill, I was taken aback.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.130
This was about 20 years ago now.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.080
It looked like a
medieval monastery.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.310
It had red-tiled roofs,
and cream-colored walls,

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.340
and a turret, and a bell tower,
where patients, it turned out,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.480
used to go up and smoke.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.904
And I went on my interview.

00:08:35.904 --> 00:08:37.570
And the medical
director took me around.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.880
I had never seen a
hospital like this.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.540
It was on 62 acres of land in
the middle of San Francisco.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.350
It had 1,200 patients.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.220
It had enormous grounds.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.650
The patients all
got taken care of on

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.620
these old-fashioned
wards, those open wards

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.740
you see in the old
movies from the 1930s.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.570
It had an X-ray
department where we

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.430
could take our own
X-rays and a lab

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.180
with a microscope where we
could look at our own slides.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.780
It had a chapel, a
little small chapel,

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.370
that was run by the county.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.580
It had a chapel that actually
looked more like a church,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:21.210
with stained glass windows,
and polished wooden pews,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.180
and very politically incorrect
stations of the cross

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.080
along the walls.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.972
And then we went out.

00:09:26.972 --> 00:09:28.930
And the medical director
showed me the grounds,

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.070
which were enormous.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.010
There was an aviary,
so that patients could

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.380
watch chickens hatch from eggs.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.670
There was a green house, so
that patients could pop plants.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.310
And there was even a
barnyard, so the patients

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.590
could see animals, even
if they were bed-bound.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.440
Then we walked
back to her office

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.240
and she offered me the job.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.920
Well, I didn't know.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.580
I wasn't sure.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.906
I had never seen a place
like that before in my life.

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:57.280
But it was only place that
would let me practice medicine

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:57.779
part-time.

00:09:57.779 --> 00:10:00.280
So I said I would
stay for two months.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.750
And I ended up
staying for 20 years.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.750
Because it turned out to be a
fascinating place to practice.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.580
And that was for
one specific reason.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.670
It had originally been called
the San Francisco Almshouse.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.810
This was the first rendition
of Laguna Honda in the 1860s.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.779
And the almshouse
was actually how

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:18.320
we used to take care
of the sick poor

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.090
before there was
health insurance.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.580
We had a way of taking
care of the sick poor.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.520
And that was this system
that was the big, old county

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.670
hospital, where anybody could
show up and get taken care of.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.640
And then if they needed
more care than that,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.750
we had someplace to send them.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.390
So this is where,
in the old days,

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.180
we could send people
who were mentally ill,

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.390
who needed more care, who
were unemployed, who'd

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.590
just been let out of prison.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.570
We actually had a system.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.660
And Laguna Honda was the
San Francisco Almshouse.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.310
And it's how I got the title for
my last book because this is--

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.840
the system that we have
came from France, and Europe

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.710
in general.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.530
And in French, the word for
almshouse is hotel-dieu.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.270
It's God's hotel.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.478
So that's how I got the name.

00:11:03.478 --> 00:11:05.480
And the reason I ended
up staying so long

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.990
is because typically
the almshouse

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:13.310
would get the bottom
1/10 of 1% of patients.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.700
So my patients were all
three standard deviations

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.970
from the mean, any mean.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.460
They were the tallest and
they were the shortest.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.440
They were the fattest and
they were the thinnest.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.920
They were the oldest, and
the youngest, and the nicest,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.010
and the meanest of any
patients I ever had.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.870
And, because the
whole catchment area

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:37.880
was San Francisco at the
time, with 600,000 people,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.220
if a disease would occur in
one in a hundred thousand,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.540
I'd see a couple.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.940
So it was a fascinating
place medically.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.770
I just went through
the rare diseases

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.480
in Harrison's
textbook of medicine

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.310
and checked them off
as they would come up.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.230
So it was a fascinating
place to practice.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.370
And I ended up
staying for 20 years.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.200
But it also a wonderful place
to practice because health care

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.900
efficiency had not yet arrived.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.080
We were over the hill to
the poorhouse literally.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.120
And people kind
of left us alone.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.729
I mean, we had
standards and things.

00:12:06.729 --> 00:12:08.270
People paid attention
to what we did.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.370
But mostly, I had something
that doctors today mostly

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:11.870
don't have.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.260
And that is the time to
take care of my patients,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.464
to properly examine
them, to figure out

00:12:18.464 --> 00:12:19.880
what was actually
wrong with them,

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.120
to get the right diagnosis
and the right treatment.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.310
And the longer I was
there, the more impressed I

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.690
was by not only how, um--

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:34.240
how satisfying that
was for me as a doc,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.570
but how efficient it was, even
from a health care efficiency

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.380
point of view.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.730
And I'll give you an example.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.190
The typical patient
at Laguna Honda

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:49.040
would arrive on between 15 and
26 medications, of which they

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.870
only needed about four or five.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.480
But no other doctor had had the
time to go through the chart,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.890
go through the patient, figure
out whether they actually

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.810
needed that medicine,
maybe even try

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.530
taking them off that
medication to see how they did.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.910
I found that most
of the patients

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.868
could be handled very
well on five medications.

00:13:08.868 --> 00:13:11.650
So I was taking them off between
10 and 15 medications, which,

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.230
if you figure it
out economically,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.320
is incredibly cost effective
for the extra few hours of time

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.450
it took me.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.840
So I was quite happy there.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.446
And then meanwhile-- of course,
I'd gone back to study--

00:13:24.446 --> 00:13:29.810
so this is actually what I call
the efficiency of inefficiency.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.970
Meanwhile, I'd gone back,
as I had decided to do,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.450
to get my PhD in medical
history with Hildegard of Bingen

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.310
as my focus.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:41.120
And what I decided to
do was to really learn

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.210
Hildegard's medicine as
if I were its student,

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.470
by reading her medical text
in its original language

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.010
and by understanding what
people were doing around her.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.060
So I took classes and
learned Latin because she

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:56.686
wrote in Latin.

00:13:56.686 --> 00:13:58.976
And I learned medieval Latin
because she wrote actually

00:13:58.976 --> 00:13:59.780
in medieval Latin.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.850
I learned medieval
German and German

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.190
because that's what the
secondary literature was in.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.520
And learned paleography
and codicology,

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.690
so I could actually read
the handwritten texts

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.360
which they had back then.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.290
And I also experimented.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.800
Because I figured if I'd been
her student in the Middle Ages,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.800
I'd sort of have a sense of
using her different recipes

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.030
and prescriptions.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.880
So I planted a
medieval herb garden.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.840
And I brewed up some of
her potions and syrups.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.360
I tried her medicinal beers.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.380
And I baked some of her
anti-depressant cookies.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.960
And what I found over
time, I got more and more

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.200
interested in the difference
between Hildegard's model

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.900
of the body and our
model of the body

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.250
because they were
clearly very different.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.270
Our model of the body is
fundamentally based on the idea

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:51.860
that the body is a machine
and the doctor is a mechanic,

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.840
looking for what's broken
and trying to fix it, repair

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.370
it, or replace it.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.380
Hildegard's model
was very different,

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.110
I gradually learned
over the years.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.800
Hildegard's model was much
more of the body as a plant,

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.380
rather than as a machine,
and the doctor more

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.800
like a gardener,
than a mechanic.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.520
What's the difference?

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.980
The difference is that someone
has to fix a broken machine.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.210
But a plant can heal itself.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:27.910
And Hildegard had a name
for the power of a plant

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.940
to heal itself.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.740
She called it "viriditas,"
from the Latin "viridis,"

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.150
that means green.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.700
So it was the greening
power of a plant

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.000
to grow, to produce seeds,
and to repair itself up when

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.440
it was injured.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.730
And she believed that human
beings also have this power.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.710
And that the job
of the doctor was

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.280
more to remove what was in the
way of the patient's viriditas

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.230
and to support it
with the basics,

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.350
than to do something
to the patient.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:57.964
So this was a very
interesting model.

00:15:57.964 --> 00:15:59.380
And it took me
years to understand

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.545
how to apply it to the
patients I had at Laguna Honda.

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:06.490
But gradually, I began to
see that not only could I

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:10.420
help a patient by figuring out
what diagnosis they actually

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.550
had, but once I
had the diagnosis,

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.880
to step back and see what
was in the way of viriditas

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.860
and what could I
do to support it.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.930
The longer I practiced
medicine at Laguna Honda,

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.260
the more I realized that
this was a very helpful way

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.090
of looking at patients.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.480
And I began to think of it
as sort of the slow medicine,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.240
as opposed to the fast
medicine I also used,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.250
which was so effective for
what I consider fast diseases.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.670
So, for instance, if
you come to the hospital

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.730
because you have appendicitis
and you need an appendectomy,

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.790
or you come to the hospital, and
you are having a heart attack

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.910
and you need an angioplasty,
or even if you have cancer,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.120
this is when, what I would
call by contrast, fast medicine

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.390
or modern medicine, based on the
model of the body as a machine,

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.420
works great.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.590
But after your appendectomy,
and after your angioplasty,

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.960
and after your
chemotherapy, this

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.099
is when modern medicine, with
this idea of coming in, fixing

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.210
what's broken, falls down.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.240
And what I learned
at Laguna Honda is,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.000
when I used both models
together, first fast and then

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.349
slow medicine, the
patients did the best.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.000
They did remarkably well.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Many of them were
actually able to go home,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.060
sort of unexpectedly.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.020
And during the 20 years
I practiced medicine,

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.140
while I was practicing
medicine at Laguna Honda,

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.510
we eventually got discovered
and our halcyon days

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.690
of having enough time
began to disappear.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.840
And, first by health
care efficiency experts,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.540
who showed up one day,
walking through the place

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.160
and horrified to discover the
aviary, and the greenhouse,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.470
and particularly the open wards.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.210
And the Department
of Justice finally,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.150
eventually, showed up
and told Laguna Honda

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.060
that they were going to have to
tear the place down and rebuild

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.560
a new health care facility,
that had private rooms for all

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.650
of the patients,
rather than keep

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.740
the patients on the open wards.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.950
And at that point, I decided
to take some time off and write

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.960
a book about what
I'd seen there.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.460
That was my first book.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.270
And also to think about
what I had seen so far

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.077
in my life as a physician.

00:18:17.077 --> 00:18:18.660
It seemed to me,
when I thought about,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.685
that in my life as a physician,
the pendulum of health care

00:18:23.685 --> 00:18:28.160
had swung from the
personal to the efficient.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.570
And I have been more and
more impressed by what

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.990
that leaves out.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.460
So, for instance, the results
of the kind of health care

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.010
efficiency we've had over the
last 20 years, as you can see,

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.200
is that health care
costs have kept

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.330
rising no matter what
health care economists have

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.454
tried to do.

00:18:45.454 --> 00:18:47.120
They've tried to do
all kinds of schemes

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.290
for getting a hold
of health care.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.248
And this is not true just
in the United States,

00:18:50.248 --> 00:18:51.670
but across the world.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.260
Health care costs keep
rising every year,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.430
despite DRGs and HMOs, and
managed health care systems,

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.240
everything we've tried.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.970
Trying to understand
what was going

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.760
on in the system as a whole, I
decided to look at Laguna Honda

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.980
specifically and
ask myself, what

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.460
had gone on there in
the last 20 years?

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.810
So I figured out that
in the last 20 years,

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.420
as a cost-cutting measure,
the patients we had,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:21.602
had gone from about
1,178 down to 780.

00:19:21.602 --> 00:19:23.060
This was as a
cost-cutting measure.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.330
So we were taking care
of a lot fewer patients.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.930
Of course,
correspondingly, the number

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:33.860
of doctors we had went down,
was cut, from 32, to nine.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.740
And, correspondingly
also, the clinical staff,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.140
that's the nurses,
and the therapists,

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:44.180
and the social workers, was also
cut as a cost-cutting measure,

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.840
from about 15,000, to 1,200.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:55.020
And yet, at Laguna Honda, every
year the budget has increased.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.590
So I asked myself, well,
what counted for that?

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.530
And I realized that even
though the patients were fewer,

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.660
and the doctors were
considerably fewer,

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.160
and the clinical
staff had been cut,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.450
the total staff was
actually the same.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.680
There were more and more
administrators every year.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.450
What did all those
administrators

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.730
do, I asked myself?

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.940
Well, what I realized was
that, when I thought about it,

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.980
that the one thing we
had more of at Laguna

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.150
Honda at the end of my time
there, than at the beginning

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.640
of the time, were forms.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.340
So when I first got there,
we had paper charts.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.020
And we had two single-page
forms in the chart.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.100
And the day before
I left Laguna Honda,

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.725
I pulled out one of the
paper charts just randomly.

00:20:40.725 --> 00:20:42.100
And I started
looking through it.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.940
And I counted how
many forms that were.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.090
There were 43 forms
in that chart.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.070
And none of them were
single-page forms.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.290
They were 10 page, 20 page.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.390
There were so many
forms that the charts

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.160
would explode from the forms.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.860
And medical records
had to show up and thin

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.460
out the doctors' notes.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.230
And this, to sort
of clarify things,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.420
because I do have somewhat
of a mathematical mind,

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.955
I created this chart at the time
when I was figuring this out.

00:21:11.955 --> 00:21:13.260
OK, now this is working.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.790
So this is a chart I created
at the time on a napkin,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.950
as Becca pointed
out the other day.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.216
So these are the
patients, going down.

00:21:20.216 --> 00:21:22.240
I was trying to
understand this system.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.470
There are the
doctors, going down.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:30.800
There's the budget going up, the
clinical staff, the total staff

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.220
staying about the same.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.456
And this is the number of forms.

00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:39.930
And what I realized is, is that
if current trends continued,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.930
by 2024 there would be no
patients at Laguna Honda.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.810
There would be two doctors.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:51.990
There would be a staff of
1,400, a budget of $275 million,

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.800
and an infinite number of forms.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:01.530
And I began to think of this
as doing less with more.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.599
And the thing that's interesting
about it is-- and crucial

00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:06.390
about it-- is exactly
the same as the thing

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.800
that's been happening in
the country as a whole.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.260
Let me show you what I mean.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.850
So this is the
country as a whole.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.766
So if you look at the
growth of its physicians

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:17.527
and administrators,
here's what you find.

00:22:17.527 --> 00:22:19.360
So I'll interpret this
a little bit for you.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.240
These are the number of
docs, percentage growth.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.410
So it's about doubled.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.590
So the docs have about doubled,
in tandem with the population

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.770
has about doubled.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.170
So there's about the same
number of docs per patient,

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.890
and vice versa, as
there always have been.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.450
The yellow is a number
of administrators.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.977
There are 35 times as
many administrators

00:22:39.977 --> 00:22:40.810
as there used to be.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.290
And as you can see,
just like Laguna Honda,

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:50.780
the budget has continued
to go up every year.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.670
And what do all those docs do?

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.840
What do all these
administrators do, I should say?

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.260
Well, this just is interesting.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.670
This is HHS paperwork.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.530
Really, they should
say electronic computer

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:04.370
work, in millions of
hours, millions of hours.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:06.980
Just in the last 10
years, it has doubled.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.390
From 350 million
hours, it has doubled

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.470
to almost 700 million hours.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.375
Why?

00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:20.230
Well, what's happened is,
is that because of all

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.410
this paperwork that the
administrators have generated

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.166
for various reasons,
we've ended up

00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:28.540
in a situation where your
doctor doesn't have enough time

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.540
to look at patients anymore.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.109
This is a sentence I've
heard over and over again

00:23:34.109 --> 00:23:36.400
over the last five years as
I've gone around and spoken

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.300
about the book.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.002
And I put it--

00:23:38.002 --> 00:23:40.210
I don't know if you can see
when you're sitting here.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.282
But this was a rather
scandalous drawing

00:23:43.282 --> 00:23:45.490
that appeared in the "Journal
of the American Medical

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.710
Association" a few years ago.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.000
A doc had it published.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.750
It was a mother who
brought it to him.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.560
It was a drawing by her
five-year-old daughter,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.150
about my visit to the doctor.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.020
And you can't see it too well.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.980
But this is the daughter
sitting on the exam table.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.200
Behind it is the mom, holding
a little baby, and a friend,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:07.940
I believe.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.810
And this is the doctor, who
is looking at the computer.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.740
This is where we're
spending our time.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.110
And from experience, in
general, and experience,

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.840
particularly at Laguna
Honda, I believe

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.506
in or to have a good
health care system,

00:24:21.506 --> 00:24:23.710
we actually need to
put inefficiency,

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:28.720
that is unregulated free time
for the doctors and the nurses

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.520
to have the time to
look at their patients

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.620
and to get off the computer.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.180
And the question then becomes,
how can we get that time back?

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.540
Because, as you've just seen,
we have actually the same number

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.880
of doctors and patients
as we've always had.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.100
But the doctors are
spending a bunch of time,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.180
not with the patients.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.550
So that the patient doesn't
feel looked at anymore

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.870
and isn't looked at anymore.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.350
So when I was thinking about
this, trying a figure out, OK,

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.060
so how could we get the time
back, I asked myself, well,

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.620
what do we spend our time on?

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.220
And, in a way, time is the
viriditas of health care.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.980
So I can do a
viriditas analysis,

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.177
and ask myself, well, what is
in the way of doctors having

00:25:07.177 --> 00:25:08.260
enough time with patients?

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.020
What do doctors
spend their time on?

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.520
So I came up with three
fundamental things

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.400
doctors spend their time
on, forms; what I call fast

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.460
administration, as opposed
to slow administration;

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.230
and lousy electronic
health records.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.690
By forms, I mean this
whole contraption

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.500
that has come upon us with
electronic health records

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.870
and administration, screens,
logins, alerts, e-mails,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.090
script, that are based
on this whole idea

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.730
that if it's not documented,
it didn't happen.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.540
And if it is documented,
it did happen.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.270
And we can talk
about that a bit.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.320
And second, what I'm thinking of
as fast administration, which I

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.150
consider a problem with style.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:56.910
This idea by administrators,
that if they come up

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.370
with a form, they're done.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.640
If they come up with a paradigm,
a script for us to follow,

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.360
the problem was solved.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.160
And last, and really
mainly, the easiest thing

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.890
to fix, to get doctors back
their time, electronic health

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.120
records, that take all our time.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.120
And this is what I'd like
to sort of zero in now

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.770
on for little bit, about the
problem with electronic health

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:26.030
records and how I think we
can actually get doctors

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.650
back some of our
time with patients,

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.050
some of our free time, some
of our inefficient time.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.008
So we can sit down with
patients, look at them,

00:26:32.008 --> 00:26:33.140
and actually examine them.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.450
So what's happened in
the past about 10 years

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.010
is electronic health records.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.980
We used to use the paper charts.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.870
The biggest flaw
with paper charts

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.251
was that, if you went
to the emergency room

00:26:45.251 --> 00:26:47.750
and nothing happened, and then
you came back to your doctor,

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.250
they couldn't tell you what--
nobody knew what was going on.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.879
We had to get them to
send us, to Xerox things,

00:26:52.879 --> 00:26:53.670
and send the paper.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.960
So more than about 10
years ago, what they did

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.050
is that if we had electronic
health records on the computer,

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.840
and you went to the emergency
room and had something done,

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.540
it would magically appear
in your doctor's office,

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.340
on the doctor's computer.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.110
And so that's kind
of was the way

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:13.280
that electronic health
records were envisioned.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.570
But that's not what happened.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.570
Because there's so
much money in health

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.100
care these days, and so much
money in electronic health

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.630
records, at this point,
the last time I checked,

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.950
there were 1,100 for-profit
electronic health record

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.150
companies.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:29.400
And they're engineered to that
they don't talk to each other.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.920
So it's actually even
worse than it used to be.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.960
So how bad is it?

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.494
Well, doctors have ended up--

00:27:37.494 --> 00:27:39.410
so first of all, the
electronic health records

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.240
haven't done what
they should have done.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.250
But, in addition,
they've been used

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:47.810
to acquire big data for the
pharmaceuticals, marketing,

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:48.504
and advertising.

00:27:48.504 --> 00:27:50.670
And the doctor has been
right in the middle of that.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.211
The doctor has been plumped in
front of the electronic health

00:27:53.211 --> 00:27:56.990
records, which are
based on a model of--

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:01.460
based on an old billing model,
that comes back from the 1970s

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.660
and is incredibly clumsy.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.810
So clumsy that in
a Stanford study,

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.750
doctors were
actually spending 70%

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.120
of their time on the computer.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.320
But in a more sort
of shocking study,

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.122
Kaiser got tired of hearing
how whiny their doctors were

00:28:20.122 --> 00:28:22.080
about how much time they
spent on the computer.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.960
So they actually decided
to see how much time

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.540
do our doctors spend
on the computer.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.300
And they picked two hospitals.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.640
And they spent two months
actually keeping track

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.190
of all the stroke doctor--

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.771
all the keystrokes.

00:28:35.771 --> 00:28:37.270
And then they added
all that time up

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:39.020
and they divided by
the number of doctors.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.209
This was in two separate
hospitals over two months.

00:28:41.209 --> 00:28:42.750
And they discovered
that the doctors,

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.980
out of an eight-hour
day, were spending

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.820
10 hours on the computer.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.910
So this is where
our time is going.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.700
And we could get it back
if we had electronic health

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.100
records that only
took as much time

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.460
as the paper records,
which would take about 15%

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.360
of their time.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.780
So in a 15-minute visit, they'd
take 2 and 1/2 minutes of time,

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:11.600
rather than taking more than 15
minutes of that 15-minute time.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.640
We can get the doctors
off the computer,

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.200
back to doing the
kind of care that I

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.021
was able to give at Laguna
Honda, where we can actually

00:29:18.021 --> 00:29:20.020
get the right diagnosis
and the right treatment.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.400
So that's actually what
I'm focusing on now

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.390
and one of the reasons
I wanted to speak up

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.090
to this particular audience.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.640
Because I think
it's very possible

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.236
to create an electronic
health record that's simple,

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:33.610
that's cheap, that takes,
like, 2 and 1/2 minutes instead

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:37.400
of 15 minutes, and that
everybody could use

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.350
and would want to use.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:44.060
So some of my rather larger
ideas for getting control

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.360
would be to have the
opposite of the three things

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.990
I had before about what
we spend our time on.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.640
So we could start
in terms of forms,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.580
with a law for the
conservation of forms.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.415
So my experience is that we
have enough forms already

00:29:58.415 --> 00:30:00.400
and that we don't
need any new forms.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.690
And I think in most
hospital situations,

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.330
that when an administrator
comes up with a new form,

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.670
they should find at least
one form of equal length

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:10.190
to get rid of.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.440
Second of all, slow
administration.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.350
I think that if administrators
would think and would

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.810
realize that every time
they send an email,

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:20.630
organize a meeting, or
come up with a new form,

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:25.200
they are directly taking
time away from the doc.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.080
And last, we need the
electronic health record

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.280
that preserves story.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.500
Because the problem with
electronic health records

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.950
based on the billing platform--

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:34.950
I don't know if anybody
here has ever seen them.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.340
But they make it
literally impossible

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.720
to understand what's actually
gone on with your patient.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.670
And the last thing
that I think we

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.680
need to do in our
health care system

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.220
is to also start some
experiments with being slow.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.310
And some of the ideas
I've come up with for that

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.690
is to just, in the
hospital situation,

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.020
to have a slow
medicine clinic, where

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.580
the doctor would
get as much time

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.400
as they needed with patients.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.900
It's a novel idea.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.650
Slow medicine beds,
so that we had

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.320
a few beds in the hospital where
patients could be admitted when

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.680
they needed a work-up,
instead of getting piecemeal,

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.710
being sent all over
town when they get sick.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.350
And finally, a slow
medicine consult service.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.170
That would be the equivalent
of an oncology consult service

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.066
or a cardiology consult service.

00:31:22.066 --> 00:31:24.190
But it would be for slow
medicine, for the patients

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.800
that we end up as doctors
getting in the hospital, that

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.690
are so sick and complicated.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.940
And we know we cannot figure
out what's going on with them

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.190
and we have to discharge them.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.890
Instead, we call it the slow
medicine consult service.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.480
And have them arrive, and
figure the patient out.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.650
Because in the end, I'm
not a complete pessimist

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.400
about health care.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.570
I'm a pessimist and an optimist.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.450
I think that health care is--

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.470
with health care, the glass
is half full and half empty,

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:51.760
in this way.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.480
That, in a lot of ways,
we've done a fantastic job

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.410
with fast medicine.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.380
That this model of
the body as a machine

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:04.120
and the doctors as a mechanic
has been incredibly powerful.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.790
If you look at what's happened
over the last 150 years

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.530
in medical history,
nobody would ever

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:13.630
want to go back to
practicing medicine

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.010
the way we did even
20 or 30 years ago.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.340
But on our way to fast
medicine, this idea

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.080
that doctors would
have enough time

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.810
to get the right diagnosis,
to examine the patient,

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.630
to get the right treatment
has sort of disappeared.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:30.670
And I think we need to go back
and reinstitute this second way

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.670
of looking at a patient.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.660
For more on my book, which
some of you have, and last,

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.309
I always like to remember who,
in the end, won that race.

00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:42.850
So thank you very
much for your time.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:48.370
We'll have some
questions and answers.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:49.794
REBECCA MOORE: Thank you.

00:32:49.794 --> 00:32:54.550
We do have a Q&amp;A. I do have
a question to start with.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:57.760
But people, please think
of questions for Dr. Sweet.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.440
So you're here at Google.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.850
And a big focus for us now
is machine learning and AI,

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:08.110
which is being applied to
all facets of human endeavor

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:12.490
and actually creating
a lot of breakthroughs.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.840
Do you have any thoughts on how
machine learning and AI could,

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.470
in fact, play a role
in solving this problem

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.870
with electronic medical
health records, that

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:27.160
lose the story, doctors spending
too much time as data entry

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.180
clerks?

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.506
Your thoughts on that.

00:33:29.506 --> 00:33:30.630
VICTORIA SWEET: Yeah, I do.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.350
So that's really the
issue of the hour.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.240
There's 1,100 different
electronic health records

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:34.740
systems.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.580
But they all look
exactly the same.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.500
They're all
fundamentally the same.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:43.270
And they all lose the story.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.270
They're little bits
of information.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.200
They're boxes, that the
docs have filled out.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.640
The old paper charts
were basically books.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.080
They were basically books.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.960
And they preserved the
story of the patient.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.850
They were books
because they had pages.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:59.270
And they went through time.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.540
They had a beginning,
and a middle, and an end.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.870
And this was incredibly useful
as a doc because you could

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.450
go through and you could read
about how the patient first

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.100
came in, and the
things that were done,

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.230
and what the nurse thought,
and what the social worker did,

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.020
what meds they were
on, and what labs.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.374
It was very useful
for serving the story.

00:34:16.374 --> 00:34:18.790
And then what happened when
electronic health records came

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.345
in, because they were built
on this piddling platform,

00:34:21.345 --> 00:34:22.719
electronic health
records that we

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:24.880
look at today, what the
doctors are all looking at,

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.230
is a screen.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:30.100
And it's a screen with boxes,
and alerts, and logins.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.889
So the doc is sitting
there, logging things in.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.870
Pharmacy has got a
whole different section.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:36.230
Nursing has a different section.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.659
And these are all little boxes.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:41.230
And you cannot figure out from
the electronic health records

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.840
what's gone wrong
with the person.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.630
I know this because
my own father got sick

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.489
a couple of years
ago and was admitted

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:51.739
to a hospital with
the wrong diagnosis.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.489
And this particular
hospital, at the time,

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:55.199
the doctors and
nurses were actually

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.870
reading "God's Hotel"
in their book club.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.910
So I was a bit of a VIP.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:04.830
Nevertheless, I could
not get those docs

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.540
to change his diagnosis.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.950
They thought he'd had a stroke.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.075
But he hadn't had a stroke.

00:35:09.075 --> 00:35:09.925
He'd had a seizure.

00:35:09.925 --> 00:35:11.300
And he had a
history of seizures.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.750
We all knew he had seizures.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:14.610
I couldn't get them to focus.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:18.600
They even tried to
change the diagnosis

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.010
in the electronic health record.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.300
But they couldn't change it.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.150
So every time a new shift of
doctors and nurses came down,

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.390
they continued to treat
my dad with the treatment

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.300
for a stroke.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.540
And eventually, he was on so
much medicine, the medicine

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.004
for the stroke,
and then medicine

00:35:34.004 --> 00:35:36.170
for the side effects of the
medicine for the stroke,

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.760
and the medicine for
the blood pressure, kind

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.710
of this sort of thing,
that he was clearly

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.410
going to die in the hospital.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.060
So I was rather
worried about him.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.310
And I realized the only way
I could really get him out

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.160
of the hospital was to convince
the doctors that we thought--

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.250
we had decided he was a
hospice-level patient.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.020
And we were wanting
to just let him die.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.440
So once they accepted that,
they let us take him home.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.020
And I took him off all the
medicines that he was on.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.170
And he had his 95th birthday
about two months ago

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.820
and cut his own cake
with a very large knife.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.770
I mean, he did it on purpose.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:14.010
So I thought perhaps I'd
missed something because I

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.010
couldn't-- there was no
chart for me to look at.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.250
And I was worried, well,
maybe he did have a stroke.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.590
I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.980
So I asked for those
electronic health

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:26.210
records, his electronic
records, from 10 days.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:27.590
And I got them.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.170
And it was amazing.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.870
It took me four hours to
go through those electronic

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.250
records of my dad's.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.100
There were 810 pages.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.590
I had two questions I
was trying to answer.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:41.560
What medications was he
on at any particular time?

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.000
And why had they made
that diagnosis of stroke?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.710
And I could not figure it out.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.940
I couldn't figure out anything.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.390
It was just page after page of--

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.520
it was just-- there was no way.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.510
And I spent four hours.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.926
And I knew what I
was looking for.

00:36:56.926 --> 00:36:58.510
So nobody who came
to see him, when

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.280
they looked at those
electronic records,

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.340
could possibly have figured
out what was wrong with him.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:07.360
So when you compare these
beautiful old-fashioned paper

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.832
charts, it would have been easy.

00:37:08.832 --> 00:37:10.540
I would have just gone
through and looked

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.940
at his original
diagnosis, how he got it.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.422
I would have turned back and
looked at the labs, which

00:37:15.422 --> 00:37:16.630
would have been in a section.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.950
I would have looked
at the X-rays.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.450
I could have seen
the nurses' notes.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.597
I could have followed
the doctors' narrative.

00:37:21.597 --> 00:37:22.930
I could have followed the story.

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.390
It would have been a snap.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:30.130
So my idea is that
we take this model,

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.160
this old-fashioned model,
that's made out of paper,

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.700
and we just turn
it into electrons.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.860
So we have an electronic paper
chart that preserves the story.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.160
And how would we do that?

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.050
So my imagination is that we
already had this technology.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:48.940
It's called an e-book.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.234
So why not just use
this idea of an e-book

00:37:52.234 --> 00:37:53.650
for our electronic
health records?

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.524
So if you, for instance,
came into my office,

00:37:55.524 --> 00:37:57.430
you were a new patient,
we have some HIPAA

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:00.941
privacy-protected cloud, that
I can take a new chart out of.

00:38:00.941 --> 00:38:01.690
That's your chart.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.965
And it looks like a book.

00:38:03.965 --> 00:38:04.840
It's on the computer.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.130
But it looks like a book.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:10.120
And I should be able to, I
think, I should be able to--

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.759
if I like to write, how come I
can't, like, handwrite a note?

00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:15.300
Or if I like to
dictate, why can't I?

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.258
If I like to type, I
should be able to do that.

00:38:17.258 --> 00:38:20.080
If I want to write in French,
I should be able to do that.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.690
I should be able to write
the narrative of what happens

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:23.920
and my physical exam.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.070
I should be able to turn
that chart around, go

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.960
look at-- fluff
through the chart.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.100
Why can't we do that?

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.350
And then that would mean
that if we did it this way,

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.000
then when I'm done
with your chart,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.505
I put it back in the cloud.

00:38:35.505 --> 00:38:37.630
Let's suppose you have to
go to the emergency room.

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:41.410
They can just go take that
chart out of the cloud

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.560
and write in it themselves.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.610
I don't see why
you can't do that.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.470
And so then the problem
becomes, well, what do we do--

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:51.656
because one of the reasons
electronic health records

00:38:51.656 --> 00:38:53.280
are being used this
way is for billing.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.030
And the second reason
is because of big data.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.320
Oh, big data is very valuable.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.750
This idea that you can
figure out instantly

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.550
how many patients
have hypertension,

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.690
or how many patients--

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.940
this kind of information
is very valuable.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.785
Just financially,
it's very valuable.

00:39:11.785 --> 00:39:12.580
It's valuable to marketing.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.495
It's valuable to
pharmaceuticals.

00:39:13.495 --> 00:39:16.030
It's valuable to the health
care industry as a whole.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.680
But right now what
we have, is we

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.930
have the docs
acting fundamentally

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.920
as data care providers.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.751
That's what we do.

00:39:22.751 --> 00:39:23.250
We--

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.590
REBECCA MOORE: Data
care providers--

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:25.150
VICTORIA SWEET: Data care--

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.282
REBECCA MOORE: OK.

00:39:25.282 --> 00:39:26.470
That's a new one.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.660
VICTORIA SWEET: We
put-- that's our job.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.410
We spend 110% of our time in
front of your electronic health

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:35.770
records, simply
entering data, so

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.330
that big data can be produced.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:41.580
So that big data can be sold
and used by these companies.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.545
And so what I don't--
it seems to me--

00:39:43.545 --> 00:39:45.640
Becca and I have actually
talked about this--

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.370
is, if artificial
intelligence can

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.640
do all these marvelous
things, why can't they

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.060
take my handwritten
notes and all this stuff

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.010
and just stick
artificial intelligence

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.910
between the necessary big data
and my electronic paper chart,

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.550
and if artificial
intelligence turned my chart

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.870
into all the big data you want?

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.170
Why do I have to do it?

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.740
REBECCA MOORE: It works for me.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.327
So that is your challenge.

00:40:12.327 --> 00:40:13.160
VICTORIA SWEET: Yes.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.030
I challenge Google.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.780
REBECCA MOORE: OK.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.220
The gauntlet is now thrown.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:16.490
VICTORIA SWEET: Yes.

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:17.573
I think we should do that.

00:40:17.573 --> 00:40:19.780
Because if we could do that,
it would be phenomenal.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.700
We could have doctors who could
spend 2 and 1/2 minutes-- we'd

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.366
have our 12 and 1/2 minutes back
with patients, to examine them.

00:40:27.366 --> 00:40:29.240
The big data people,
who like all that stuff,

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.160
they'd still be happy.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.160
And you guys could do
something fantastic.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.050
And I think it would
be very interesting

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:39.329
for artificial intelligence
to look at that as a problem.

00:40:39.329 --> 00:40:41.120
REBECCA MOORE: So I
have one more question.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.160
But then I want to let
other people do it too.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.262
So in the news this week--

00:40:45.262 --> 00:40:47.890
I think it was just like
yesterday or the day before--

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:54.020
it was suddenly announced
that some of the health policy

00:40:54.020 --> 00:41:00.080
setters have changed the
standard for hypertension.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.410
And they've lowered the
level of your blood pressure

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:07.100
at which they consider
that you have a problem

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.770
and should go on medication.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.800
And I think I saw
yesterday, that now

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:18.710
50% of the adult population is
now considered hypertensive.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.380
And, in fact-- then I
heard on NPR last night,

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.140
something about someone, who is
sort of an apologist for this,

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.210
was saying, but it's OK.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:29.690
We've determined that it's
safe to medicate people

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.460
at these lower levels
of blood pressure.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.960
So it's fine.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.100
I found that alarming.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.527
And I just wondered if you
had any thoughts on this.

00:41:38.527 --> 00:41:39.360
VICTORIA SWEET: Yes.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.945
Well, I do have clients.

00:41:40.945 --> 00:41:42.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:44.770
Well, so my first
thought actually was--

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:47.870
so they've been doing this
for decades and decades.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.100
So long ago, when I
was in medical school,

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.300
and they had actually--

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:01.960
so the way that docs determine
what's high and what's low is--

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.310
we don't really know actually.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:04.840
It's mostly statistical.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.960
We basically decide
one standard deviation

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.480
from the mean, or two standard
deviations from the mean,

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.320
by definition.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.530
That's what we do.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.690
Because we don't--

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.060
A priori, we wouldn't know
what a normal sodium is.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:18.070
The way we even know
a normal sodium is we

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:20.290
do billions of
sodiums in people.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:24.670
And then we declare these to
be normal, within, let's say,

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:25.690
one standard deviation.

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:27.220
And everything else
to be abnormal.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.220
And then, sometimes, we'll
be able to connect up

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.700
a disease state or a symptom
with those abnormalities.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:37.840
So with hypertension, that
was done in around the '60s

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.890
and '70s.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.232
And the original definition
of hypertension was actually--

00:42:42.232 --> 00:42:43.690
I may be one of
the only people who

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:46.712
remember this-- was actually
about a 180 over 110.

00:42:46.712 --> 00:42:48.670
That was two standard
deviations from the mean.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:56.792
And that was correlated with
significant kidney problems,

00:42:56.792 --> 00:42:58.750
when you have that high
a blood pressure, heart

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.070
problems, and extra strokes.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:03.950
So that actually was
actually shown as evidence.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:05.350
Then, over the years--

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.946
but that's two
standard deviations.

00:43:06.946 --> 00:43:08.320
What do you get,
7% of the people

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.170
are taking their medications.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.060
That's not very much.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.880
That's not very good.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.540
So about, um, about 20
years ago, they lowered--

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.285
they just randomly
lowered, and said,

00:43:18.285 --> 00:43:20.410
from now on it's going to
be one standard deviation

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.810
from the mean, which
is 160 over 90,

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:26.530
which nobody has ever
correlated with actual damage.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.950
But they just assume, if really
high blood pressure was bad,

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.650
then kind of-- this
was still high.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.600
It was one standard
deviation from the mean.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.390
So then we had in an epidemic
of high blood pressure

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:41.210
because suddenly we had
15% of the people had--

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:43.210
statistically-- you guys
are all mathematicians.

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:44.876
Once you go from two
standard deviations

00:43:44.876 --> 00:43:46.880
to one standard
deviation, you have 15%.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.610
So, my god, we
have this epidemic.

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:50.780
Because it used to be 7%
of people had hypertension.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.370
Now, 15% have hypertension.

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:55.750
But then, we have 15% more
people taking medications,

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.095
which is very useful.

00:43:58.095 --> 00:43:58.720
So then about--

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.636
REBECCA MOORE: I think
you're being sarcastic.

00:44:00.636 --> 00:44:04.270
VICTORIA SWEET: --15 years ago,
we declared that 140 over 90

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.550
was hypertension.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:08.650
So then we had
about 20% of people

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.530
who were now hypertensive,
about 20% of people.

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:13.570
And then the
cardiologists got together

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:16.630
and decided that any amount of
blood pressure was bad for you.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.785
They did.

00:44:17.785 --> 00:44:18.520
They did.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.330
Remember?

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:20.590
They did do that.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.840
But they didn't really
officially declare it

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.300
until this last week,
where they've lowered it

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.710
once again, down to 130,
which falls actually

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:33.490
way within the mean, the
mean of a blood pressure.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.380
So consequently, 50%
of-- it's not surprising

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.190
that 50% of people
now have hypertension

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.510
with the definition.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.810
How would they not,
just statistically?

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:47.990
And that means 50% of people
are going to be on medications.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.567
REBECCA MOORE: Do these
medications have side effects?

00:44:51.567 --> 00:44:52.400
VICTORIA SWEET: Yes.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.200
They all have side effects.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:54.950
REBECCA MOORE: OK.

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.080
Anyway, I'm asking
too many questions.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.142
Anyone else have a
question for Dr. Sweet?

00:44:59.142 --> 00:45:00.350
VICTORIA SWEET: Or a comment?

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:01.516
REBECCA MOORE: Or a comment?

00:45:01.516 --> 00:45:03.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] All right.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.280
I have a microphone.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:04.610
REBECCA MOORE: OK.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:05.110
Great.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:06.111
AUDIENCE: He's up front.

00:45:06.111 --> 00:45:06.985
VICTORIA SWEET: Yeah.

00:45:06.985 --> 00:45:07.891
Go ahead.

00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:08.390
Yeah.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:09.864
Actually, you--

00:45:09.864 --> 00:45:11.484
AUDIENCE: Comment on that.

00:45:11.484 --> 00:45:13.900
AUDIENCE: How much is that
mean shifting over time though,

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:14.936
since the '60s?

00:45:14.936 --> 00:45:16.310
VICTORIA SWEET:
What do you mean?

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:18.010
AUDIENCE: Well, you said it's
so many standard deviations

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:18.530
from the mean.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:19.480
VICTORIA SWEET: That's right.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.610
AUDIENCE: And now, are--

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.480
VICTORIA SWEET: So
the mean stays--

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.340
AUDIENCE: Is that mean
shifting itself over time?

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:22.445
VICTORIA SWEET: No.

00:45:22.445 --> 00:45:23.290
So the mean-- All right.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:24.410
I see what you're saying.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:26.270
That's a really
interesting question.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:28.320
That's actually a
very good question.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.290
As far as I know, the mean
is still the average-ish.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:35.534
It's still about 120 over
70, as far as I know.

00:45:35.534 --> 00:45:37.700
I mean, that's actually a
real interesting question.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.200
I don't know the answer to that.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.460
I don't know if anybody does.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.190
Do you know,
[? Jumi, ?] offhand?

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.170
I think it's still 120 over 70.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:45.821
It's just, they
keep coming down,

00:45:45.821 --> 00:45:47.320
just like they've
done with statins.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.880
It's exactly the same model.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.940
I mean statins, your
elevated cholesterol

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.930
was two standard
deviations from the mean,

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:58.030
which was going to be an LDL, a
bad cholesterol of, like, 180.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.740
And then they went to 160.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.810
And then they went
to 130, which,

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.390
again, meant that 50% of
the people, not surprising,

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:07.210
were hypercholesterolemic,
because that was, like,

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:10.055
within 50% of the
people had a LDL of 130.

00:46:10.055 --> 00:46:12.430
And then the cardiologist
declared that it doesn't really

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:16.210
matter and we should have as
low cholesterol as possible,

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:20.410
even though the white
matter of your brain

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.362
is white because it's
made out of cholesterol.

00:46:23.362 --> 00:46:26.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:26.520
Ah.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.180
And [? Jumi ?] puts in,
and your sex hormones

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.346
are made out of cholesterol.

00:46:29.346 --> 00:46:34.190
And vitamin D is actually
1-dehydroxy cholesterol.

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.209
So, yes.

00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:36.250
REBECCA MOORE: All right.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:37.166
VICTORIA SWEET: Salim?

00:46:37.166 --> 00:46:38.339
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:38.339 --> 00:46:40.380
VICTORIA SWEET: Did I get
your name right, Salim?

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:40.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:41.300
VICTORIA SWEET: Salim.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.100
Yes.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:42.600
Correct.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.810
Good.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.480
AUDIENCE: So I will
ave my question

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.170
about forms and administrators
for later maybe.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:51.740
But I'm more curious--

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.410
or maybe I'll start
with the preface

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.750
that we're a part of
a technology company.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.310
And it certainly
feels like the world

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.750
is moving faster and faster.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.040
And we want to, whether it's
multitasking or enabling

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.470
people to move faster,
you put a lot of the onus

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:07.990
on the medical
system and doctors

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:09.880
to slow the system
down, it seems like,

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.010
to not treat the
body like a machine.

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:16.810
Yet, what are your thoughts
from a patient's perspective?

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.600
The ability to take
some ibuprofens

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.050
when I have a headache
and solve the problem is--

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.270
that's nice to hand that
off to the doctor and say,

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:26.890
why are you prescribing
me ibuprofens?

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:29.020
But I can get this
off the shelf.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.900
How do patients approach
medicine differently

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.220
and slow things down, and
look for longer solutions,

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.160
moralistic solutions?

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.350
VICTORIA SWEET: That's a
really thoughtful question.

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:41.170
Thank you.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.780
Well, what I would say is this.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:47.552
I think there's actually
two flavors of patients,

00:47:47.552 --> 00:47:48.760
two flavors of people really.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.410
Some people really
like medications.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.235
They like meds.

00:47:52.235 --> 00:47:52.860
They like labs.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.830
They like going to the doctor.

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:55.079
They like-- they just like it.

00:47:55.079 --> 00:47:56.260
They like meds.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.760
And then there's a
whole other group

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.680
that don't like meds, of which
I happen to belong to them.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.320
And what usually happens
with docs in an open system,

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.320
is the docs that like to
prescribe meds and just

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.780
naturally practice this
way, collect patients

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.510
who like to have medications.

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:12.620
There's a whole lot of
people who believe in meds.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.580
But I'm not one of them, either
as a doctor or as a patient.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.820
And I would tend to collect
patients who think like me.

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.250
So I don't think it's
just one or the other.

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:27.400
I think for the people who
are reluctant to take meds,

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.870
they don't usually
take meds very much.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.170
And if they can get away
with just taking something

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.870
off the shelf, sort of why not?

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:39.380
So I think that's how I
would answer that question.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.920
I'm not sure if I got
to the nubbin of it.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.870
Because you started out by
talking about everything

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:49.170
moving faster and faster.

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.275
And that as a patient, how can
you get things to slow down?

00:48:52.275 --> 00:48:54.400
And in a way, I don't even
think it's as a patient.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.520
It's as a person.

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.490
I mean I think--

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:58.656
so this is, again,
maybe a little off

00:48:58.656 --> 00:48:59.530
for me talking about.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:04.980
I think as far as
our health goes,

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.620
we couldn't live
in a society that

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:12.660
was more difficult to
be sane, and centered,

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.460
and enjoy your life than the
society you live in right now.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.800
And I think-- you
know, "sane" actually

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.220
is from "sanus," which
means "healthy" in Latin.

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:26.570
And "health," which
is "solus," actually

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:27.980
is connected to salvation.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:34.110
Then I like the one that's
"hello," which actually means

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:35.910
"health to you."

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.800
Because in old English,
"hal" was health.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.440
And they're all related
to this idea of wholeness.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.450
So whole, and hal, and
health, and wealth--

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.020
I think.

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:46.740
I haven't looked that up yet.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.739
But I decided the other
day, I think wealth fits

00:49:48.739 --> 00:49:51.590
into this wholeness model.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:52.930
We're fragmented.

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:56.010
Our attention is fragmented.

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:59.050
We're just in this kind of
piecemeal, sort of state.

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:01.025
And I think it's not
a good state to be in.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.632
REBECCA MOORE: Another question.

00:50:05.632 --> 00:50:08.500
AUDIENCE: Building on Salim's
thing, I think he says--

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.685
I think it's separating
symptom from the source.

00:50:10.685 --> 00:50:13.060
So if you have a headache,
and that's a symptom, you say,

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:13.960
I can take an Advil.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.390
And that will go away.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:17.480
And you can just keep
doing that for a while.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.520
But you're not addressing
the root cause.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.350
So if I can treat a symptom,
I will deal with it myself.

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:24.610
But if I can't get
past that, then that's

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:26.620
where I go to the doctor,
to help me figure out

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.408
what's actually going on.

00:50:28.408 --> 00:50:29.830
VICTORIA SWEET: Correct answer.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:30.450
Thank you.

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:31.840
AUDIENCE: Well, you're
supposed to comment on that.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.631
VICTORIA SWEET: Oh.

00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:33.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:35.120
I totally agree with it.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.600
It's exactly right.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.410
That's exactly it.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:41.460
Is, if you can make it go away
on your own, and that's-- then,

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.287
I don't have a problem
with that actually.

00:50:43.287 --> 00:50:44.620
I think that's a good way to go.

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:45.780
AUDIENCE: That's your
measure of efficiency though.

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.792
Are you looking at
[INAUDIBLE] efficiencies?

00:50:47.792 --> 00:50:48.750
I had a headache today.

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:49.380
I took a pill.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.170
It went away.

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:52.860
It looks like it's
extremely efficient.

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.075
But if every single day
I'm taking this pill,

00:50:55.075 --> 00:50:57.450
and I'm constantly dealing
with that, over the long term,

00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.150
that's extremely inefficient.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:00.660
And if I treat the
source of that,

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.400
it takes me longer
to treat the source,

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.500
but it solves it for a
much longer duration.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.414
And therefore, it's much more
efficient in the long run.

00:51:07.414 --> 00:51:08.580
VICTORIA SWEET: Good answer.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.460
It is.

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.150
It's super.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.400
Thank you.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.816
AUDIENCE: To get
to Salim's point,

00:51:11.816 --> 00:51:17.270
I think it's very hard for a
certain segment of patients

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.410
to get over that.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.030
They want the quick fix.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:22.400
So, in some ways,
many physicians

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.100
respond to that by prescribing.

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.770
I think many-- and I speak
as a physician myself.

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:30.830
Many of us would like to sit
down, talk to our patients,

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:32.055
spend time.

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:33.680
And sometimes patients,
like me, doc, I

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.765
don't have time for this.

00:51:34.765 --> 00:51:36.390
I'm not going invest
in my health care.

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:38.120
I just want-- give
me the antidepressant

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:38.780
and I'll feel better.

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.140
And I'll have time
for therapy later.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.848
But I don't have time
for that right now.

00:51:41.848 --> 00:51:43.700
So there's this
whole sea change,

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:47.600
that has to also start from the
patient point of view, actually

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.792
wanting to invest
time in themselves.

00:51:49.792 --> 00:51:52.000
AUDIENCE: And if you have
to see a thousand patients,

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.480
you don't have time to do that.

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.010
VICTORIA SWEET: Correct.

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.770
REBECCA MOORE: Anyone else?

00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.410
So I one last question, maybe.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.630
Do you feel that
you, as a clinician,

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.400
that you are alone in this?

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.590
Or, as you go around
and you're talking

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:10.040
with other doctors, and nurses,
and so on, around the country,

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.785
is this message of slow
medicine resonating?

00:52:14.785 --> 00:52:15.660
VICTORIA SWEET: Yeah.

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:16.620
It sure is.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.100
And I sometimes wish I was
a lot more of a general,

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.290
rather than a philosopher.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:26.220
Because there's a whole movement
that is brewing out there.

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:31.160
There's so much frustration
among doctors, and nurses

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.180
especially.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.650
I mean as much
nurses, as doctors.

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:37.750
That, we're just stuck
in front of the computer.

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.320
It's just maddening.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.970
So there's a huge--

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:43.920
I've spoken to, like,
thousands of people

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.530
by now, personally, in
all these different talks.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.300
And everybody wants
something done

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.140
about it, which is
one of the things I've

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.270
thought about electronic
health records and getting--

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:53.436
because that would at least
get us off the computer.

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:55.660
It's not complicated.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.260
I don't think it's as
complicated a solution as it

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.435
looks like at first, if we
can just get back the time.

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.760
REBECCA MOORE: OK.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.390
We'll have [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:10.310
AUDIENCE: Since
we're at Google, I'd

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:14.270
be curious about your comment
on the use of Google Glass

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.130
in the doctor/patient setting.

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:18.710
So a clinic, that
I will not name,

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.710
has now gone to
using Google Glasses.

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:23.030
So you walk into the
clinic, the room.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.430
Your doctor has a
Google Glass on.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:27.470
And on the other side
of the Google Glass

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:31.210
is a transcriptionist, probably
in India somewhere, outsourced,

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:33.560
that is documenting
every single word

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.630
that occurs between
you and your physician

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:36.920
during that encounter.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.270
So in some ways, it's
taking more time.

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:43.181
The doctor doesn't have
to do the data entry.

00:53:43.181 --> 00:53:44.930
But there's this third
person in the room,

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:47.230
through the Google Glass,
that your wonderful--

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:50.900
an amazing company has enabled
doctors to use this technology.

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.646
But it has affected the
doctor/patient interaction.

00:53:54.646 --> 00:53:56.270
Many of my colleagues
who are using it,

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:58.339
claim that its given
back their lives.

00:53:58.339 --> 00:54:00.380
That they're now completing
all of their charting

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.620
within the course of the day.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.120
They're going home.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.770
And they're not taking
their charts home with them

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:05.645
because they don't have
to because everything

00:54:05.645 --> 00:54:06.860
is transcribed for them.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.680
But I'm wondering, from
all of you, and from you,

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.470
what your perspective on this
as a possible solution would be?

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.140
VICTORIA SWEET: That seems
to me not a solution,

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.390
but a possible problem.

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:22.230
I mean-- I just--

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:25.330
I was just horrified
when I heard about that.

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:29.320
I mean, I can't imagine
anything worse than going

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.520
into my patient like this.

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.620
Hi.

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.630
I'm Dr. Sweet, trying
to look at the Google

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:36.880
Glass and their records out
of the corner of my eye.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.510
It just seems whacked.

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:42.990
There is something called
the Scribe, which--

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:45.171
it gives me the same
feeling, which is doctors--

00:54:45.171 --> 00:54:47.170
so they don't have to sit
in front the computer.

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:50.200
Now, there's an actual, physical
third person, who follows you

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.440
in the room and fills out your
electronic health records,

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.020
while you supposedly are talking
with the patient, which is,

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.561
as an example, a
lot better solution,

00:54:57.561 --> 00:54:59.800
I think, than the Google
Glass, where at least you're

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.840
physically looking
at the person.

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.120
But Rebecca, do you have any
thoughts on Google Glass?

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.550
REBECCA MOORE: Well,
actually I have a clinician

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.490
who wanted to do that.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:09.940
And I was uncomfortable.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.190
And she did give me an option,
that you didn't mention,

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.960
which is--

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.390
what I was uncomfortable
with was Google Glasses,

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:17.450
about looking at things.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:20.140
It's not just about
audio transcription.

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:23.590
And so it could be
beaming images, right,

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:26.710
which feels like it could be
a violation of the patient's

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:28.120
privacy.

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.960
So there were two modes.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.870
So the mode that I
allowed her to use

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:34.360
was just recording audio.

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:40.550
But even so, that
eyewear, I felt

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:46.610
as an imposition in that
trust relationship, personal.

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:48.060
Anyway.

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:49.100
Anything else?

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.974
Oh, one-- Yes, please.

00:55:50.974 --> 00:55:52.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] legal.

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.050
You have to have this paper
trail of absolutely everything.

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:57.819
And that's part of what's
inhibiting your efficiency.

00:55:57.819 --> 00:55:59.610
VICTORIA SWEET: Could
you say it a little--

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.776
AUDIENCE: How much of it
is driven by legal reasons,

00:56:01.776 --> 00:56:04.069
and not like big
data and collecting?

00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.860
VICTORIA SWEET: Oh.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:05.430
I see what you mean.

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:07.010
AUDIENCE: By having
a paper trail and--

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.270
VICTORIA SWEET: Yes.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.470
Yes.

00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.970
Yes.

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:13.460
Well, we have we do like to
document things for malpractice

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:13.960
reasons.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.740
But if you just handwrite
it, it's perfectly fine.

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.545
It doesn't have to be in
a computer per se, at all.

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:24.570
So there's no
reason that we have

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:26.700
to have a clumsy electronic
health record, that

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:31.170
takes all our time and produces
big data, in order to document.

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:33.630
It's actually much
better documentation

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.880
if I actually write
the story about you.

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.920
This 32-year-old woman came
in with chronic headaches.

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.224
And I thought this.

00:56:40.224 --> 00:56:40.890
And we did this.

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:43.050
And this is what I think
it is, kind of the story,

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:46.140
than it is to have what I
found with my father, which

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.480
was incomprehensible.

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.060
So that's not the legal thing.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:53.810
There is a legal piece
that the United--

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:56.160
the one reason we've gone
to having electronic health

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.520
records was that in
2009, there was hidden

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.210
in the Reconstructing
America Act, this little--

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:04.950
what did they call it--

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:08.730
sorry-- this little
sublaw thingy,

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.730
that every doctor,
that has anything

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:12.480
to do with the federal
government I think,

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.640
has to have their
electronic health records.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.856
That's how it happened.

00:57:15.856 --> 00:57:16.980
It didn't happen gradually.

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.032
It was like 2009.

00:57:18.032 --> 00:57:20.490
And then they would start taking
money out of your practice

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:22.560
if you didn't have
electronic records.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.080
So it was one of the
reasons that suddenly they

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:28.350
took this billing platform
and just immediately tried

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:30.690
to add things on, so they
could sell it to the doctors

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:31.930
and doctors could do that.

00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:33.870
So there is some
legal piece of that.

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:36.687
But it isn't so much like
getting sued, kind of thing.

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:37.770
It's more like government.

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:39.311
REBECCA MOORE: I do
want to point out

00:57:39.311 --> 00:57:42.240
that Dr. Sweet is one of the
few people on the planet who's

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:45.300
actually read the entire
Affordable Care Act.

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.790
VICTORIA SWEET: 922
single-spaced pages.

00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:49.514
It's as long as
Harrison's "Principles

00:57:49.514 --> 00:57:50.430
of Internal Medicine."

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:51.210
REBECCA MOORE: OK.

00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:52.937
On that note, thank
you very much.

00:57:52.937 --> 00:57:55.020
VICTORIA SWEET: Thank you
very much for having me.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.070
[APPLAUSE]
