00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:06.372
ANNOUNCER:<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
 the 45th and final President</i>

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.274
<i> of the United States.</i>

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.009
(applause, cheering)

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.744
(camera shutters clicking)

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:13.513
Wow.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.314
(muttering)

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:16.783
Wow.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.851
Thank you, thank you.

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:22.588
I'm so proud of what
we've accomplished today.

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:26.059
Everyone loved when Obama
killed bin Laden.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.928
And now everyone will remember
where they were

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.664
when I freed O.J. Simpson.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:33.199
Mr. President! Mr. President!

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:35.234
Your party controls
the whole government,

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.869
why can't you pass
a health care bill?

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.204
It would have passed

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:40.940
if it weren't for the 3 to 5
million illegal senators

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:44.277
who shouldn't have been able
to vote in the first place.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.747
So is your plan now
just to kill Obamacare?

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.083
I'm not killing Obamacare.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.952
I'm letting it die naturally.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.922
The same way you let your
grandmother die naturally,

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.926
by unplugging her oxygen and
shoving her down the stairs.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.629
Um, is there a theme tonight?

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:07.433
Tonight's theme is
"Made in America."

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:11.270
Because what makes America great
is what America makes.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:12.638
Whoa!

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.708
That's like the first good thing
I've ever said.

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.444
We're celebrating the
hardworking Americans

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:20.980
who are making
all kinds of things.

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:24.550
From the lady in the shower cap
who makes honey bunches of oats

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:28.721
to the elves in the tree
who fudge all the stripes.

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.824
And, of course, those beautiful
Clydesdale horses

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:35.495
who love beer and hate 9/11.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:38.164
All such great Americans.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.233
Why did you say it was unfair

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.069
for Jeff Sessions to recuse
himself on Russia?

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.938
I have a very simple test
for fairness.

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.007
Does this thing earn me money,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.377
make me look smart
or arouse me sexually?

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.448
If the answer to any of those
is no, totally unfair.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:58.151
Any comment on
the continuing accusations

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.086
that you colluded with Russia?

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.922
No, I don't have a comment.
What do I look like? Don, Jr.?

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.258
-Kind of, yeah.
-Yes, he's your son, yeah.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:09.028
Please, Don, Jr. wishes
he looked like this.

00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:10.930
Ding.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:12.465
Folks,

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:16.135
let's not make this into
something ugly like my son.

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:18.271
If I could get rid of him
I would,

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.206
but someone's got to go to jail.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.508
I'm the president.
Can you repeal it? Nope.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.541
Let's roll!
