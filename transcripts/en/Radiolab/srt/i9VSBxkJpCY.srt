1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm
Robert Krulwich dishes radiolab.

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:08,160
This hour we're going to talking about
diagnosis, diagnosis, the easy kind.

3
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:09,090
We're not going to talk about it.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,420
Easy would be you come into my office
and I'm a doctor. You have a broken arm.

5
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:16,080
I take a picture. I say, Hey, you've
got a broken arm. That picture says so.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,520
Yeah, cause you can see
the break right there.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,670
But let's suppose you came into
my office and you were sad.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,080
You tell me that your sex drive
is down. Yay. I'm the doctor.

9
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:28,210
So we're going to sit. But just
between you and me, right? Well,

10
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:32,590
right away my learning tells me that
you may be a candidate for depression,

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,840
but how do I know that you're
depressed? What do you mean?

12
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:38,180
How do we know we talk
about it? You just said,

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,810
well you can't measure
sadness or depression.

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,610
You can't go to a test tube
and count anything. Right.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,390
It's not hard science.
Yeah, because till now,

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,550
what if I put you in, you know,

17
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:56,150
one of those FMR I machines that
we've talked about so often?

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,420
I snap a picture of your brain in action
and I look at it and from your picture

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,600
I say that you are depressed. You're
going to tell me I'm depressed.

20
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:09,800
Just from looking at a picture of
my brain. Yes. What? No Way. Look,

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,140
it's now here. Photographic diagnosis
of mental illness. This is happening.

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,510
There is no question and that by the way,

23
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:21,590
is Eric Candela professor up at Columbia
University who just happens to have won

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,990
the Nobel prize for medicine. Let me
give you a little historical back.

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,110
Did you get a note, Bill? I don't think
you did. I still don't believe you.

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,630
And what just cause he's got a Nobel
prize. I'm going to suddenly turn it.

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,290
Oh no you're not. So let's do
this step by step. Okay. Step one.

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,560
Imagine you're slipping
into an FMR I machine. Okay.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,530
I want you to just look at my
face. Why is that so difficult?

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,390
Just to know what this
is going anywhere. Okay.

31
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:50,300
I'm looking at your face now
that you're looking at my face.

32
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,550
Different regions of the
brain, they become active.

33
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,490
There are cells in your brain
that are saying, I know him.

34
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,580
The cells are more active. They need
energy. Just like when you're running,

35
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:04,970
you have to breathe fast and to get the
energy, your heart pumps more blood.

36
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,380
The body sends a rush of fresh blood with
that particular group of cells because

37
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,370
the blood has iron in it.

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,560
The magnet and the brain scanner can
see the iron and therefore see the blood

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,420
field and take pictures of it. Many,

40
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:27,630
many pictures in real time. I'll
show you a very nice example of that.

41
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,300
Eric's now heading off across his ample
office with an extraordinary view of the

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,330
Hudson Valley and he brought over a
picture of a human brain with different

43
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:38,540
colors in different areas and he
told me, when you look at a face,

44
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,510
when you image the face,
this area lights up.

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,790
You're pointing to an area of
your main area of the brain,

46
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,420
your on your forehead kind
of. That's right. That's fine.

47
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,450
If you look at a house,
some other area lights up,

48
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:53,420
but this area does not light
up. You look at another face.

49
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,760
This area lights up again. Every time
you see a face, the same area. Yup.

50
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,280
But you haven't told me anything
about emotions yet. That's true.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,020
So let's move on to step two

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,450
because we use faces to tell what
someone else's thinking or someone else's

53
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,110
feeling.

54
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,970
Looking at faces also triggers an area
deep in the brain that is concerned with

55
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,710
the emotion called the Amygdala.

56
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,540
Now very recently a number of people
have looked at the make the looking at

57
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:23,260
faces and it's extremely
interesting. Step three.

58
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,380
Okay, I'm going to take you now to
London. Hello. Hi. Yeah, hi. Yeah,

59
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:32,920
that's good. It's okay. Who is
this? Oh wait, sorry. Who are you?

60
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,870
I'm Cynthia [inaudible].
My psychiatrist at

61
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,090
the Institute of Psychiatry
Kings College London.

62
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,230
And Are you liking your 30s or your
forties or your 50s this is part of the

63
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:44,530
interview I want cause like
cause your mood tonight man.

64
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,130
I wanted to establish that she came
into psychiatry. Trying to think,

65
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:51,130
when did I graduate medical school.
I didn't live very critical time.

66
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,250
I finished my training in 97 my training
in psychiatry in 97 1997 when the Fmri

67
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:59,110
machines were first becoming available.

68
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:02,440
And so Cynthia was able to
do a rather amazing study.

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,870
What in this study she got together
a group of people who were clinically

70
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:11,080
depressed, depressed people, and then
another group of people who are normal,

71
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,340
healthy people and she put them in the
brain scan machine and showed them facial

72
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:16,060
expressions,

73
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,710
faces ranging from more neutral
expressions to more sad expressions.

74
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,380
So they saw a sad face and then a neutral
face and a sad face. That's right.

75
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,830
And what the person in the machine was
supposed to do is look at these faces and

76
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:32,720
decide whether it was a
man or a woman's face. Huh?

77
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,420
What does that have to do
with anything? Because,

78
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:37,120
because while they were doing that,
now they're making this decision.

79
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,020
The emotion of the face is
being processed automatically.

80
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,140
The amygdala sees the emotion on the
faces at that moment and the machines,

81
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:50,350
it's like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
And they were hundreds of pictures.

82
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,290
10th of a second to 10th of a second.
A 10th of a second. That's right.

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,760
Did you see a difference between the
people who were depressed and the people

84
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:00,040
who were normal? Yes.

85
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,900
Was it a significant difference or adjust?

86
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,780
Barely difference as a group it was a
significant difference and now she takes

87
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:08,650
the big step.

88
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,000
Step four from the pattern
she sees in bunches of people,

89
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:16,090
she feeds all those patterns into
a computer called machine learning.

90
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,410
Show the program. This is a pattern of
brain activity and depressed people.

91
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,870
This is a pattern and brain
activity in healthy people.

92
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,310
And then she shows the computer
a brain scan of a new person.

93
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,100
So this is someone the computer's
never met before. Exactly.

94
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,890
And she did this a bunch of time,
right? A whole bunch of people.

95
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,490
And each time the computer tries to get,

96
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,200
is this new person depressed
or not? Oh and what?

97
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,000
What happened? More than 85% of the time,

98
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:47,260
86% of the time the algorithm
correctly diagnosed,

99
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,960
whether that person was
depressed or healthy.

100
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,030
[inaudible]

101
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,110
was just a brain scan, a computer
and a patient. No doctor.

102
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,860
Cynthia's computer got
the diagnosis right.

103
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,510
86% of the time a computer. Let me
saw the results. It's like, wow,

104
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:09,780
this is amazing. Wait a second.

105
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,670
Has she repeated this? Well,

106
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:15,060
this is actually the very first time that
this has been done with depression and

107
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:17,280
so it's just a pilot
study and like you say,

108
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:19,710
someone else will have to do
it again and again and again,

109
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,180
but according [inaudible] does,
Cynthia, the potential is fantastic.

110
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,760
Psychiatry is going to be
absolutely revolutionize.

111
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,110
I think this method can be applied
to any psychiatric disorder,

112
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,670
any autism. It's a phrenia obsessive
compulsive disorder. No Way. Come on.

113
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:34,504
Why not?

114
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Every one of these illnesses ultimately
must have an anatomical basis,

115
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,340
every one of these illnesses,

116
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,370
so this means that it will shoot or one
day be possible for a patient to come in

117
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:52,060
and you take a picture of him in real
time or of her and you will have a

118
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,870
diagnostic tool. That's what
you're saying? Absolutely.

119
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,281
Absolutely.

120
00:06:57,281 --> 00:07:00,910
You mean to tell me that they're going
to put people in machines and just go

121
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,820
boom, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,040
This is not a casual thing.
You go to the doctor,

123
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,500
you tell the doctor that
you're feeling a certain way,

124
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:13,170
the doctor will talk to you and
then he would come to you and say,

125
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:16,560
well my learning and the test
tells me that you're ill.

126
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,400
So that's all it's happening. Share is
now the medical doctor was habitats.

127
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,120
We have nothing in this
that feels invasive to you.

128
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,250
Well obviously huddling into the deep
depths of your personhood is no, this is,

129
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,570
if you believe that mental
illness is a mental illness,

130
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,540
it is a structural condition
which can be fixed.

131
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,620
So it's not the deep inner
you, it's the broken you.

132
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,430
So it's like the broken arms
and you started off with that.

133
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,830
So you would put the two side
by side. I think I would.

134
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,810
And then of course you get to
the Nelson. Come on Robert.

135
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:49,760
I mean human beings are
way too messy for that.

136
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,300
You're too messy for it to
be that easy. No, no way.

137
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:56,180
So you think this is out of science's
reach? Really? It's just too,

138
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,940
there's a part of me that does
think it is out of science.

139
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:03,740
I think it's because you think you think
that they're looking deep inside you.

140
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,990
That's what you don't like. I
do. I mean, don't get me wrong.

141
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:10,020
I find brain scans fascinating when it
comes to questions like where is the

142
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,910
salt? What is consciousness?
That kind of stuff,

143
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,090
but don't kind of get in my head and
tell me what's what's right and what's

144
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:18,120
wrong and sick. Don't you
want to get better? Yes,

145
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,210
but I enjoy the comfortable ambiguity
that would come from a situation like

146
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:26,490
sitting in a therapist's office and
saying, well, I'm, how am I feeling?

147
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,230
I'm feeling this way or that way.

148
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:31,440
And in the messiness of trying to
just rely on how you're feeling,

149
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:34,850
there's a vast landscape of, of
things that can happen. Choices.

150
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,800
You can make therapies,
you can pursue it this way.

151
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,920
Let's say you are sick and you know
that you're sick machine or no. Okay.

152
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,250
[inaudible] if you are feeling badly,

153
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,600
wouldn't it be nice if a machine could
help you find the right kind of help?

154
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,230
What do you mean? Well, Eric took me
people to do a thought experiment,

155
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,303
a mind experiment.

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,910
You've developed a psychotherapy
and I've developed a psychotherapy.

157
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,970
We each claim it's the best in the world.

158
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,180
Now we have an objective way of seeing
this machine allows you to independently

159
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,500
of any evaluation, see
the outcome of treatment.

160
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,810
So you can audit the doctor,

161
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,160
audit the doctor and give you evidence
that it's working or no. Okay.

162
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,350
[inaudible] a little bit on board.
I can give you 10% buy in now. Okay,

163
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,410
so how far off is this stuff?
Is it going to come soon?

164
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,420
This is very early in the game, obviously,

165
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:27,750
but I get to ask him like how far into
the future are we talking about here?

166
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:30,660
Soon or mid after long after you're dead.

167
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,690
I'm going to be around a long time,

168
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,230
but the question stands, will you
make it to see that said, look,

169
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,740
people who actually have you
don't. One can't in medicine.

170
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,000
In all honesty, give a timeline
for many of these things.

171
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,480
Imaging methodology right
now is quite sophisticated,

172
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,720
but it's still primitive
compared where it needs to be.

173
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,800
You're picking this up in
status and this entity,

174
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,120
you become excited as the
thing is beginning to emerge.

175
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,100
We see it for the first
time on the horizon.

176
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,700
You saying we got to the story too
early. That's what you said, just right.

177
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,630
It's not going to be interesting.
20 years from now it'll be obvious.

178
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,910
Or in 20 years it'll be obvious
that we were wrong. Okay.

179
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,200
That's a real possibility because what
we don't know is ally's vast. Yeah,

180
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,300
and I want to tell you a story now about
just how wrong people can be. Okay.

181
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,550
It begins with a mystery,
sudden infant death syndrome,

182
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,920
perfectly healthy child goes to
sleep and dies during the night.

183
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,530
[inaudible]

184
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,770
it's about the worst thing that can
happen to a parent and each year it does

185
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:42,120
happen about 7,000 times. It's still,
no one knows why. Oh, and by the way,

186
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:43,260
that was Robert Sapolsky.

187
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:46,680
He's a professor of neuroscience
at Stanford University,

188
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,540
and a Spolsky tells this story of the
moment sids was diagnosed for the first

189
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,050
time,

190
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,050
or at least classified in a terrible
mistake that was made around 1900 or so.

191
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:01,560
People were being made to recognize
this as a disease entity and nobody knew

192
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:05,890
what was up. So people
decided, let's go dissect sids.

193
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,490
Kids meaning when a baby would die, they
would perform an autopsy. Exactly, yes.

194
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,581
Checked the baby's inside.

195
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:15,090
See if there's anything different in them
from normal kids. That seems logical.

196
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,983
Absolutely.

197
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,100
They measure the size of the baby's
lungs. Yep. Normal. And they didn't.

198
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:24,930
They measured the size of the heart.
Yep. Nothing strange. Their stomach,

199
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,790
kidney, liver, Yep. Those are all fine.
Then they would look in the throat.

200
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:31,730
[inaudible]

201
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,390
they look in there and they
say, oh my God, these sids kids,

202
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:39,860
they have enormous fine. This
glance, the thymus of famous.

203
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,920
What is the famous wonder? Well,

204
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:47,470
it is a little tiny pink
gland that is right there.

205
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,760
Right behind your collarbone,
Huh? At the base of your throat.

206
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:54,761
And Its job is to help you fight disease
makes one type of cell critical to your

207
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,930
immune system, especially
in times of stress.

208
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,540
Any case,

209
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,540
normally this little organ is about
the size of a tiny tube of toothpaste,

210
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:11,080
like the tribal coin. But in these
six kids it was huge. Humongous,

211
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:13,840
enormous. Twice the size. Exactly.

212
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,740
And since the thymus is
dangerously close to the windpipe,

213
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,640
doctors came up with a hypothesis,
perfectly reasonable hypothesis,

214
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,300
which was that maybe if you're one of
these babies with an enlarged thymus and

215
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:29,800
you're asleep and somehow you roll over
wrong [inaudible] well that gland might

216
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:33,700
press down on your trachea and
suffocate you during the night. Oh, so

217
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,510
medical mystery soft, really? Nope.

218
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,140
They even came up with a name for
it. It was called status find Maco,

219
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:45,930
lymphatic and the spillage.

220
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,110
It was in all the pediatric textbooks
by the 1920s and you would look in there

221
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,470
and there'd be pictures, there would be
pictures of the dissector fine misses,

222
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,430
normal size. And here
on the right in large,

223
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,100
abnormally large status find the
colon fat. And in no time at all,

224
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,850
doctors came up with a treatment,
perfectly logical therapy,

225
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,470
which is that if we're
going to help these babies,

226
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:12,750
we've got to shrink their
thymus gland. And to do that,

227
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,810
the best solution obviously is to

228
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,270
irradiate their throats or radiate their
throats to shrink their thymus gland

229
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,880
that the child's throat with
trillions of radioactive particles.

230
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,400
You literally, you Betcha.

231
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,150
And this was considered like something
every good loving parents should do.

232
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,200
Absolutely. If you worry about
your child being at risk for sids,

233
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,910
go and get their throats irradiated to
shrink the thymus glands and did it work?

234
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,590
Yes. Shrank the following. Ms Glanz.
But he says it did have another effect.

235
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,180
Decades later. You've killed 20 to
30,000 people with thyroid cancer.

236
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,440
20 30,000 deaths. That's a, that's
a real number. Yeah, that's a,

237
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,650
that's a fairly big one.
Yeah. So here's my question.

238
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,050
How could these doctors have
gotten it so, so, so, so, so wrong.

239
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,380
Do you know what I mean? I do.
I don't. You know what you mean?

240
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:16,530
You just answered your own question
a minute ago. No, no, I didn't.

241
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:19,740
I'm about to answer it right now.
They're playing with radiation.

242
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:21,420
You just said that. But what they, what?

243
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:24,270
They didn't know that radiation would
hurt you. They had no, it was like,

244
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:26,940
that's not technology,
but that's not what I was

245
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,673
[inaudible]

246
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,530
no, a couple of decades into
radiation having been discussed,

247
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,400
isotopes are performing near
miracles of diagnosis and discovery.

248
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,250
Well, we're just tossing around
radiation all over the place. Yeah.

249
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,670
Iodine one 31 radioactive sodium
right off gamma rays. Blue Trot.

250
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,930
And this was a period with madame
Curie dipping her arm into vats of

251
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,610
radioactivity. Harmless in dying.
Soon afterwards from cancer,

252
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,040
people would go into shoe stores and
they would have their feet x-ray. Yes.

253
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:05,410
X-Ray is a wonderful invention I
had that you had that. I did. Yes.

254
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,180
Kick off your shoes. And I think
you can look at your balloon.

255
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,270
That's exactly what that, how would
you do that? That's what that was back.

256
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,490
That was the thing you could do at
the shoe store was very cool. Good.

257
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,200
Showing how cutting edge of
a shoe store or they aren't.

258
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,230
So that's your explanation. Yeah. So
that may look like the explanation,

259
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,750
meet your radiation would play
a role. But if you would have,

260
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:29,560
let me say what I was gonna say. I would
have told you the real explanation.

261
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,790
Yes. Preceded the radiation by like a
couple hundred years. Hello? I don't know,

262
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,200
idea what you're talking. I'm going to
tell you back in the 17 hundreds okay.

263
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,590
Oh, that far back, that far back
before, uh, radiation before, uh,

264
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:43,900
your grandpa for, uh,

265
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,780
before the civil war or the
Eiffel tower in Napoleon.

266
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,890
I'm talking when the red coats
were still wearing red. Yeah. Yeah.

267
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,480
This was shortly after the revolutionary
war, right about this time.

268
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,260
So supposedly the first med schools
exist, started to pop up in America,

269
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,220
and a supply and demand issue came into
effect because with these med schools

270
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:06,310
came med students, medical students
who needed to learn about anatomy.

271
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,720
And of course, in order to do
that, they needed bodies, you know,

272
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,020
to dissect this, produced
this whole occupation.

273
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:17,490
You could be a resurrection
list or resurrect Janice. Yup.

274
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,530
And they would go out and
dig up bodies that's at night

275
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,790
and sell them to the unanimous
just the medical schools.

276
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,920
I'll need two more by Thursday.
[inaudible] yeah. Hey Dick.

277
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,180
Now here's the key point.
Since demand was so high,

278
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,170
the resurrection has had to go where
the bodies were easiest to get,

279
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,640
which meant no, avoiding
the fancy graveyards.

280
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,140
If you were wealthy,

281
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,830
you could have yourself buried in
what was called a patent coffin,

282
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,960
which was a triple layer coffin, which
was meant to be. Resurrection is proof,

283
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,290
but if you are not wealthy,
no fancy coffin for you,

284
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,100
you'd probably just be buried in a sack
and some poppers field just a few inches

285
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:12,150
under the soil. Very accessible
for these resurrection lists.

286
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,750
Not surprisingly, that's where they went.

287
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,330
Are we still on the same topic? Are you
explaining why children die? Yes, yes,

288
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,350
they're with me. All right.

289
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,790
What I'm trying to make is that the grave
robbers targeted the poor so much so

290
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,080
sometimes when they, you know,

291
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,010
people would catch these resurrection
lists in the act and see like, oh my God,

292
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:35,220
that's my dad. You're digging
up [inaudible] there'd be riots.

293
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,873
Stop stealing

294
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,440
leaps recalled out and
why odors were shot.

295
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,420
Are we talking like hundreds
of people torch bearing a,

296
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,880
it was townies versus the people who are
trying to dissect their dead relatives.

297
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,330
This is a lot of history and
I'm very fascinated in quotes.

298
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,050
What does this have to do with kids
dying? Fire, right? Let me bring it home.

299
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,340
Not that it hasn't been interesting,
but being at home, okay.

300
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,980
As a result of all of this hubbub over
a grave robbing country after country

301
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:12,120
throughout Europe decided,
no, let's standardize how
science gets it's cadavers.

302
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:13,290
Forget all this great robbing.

303
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,500
So they passed laws which formalized
anyone who died in a poorhouse,

304
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,690
uh, their body would be
turned over to the anatomist.

305
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,300
This was like the cadaver
version of direct deposit. Okay.

306
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:25,500
So grave robbing was gone,

307
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:28,830
but now all the body's use by
medicine and not just some,

308
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,040
but nearly all now came from the poor
estimates were by the end of that century,

309
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:36,570
99% of the body's used for,

310
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,050
for anatomy lessons had been
derived from poor houses.

311
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,110
And that seemed okay until 1936 a guy
named Han Soviet showed that being poor

312
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,080
actually warps your body. And now Robert,

313
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:56,010
now we come back to the case of the
mysteriously enlarged time is cause if

314
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,670
you're poor, you're either
worried about your job,

315
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,490
you're worried about feeding your
family, you're worried about the bills.

316
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:06,720
In other words, you are stressed
out during chronic stress.

317
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,370
Your immune system goes down the tubes
and since the time is this part of the

318
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:15,030
immune system, if you are chronically
stressed, the thymus gland shrinks.

319
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,100
Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

320
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:24,440
This hour we're going to talking about
diagnosis, diagnosis. The easy card,

321
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,330
we're not going to talk about it easy
would be you come into my office and I'm a

322
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:30,030
doctor. You have a broken arm.
I take a picture. I say, Hey,

323
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,640
you've got a broken arm.
That picture says so. Yeah,

324
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,810
cause you can see the break right there.

325
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,960
But let's suppose you came into
my office and you were sad.

326
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,370
You tell me that your sex drive
is down. Yay. I'm the doctor.

327
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:44,490
So we're going to sit. But
just between you and me. Well,

328
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,880
right away my learning tells me that
you may be a candidate for depression,

329
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,130
but how do I know that you're
depressed? What do you mean?

330
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:54,470
How do we know we talk
about it? You just said,

331
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,100
well you can't measure
sadness or depression.

332
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:01,910
You can't go to a test tube
and count anything. Right?

333
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,680
It's not hard science.
Yeah. Because till now,

334
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,830
what if I put you in, you know,

335
00:20:09,831 --> 00:20:12,650
one of those FMR AI machines that
we've talked about so often? Yeah.

336
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,710
I snap a picture of your brain in action
and I look at it and from your picture

337
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,890
I say that you are depressed. You're
going to tell me I'm depressed.

338
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:26,090
Just from looking at a picture of
my brain. Yes. What? No Way. Look,

339
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,430
it's now here. Photographic diagnosis
of mental illness. This is happening.

340
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,930
There is no question, and that,
by the way, is Eric Kandel,

341
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:39,931
a professor up at Columbia University
who just happens to have won the Nobel

342
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,420
prize for medicine. Let me give
you a little historical backwards.

343
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,440
Did you get a note.
