00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.800
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.370
So the two books most often cited as the "Great
American novel" are The Adventures of Huckleberry

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.650
Finn and this slender beast, The Great Gatsby
by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The US is a country

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.640
founded on the principles of freedom and equality;
Huck Finn is a novel about slavery and radical

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.750
inequality. We're also a nation that believes
in the American Dream. We pride ourselves

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.390
on our lack of aristocracy and the equality
of opportunity, but Gatsby is a novel about

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.719
our de facto aristocracy and the limits of
American Opportunity. I mean, Daisy Buchanan-

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.530
Mr Green, I hate everything about this stupid
collection of first world problems passing

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.840
for a novel, but my hatred of that Willa Cather-ing loser
Daisy Buchanan burns with the fire of a thousand suns!

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.940
Ugh, me from the past, here's the thing: you're
not supposed to like Daisy Buchanan, at least

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.520
not in the uncomplicated way that you like, say, cupcakes. By the way, Stan, where are my cupcakes?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.579
Stan: It's not your birthday or Merebration.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.159
Ah, stupid Merebration, coming only once a
year.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.809
I don't know where you got the idea that the
quality of a novel should be judged by the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.690
likeability of its characters, but let me
submit to you that Daisy Buchanan doesn't

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.300
have to be likeable to be interesting. Furthermore,
most of what makes her unlikeable -- her sense

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.450
of entitlement, her limited empathy, her inability
to make difficult choices - are the very things

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.390
that make you unlikeable! That's the pleasure
and challenge of reading great novels,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.010
you get to see yourself as others see you,
and you get to see others as they see themselves.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:32.040
[Theme Music]

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.960
So today we're going to focus on the American
Dream and how it plays out in the Great Gatsby.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920
Spoiler alert, some petals fall off the Daisy.
So let's begin with the characters.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.770
From the first chapter, we know three things
about our narrator, Nick Carraway - By the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.030
way, get it? Care away? It's not that sophisticated,
he could have done better.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.360
1) Nick grew up in the Midwest then moved
to New York's West Egg, and then something

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.480
happened that made him move back to the Midwest.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.250
Also, 2) He is prone to the use of highfalutin
language as when he introduces Jay Gatsby

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.430
by saying, "Gatsby turned out alright in the
end; it was what preyed on Gatsby, what foul

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.090
dust floated in the wake of his dreams that
temporarily closed out my interest in the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.689
abortive sorrows and short-winded elations
of men." That dream, by the way, with all of

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.109
its foul dust, is the American Dream.

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.930
Finally, 3) Nick is rich, and he got rich
not by working but by having a rich ancestor

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.439
who paid someone off to serve in the Civil
War on his behalf which allowed Nick's ancestor

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.039
to spend the Civil War making money. So how's
that for equal opportunity?

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.160
And then there's Gatsby, about whom we learn
absolutely nothing in chapter 1, except for

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.040
the aforementioned foul dust floating in the wake of his
dreams and that he had an "extraordinary gift for hope."

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.959
This extraordinary gift for hope is the essential
fact of Gatsby and also many romantic leads

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.039
from Romeo to Edward Cullen to Henry VIII,
who might have given up on several of his

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.480
wives but never gave up on the idea of love!

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.360
All of these people share a creepy belief
that if they just get the thing they want

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.750
-- the thing being a female human being --
then they'll finally be happy.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.200
We have a word for this;
it's called objectification.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.140
Then you have the aggressively vapid Daisy
Buchanan, Nick's distant cousin who lives

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.310
across the bay from Gatsby and Nick in the
much more fashionable East Egg. Daisy Buchanan

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.050
is crazy rich -- like polo pony rich -- thanks
to her marriage to Tom Buchanan.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.340
Tom is a former football player and a life
long asshat who Nick describes as "one of

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.090
those men who achieves such an acute, limited
excellence at twenty-one that everything afterwards

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.469
savors of anti-climax." Listen, if you're
under 21 it might be difficult to apprehend

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.920
the depth of that burn, but trust me, it's
a burn.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.160
So soon after the novel begins, Daisy and
Tom ask Nick to come over for dinner, where

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:40.529
the golfer Jordan Baker is also there, and they have
this awful party. And there's this great moment when

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:45.860
Tom goes on a racist rant and says, "We're Nordics and
we've produced all the things that make a civilization,"

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.900
Which is hilarious because none of those
people has actually produced anything.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.760
They didn't make the fancy furniture they're
sitting on, they didn't grow or cook the food

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.040
they're eating, they don't even light their
own freaking candles! Anyway we also learn

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.049
that Tom has a mistress and that Daisy might
not be as stupid as she's letting on, because

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.340
she looks at her young daughter and famously
says, "I hope she'll be a fool, that's the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.090
best thing a girl can be in this world, a
beautiful little fool."

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.000
Now look, it's difficult to argue that Daisy
is a good person -- after all, in the novel's

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.920
climax she allows Gatsby to take the fall for something
she did -- but she's a product of a much older American

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.540
system, one that, for instance, allows rich people
to pay poor people to go fight the Civil War for them.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.300
Oh it's time for the open letter? I never
noticed this chair was gold before, Stan.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.570
It makes me think of wealth. And to a lesser
extent, decay.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.500
An open letter to the Heroic Past. But first, let's see
what's on top of the secret compartment today.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.920
Oh, it's a champagne glass, I love champagne.
Stan! There are champagne poppers in here!

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.980
You put explosive miniature champagne bottles
in my champagne glass instead of champagne!!

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.920
Dear Heroic Past,
Like champagne poppers, you're always a little

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.250
bit underwhelming. (POP!). The thing is, Heroic
Past, which of our pasts was so heroic? Was

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.150
it the part where we owned other human beings?
Was it the part where we fought over the right

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.090
to own other human beings?
Was it Gatsby's Jazz Age, with its fast cars,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.000
deliciously illegal alcohol and rapidly expanding
stock portfolios? I mean, the amazing thing

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.580
about the Great Gatsby is that Fitzgerald
didn't know the Great Depression was coming,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.440
but his book sure reads like prophecy.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.320
The truth, Heroic Past, is that we may thing
we want to recreate you, but what we actually

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.670
want to do is we want to recreate you without
all the problems we don't remember.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.570
And that's how you ruin your life over a girl
you dated for a month five years ago.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.060
Best wishes,
John Green

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.560
From that dinner party, it's clear that wealth
consumes the rich, but there's also a moment

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.860
where it becomes clear that wealth consumes
the poor. Daisy tells a story about her butler,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.490
that he used to polish silver for a big family
in the city night and day until the caustic

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.930
silver polish ruined his nose. Alright, let's
go the the Thought Bubble.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.520
So whenever Nick is hanging out with the mega-rich
Tom, the parties are always awful and everybody

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.520
always wants the kind of status and wealth
that Tom Buchanan has, which is hilarious

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.080
because of course Tom is a horrible asshat who makes
Paris Hilton look, like, charming and grounded.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.960
But then we get to go to some awesome parties, at
Gatsby's house on West Egg. And even though Gatsby

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.920
has the annoying habit of saying "old sport" all the time and trying to sound upper-crusty, he's totally charming.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.220
He has a "smile that makes you feel he is
irresistibly prejudiced in your favor," to quote Nick.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.320
The first party at Gatsby's house also contains,
despite being set during Prohibition, the

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.370
greatest drunk-driving scene in the history
of American literature in which a guy gets

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.250
in an accident, like, three seconds after
getting into his car, and even though the

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.550
wheel has fallen off the car, he keeps trying
to drive it. To Fitzgerald, that had become

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.750
the American Dream by the 1920s: everyone
wanted enough money to buy fancy cars and

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.300
enough whiskey to crash them.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:53.080
But Gatsby, tellingly, doesn't drink. He's
never even used his pool, well until the very

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.250
end of the novel. All the money he's acquired
and all the parties he throws, are about one

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.020
thing and one thing only: winning back Daisy
Buchanan. There's a flashback in the novel

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.030
to Gatsby's first meeting with Daisy and when
you hear Gatsby tell that story it's very

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.490
telling that it's hard to understand whether
Gatsby is falling for Daisy or for her mansion.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.700
But when they finally reunite years later
and Gatsby has a mansion of his own everything

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.530
is yellow: Gatsby's car is yellow, his tie,
the buttons on Daisy's dress; at one point

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:29.390
Nick, who's third-wheeling it big time in
this scene, describes some flowers as "smelling

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.040
like pale gold." What does that even mean?!

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.220
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So the most famous
color symbol in The Great Gatsby is the Green

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.290
Light at the end of Daisy's dock that Gatsby
is always looking out at from across the bay.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.070
Gatsby just wants to reach across the bay
and get to that Green Light and if he can

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.870
he believes he will have the girl and the
life that has driven his wild ambition.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.790
Nick calls that Green Light at one point "an
enchanted object", and that's what symbols

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.180
really are in both literature and real life.
So yes, the Green Light is a symbol in Gatsby

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.610
but this isn't only stuff that happens in
novels. We all have enchanted objects in our

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.180
lives. On the night that I got engaged I drank
champagne with the woman who is now my wife

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.889
and I still have the cork from that champagne
bottle - I'm lying. I couldn't afford corky

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:15.240
champagne it was twist off champagne, but
I still have the bottle cap.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.740
So just as the Green Light is an enchanted
object, gold and yellow are enchanted colors

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.180
in Gatsby and also, for the record, in real
life. I mean think of golden opportunities,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:29.580
or golden ages, or your golden youth, or the
golden arches. Unless you're at McDonald's,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.640
gold is the color that conflates wealth and
beauty.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.000
But while in our culture the yellow color
of gold is seen as telling us that wealth

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.320
is beauty and beauty, wealth - in the novel
The Great Gatsby it's a bit different. In

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.710
the novel yellow is the color not only of
wealth but also of death: Myrtle Wilson's

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:49.880
house is yellow, the eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg
-- which stare over so much death in the novel

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.820
in so many ways -- are ringed in yellow glasses,
Gatsby's car -- that fatal missile -- is yellow.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.940
Now that may seem like symbol hunting to you,
but I'd argue that it's really important to

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.860
understand that Fitzgerald is using gold to
decouple the ideas of wealth and greatness,

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.740
and instead he's associating richness with
corruption and amorality and finally death.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.980
In the roaring 20's and today wealth was seen
as profoundly good; it was seen as an end

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.800
that justified most means. Wealth was the
American Dream. But the foul dust that trailed

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.250
in the wake of those dreams - the casual destruction,
the cyclical violence, the erosion of altruism

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.260
-- make it clear that at least to Fitzgerald,
wealth isn't simply good.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.570
The last chapter of The Great Gatsby is one
of the saddest passages in American Literature,

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.790
showing how difficult it is to distinguish
between guilt and innocence, and how intractably

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.610
unfair our society is -- even if we don't have
barons and duchesses.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.240
I mean, some people argue that Gatsby couldn't
live the American Dream because he didn't

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.750
come by his money honestly, but who in the
novel did come by their money honestly?

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.690
And you can argue that Gatsby fails because
nothing is ever enough -- it's not enough for Daisy

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.800
to love him, she must also say that she never
loved Tom.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.480
But this is America, man, when was enough
ever enough for us? We invented super-sizing!

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.980
I mean -- we invented the stretch limousine,
we invented the Hummer, and then we invented

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.210
the Hummer stretch limousine! We all believe,
as Nick says at the end of the novel, "that

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:16.590
if we can only run faster, stretch out our
arms farther, then one fine morning..."

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.440
We've come to believe in this American Dream
not just in the United States but throughout

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.310
the world. We understand that much will be
lost in pursuit of this dream - not just that

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:29.110
butler's noses will be ruined - but that vast
valleys of ashes will pile up outside of our

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.320
cities as we consume ever more stuff. We know
this is unsustainable, we know that these parties

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.800
can't last forever, and that we won't be able to drive home in our three wheeled cars; but still we press on.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.060
Next week we'll consider whether Gatsby's
quest, and ours, is a heroic one, but for

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.630
now I just want to encourage you not to dismiss
the characters in this novel simply because

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.580
they may seem different from you. At one point
Nick recalls all the people who would go to

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:56.740
those great parties and sneer most bitterly
at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.460
Let me submit to you that those of us who
would sneer at Gatsby do so on the courage

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:07.070
of his liquor, because the truth is, we all share his ambition. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.480
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.540
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show was written by me and our graphics

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.730
team is Thought Bubble.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.430
Every week when I might otherwise curse, I
use the name of one of my favorite writers.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.740
If you'd like to suggest writers, you can
do so in comments where you can also ask questions

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.770
about today's video that will be answered
by our team of literature experts.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:29.540
And now I will leave you to observe the abundant
metaphorical resonances of this chair, but

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.600
thanks for watching Crash Course and as we
say in my home town, don't forget to be awesome.
