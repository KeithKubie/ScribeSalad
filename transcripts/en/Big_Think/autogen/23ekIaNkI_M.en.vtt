technology that we use in the lab again
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.840
technology that we use in the lab again
we use each of these different systems

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850
we use each of these different systems
 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.790
we use each of these different systems
depending on the kind of protein that

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
depending on the kind of protein that
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650
depending on the kind of protein that
we're trying to make and how that

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
we're trying to make and how that
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.470
we're trying to make and how that
protein is then made is it made in a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
protein is then made is it made in a
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.100
protein is then made is it made in a
soluble form is it insoluble is the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
soluble form is it insoluble is the
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.920
soluble form is it insoluble is the
protein secreted from the cell is the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
protein secreted from the cell is the
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.200
protein secreted from the cell is the
protein does it reside inside the cell

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
protein does it reside inside the cell
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.770
protein does it reside inside the cell
is the protein a cell surface protein in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
is the protein a cell surface protein in
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.750
is the protein a cell surface protein in
which case it's found on the surface of

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
which case it's found on the surface of
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.569
which case it's found on the surface of
the cell so depending on the kind of

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
the cell so depending on the kind of
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.729
the cell so depending on the kind of
protein we're trying to express that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
protein we're trying to express that
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.980
protein we're trying to express that
really determines the method and how we

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
really determines the method and how we
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.289
really determines the method and how we
will grow or optimize the protein

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299

make sure that we make the target

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
make sure that we make the target
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.510
make sure that we make the target
protein and that's done through

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520
protein and that's done through
 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.999

different technologies such as

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009
different technologies such as
 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.620
different technologies such as
polyacrylamide gels that we get to stain

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
polyacrylamide gels that we get to stain
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990

we can stain for the proteins with a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
we can stain for the proteins with a
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.960
we can stain for the proteins with a
kumasi based stain sometimes we have to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970
kumasi based stain sometimes we have to
 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.670
kumasi based stain sometimes we have to
use like what's referred to as a Western

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
use like what's referred to as a Western
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.789
use like what's referred to as a Western
blot and use an illogical method to see

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
blot and use an illogical method to see
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.130
blot and use an illogical method to see
the protein so our job is to make sure

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
the protein so our job is to make sure
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.050
the protein so our job is to make sure
we're making the target protein of

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
we're making the target protein of
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.810
we're making the target protein of
interest and then that will then go to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
interest and then that will then go to
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.059
interest and then that will then go to
the purification chemists who will

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
the purification chemists who will
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.240
the purification chemists who will
actually purify and make the pure

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
actually purify and make the pure
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.350
actually purify and make the pure
protein

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
protein
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.210
protein
that pure protein thing gets passed into

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220
that pure protein thing gets passed into
 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.890
that pure protein thing gets passed into
the therapeutic area well they will do

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900
the therapeutic area well they will do
 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.620
the therapeutic area well they will do
this assay development it may go to the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630
this assay development it may go to the
 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.360
this assay development it may go to the
structural chemistry group where they

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370
structural chemistry group where they
 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.100
structural chemistry group where they
will try and crystallize and get the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
will try and crystallize and get the
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.560
will try and crystallize and get the
crystal structure of the protein it may

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570
crystal structure of the protein it may
 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.330
crystal structure of the protein it may
go to the therapeutic area where they're

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340
go to the therapeutic area where they're
 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.500
go to the therapeutic area where they're
going to do high-throughput screening

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510
going to do high-throughput screening
 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.380
going to do high-throughput screening
and screen a hundred thousand pfizer

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390
and screen a hundred thousand pfizer
 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.480
and screen a hundred thousand pfizer
compounds a day against the target

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490
compounds a day against the target
 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.720

protein so all of our work is really

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730
protein so all of our work is really
 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.040
protein so all of our work is really
based upon the person before us and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050
based upon the person before us and
 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.230
based upon the person before us and
that's how we work together in teams to

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240
that's how we work together in teams to
 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.590
that's how we work together in teams to
make a drug
