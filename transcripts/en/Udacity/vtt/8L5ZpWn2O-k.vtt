00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.416
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The answer is graph E, this reddish curve right here. We can see that it goes

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:08.588
to the point 4, 0, the point 16, 18, and the point 28, 0. All of the other

00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:12.935
graphs on here go through at least one of these points, but none of the others

00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:17.563
goes through all three. And in fact, remembering that this curve is supposed to

00:00:17.563 --> 00:00:22.117
be the trajectory or the path that Grant's ball takes through the air, the curve

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:26.327
really should look like this. The point down here, 4, 0, is where the ball

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:30.729
leaves the slingshot. The point at the top of the curve is where it goes through

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:34.300
the hoop. And the point down here is where it lands on the ground.
