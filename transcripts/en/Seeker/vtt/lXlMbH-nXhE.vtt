00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:08.710
Chronic diseases like asthma diabetes are
on the rise, could c-sections be to blame?

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:15.710
We’ve talked a lot about the microbiome
here on DNews.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.220
Researchers think that the bacteria that live
in and on us play crucial roles in our lives

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.580
and that an imbalance of microbes might lead
to chronic diseases.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.570
Our first microbes actually come from our
moms when we’re born.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.029
But some kids born via c-section are missing
out on those microbes.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.550
This is because the c-section procedure, or
cesarean section, is when a baby is delivered

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.720
through a surgical incision in the mother's
abdomen and uterus.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.600
And because these babies are not going through
the vagina, the important microbes or researchers

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.210
call them “natural primordial bacteria”
are not transferred to the baby.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.531
So that’s why doctors are swabbing babies
born via c-section with their mother’s vaginal

00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:57.100
microbes in a procedure called microbial transfer.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.490
Before the C-section, doctors swab the mother’s
vagina with a sterile gauze, then two minutes

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.740
after the birth, the baby will be thoroughly
wiped all over with with the microbe laden

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.740
gauze.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.140
In a small study published in the journal
Nature Medicine scientists reported the results

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.710
of such procedures.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.560
The researchers looked at the microbe make-up
of 18 babies a month after birth.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.560
7 were delivered vaginally and 11 were born
via c-section.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.930
and 4 of those who were born via c-section
received a microbial transfer.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.120
The researchers found that those 4 babies
had skin, gut, anal and oral microbe make-ups

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.060
similar to babies born through vaginal birth.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.100
One of the authors of the study Rob Knight
believes that before this kind of surgery,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.490
“every surviving mammal that was delivered
into the world was essentially coated in its

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.020
mother’s vaginal community.”

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.050
So it makes “evolutionary sense” that
these microbes could play a vital role in

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.050
our health.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.260
Babies need microbes because they train our
immune system to fight disease and recognize

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.810
what is harmful and what is harmless.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.170
An untrained immune system can be overly sensitive
and react to benign substances like pollen

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.659
and dust, which can lead to asthma.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.080
And without the initial mixture of mom’s
microbes, our gut microbes can get out of

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.770
balance leading to ulcerative colitis (and
crohns disease?).

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.770
Without these microbes, our metabolism could
be altered, leading to obesity.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.180
Basically, your mom is helping you out from
the start by passing on these microbes to

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.180
you.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.420
And these kind of chronic diseases are on
the rise, as are the rates of cesarean sections.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.160
C-sections births in the United States rose
by over 25% in the last 50 years..

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.370
So if you’re one to make leaps of logic,
you might get where I’m going here.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.530
Although correlation does not necessarily
mean causation.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.670
A study published in the journal Clinical
and Experimental Allergy found that infants

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.800
born through C- section were a whopping 20%
more likely to develop asthma later in life.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.770
And a study published in the British Medical
Journal found that kids who were born via

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.060
C-section had a higher obesity rate of 19.4
percent versus the obesity rate among kids

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.630
delivered vaginally, which is 15.8.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.830
So maybe microbial transfers can curb the
rise of some of these chronic diseases.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.630
While the first study was small, a new study
is in the works that will follow 75 babies

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.260
a year after birth, with plans for an even
larger study following 1200 children for at

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.450
least 3–5 years.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.310
So what I’m saying is, more research is
needed.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.239
If you love microbes as much as I do why don’t
you start your own website at ilovemicrobes.co

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.739
or magnificantmicrobes.com check out those
available domains and more over at domain.com

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.819
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.550
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%
off Domain Dot Com’s names and web hosting

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.140
by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.870
So what does bacteria do for us?
