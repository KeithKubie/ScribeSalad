00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.960
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Of course
you all know Diana's books,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.340
or you wouldn't be here.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.610
But let me say just
a few words about her

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.070
and her remarkably original novels.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.630
They're a bit science fiction,
a lot historical fiction,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.190
and they're all infused with
fantasy, military fiction,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.490
and a very appealing
dose of romance.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.840
A novel by Diana is a
genre all to itself.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.630
And that unique approach to
large canvas, big-brained,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.320
openhearted storytelling has won
her millions of readers worldwide.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.860
She's an Arizona native, part Anglo
American -- thank you, [inaudible],

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.500
yes, [laughter] part
Mexican American.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.150
She has a bachelors
degree in zoology,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.040
a masters in marine biology,
and a PhD in animal behavior,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.700
as well as being an expert

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.610
in scientific computation
and micro-computing.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.100
But don't let that scare you.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.220
[Laughter] She has also
spent her early career

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.950
as a comic book scriptwriter,
and in many ways, she is a woman

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.990
for all seasons, and
a writer for all ages.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.490
As the reviewers have said Diana
writes books that sell like crazy,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.730
and have gathered devoted readers
from every corner of fandom.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.070
By several reckonings, the
"Outlander" series has sold

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.340
about 28 million books -- I
had 25, but she corrected me,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.220
[laughter] since Diana's first
novel was published in 1991.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.470
The series has been translated
into 43 different languages.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.790
You all know the titles,
"Dragonfly in Amber," "Voyager,"

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.710
"The Scottish Prisoner," "The Fiery
Cross," "An Echo in the Bone,"

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.260
"Written in my Own Heart's
Blood," just to mention a few.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.830
They have all been New
York Times bestsellers,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.350
they have won many prizes, and
they have been called "breakneck,"

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.640
"rip-roaring," and,
"totally addictive."

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.200
At the end of the talk, you'll have
a chance to pose questions to Diana

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.890
at one of the microphones
you see set up in the aisles.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.360
So save up your thoughts and ideas.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.660
I need to tell you, though, you
will be on camera and archived

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.540
in the Library of Congress into
perpetuity, [laughter] so make

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.890
that question a smart one.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.580 position:56%
[Laughter] You'll also have a
chance to have Diana sign your books

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.400
at her 1:00 signing session
down on the lower level.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.510
So without further adieu, please
welcome our author of the moment.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:03:04.250
[ Applause ]

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.550
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
Well, thank you, Robert.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.850
I'm going to remember "big-brained,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.710
open-hearted storytelling"
for my next cover blurb.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.210 position:56%
Thank you so much to the organizers,

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.530
and to all of the wonderful
volunteers who have kept me

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.350
from getting lost this morning,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.130
or at least have recovered
me when I was lost.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.090
And thank you to all of you
who could just as easily be

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.160
at home washing your
cars or something.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.360 position:56%
I'm glad you came to see me instead.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.870
Back in the day, when I would go
out at night to do events and talk

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.820
to people, my husband
would say to me, "Well,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.250
doesn't it bother you having
to go out and talk to all

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.100
of these totally strange people?"

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.520
I think he meant "total strangers,"
but [laughter] I said, "Well, no."

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.590
I said, "You know, I've
been a university professor

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.270
for a long time, I'm kind of
used to talking to large crowds."

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.210 position:56%
And I said, "If I can keep people
awake at 8:00 in the morning talking

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.990
about human anatomy and physiology,
I can probably keep them awake

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.110
at 8:00 in the evening if they
came on purpose to hear me."

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.130
Back in the day, I would tell very
large crowds, maybe 400 or so,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.320
because human anatomy
and physiology,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.020
one of my classes, was
a very popular one.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.250
Everybody took it as
a science elective,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.890 position:56%
including the football team, because
they thought it would be easy.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.360
I mean, how hard can it
be; count your fingers.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.430
[Laughs] But anyway, they would
all show up in the morning,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.650
it was an early class, and
they'd all sit in the front row,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.550
sound asleep, these large
inanimate blobs of flesh.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.090
[Laughter] And I would be
standing at a podium like this.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.910
So I would step up and say,
"This morning, gentlemen,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.590
we're going to discuss the
history of contraception."

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.630
And they would all start blinking.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.870
[Laughing] See, "In days of
old when nights were bold

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.410 position:56%
and condoms not invented, they
wrapped old socks around their cocks

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.860
and babies were prevented."

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.510
[Laughter]

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.670
[ Applause ]

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.880
Yes. Well, it worked on
the football players, too.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.770
[Laughter] No; people always say
to me, "Well, how did you get

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.730
from being a scientist, you
know, with all these degrees

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.030
and things to being a novelist?"

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.480
And I said, "Well,
easy, I wrote a book.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.390
I mean, they don't make
you get a license."

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.280
[Laughter] No; but what they
actually mean is well science seems

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.480
all cold, and clinical,
and orderly and tidy,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.790
and white-coded, and,
you know, cold.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.780
And writing, you know,
it's this creative thing,

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.200
it must be all wonderful,
and colorful,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.950
and warm and fuzzy and so forth.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.370
And I'd say, "Well."

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.890 position:56%
No; the thing is science and art
both are two sides of the same coin.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.410
They both rest on the same
thing, which is the ability

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.630
to perceive patterns and
draw patterns out of chaos.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.140 position:56%
When you do science, you define
your chaos by the choice of subject,

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.470 position:56%
you know, your organism, your
ecosystem, whatever you're studying.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.500
And then within that, you try to
define and pick out the patterns

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.200
and explicate them to people.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.240
Same thing when you do a novel,
then you're defining your chaos

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.700
by the subject that you
choose, or the genre,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.940
but also you include
your own internal chaos

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.320
as part of that subject.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.830
And you try to make the
patterns equivalent.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.430
Well, in science, you
come up with a hypothesis.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.910
You say, "I think this is
what's happening in my system,"

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.620
and then you try to support
it by means of experiment.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.750 position:56%
Well, your novel is your hypothesis,
and your experiment is the audience.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.710 position:56%
So you release it upon your audience

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.740
and you see whether they see
the same patterns you do, which,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.850
you know, evidently
you do, so thanks.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.800 position:56%
[Laughter] But as to how I got here,
well, I've known since about the age

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.920
of eight that I was
meant to be a novelist.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.450
This was the age at which I
realized that people write books,

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.620
that they don't just pop out
of the shelves like, you know,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.450
toilet paper in the grocery store.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.120
And so I said, "Well, yes, I
think that's what I should do.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.770 position:56%
I was actually having a conversation
with God about it one day.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.070
I was raised as a Catholic
and they told us, you know,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.470
it's not just to organize prayers,
you know, you should talk to God

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.770
about your life and so forth."

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.370
So at the age of eight,
I was kind of doing that.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.670
We were driving somewhere with
my parents, and I was looking

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.970
at the clouds and so forth.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.270
And, you know, I was
just talking to God.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.410
Anyway, so you know, "I'm thinking
I kind of want to write books,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.370
you know, that would
kind of lift people up."

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.600
That was my best description
of escape fiction, you know,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.040
take a story that would lift
people out of themselves

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.450
and give them a new experience.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.540
Anyway, God said, "Yes; I
think that's a good idea."

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.070
So, you know, [laughter] I
kind of -- people said, "Well,

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.340
how did you find the nerve, you
know, to do this," and I said,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.400
"I was supposed to do this;
that's not a problem."

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.750
But of course, the problem is
always how, because when you set

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.960
out to write a book,
there are no road maps.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.050
I was once in Germany
doing a book tour.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.050
And the publisher, and the
publicist, and, you know,

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.260
all these news people took
me out to lunch together.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.110
And they started asking,
"Well, how did you do this?

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.880
How did you write your novel?"

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.690
And so I explained to them what
I'm about to explain to you.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.060
And they were all shocked.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.770
You know, they said, "No one in
Germany would dream of trying

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.120
to write a novel without first
getting a PhD in literature."

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.960
And I said, "That's probably
why two-thirds of the authors

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.680
in your catalogue are Americans."

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.270
[Laughter] I did not actually say
that because I have better manners,

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.930
but, you know, that's
what I thought.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.800 position:56%
[Laughter] Anyway, the thing is that
anyone who writes a novel is going

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.320
to kind of figure it
out for themselves.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.790
You know, if you want to be
dentist, or a lawyer, or a doctor,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.760
or something, there is a set
curriculum that you take.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.650
You have to enroll in
this particular school,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.620
you have to take these
particular classes,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.880
you pass these particular
formal exams,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.330
and they give you a certificate
that says, "Now you are allowed

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.010
to be a doctor," or whatever.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.740
Okay; you don't need
permission to be a novelist.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.050
This is the good thing.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.870
The bad thing is that there
are no rules to follow either.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.800
And people always have their
own individual take on it.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.710
I don't know a single
author who just sat down

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.300
and became an author overnight.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.050
Most of us have had very checkered
background in one way or another.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.660
I don't know if you're
familiar with Ian Rankin.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.850
He's a Scottish author,
very, very good,

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.820
one of my favorites,
and a good friend, yes.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.030
But before I knew him personally,
I was reading his books,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.730
and I would read the
little bio in the back,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.270
and it would always give
his previous occupations

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.240
as including tax collector
and swine herd.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.930
And [laughter] so when I
finally met him, I said, "Well,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.370
I have to ask Ian what
is it about --

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.970
how did you get to
come a swine herd?

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.550
I don't care how you
got to be a novelist,

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.850
I want to hear about the pigs."

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.900
And he said that well
he was younger,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.750
he and his wife had gotten
jobs as domestic servants

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.650
on a French winery estate.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.870
And his wife took care of
the interior domestic things,

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.220
and he took care of
the outside things,

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.510
including slopping the
hogs, and so forth.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.690
And he said that it was a
very old-fashioned estate.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.350
When they did the harvest, they
actually did in fact strip off

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.860
and stomp the grapes and
everyone got very drunk.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.730
And he said so they did that,
and consequently everyone went

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.390
to sleep it off including him.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.930
Well, when he got up
several hours later,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.380
he realized that he had
not yet fed the hogs.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.810
And so he went out and
he found a large tub full

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.150
of the discarded wine -- or
grape skins from the stomping.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.510
And so he tossed these into
the pigs' trough, and the pigs,

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.940
of course, went after them.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.380
What he hadn't realized was that
the grape skins had been standing

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.110
in the sun for several hours,

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.870
and the pigs all died
of alcohol poisoning.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.170
[Gasping] Yes.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.320
[Laughs] He said that that was the
end of his career as a swine herd,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.870
so I thought I'd better
write novels.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.170
[Laughter] Yes.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.390
Well, luckily, none of my
previous careers have come to quite

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.400
such a dramatic conclusion,
but I have had quite a few --

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.080
let me see, I had the
post-doc appointment

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.140
where my job was to
butcher sea birds.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.450 position:56%
Luckily, I didn't have to kill them,

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.060
they came pre-killed
from Canada and frozen.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.130
But it was my job to take
something like a genet --

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.580
genets are these big diving
birds that have a wing spread

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.970
of about six feet, and they
dive from about 50 feet up.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.690
Consequently, their heads
are made of solid concrete

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.500
because they strike
the water that way.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.970
And so I was supposed to reduce
all of these different birds

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.200
to 15 different body components,
which I could then analyze

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.610
for their protein,
water, and fat content.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.430
Just don't ask why;
but that was my job.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.630
Anyway, I learned to
pluck and reduce a genet

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.160
in about three hours flat.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.000
But the hard part was the head
because you had to use the hammer

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.830
and chisel, you know, to break
the skull and pour the brain out,

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.460
which was part of the
components that we wanted.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.910
That was probably my
most disgusting job.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.890
I couldn't eat fried chicken
for a year after that.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.400
[Laughter] The next one
was a little easier.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.260
I was a post-doc at UCLA replacing
a scientist on sabbatical.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.030
So I took over his lab, and
his six graduate students,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.260
and two Russian scientists
who were studying with him.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.860
And after the Russians left,
the next day an FBI agent showed

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.300 position:56%
up in my office, two of them, with
a little warrant badge and so forth.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.080
And one of them dramatically
introduced himself

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.090
as Special Agent Justice.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.390
And I said, "Of course, you are."

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.290
[Laughter] That actually turned
out to be his real last name.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:48.100
But anyway they wanted to interview
me about this particular Russian.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.960
And I told them about
him, and I said, "Look,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.730
if this gentleman is
the best the KBG can do,

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.330
we have nothing to worry about."

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.170
[Laughter] But then I mentioned the
second Russian, and they said, "Oh,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.470
we didn't know about him."

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.710
And I said, "Maybe we do have
something to worry about."

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.390
But anyway, it was a more
interesting job in that

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:12.380 position:56%
in that one what I had to do was
take high-speed motion picture films

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.850
of boxfish.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.300
And the reason we were doing this
is because -- you may know this,

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.890
those of you who are runners and
so forth, but the more you run

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.310
or the more you exercise,
the more oxygen you use.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.860
So if you take a person or
an animal and you put them

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.920
in a sealed compartment with,
you know, a set amount of oxygen

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.130
and you make them exercise
faster and faster,

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.900
their oxygen consumption goes up,

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.100
the amount of oxygen
in the tank goes down.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.500
And so you get this nice
45-degree angle graph, you know,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.410
more oxygen, more exercise.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.240
Well, boxfish don't do that.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.810
A boxfish, in case you have never
seen one, is very aptly named,

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.080
it's a little box of,
you know, hard shell.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.450
And their fins are
just on the outside.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.880
They're not like regular
fish where they swim

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.330
in this [inaudible] form motion,
they have a strachae form motion

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.920
because they are strachiadae.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.650
So they swim like this, and
their little tail goes like that.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.750
But that's all the
maneuvering they can do.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.350
And the funny thing about them is
if you make a boxfish exercise,

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.120 position:56%
they will go faster, and faster, and
faster, looking agitated as they do.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.400
And they use more and
more oxygen up to a point.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.960
And then they go faster and faster,
but they don't use anymore oxygen.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.610
And so we said, "How
are they doing that?

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:21.910
This is really cool."

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.310
Yes; so the person I was working

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.820
with had several hypotheses
to account for that.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.550
But the first one of those was
maybe they're doing what people do.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.000
You know, when you walk faster
and faster, at some point,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.290
you shift into a run
because that's more efficient

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.590
for the speed you're going.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.890
And at that point, your
oxygen use will drop slightly;

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.460
goes back up if you keep running.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.260
But we were thinking maybe these
guys are doing something special

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.560
with their fins.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.590
So I was having to do
high-speed motion pictures.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.680
Well, this was back in
the 1980s, the late 1980s.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.230
Consequently, I had to shoot
my film, and then take it

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.300
to the CBS TV Studio
to have it processed.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.400
We talked them into it
as a public service.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.490
So you know, I would go down
behind the Johnny Carson Show stage

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.460
and give them my fish films,
and then I would go back

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.760
and pick them up the next day.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.130 position:56%
It was an interesting place to work.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.230
Also it was -- we lived in Burbank,

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:16.560 position:56%
and this is when I started writing
Walt Disney comic books on the side.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.230
I'd been reading comic books
since I was three years old;

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.070
that's how my mother
taught me to read.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.560
And I kept on reading them.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.920
And while I was working at
UCLA, I had picked up one

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.520
at the grocery store, and I
said, "Well, this is pretty bad,

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.160
I bet I could do better myself."

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.950
And such was my state of mind that
I found out the name of the editor

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.070
who handled that line and I wrote
him this very rude letter saying,

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.040
"Dear Sir, I have been reading
your comic books for 25 years.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.620
They've been getting
worse and worse."

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.280
I said, "I'm not sure that
I could do better myself,

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.600
but I'd like to try."

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.820
And luckily, I hit a man
named Dell O'Connell,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.360
who was a gentleman
with a sense of humor.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.930 position:56%
He wrote back and said, "Okay, try."

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.610
And he sent along a format

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.460
so I could see what shape
the manuscript should be.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.760
So I wrote him a story.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.420
He didn't buy it, but he did
something much more valuable,

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.970
he told me what was wrong with it.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.340
So he did buy my second story and
he continued to buy my stories

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.370
for another 18 months, at the
end of which the powers that be

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.710
at Disney said, "We've got 40 years
of Carl Barks scripts in our file;

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.010
why are we buying new ones?"

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.520
And they stopped buying new ones.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.530
But so that was my
short-lived comic book career.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.520
But I still get a dozen or so
stories out of it, which was good

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.910
when I contrast with
what I was doing at work.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:28.360 position:56%
Anyway, I had to build a water
tunnel and make the fish swim in it.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.030
It has a fan at one end.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.530
And fish will normally face into
a current, so it was not a problem

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.050
to get them going in
the right direction.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.340 position:56%
But you would turn on the fan and
they would start swimming like this,

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.700
and you'd turn it up, and
they'd swim like this.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.810
And then you turn it up,
and they'd be going --

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.110
and finally they'd be
going [makes sounds].

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.320 position:56%
And they just fall over backwards,
in which you would instantly turn it

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.130
out and pull them out with a net
and take them off to recover.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.990
You know, we were not killing them.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.390
And then, you know, you would
process the film and so forth.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.720
So that's what I spent
another few years doing.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.250
But at the age of 35, I
said to myself, "Well,

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.290
you know, Mozart was dead at 36.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.050
If you want to write a book,
maybe you should get started."

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.120
And so I said, "Okay;
on my next birthday,

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.960
I will begin writing a book."

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.950
I didn't -- I had to this point,
written all kinds of things.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.250
I'd written, you know,
doctoral dissertations.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:20.830
My PhD dissertation was
titled "[Inaudible],"

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.660
or as my husband says,
"Why Birds Build Nests

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.960 position:56%
Where They Do and Who Cares Anyway?"

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.220 position:56%
[Laughter] But, you know, it was a
400-page dissertation, or let's see,

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.270
an 800-page monograph on
dietary habits of the birds

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.940
of the Colorado River Valley.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.210
You might notice a trend here,
you know, 400 pages, 800 pages.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:48.040
But I also, you know, wrote
a computer documentation.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.890
I wrote software reviews
for the computer press, and,

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.910
you know, other things like this.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.000
Back in the day, my
father would say to me,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.560
"You're such a poor
judge of character.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.340
You're bound to marry
some bum," he said,

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.080 position:56%
"so be sure you get a good
education to support your children."

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.330
[Laughter] This is how I ended
up with three science degrees.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.740
But, you know, I still wanted
to write novels and so forth.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.000
But in the course of my previous
career, I had gotten all kinds

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.260
of experience in writing,
just not writing novels.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.070
I did not marry a bum, I married a
very nice man whom I still have 45

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:24.870
years later, and -- thank you.

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.320
[ Applause ]

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.020
And my husband thanks you.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.240
[Laughs] But he did
quit work three months

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.280
after our first child was born in
order to start his own business.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.650
And I do have to say that
between an entrepreneur and a bum,

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.280
there's not that much to choose
in terms of financial stability.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.260 position:56%
Now, luckily, his business got going
fairly quickly and did quite well.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.190
But for the first two or three
years, I was our sole support,

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.510
and they don't assistant
biology professors that much.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.070
So at this point, the need
to earn extra money arose.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.190
And so I said, "Well, what can I
do to earn a little extra money,

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.480
you know, other than
prostitution in the home?"

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.150 position:56%
And [laughter] I said, "Well, I
know how to write, I mean, you know,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.880
I'm grammatical, I know
punctuation, all that.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.890
And I know quite a
lot about computers."

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.890
This happened as an accident when
I was -- all of the, you know,

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.760
things in my life have
happened as accidents,

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.470
including meeting my husband; I
met him in the French horn section

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.760
of the Arizona marching band.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.140
[Laughter] But anyway, in
this particular instance,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.810
the accident had more to
do with my job, that is,

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.510
I was hired at Arizona
State University

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.150
because they had money
allocated for the position.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.630
But as they said, "We have this
money, but it's soft money.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.500
If we don't spend it, they'll
take it away, so you're hired."

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.860
And they said, "This is
how government works,

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.870
in case you were wondering."

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.250
And they were saying, "So we
don't actually have anything

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.550
for you to do.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.790
We would like for you to
develop your own research.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.840
But while you're doing it,
maybe you could help Bob here

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.140
who is the assistant professor

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.440
and the assistant director
with his data."

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.680
Said, "ob has, you know, ten years'
worth of data in his back room.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.960 position:56%
And you have a computer background,"

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.660
by which they meant I have one
class in Fortran programming.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.210
[Laughter] But it was one more than
any of them had, and so they said,

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.910
"So you can help Bob get
his data into the computer."

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.020
This was like 1981.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.640
"Macro computers," as they were
called, were just barely coming

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.030
into offices and universities at
the time, and they still thought

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.600
that you poured data in the top,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.250
and then you got reports
out at the bottom.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.090
So it was my job how to figure out
how to get the top off the computer

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.390
and get the data into it.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.420
So I spent the next 18 months of
my life writing Fortran programs

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.120
to analyze the contents
of bird gizzards.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.040
There's actually a reason
why I'm telling you this.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.360
There's a reason why
I write long books,

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.660
it's because I like digressions.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:54.870
But [laughter] anyway at the end
of this 18 months of work I said,

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.620
"There's maybe five other people in
the entire world who are interested

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.620
in bird gizzards, but it would
save each of them 18 months' worth

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.890
of work if they knew about
these programs I've written."

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.400 position:56%
I was thinking, "There must be other
people out there who are, you know,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.830
employing this new tool,
computers, and doing science.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.740
Why is there no way in
which we can communicate?"

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.330
So I took out a little
ad in the newsletters

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.990
of all the scientific
societies I could find,

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.290
and I explained what I was doing.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.300
And I said I know there are other
people out there doing this.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.600
Why won't you write to me?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.740 position:56%
If there's enough of us, maybe we
can put together a little newsletter

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.040
of our own."

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.230
So I got 300 letters in two months.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:32.530
And I took these to the director
of my center, and I said, "Well,

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.600
I'm not having any luck
getting money out of the NSF,

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.410
but I think I've started
something here.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.290
Can you front me a little
money from petty cash

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:39.640
and I'll see what I can do?"

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.520
So he gave me $250.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.010
I printed up some brochures and I
took them to the next conference

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.200
that I was going to, and handed
them out on the floor to people.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.560
Well, I raised enough money
in charter subscriptions

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.380 position:56%
to start Science Software Quarterly,
which was a scholarly journal

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.570
for scientists who used computers
in their work, which was fun.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.970
Anyway, I ran that for about eight
years and I developed, you know,

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.290
seminars for an international
group of scientists who wanted

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.800
to come learn about
laboratory automation,

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.870
and data acquisition,
and that kind of stuff.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.470
All of which is just
to explain how it was

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.650
that I had a second
career at the time.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.510
So I was teaching, and I
was a university professor,

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.160
and I was doing my own research,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.770
but I also developed
this secondary career.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.500
When the need for extra
money arose, I said, "Okay;

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.620
I know about computers
and I can write."

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.440
So I wrote a quick query letter to
Byte, and Info World, and PC Mag,

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.610
and I sent it with a copy of
my Science Software Quarterly,

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.470
and a copy of a comic book that
I had done for Walt Disney called

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.640
"Nutrition Adventures with
Orange Bird [phonetic]."

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.190
And it was a real short query.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.670
It said, "Dear sirs, as you
can see from the enclosed,

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.140
you won't find anyone who
knows more about scientific

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.940
and technical software than
I do, and at the same time,

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.040
can write so as to appeal to
a broad popular audience."

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.820
Well, this got immediate results,
and, you know, within a few months,

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.770
I was making as much freelancing
for the computer press as I was

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.530
at the university, which just goes

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.960
to show how badly they
pay assistant professors.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.540
But anyway, at the time, when I
made up my mind to write a book,

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.190
I was 36 years old, I
had two fulltime jobs

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.840
and three children
under the age of six.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.470
So I don't want anyone telling me

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.270
that they don't have
time to write a book.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.460
[Laughter] If you want to write
a book, you'll make the time.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.380
I mean, nobody finds time; it's not
just lying around in the street.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.230
Unfortunately, you have to
make it, or you don't have any.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.190
But, you know, the
time and so forth.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.420
And the question is always -- says
a lot of people, especially women,

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.630
they said, "I can't justify taking
time away from my family, you know,

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.330
to be doing something
like writing, you know,

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.950
this frivolous silly thing."

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:42.330
And my first question is,
"Do you watch television?"

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.740
And I said, "Okay; I do
feel like that's a waste

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.840
of your time because,
you know, it's a choice.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.300
Why don't you take one of the hours
you would spend watching television

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.230
and work on your book?"

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.080
Because it's fairly simple.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.210
I was talking to Rick Rankin,
one of the new cast members

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.680
for the "Outlander" TV show.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.230
He was -- oh yes he's very
nice; he's really charming.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.830
Yes; he sort of walked into
the makeup room, spotted me.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.130
We had never met before.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.830
He walked over and kissed me
and I said, "Really, okay."

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.130
Well, [laughter] Scotsmen
are different, yes.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.040
They all do that, actually.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.200
But anyway, he was talking to me
later about writing and so forth.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.500
And he said, "You know,
I've always wanted

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.800
to write a book, but,
you know, time."

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.230
I said, "Look," I said, "if
you have ten minutes a day,

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.150
and you can do it every
day, you can write a book."

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.770
I said, "Take that
ten minutes and write.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.850
Okay; if that's all you've
got, that's all you've got.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.150
But do it the next day."

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.710
I said, "If you write
ten minutes every day,

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.670
you will have a book within a year.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.570
It may not be a big book,
but you'll have a book."

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.810
I said, "If you don't do
that, you won't have a book.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.110
It's that simple.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.410
You know, you'll have time.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.060
It doesn't have to be
a big amount of time."

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.360
Lots of people think, "Oh,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.500
I can't possibly write unless
I have eight hours a day,

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.200
and individual support, and a
room of my own, and, you know,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.570
everybody is keeping everybody
away from me so that I can write."

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.140
And it kind of doesn't
work that way.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.490
You know, you write any way
is what it comes down to.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.350
So anyway, I kind of knew that
because of what else I was doing.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:06.940
And so I just involved the
writing into my regular routine.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:12.030
But I went immediately to think,
"What am I going to write?"

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.000
And because I read
everything, and lots of it.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.550
And I said, "Well, maybe I should
write a mystery; I love mysteries."

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.570
And I said, "No; mysteries
have plots.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.030
I'm not sure I can do that."

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.670
And -- [laughter] well I never had.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.150
And so I said, "Okay; what's
the easiest thing to write?"

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.620
No point making it hard.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.920
And so I thought, "Well, for me,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.090
maybe a historical novel would
be the easiest thing to write.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.910
I was a research professor; I
knew my way around a library.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:39.170
I said, "It seems easier to look
things up than to make them up."

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.750
And if I turn out that I have no
imagination, I can steal things

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.960
from the historical record,"
which actually works pretty well.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.470
And so I said, "All
right, historical novel;

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.210
where shall I set this," because
I've got no background in history,

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.900
just the six hours of Western
Civilization they make you take

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.220
as an undergraduate.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.790
And so any time would
do as well as another.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.570
And so I said, "Okay;
let me think about this."

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.180
And so I was thinking, you know,
"15th century Venice, you know,

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.290
American Civil War, what
sounds interesting?"

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.000
Well, in this malleable
frame of mine,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.340
I happened to see a really old Dr.
Who rerun on public television.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.290
And this -- thank you.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.710
Yes; it was one of
the really old ones.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.760
It was Patrick Troughton,
the second doctor.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.080
For those of you who may not
be familiar with "Dr. Who,"

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.460
it's a really old, really
long-running show done in the UK.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.580
Originally, it was a kids'
show, but now much more adult.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.860
The thesis, or the
premise of the show is

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.110
that the doctor is a time
lord from the planet Galifre,

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.800
who travels through space
and time having adventures.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.630
And along the way, he
picks up companions

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.580
from different periods
of Earth's history.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.880
Well, in this particular show,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.960
he had picked up a young
Scotsman from 1745.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.830
And this was a, you know,
nice looking young man

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.130
who appeared in his kilt.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.000
And I said, "That's
rather fetching."

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.320
[Laughter] And I found
myself still thinking

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.450
about this the next day in church.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:58.260
And I said, [laughter] "Well, you
know, you want to write a book,

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.560
it doesn't really matter.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.710
Fine, let's start there,
Scotland, 18th century."

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.890
So that's where I began,
knowing nothing about Scotland

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.960 position:56%
or the 18th century, having no
plot, no outline, and no characters,

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.380
just the rather vague images
conjured up by the notion of a man

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.860
in a kilt, which is, of course, a
very powerful and compelling image.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:20.660
[Laughter] In fact, some
years later, my sixth book,

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.160
which was a very lucky book
for me, it won several awards,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.800
including the Corine International
Prize for Fiction, which is cool.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.730
And I got to go to
Germany to accept it.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.420
Well, while I was there, the
German editor had me interviewed

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.520
by everybody in the German
media from, you know,

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.630
the tabloid newspapers on up.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.750 position:56%
And toward the end of this very long
week, I was talking to a nice man

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.050
from a literary magazine.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.500
And he said, "Oh, I've read
all of your work, you know,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.060
your characters are
so three-dimensional.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.520
Your narrative drive is tremendous.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.400
You know, your imagery,
it's just transcendent."

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.180
I'm thinking, "Yes, yes, go on."

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.170
[Laughter] And instead he said,
"There's just this one thing,

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:57.870 position:56%
I wonder, can you explain to me what
is the appeal of a man in a kilt?"

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.240
[Laughter] Well, he was
a man, and a German.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.620
And anyway, I was really tired
or might not have said it,

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.420
but I just looked at him
for a minute and I said,

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.020
"I suppose it's the
idea that you could be

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.510
up against a wall with
him in a minute."

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:21.040
[ Laughter ]

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:27.100 position:56%
Yes; so that is actually in case
any of you gentlemen were wondering.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.000
[Laughter] But anyway, a
man in a kilt, as I say.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.580
So that's why I chose Scotland,
and that is why I chose Scotland

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.360
in the 18th century,
you know, there it is.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.350
[Laughter] So anyway, I went
immediately to the library

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.920
and began looking up
Scotland in the 18th century.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.400
Now, the only thing I actually knew
about books or writing a novel was

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.720
that it should have conflict.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.030
You know, I had a minor in
English and that was the sole sum

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.290 position:56%
of my knowledge from that, conflict.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.460
And so you don't look for conflict
in Scotland in the 18th century

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.510
for very long without running smack
into [inaudible] Prince Charlie

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.810
and the Jacobite Rebellion.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.110
And I said, "Well,
that looks like plenty

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.800
of conflict, fine, we'll use them."

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.620
And so that's where I began.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.200
I was just doing research at the
same time as I was writing, and,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.330
you know, just beginning
feeble stabs at writing.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.080
I was just putting down bits
and pieces of, you know,

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.970
just vaguely imagined things
with my man in a kilt.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.100
And none of those ever made
it into the published book.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.550
But as I was working with this,
I was thinking, "Well, you know,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.860
essentially it's Scots
versus English here.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.930
And I must have a lot of Scotsmen,
of course, for the kilt factor.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:31.540
But it would be a good idea
if I had a female character

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.180 position:56%
to play off these guys, you know,
sexual tension, that sort of thing."

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.110
I said, "So if I make
her an English woman,

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.120
we will have lots of conflict."

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.400
So on the third day of writing,
I introduced this English woman,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.730
no idea who she was, what she was
doing there, or how she was going

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.280
to carry out on the story.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.790 position:56%
But I loosed her into a cottage full
of Scotsmen to see what she'd do.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.040
Well, she walked in,
and they were all seated

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.390
around the fire muttering
to each other.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.690
They turned around, stared at her.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.250
And I'm thinking, "Why,
does she look funny?

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.550
You know, what's going on here?"

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.320
Anyway, one of them drew
himself up and he said,

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.360
"My name's Dugal McKenzie,
and who are you?"

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.380
And she looked up and without my
stopping to think I just typed,

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.400
"My name is Claire Elizabeth
Beecham, and who the hell are you?"

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.730
[Laughter] And I said,
"Okay; you don't sound at all

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.430
like an 18th century person."

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.160
So I fought with her in several
pages trying to beat her into shape

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.680
and make her talk like
an 18th century person.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.970
But she wasn't having any,
she just kept making smart ass

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.270
modern remarks.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.650
And she also took over and
started telling the story herself.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.230
And I said, "Okay;
I'm not going to fight

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.530
with you all the way
through this book."

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:31.980
I said, "No one's ever
going to see this.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.600
It doesn't matter what bizarre
thing I do, go ahead and be modern

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.530
and I'll figure out how
you got there later."

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:41.300
So it's all her fault that
there's time travel in these books.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.160
[Laughter] But you know, once
having made that decision,

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.760
well obviously anything else went.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:49.160
So, you know, while the historical
background is as accurate

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.920 position:56%
as history itself is, which means --

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.000
which is to say not
necessarily all the truth,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.230
but it was all the truth,
it was written down.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.370
Anyway, the background
is very accurate.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:03.180
But part of the art of
immersion in popular fiction is

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.530
by making little connections

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.280
with your readers amongst those
details they can identify with.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.420
And I can tell you
what, if you are very,

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.320
very good at making the details
of daily life believable,

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.950 position:56%
then your readers will follow you
right over a cliff when you ask them

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:17.250
to believe in time travel.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.730
[Laughter] That's how you do it.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.940
So there is a lot of research
involved in these books, but,

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.730
you know, I was a research
professor and that's how it works.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.240
Well, let's see, how
are we doing for time?

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.100
Okay, we have two minutes before
we start questions and so forth.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.430 position:56%
So that is just about enough time
to explain how I got from this point

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.070
to actually being published,

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.410
because this was this book I
was never going to show anyone.

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:41.370
Well, what happened was that
owing to my computer background

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.410
and so forth, I had stumbled
into a group of people called the

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.850
"CompuServe Literary Forum."

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.050
It was just by accident while
I was doing research for one

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.680 position:56%
of the software reviews I was doing.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.130
And this was like a 24-hour
electronic cocktail party amongst

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.430
people who liked books.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.240
There are many, many
readers, and some writers

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.710
of all degrees of ability.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.180
But, you know, it was
a great place --

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.200
and for someone with two social --

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.660
two fulltime jobs and
three small children,

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.700
it was the ideal social life.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.960
So I signed on and was
hanging around there.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.360
Well, I was certainly
not going to tell any

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.360
of these people what I was doing,
but one day, I found myself engaged

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.310
in an ongoing argument
with a gentleman

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.950
about what it feels
like to be pregnant.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.510
And [laughter] he said, "Oh,
I know what that's like,

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.170
my wife's had three children."

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.100
And I laughed.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.380
I said, "Yes, buster," I said,
"I've had three children."

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.500
And he said, "Well, can you
tell me what it's like?"

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.930
I said, "I can, yes, but
it's kind of complex.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.230
I don't think I could fit it

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.940
in a 30-line message
slot," which is what we had.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.240 position:56%
I said, "I'll tell you what, though,

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.570
I have this little piece
I wrote a few months ago

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:42.620
in which a woman tells her brother

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.510
in some detail what it's
like to be pregnant."

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.720
I'll put it up for
you and you can see.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.900
So I put up this piece in order
to win the argument, which I did.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.370
And everyone who had been
following the argument went

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:53.670
and read the piece.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:54.970
And they came rushing back.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:56.270
And they said, "This
is great, what is it?"

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.570
And I said, "I don't know."

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.320
And they said, "Well,
where's the beginning?"

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.830
And I said, "I haven't
written that yet."

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.350
And they said, "Well,
put up some more of it."

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.460
So over time, I began putting
up more little pieces, just --

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.060
I don't write in a straight line
and I don't write with an outline,

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.860
I write where I can
see things happening.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.240 position:56%
But if I had a piece that I thought
was, you know, comestible as it was,

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.110
you know, fit for human
consumption, I would put it

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.540
up every two or three months.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.140 position:56%
People got more and more interested.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.320 position:56%
Anyway, the bottom line is that a
friend online who had read my pieces

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.160
and the response to them said,

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.820
"I know you must be ready
to look for an agent.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.650
Would you like me to
recommend you to mine?"

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.040
And I had actually researched
his agent and I said,

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.760
"That would be great,
John, thank you."

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.160
And I was afraid that John
would leave CompuServe or be run

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.200
over by a bus before I finished the
book, so I said, "Yes, go ahead."

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.530
And so he wrote -- Perry
Nolton was the agent's name,

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.710
he wrote Perry a nice note saying,

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.340
"Everybody thinks this woman
is hilarious, you know,

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.970
she's probably worth looking at."

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.820
And I followed that with my own
note and I said, "Dear Mr. Nolton,

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.210 position:56%
I've been writing and selling
nonfiction by myself for some years,

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.990
but I understand now that I need
a good literary representation.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.460
You've been recommended
to me by John,

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.760
and Judy and all these people."

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.910
I said, "I have this
very long novel.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.210
I don't want to waste your time.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.510
Would you be willing to
read excerpts from it?"

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:05.210 position:56%
I didn't tell him I wasn't done
writing it; excerpts were all I had.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.970
[Laughter] But he very
kindly called back

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.560
and said yes he would read your
excerpts, and the basis was --

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.560
he took me on, on the basis
of an unfinished first novel,

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.640
which was not common then,
and is not common now,

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.500
either, but very lucky for me.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.840
Anyway, in the fullness of time,
I didn't finish writing the book,

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.400 position:56%
and I gave it to him and I said, "I
can tell there's more to this story,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.710
but I thought I should stop
while I could still lift it."

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.070
And he said, "Okay."

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.720
And I said, "But you could
tell people there's more

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.020
if they're interested."

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.900
So luckily, he sent it out to
five editors who he thought might

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.910 position:56%
like it, and within four days, three
of them had called back with offers

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.750
to buy it, which was also lucky.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.420
So he negotiated amongst them
for two weeks and came back

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.720
with a three-book contract.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.520
And bing, I was a novelist.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:53.270
[ Applause ]

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.950
Great; well thank you very much.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.850
Well, I think we have now
reached the time for questions.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.770
And we have this enterprising
young man

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.260
who has got the microphone already.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.380
We have a microphone at the
beginning of each aisle,

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.790
so any of you who are interested

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.000
in asking a question,
you can come up there.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.880
Okay, yes, sir.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.380
&gt;&gt; Well, Diane, I love the modern
world, and yesterday my muse

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.610
and I beamed you into our kitchen.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.510
So I met you yesterday already.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:17.810
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Hmm.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.110
&gt;&gt; I come from New Zealand.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.410
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh, yes; yes.

00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:26.220
&gt;&gt; And we've spent the last three
years doing the third polish

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.180
on something that I've
been working on.

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.760
And I love your story about
how you got an attorney.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.410
So how many books have you sold?

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:37.090
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: How many books;
28 million is the latest estimate.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:38.390
&gt;&gt; Well, congratulations.

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:40.020
So you --

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.440
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.740
[Laughs]

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.040
&gt;&gt; Yes; anyway, that
was my question,

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.520
how many books have you sold?

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.460
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: That
was an easy one; thank you.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.230
Perfect; and you, sir?

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:55.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I am a recent convert -- [laughs]

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.520
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.820
&gt;&gt; To your books.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.120
My wife introduced me to them.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.420
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Wonderful; yes.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.720
&gt;&gt; And they're quite enjoyable.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.260
I'm a history teacher.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:08.010
So as you're writing these books
and as you see these progress --

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.310
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.240
&gt;&gt; I know there's a nice
book coming out sometime?

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.540
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Sometime, yes.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.840
[Laughter]

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.040
&gt;&gt; Can you give us any hints
on where that may take us,

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.350
what location the main
characters may be at?

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.650
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh, where
may the next book take us --

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:24.950
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.250
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: In terms
of time, location, et cetera?

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.550
&gt;&gt; Yes; yes.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:28.970
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Well, vaguely,
yes, we are in North Carolina.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.970 position:56%
He's asking about the ninth book and
what hints I can give you about it.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.200
I have a title for it, it's called,
"Go Tell the Bees that I am Gone."

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.680
And that comes from a -- thank you.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.190
It comes from a bit of
beekeeping lure, which is common

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.980
to the Celtic countries,
but you find it also

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.420
in other parts of Europe
and America.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.430
And it's based on the idea
that if you are a beekeeper,

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.330
you tend to your hives every day.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.480
And since bees are social insects,
they need to know what's going

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.050
on in the community,
not just their own hive.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.000
So you tell them the
news of your community,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.910 position:56%
who's come into the community, who's
gone, who's been born, who's died,

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.060
what's going on, because if you
don't and the bees find out,

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.980
they'll be angry and swarm and fly
away, and you won't have any honey.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.650
So you always go and tell
the bees what's going on.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.750
Now, as to who is gone, or
where they are going, and when

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.370
or if ever they will come
back, that we don't know.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.080
It may apply to more than one
person, I can tell you that much.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.380
[Laughs]

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.420
&gt;&gt; That was the other question
was who is going to tell the bees?

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.720
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Who is going --

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.020
&gt;&gt; Yes. [Laughter]

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.320
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes;
well, I don't know.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.410
Clara's usually the beekeeper,
but, you know, on the other hand,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.820
if it's her that's going, she
would be telling someone else

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.970
to go tell the bees that I've gone.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.840
Yes; on the other hand,
there might be someone else

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.250
and she's telling the
bees about them.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.740
Or as I say, there might
be more than one person.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.120
[Laughter] Yes.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.420
Thank you.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.310
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, Diana.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.610
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Hi.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:46.910
&gt;&gt; I just want -- I'm
sorry, I'm short.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:50.030
For one thing, I want to say
congratulations on being a granny.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.330
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
Oh, thank you so much.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.930
Yes; I am a new grandmother.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.230
[Laughter]

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.790
&gt;&gt; But I also wanted to
ask how much were you aware

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:02.870
of early American history of
what was going on, you know,

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:04.970
in terms of colonial times,
the American Revolution

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:08.600
and so forth before you actually
started approaching that?

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.950
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh, how much did
I know about early American history

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:13.470
and revolutionary times before
I began writing the books?

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.770
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.070
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh,
just what you would learn

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.370
in elementary school
in the 1960s, yes; yes.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.670
&gt;&gt; So was there anything --

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:19.970
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Which
is a heck of a lot more

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.490 position:56%
than you'd learn now, I'll tell you.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:22.790
[Laughter]

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.090
&gt;&gt; Well, it depends on location.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:25.390
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.350
&gt;&gt; But how much -- did anything
surprise you that you came across?

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.650
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Did
anything surprise me

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.950
from the things that
I learned later?

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.250
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.550
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh, yes,
all kinds of things, but --

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.320
yes, I'm trying to think
of anything in particular.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.650
Well, I know more about George
Washington's false teeth now

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:37.950
than I did.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.250
They weren't necessarily
all made of hippopotamus,

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.800
I agree, but a lot of them were.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.670
Yes; no you learn all
kinds of interesting things

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:47.490
like General Nathaniel Greene
was a Quaker by profession,

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:50.970 position:56%
which makes it rather odd that he
became a revolutionary or a general.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.900
But it turns out that
as he was growing up,

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.020
his father disliked books.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.550
And he forbade his son to read

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.850
because he thought books would
separate you from God, you know,

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.730
by distracting you and so forth.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.950
And young Nathaniel
didn't bide with this

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.940
so he snuck off and read anyway.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.370
But this vision, you know, made
him decide that he didn't want

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:11.440
to be a Quaker anymore if they were
so narrow-minded not to read books.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.990
Now, of course, they weren't
all, but his father was.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.260
Anyway, so that's what caused
him to go off and read.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.490
And what he was reading
was military history.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:21.340
And he became more and more engaged
in this and finally, he said,

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.640
"All right, I'm not
a Quaker anymore.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.100
I'm going to take up military."

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.770
And he was a very good general.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.070
Yes.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.370
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:30.670
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: You're welcome.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.970
Yes, yes.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.270
&gt;&gt; Hi, Diana.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.570
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Hi.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:35.870
&gt;&gt; I'm from Havelock,
North Carolina.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:37.170
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh, very nice.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:38.470
&gt;&gt; And I know you've been
there because you went

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:39.770
for the 300th anniversary
of New Bern.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.360
And my question to you is how
did you come across wanting

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.410
to have Jamie and Clare Frazier go
to Frazier Ridge in North Carolina?

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:50.860
Why that spot; why there?

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:55.110
And the other part of the question
is if the filming keeps continuing,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.220
if you could have them film
in New Bern, North Carolina,

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.970
[laughter] because we would love to
have them there by Triumph Palace

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.740
to be able to do some of that.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.140
And because in Scotland, you just
don't experience the heat you do

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.800
in eastern North Carolina, so.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.130
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes, yes, yes.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.420
Yes; the question was
first how did I come

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.930
to set Frazier's Ridge
in North Carolina?

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:18.140
And the second is can I arrange
to have part of the show filmed

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.100
in North Carolina for
the next season?

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.530
Yes; that unfortunately
is beyond my control.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.380
And part of it is that they have
this huge studio in Cumbernauld,

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.830
which is just outside Glasgow,

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.210
which expands with each
season, so it's immense.

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:33.210
And they do all of the indoor
shooting, and I guess some

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.570
of the outdoor shooting
actually within this facility.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.760
So they're not going
to go build another one

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.700
in North Carolina is
the bottom line.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.900
Excuse me.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:46.180
As for the outer stuff, there are
parts of Scotland that can be used,

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:50.110
but they also have another
European location that they can use

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.660
for the more forested
parts of things.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.780
The thing also is that "Outlander"
is not a union show; you don't have

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.760
to be in the UK, whereas you pretty
much do need to be in the States.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.360
And so just the legalities
involved in that, plus the taxes,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.520
plus the idea of moving a
production that size all the way

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.110
to North Carolina,
no, not happening.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:11.190
But as for why I set them there,

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:13.570
that's where the Scots
went after Colladen.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.960 position:56%
The -- many people were transported.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.420
Many people left voluntarily

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.620
because there was nothing
left for them in Scotland.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:26.970
Excuse me, I've had a cold
all week, so there we go.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:33.090 position:56%
Yes, all right; so about half the
Scottish immigrants went up straight

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:36.630
up the coast to Prince Edward
island and Nova Scotia.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:39.360 position:56%
So it's called Nova Scotia and New
Scotland, that's where they settled.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.080
But the other half went straight
up the Cape Fear River --

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.830
that's okay, I've got
a drink, thank you;

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.380
went straight up the Cape Fear
River and into the mountains

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.110
of North Carolina and Tennessee,

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.430
because the mountains
reminded them of Scotland.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:54.360
And so that's why Frazier's Ridge
is within ten miles of Boon,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.350
but I couldn't tell
you in which direction.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.070
Yes; yes, yes.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.110
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name's Karen.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.410
I am an [inaudible].

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:02.710
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.010
[Laughs]

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.310
&gt;&gt; I write for the
"Outlander" cast blog.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.610
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Lovely.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.400
&gt;&gt; So this question is for
-- on behalf of everybody.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.980
And I am going to blatantly steal
something from the first session.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.280
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.430
&gt;&gt; And then I'm going
to add my own to that.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:16.730
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Okay.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.810
&gt;&gt; How much time do you spend
thinking, that was the question.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.680
And where do you do it best?

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.260
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: How much
time do I spend thinking,

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.650
and where do I do it best?

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.790
I think all the time; I mean, yes.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.540
If you mean about books, I still
think about books all the time,

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.250
it's just in the back of my mind.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.700
And, you know, I'm doing other
things, of course, but every once

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.310
in a while, I would just get
an idea and it pops into place.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.990
And as my husband says, "You have
that goofy look on your face again.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:39.300
Are you having book ideas?"

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.900
And I say, "Yes."

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.840
So I mean, it's -- I don't have

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.330
like regimented hours during
which I think, you know.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.970
And likewise, I don't have a
place as far as the writing goes.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:55.320
All I need is a laptop computer and
I'm not there, I'm within the book

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.750
so I can actually do it anywhere.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.090
I've done it in halls like
this, and in airports and,

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:00.710
you know, pretty much anywhere.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:02.350
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for all of that.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.650
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: You're welcome.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.430
&gt;&gt; For the kilts, and
for that visual about up

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.310
against the wall in a minute.

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:08.610
[Laughter] Thank you, thank you.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:09.910
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Feel free.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.210
[Laughs] Thank you.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.510
And you; yes.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:16.860
&gt;&gt; Hi. I wrote my question down
because that's usually how I go.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.780 position:56%
Where did you get the idea of giving
Briana and Roger's daughter, Mandy,

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.450 position:56%
the ability to sense Jim's location,

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:25.990
and will that be built
upon in the new book?

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:29.370
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh, where did
I get the idea of allowing Mandy,

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.960
Roger and Briana's daughter,
to sense Jimmy's location,

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.210
and will that be used
in future books?

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:41.330
Well, plainly it will, yes, but as
to where it was, it was just there.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.630
Excuse me.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:45.740
Yes, I mean, she just said
that, "I can feel him."

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.360
And I was thinking, "Oh,
well, of course you can."

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.330
You know, and I wondered if it
was reciprocal, which it turned

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.900
out to be, you know,
that they both can.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.750
The hypothesis here would be
that we know that the ability

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.420
to time travel is genetic.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.250 position:56%
And well, I mean, me think about it,

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.860
how many of you can
roll your tongues?

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.020
You just go [makes
sound], okay you go, okay.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.580
If you can't do it,
then you can't do it.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:09.880
That's all there is to it.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.330
You can think about it all
you want, but you can't do it.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.650 position:56%
And the same thing with time travel,
if you are genetically endowed

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.630
to do that, you can do
that, otherwise you can't.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:22.290
But anyway so I assume that you
must have one gene to time travel.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.220
Briana has one gene from Claire.

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.590
But, you know, genes, as we
know, occur in a paired alleles.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:32.510 position:56%
So what if we know Ray has one,
Roger may have one, he may have two.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:36.520
But either way, Jimmy and Mandy
have the potential of having two.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.450
So I said, "What if
they both do have two?"

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:41.040
So that gives you the ability
to, you know, steer through time

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.610
and they both seem to be somewhat
more flexible time travelers

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:44.910
than their parents.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.640
But what if it also allows you to
recognize other time travelers?

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.620
And I was thinking so they
can recognize each other.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.610
You see, the thing is they can
recognize their parents as well

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.320
as Mandy does when she
tells them where Roger is.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.130
So they have this ability to
recognize another time traveler

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.960
when they see them, rather
than wait, and that may come

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.740
into play somewhere else.

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.340
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.640
Yes.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.940
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'd like to --

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.240
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Hi.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Miss Gabaldon, for all
of your work, in particular in light

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.980
of what Mr. McCullough mentioned
about bringing history to life.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.280
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.130
&gt;&gt; I would -- especially
in my own family,

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:26.820 position:56%
I would say that my now college-aged
daughter found no joy in history --

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.120
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
Oh, wonderful; yes.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.570
&gt;&gt; Until she read your books.

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:32.100
So that brings it to home.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.490
And I would like to
in honor of her ask --

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.780
because she is an aspiring writer,

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.780
how do you work through
writer's blocks?

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:43.220
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh, how do
you work through writer's block?

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.010
It's real simple, but
also horrifying,

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.980
you just keep writing anyway.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.290
I mean, really just
keep putting down words,

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:51.440
and eventually it will let go.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.210
Now, I can expand on
that a little bit.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.580
But I know it may not work
for her because it has to do

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.410
with the way my brain is wired up.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:59.930
I think I have a rather
beneficent form of ADHD

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.060
in that I can't concentrate
on something for more

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.480
than about 20 minutes
unless it's really engaging.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.700
But what I learned to do
early on was to switch rapidly

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.000
from one project to the next.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.360
I usually work on three, four,
five, six projects at once.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.200
So I'll begin, say,
with a grant proposal,

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.890
which is the most horrible thing to
write, and I would get, you know,

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:20.620
two-thirds of the way down
the page, it would stick.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.850
Well, everybody gets stuck at
some point, and they get up,

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:25.170
go to the bathroom, get the
drink, take the dog for a walk.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.470
Some of them don't come back,

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:28.200
and that's why they
don't finish their books.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.940
I couldn't do that because
I had to keep getting paid.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.660
So I would come to
the sticking point.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.110
And without stopping, I would
pick up the next project

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.560
on my software review
pile, start the review.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.070 position:56%
Then I'd check with the draft of
the proposal, if it was still stuck,

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:45.030
I would then pick up the scene
I was working on for the novel,

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.330
work on that until it got stuck.

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:48.540
And so it would keep me
circling through these things.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.840
And I would not get up.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.460
And so at the end of the night,
I would end up, you know,

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.090
with two pages of the
grant proposal,

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.890
and half of a software review,
and maybe three-quarters

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.200
of a finished scene,
but I would have work.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.360
And so, you know, this is another
thing you can do, you know,

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.000
if you are stuck on what
you're doing, do something else

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.640
that also involves writing because
those synapses keep working,

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.340
and eventually something
comes loose.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.980
It all comes -- if everything else
fails, work on what you're supposed

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.960
to be working on, but just
put down anything that comes

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.520
into your mind that's connected
where they don't try to, you know,

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.080
organize or plot, or anything
like that, just, you know,

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.600
let the words come and then it --

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.130
usually it comes unstuck
within a couple of paragraphs.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:25.730
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: You may have to
do it more than one day in a row.

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.430
&gt;&gt; My daughter Amelia thanks you.

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:28.730
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
Sure thing, thank you.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:30.030
Yes; yes.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.930
&gt;&gt; Hi. I want to thank
you personally.

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.030
I know everyone here
feels the same way.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:37.190 position:56%
I didn't know about your books
until I watched the television show,

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.950
and then I've read all of them.

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:42.180
And it's just like
opened up this whole world

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.900
to me, so thank you, thank you.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.200
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
Wonderful; thank you.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.740
&gt;&gt; I see that you're a
consultant on the show.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:54.610
And it says, you know, what -- how
do you feel like when they're --

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:58.440 position:56%
like I know they have to vary things
from the book to do advance it

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.680
into the show, but how -- I mean,
I know it's an open-ended question,

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.360
but how do you feel about,
you know, changes they make?

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.280 position:56%
Do they consult you about them or --

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.580
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.530
How do I feel about changes made
by the show to the original story?

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.030
Well, they pretty much
have to change it

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:15.940 position:56%
because they've only got ten hours
to work with, and they're big books.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.670
The other thing is that, you know,
weekly television, it's episodic,

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.080
meaning that you have one
hour, and that hour has

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.090
to have its own little
dramatic arc that comes

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.260
to a dramatically satisfying end.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.220
Well, the book is not arranged
in neat little dramatic arcs.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.920
So what they do is they
take the book apart.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.040
They call it "breaking script,"
and then they take pieces

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.810
out of this broken pile
and they reassemble them

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:39.980
into those little climactic things.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.870
So in the process,
they lose some things.

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:44.130
They have to invent some other
things to get from point A

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:47.890
to point B. But the
overall impression is still

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:49.380
that of the original book.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.320
I think they do a beautiful
job with that.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.230
There are occasional
spots where they --

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:58.120
where one scriptwriter
will have, to my mind,

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.170 position:56%
completely misinterpret a character.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:03.080
And on those occasions, I will
point that out with some force.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.980
But yes -- [laughter]
I don't do it often.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:12.160
But once that bit sorted
out with something really --

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.120
anyway I brought back and I said,
"I don't use language bad enough

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.920
to describe how much I hate this."

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.470
[Laughter] But, you know,
I don't do that often.

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.830
And when I do, they're
inclined to listen to me.

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:24.130
And they did do something about it.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:26.210
I mean, normally, they're
very good about, you know,

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:29.840
soliciting my comments and
paying attention to what I think.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.110
And you know, I don't make
a lot of adverse comments.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.410
Usually, I'll say, "This is great.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.710
I love this.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.010
This is wonderful.

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:37.310
I would have never
thought of that; terrific."

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:38.720
But, you know, every so often,
I'll say, "Look, you know, if --

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.810 position:56%
I'll tell you what, honestly, truly,

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:43.350
you cannot fatally cut someone's
throat without having a lot

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:45.250
of blood because," you know,
I got back this footage

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:48.170
and there was this just sort
of gently oozing, you know,

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.610
wound but no blood on the
clothes or anything like that.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:51.910
I said, "Look, you can't do that.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:54.220
If you're going to kill someone,
you're slicing at least one

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.940
of the corroded artery;
blood is spray everywhere.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.300
I mean, you've got
to have more blood."

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.150 position:56%
And so, you know -- you see, they're
not going to reshoot scenes just

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.740
to satisfy my technical things.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.140
But the thing is there's
this thing called "VFX,"

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.990
which means "special effect,"
and they could do things.

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.680
Frequently, I'll see notes on the
rough footage that they send me

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.810
that said "VFX, add more blood,"
and so I know they can do that.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.690
And so I'll say, "Look, add
more blood, lots more blood,

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.990
and we'll see how that works."

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:24.150
But yes anyway, they listen
to me and nine times out ten,

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.970
they'll do something in response.

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:28.240
The tenth time, they'll tell me
why that's impossible, you know,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.210
the logistics just don't
let them do this or that,

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:31.730
it's too expensive, et cetera.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:33.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:34.330
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you.

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:35.630
Yes, yes.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:36.930
&gt;&gt; Hi, Diana.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.230
Thank you.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.140
I wanted to let you know that
my family had an episode --

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:44.240
not an episode, my
first granddaughter,

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:51.150 position:56%
unbeknownst to her mother prenatally
had serious health defects --

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:52.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.580
&gt;&gt; And only lived 35 hours.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.540
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.920
&gt;&gt; I warned my daughter about
reading "Dragonfly on Amber,"

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.530
and she did read it,
and she did watch.

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:07.490
Faith Katz's [phonetic]
performance was amazing.

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:08.790
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: She was.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:12.040
&gt;&gt; And, you know, your
writing helped us

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.530
through that period of time.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.870
So when you announced
that you were going

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:18.910
to be a grandmother,
I prayed for you.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:20.210
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
Well, thank you so much.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:21.510
&gt;&gt; I prayed for your granddaughter.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:22.810
I prayed for your granddaughter.

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.110
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes.

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:25.410
&gt;&gt; I helped [inaudible] as well.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:28.500
I want to know how does
being a grandmother --

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:32.120
or does it, impact your
writing from here going forward?

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.120
How does it impact your life, and
how does it impact your writing?

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.420
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
[Laughs] Well, I don't know,

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.720
I've only been a grandmother
for six weeks;

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.020
I haven't written that much yet.

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:40.320
[Laughter]

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.120
&gt;&gt; But it's the six best
weeks of your life, I know.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.420
[Laughs]

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.400
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes, well,
see, Claire has been a grandmother

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.070
for a lot longer than I have.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:48.890
But, you know, I have had children.

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:50.700
You know, I know what it's
like to deal with children,

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.380 position:56%
both my own and others and so forth.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:56.170
So you know, you use as much of
your own experience as you have.

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:59.530
You mentioned Katrina and her
fabulous performance in "Dragonfly

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.200
on Amber," you know,
as a pregnant woman

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.160
and losing the baby and all that.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.060
And she wrote to me ahead
of time, and she said,

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.750
"Can you tell me what
it's like to be pregnant,

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.470
because I never have
been," and so forth.

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.300
And so, you know, I just did a
brain dump for her and, you know,

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.910
told her everything I knew
about that and so forth.

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:17.890
And I have been fortunate enough
never to experience a stillbirth,

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:20.190
but I have talked to
people who have,

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:22.540
and also the medical
people who attend them.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:24.930
So I told her what I knew
from that angle as well.

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:26.800 position:56%
She just did a fabulous job with it.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.100
&gt;&gt; She did.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.400
Thank you.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.700
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
Yes; thank you so much.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.000
Yes, yes.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.390
&gt;&gt; Hi. My favorite way to
procrastinate my own writing is

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.380
by doing research, going
to national archives

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.870
and reading letters,
and things like that.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.820
And I said, "Oh, I'm working
on my novel by doing this."

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.000 position:56%
But I'm really not writing my novel.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.960
And you are such a
historically detailed

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.560
and generally detailed writer.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.060
And I'm sure that your background
helps you be more regimented

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.360
in that.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.010
But I wondered what your
approach is to researching,

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:58.010
and then integrating the
research, and keeping going

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.620
with that schedule you described,

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.690
while not sacrificing
your eye for detail.

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:05.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes; well that is
a problem that I noticed with people

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.620
who are writing historical
fiction, which is, you know,

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.350
you get so tangled
up in the research

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:11.150
that you never actually
write the book.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:13.510
I know people have been writing
their novel for ten years

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:15.810
and they've never put down a
word; they're just doing research.

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:18.780
Yes, research is fun, and it's
much less work than writing.

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.960
No; I am rather fortunate in
the way that my brain works,

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.000
which is in this very
scattershot way.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.040
So I do the research and
the writing concurrently.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.560
You know, I'll be working
on a scene,

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.010
then I come to something
I need to know.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:31.470
Well, I go to my research
collection.

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:34.250
I've got about 2200 books
on, you know, early --

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:36.640
or on Scotland and early
America, and so forth.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:40.020
And, you know, or I'll go to the
Internet to look up, you know,

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.930
a historical character
that I'm using.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.590
And I'll say "MH," and it
will show me what, you know,

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:45.900
Tom Payne looked like, that sort
of stuff, and I'll read stuff.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.340
And anyway something
in there -- it will --

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.740
I'll find what I needed to
go on writing the scene,

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.070
but I'll also find something else

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:54.280
that simulates another
scene, and I'll think, "Ah."

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.350
And so I'll immediately
start writing that one

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:58.010
down on a separate
document, you know,

00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:59.860
just a quick sketch of whatever.

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.930
And so I mean, the research just
integrates itself basically.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:05.270
I put in what I need to know,

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:07.350
and the research tells
me all this other stuff

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.480
that I didn't know I needed
to know, but there it is.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.780
[Laughs]

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.080
&gt;&gt; That's very helpful.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.380
Thank you so much.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.680
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Sure; yes, yes.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.980
&gt;&gt; Okay; you are my rock star.

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.280
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.580
&gt;&gt; I am your number one fan.

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.880
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
Thank you so much.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.180
I guess we have two minutes.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.480
&gt;&gt; I love so much about you.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.780
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.080
&gt;&gt; One thing I wanted
to ask you, though,

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.380
okay I hit 50 and wrote the novel.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.020
So I'm done with the novel and I've
got friends going independently

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.920
published, others telling me
to try to go the query letter

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.250
and the mainstream publishing.

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:38.040
What made -- I know you did
the CompuServe, but what --

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:43.100
was it your friend that --
is that what garnered you --

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.070
like directed you to go
that direction with --

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:46.440
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon:
No; independent --

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.600
it's about a question about
independent publishing

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.090
versus mainstream publishing.

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:52.140
Independent publishing
didn't exist back

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.110
in the day; it was not a question.

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.860
But given the option, definitely go

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.810
for mainstream publishing
to start with.

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.910
It's too complex for
me to deal with here,

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:02.250
but I'll talk to you
later if you'd like.

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:03.550
&gt;&gt; Oh, that would be awesome.

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:04.850
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes; and
we have exactly two minutes,

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:06.170
so I'm sorry for the
rest of the people

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:07.470
who have been standing in line.

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:08.770
But I can take that question.

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:10.070
Yes.

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:11.370
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'll be quick.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:12.670
Thanks so much for the stories.

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:13.970
I was just wondering
in all your stories,

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:15.840
do you ever regret any choices
that you might have made?

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:21.030
And specifically, would you have
chosen another path for Murtagh?

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:22.330
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: For who?

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.630
&gt;&gt; Murtagh.

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:24.930
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Oh, Murtagh.

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:26.960
Yes; do I ever regret ever
killing people in my books,

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.870
essentially, was the question.

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:31.930
[Laughter] Well, see, I
don't kill people, they die.

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:37.850 position:56%
I mean, in fact, I frequently go out
of my way to try not to kill them.

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:39.150
I really did.

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:40.970 position:56%
In "Written In my Own Heart's Blood"
there's a very shattering death

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:43.400
in that one, and I was thinking,
"Surely, there's some other way."

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.700
But no, there wasn't.

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.000
You know, once I heard
that crack, you know,

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.870
I was thinking, "Yes,
he's gone, yes."

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:51.820
But yes, and you know, I
just can't change those.

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:53.510
But no, I don't plan them.

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.860
So, you know, sometimes, I
regret that someone is gone.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.030
But, you know, Murtagh, you know,
died at Culloden and part of the --

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:03.880
and because he died, but part of
the effect of that was, you know,

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:08.040
that we are sensible of a personal
loss which you need to have.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.470
You know, if Jaime is
surviving, which he was, you know,

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:14.000
we need to lose someone that
we care about, you know?

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.300
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.600
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you, yes.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.900
And one more person, yes, yes.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.200
&gt;&gt; Oh, yay, thank you
very much, Diana.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.810
My question actually
has specifically to do

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:22.110
with the "Outlander" books.

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:25.830
And I think it's in book 5,
Neoweni [phonetic] tells Claire

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:27.610
that when her hair is all white,

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:29.380
that's when she'll
be her most powerful.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.430
And really I'm just wondering how
white is Claire's hair right now,

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:37.860
and can we expect even more
powerful [laughter] achievements?

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.640
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Yes; no, Claire
doesn't have a mirror at this point

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.500
in it, and someone
mentions that to her.

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.100
And so she asked her
granddaughter, she said,

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.020
you know, "What color is my hair?

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.320
Is my hair brown or white?"

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.340
And Mandy looks at her and says,
"Grandma," say, "it's rindled."

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:55.700 position:56%
So that's what it is, it's a mixture
of brown, silver, white, et cetera.

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.650
So she's not quite there yet,
but we have two books to go.

00:55:58.650 --> 00:55:59.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you; thank you.

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:01.250
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Anyway,

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:02.550
yes that's all the
questions we have time for.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:03.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:05.150
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you.

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:06.450
[Inaudible].

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: It was very nice.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:13.290
[ Applause ]

00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:17.150
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
