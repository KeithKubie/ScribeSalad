00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.887
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.887 --> 00:00:04.220
SARAH MURRAY: Welcome everybody.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.540
I'm really thrilled to be here
to talk about Christine's book.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.080
I just thought
I'd show you this.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.235
Because this is how--

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:13.010
CHRISTINE BADER: She's
done her homework.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.926
SARAH MURRAY: --interested
I was in this book.

00:00:14.926 --> 00:00:18.050
I'm not going to be reading
every single excerpt from it,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.380
you'll be pleased to hear.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.020
But I kept running
out of colors.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.180
So every page I was like,
ah, this is so interesting.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.810
So, yeah.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.450
I mean for me, having covered
these issues for so many years,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.930
this was an absolutely
fascinating book for me to read

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.010
because I think as a journalist
you, to a large extent,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.860
feel on the outside
of all these issues.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.360
And so for me it
was just wonderful,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.380
and you do it so well Christine,
to have this story told

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.540
from the inside of
the big corporations

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.835
that I'm not normally ever
allowed to go in and examine

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:55.860
at that sort of level of depth.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.120
And the other thing that
you did really well,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.860
as a corporate
idealist you bring

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.099
in all these other
corporate idealists

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.820
sort of later in
the book as well.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.110
And Christine's kind of
created with the book

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.350
a kind of amazing
community of people.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.760
And for me it was really
wonderful because actually,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.070
a lot of these people I've
interviewed over the years.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.140
And it was wonderful to kind
of reconnect with these people

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.460
through your books.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.377
So thank you for that.

00:01:23.377 --> 00:01:24.709
CHRISTINE BADER: Oh good, Sarah.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.750
You know, it was fun for me
too to do all these interviews,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.390
because a lot of
them were people

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.220
who I'd known for a long time.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.326
Professionally we all go
to the same conferences.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:35.200
But I'd never actually
gotten to talk to them

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.870
about how they feel about
their work and their ups

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.120
and downs and their struggles,
and when their company's just

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.580
deeply disappointed them
and what that was like.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.830
So it was good fun for me too.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.360
SARAH MURRAY: Well
on that point there's

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.990
a really good line right at the
beginning that I'll just read,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.720
because it speaks very
much to that point.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.780
This is in the
introduction and Christine

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.240
writes, "We believe
that business

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.980
can be a force for good
even as we struggle

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.960
with our own contradictions."

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.490
I think that's a theme that
runs through the whole book

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.630
and is very
powerfully expressed.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.510
But I thought I'd start by,
let's go back to the beginning.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.670
Because you describe
your relationship

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.370
with BP and the corporate world
as something of a love affair.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.520
And of course, it
was a love affair

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.120
that was going to
sort of fall apart

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.130
after the Deepwater
Horizon took place.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.720
So just tell us how that
love affair started.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.760
What was the spark that made
you think that, gosh, business

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.312
might actually be a force
for good in the world?

00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:40.270
CHRISTINE BADER: Right.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.228
OK, that's good, Sarah.

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.160
That's a good place to start.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.240
So I had done nonprofit
and government work

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.140
and then decided to go
to business school, first

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.980
of all like every good
liberal arts graduate.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.960
But then also I realized
that in these jobs

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.880
I seem to be reacting to things
that the private sector had

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.420
done.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.720
So when I was doing
community service, when

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.130
I was working in the New
York City mayor's office,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.970
we were reacting
to the conditions

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.360
that business had created.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.560
So I was serving
in communities that

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.430
had been devastated when
companies had moved out

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.240
or they had actively
done things bad,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.281
like they had lobbied to replace
a public garden with a parking

00:03:20.281 --> 00:03:20.780
lot.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.330
Or they had moved into
an area and failed

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.110
to hire anybody from that city.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.160
And then in the mayor's
office, on the flip side,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.560
companies were wooed for
the jobs and for the revenue

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.880
that they bring in.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.720
And so there was always this
sort of balance of OK, well,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.610
we clearly need to
regulate business

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.754
but we want to encourage them.

00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:41.670
So that's why I chose
to go to business school

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.586
because I thought, OK.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:45.380
Business actually seems to be
pretty important in the world.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.760
I should learn something
about the private sector.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.630
So I went.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.560
But of course I had no
idea what I wanted to do.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.345
Did any of you go
to business school?

00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:56.210
Yeah.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.270
And so you get there
and people immediately

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.840
start asking you to throw
your resumes in for investment

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.260
banking or consulting
interviews.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.745
And you get there and you're
like, I don't know what this is

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.710
and I haven't
learned anything new.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.310
So I started to follow
the herd and do that.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.430
But then John Browne, who at
the time was the CEO of BP,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.810
came to speak at Yale.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.850
And he had recently become the
first head of a major energy

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.149
company to acknowledge the
realities of climate change

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.820
and urge action.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.820
And he was a really inspiring
and thoughtful leader.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.100
And I thought, oh.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.780
This is what business can do.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.560
That is intriguing to me.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.110
So that's why I joined,
because of this leader who

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.690
seemed to be a different
kind of oil man,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.982
trying to create a different
kind of energy company.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.190
And it was really intriguing.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.690
So I joined and I went
straight out to Indonesia.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.210
And the thing that turned
out to be my job in Indonesia

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.650
and China was investing in the
communities living near big BP

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.270
projects.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.450
Because everybody
who I worked with

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.620
realized that what was
good for those communities

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.850
was good for our business.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.460
There were lots of
other terrible examples

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.040
around the world of where
community relations have gone

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.590
sour and communities
have blockaded access

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.000
roads to mines, they've
sabotaged equipment.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.890
So people seem to
understand that

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.610
what was good for
them was good for us.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.690
And that was my job.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.666
So I was living this cliche
of doing well and doing good.

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:26.790
I mean, what's not to love?

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.460
SARAH MURRAY: And was this
something that came up

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.900
when you were at
business school?

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.690
I mean, were these
kinds of issues--

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.094
I mean, I know now business
schools have been piling

00:05:37.094 --> 00:05:38.885
on the courses about
sort of sustainability

00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:40.190
and corporate responsibility.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.349
But back then was that
something that was covered?

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.015
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah,
not specifically.

00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:47.140
I mean, I chose to go to
Yale for business school

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.630
because its mission
has always been

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.980
to educate leaders for
business and society.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.300
So there's always been this
sort of ethos there of, yes.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.140
We go there in order to do some
sort of service to the world.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.570
And people who go
there choose to do it

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.790
through business or
working with business.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:04.310
But no.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.260
At the time there weren't sort
of corporate responsibility

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.562
jobs or sustainability jobs.

00:06:08.562 --> 00:06:09.395
SARAH MURRAY: Right.

00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:10.005
Right.

00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:15.850
But then now, so you've
sort of met-- well,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.210
not met John Browne,
but seen him speak

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.850
and kind of bought
into this idea

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.720
that BP could be
a force for good.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.960
And then you're in
a helicopter flying

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.180
over the jungles of Indonesia.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.472
Now, what is going through
your head at that point?

00:06:30.472 --> 00:06:31.430
CHRISTINE BADER: Right.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.850
So I went out to Indonesia.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.350
I spent my summer internship
between my two years

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.360
of business school in
London headquarters,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.630
and then my first assignment
with BP was out in Indonesia.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.242
But again, this
wasn't a CSR job.

00:06:45.242 --> 00:06:47.200
I was supposed to be a
commercial analyst using

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.980
my new spreadsheet skills.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.850
And BP had just taken over
ARCO, the American oil company.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.490
And so I was there.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.530
A lot of the ARCO
stuff was in Indonesia.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.430
So I was analyzing
those projects.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.920
There were lots of different
oil fields, gas fields.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.050
There was some coal,
some solar, chemicals.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.940
What should BP keep?

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.940
What should it spin off?

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.020
What should it do
with all this stuff?

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.817
So I was just crunching
numbers and doing spreadsheets

00:07:13.817 --> 00:07:15.400
because that's what
you do when you've

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.691
graduated from business school.

00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:19.030
I didn't know that
this was a job.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.990
But one of those
projects was proving

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.509
particularly
interesting, and not

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:25.800
from a technical point of view.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.290
From a technical point of view
it was very straightforward.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.510
So there was a big gas field and
BP was going to build a plant,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.220
a liquefied natural gas LNG
plant to process the gas.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.700
And that's pretty
straightforward.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.040
BP's done that all
over the world.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.690
But never in a place
like this where

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.740
we were going to have to work
with the Indonesian military,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.510
which is not known for their
good community relations.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.660
And a village was
going to have to be

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.630
moved to make way for the plant.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.475
It was 127 families.

00:08:00.475 --> 00:08:02.100
SARAH MURRAY: Not to
mention the forest

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.580
that you were flying over.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.670
CHRISTINE BADER: Exactly.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.050
So my first trip
out there, yeah.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.890
And I was living in Jakarta
in Indonesia's capital.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.600
And so to get out
to West Papua I

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.960
had to take an overnight
commercial flight and then

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.290
a little seaplane-- it was
like a twelve seater plane--

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.930
another hour and a half,
and then a helicopter

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.790
the rest of the way in.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.470
So on that last
leg of the journey

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.860
there's this really
dense rainforest

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.990
through flocks of birds
bursting through the trees.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.559
Not a lot of people.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.020
And as we started
to get closer I

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.680
could see the rig on
the horizon in the bay.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.179
And as we're coming
in, I could just

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:45.190
see our landing pad and then
the dormitories for the workers

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.540
there.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.210
And we're on the equator.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.074
It was pretty hot.

00:08:49.074 --> 00:08:50.740
I had never been in
a helicopter before.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.220
This was pretty exciting.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.750
But I was starting to get
really sweaty and uncomfortable.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.880
And I realized that
I was envisioning

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.470
the sketches of what the
plant was going to look like.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:10.030
And it was this gleaming, modern
industrial complex and imposing

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.490
it on this not totally pristine,
but relatively pristine

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.790
rainforest.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.730
And I started to get really ill.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.230
I just thought for
the first time, oh.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.437
This is what we do.

00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:25.270
SARAH MURRAY: Not
something they prepare you

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.610
for at business school.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.360
CHRISTINE BADER: No, I mean,
I understand conceptually.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:28.859
Like, yeah.

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:33.100
We keep the lights on and we
help keep the cars moving.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.910
But that's when
it really hit me.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.707
And so we landed.

00:09:36.707 --> 00:09:38.415
And you can't really
talk in a helicopter

00:09:38.415 --> 00:09:40.140
because it's pretty loud.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.100
But I was there with one
of the vice presidents

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.350
for environmental policy,
and she immediately

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.110
saw the distress on my face.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.360
And she said, that's
why we're here.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.770
We're going to get this right.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.400
SARAH MURRAY: Now what does
getting it right it mean?

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.470
Because I mean, I
think it would be

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.080
interesting to talk a little bit
about perceptions of business

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.700
and how business
operates and what

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.050
the realities are on the ground.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.714
Because I certainly get a
sense often in the people

00:10:09.714 --> 00:10:11.755
that I talk to that aren't
in the business world,

00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:13.430
that they think,
well, business is

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:18.310
just this evil empire that comes
in and lands, and that's it.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.550
And the reality on the
ground and the things

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.760
that you were then
going to deal with

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.990
is sort of complex and messy.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.440
And how much of that is the
company's responsibility,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.450
and how much are you dealing
with the existing environment

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.990
and having to sort of
negotiate all these

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.035
very complex trade offs?

00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:40.160
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah,
that's exactly the question,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.070
and this company knows
that as well as anyone.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.410
And we can get into
that certainly as well.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:53.490
So I guess the first fundamental
macro concept is the point

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.130
that energy does
keep the lights on

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.280
and it helps enable
the lifestyles that we

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.950
want to lead.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.180
And so I suppose
there are plenty

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.200
of people who want to try to
stop globalization and stop

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.640
development altogether.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.690
And that's fine.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.790
There should be some
people who want to do that.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.680
I mean, I can get a little bit
snarky with them and ask well,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.320
who keeps your lights on and
how did you get here today,

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.880
and what made that possible?

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.160
SARAH MURRAY: We live part
of the corporate world

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.080
as consumers and
individuals, don't we?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.121
CHRISTINE BADER: Exactly.

00:11:31.121 --> 00:11:32.940
I mean, one thing that
I do once in awhile

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.690
is just a little game, which I
invite you all to play with me.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.780
But just stop and take
an inventory, right?

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.850
I just stop and say, OK.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.490
Head to toe, what am I wearing
right now and what's in my bag?

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.990
And how many companies
or brands have I

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.999
interacted with since
I woke up this morning?

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:53.290
So I've got a coffee maker
and I've got my alarm clock,

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.930
and I woke up in my sheets that
were made here and bought here.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.150
And I just go through, OK.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.700
Well, what do I know
about these companies?

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.110
And where does
that put me on the

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.857
responsible to
overconsumption spectrum?

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:05.690
SARAH MURRAY: Right.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.660
And I think what's interesting,
and this is particularly true,

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.500
I guess, of sort of
apparel industries

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.510
and food which have very
complex supply chains.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.430
But even with energy
you turn the lights on

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.310
and you don't think about
that Indonesian villager that

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:24.740
had to move to another
village or to a new village.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.070
What were the real on
the ground challenges

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.800
that you didn't expect and that
certainly business school might

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.883
not have prepared you for?

00:12:32.883 --> 00:12:33.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:33.872 --> 00:12:35.830
SARAH MURRAY: Some of
the sort of nitty gritty.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.390
I mean, I think
there was something

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.880
you mentioned about the
fact that this was really

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.750
interesting to me,
that you made it

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.454
so that the workers did
not get paid on site.

00:12:47.454 --> 00:12:48.370
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:48.962
That's right.

00:12:48.962 --> 00:12:50.420
SARAH MURRAY: That
for me reflected

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.780
a lot of the
complexities that you're

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.680
dealing with on the ground.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.370
So perhaps just explain that.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.120
CHRISTINE BADER: Sure,
I can explain that.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.170
So we were building this big
plant in a really remote area.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:03.410
There was one village there
but no other cities nearby.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.660
So we stipulated in the contract
with the construction company

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.370
that they would not hire
or pay people on the site.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.140
They would only do that in
one of the three existing

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.422
towns that were a
little ways away.

00:13:15.422 --> 00:13:17.630
The reason is that if you
let it be known that you're

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.940
going to be hiring
people right at the site,

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.660
people move right
up to the fence.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.060
And then they usually, if
they can't get a job because

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.670
there aren't that
many jobs, than they

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.360
tap into the electricity.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.620
They stay there
because they've moved.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.620
And that's how
shantytowns pop up.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.460
And then idol hands, right?

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.550
And that's how bad things
arise, because then also,

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.680
if you pay people
on site, imagine

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.997
if somebody's done
a three week shift

00:13:45.997 --> 00:13:47.080
and then they stand there.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.829
They walk out of a
plant and you hand them

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:50.760
three weeks worth
of cash, and they're

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.280
not home with
their families yet.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.690
You might imagine what pops up.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.370
So then brothels pop up.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:02.100
Sort of ad hoc gambling
parlors pop up.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.720
And then what happens,
then the police

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.680
feel like they need to
move in for protection,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.600
but they're actually
taking their cut.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.711
And then the military
step up their presence

00:14:10.711 --> 00:14:12.210
because they're
like, wait a second.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.110
The police are getting in
on all the action, right?

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.980
So you can see how these
things start to compound.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.252
So that's why we didn't
want to hire [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:20.252 --> 00:14:22.210
SARAH MURRAY: It's really
so complex, isn't it?

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.065
For so many industries.

00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:26.440
One of the things
I thought would

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.470
be interesting to ask you about
was where you see-- you talk

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.800
a lot in the book about
CSR and later we'll

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.010
talk a little bit about
sort of careers in CSR

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.050
and how you move into that.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.260
Personally I hate the term CSR.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.230
I don't know about you.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.360
Because I think it sort
of silos these things

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.530
into some kind of acronym
that half the world

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.810
doesn't know what
that means anyway.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.615
So where do you see the balance?

00:14:50.615 --> 00:14:54.040
A lot of companies will talk
about their sustainability

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.177
program or their business
responsibility program.

00:14:56.177 --> 00:14:57.760
And then you find
that they're talking

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.950
about changing the light bulbs
in the office or recycling

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.350
things.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.640
What you've just described
on the ground in Indonesia,

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.590
to me that's corporate
responsibility.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.500
How do you see that sort
of view in business,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.850
that attitude having shifted?

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:15.940
Or has it shifted?

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.606
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah,
I agree with you.

00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:19.770
I mean, the term corporate
social responsibility

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.640
sort of drives me crazy
because it can mean everything

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.440
and it can mean nothing.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.890
So I definitely
see the same thing.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:35.530
And I think that the benefit is
that so many more companies are

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.070
comfortable talking about
that, whatever it is.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.162
So it actually gets them
to the table, right?

00:15:42.162 --> 00:15:43.620
And so I have a
nice quote in there

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.390
from Aron Cramer who runs
BSR, Business for Social

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.110
Responsibility.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.430
And he says the trick is
to get them to the table

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.471
and then move the table.

00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:51.970
Right?

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.230
So the point is to get
more and more companies

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.720
in talking about corporate
social responsibility,

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.540
talking about sustainability.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.135
So you get them into
the conversation

00:16:01.135 --> 00:16:02.260
and then try to explain it.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:02.760
OK.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.870
Actually this is what we're
really talking about here.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.220
We're not actually
talking about sending out

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.470
employees in matching
t-shirts to go

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.090
paint a wall for
five hours a week.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.729
Like, that's great
as is recycling

00:16:15.729 --> 00:16:17.520
and as are these other
programs, but that's

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.830
actually not what we're
talking about here, right?

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.770
We're talking about what are
the impacts that your core

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.690
business has on society?

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.525
And I think here
that's become clear

00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:31.970
as people have realized
the challenges to privacy

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:36.150
and free expression that your
core business has on the world

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.820
and that you as a company have
a responsibility to address.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.860
And the other stuff that
you do is really interesting

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.800
and it's really great and
it's really important,

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.460
but I would be fine if all the
other stuff sort of fell away

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.210
and companies put all of that
time and energy and resource

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.520
into their core business.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.353
SARAH MURRAY: Right.

00:16:55.353 --> 00:16:57.510
Now the challenge
there though is

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.260
that there are
sort of perceptions

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.980
of this costing money.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.280
And what is the payback for
resettling an Indonesian

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.589
villager?

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:11.260
Just talk a little
bit about working

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.732
within a big corporation
on these issues that

00:17:13.732 --> 00:17:15.440
are material to the
business or at least,

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.550
that you've explained
very well in the book,

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.400
are so material to the business.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.819
You know, you may be
surrounded by the skeptics who

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.131
go, well, you know,
why are we going

00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:26.880
to pay all this money
for something that's

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.171
on the other side of the world?

00:17:28.171 --> 00:17:32.250
And what are the challenges
of being a corporate idealist

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.460
even within a company
like BP which at the time

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.745
was really as you say,
trying to do the right thing?

00:17:36.745 --> 00:17:39.120
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah, at the
time it was on the projects

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:39.828
that I worked on.

00:17:39.828 --> 00:17:42.642
But still, everybody, you
need to justify your cost

00:17:42.642 --> 00:17:43.850
and how much you're spending.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:49.880
So I suppose in Indonesia I
had the mixed blessing of there

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.610
being some really horrible
examples nearby of how

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.200
much this can actually cost
a company when it goes really

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.260
badly.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.140
So on the other end
of Indonesia in Aceh

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.680
there was a similar facility,
a liquefied natural gas plant,

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.140
that had to shut down for four
months because of basically

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.790
a civil war going on around
it that some people accused

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.797
that company of exacerbating.

00:18:13.797 --> 00:18:15.380
And I did some
research for the book--

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.820
I couldn't find
an exact figure--

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.480
but I found a bunch
of estimates that

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.370
said that that shutdown,
that four month shutdown,

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:26.580
cost Exxon Mobil anywhere from
$100 to $350 million, right?

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:31.620
I mean, even for Exxon, like,
that's kind of a lot of money.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.990
In the same province as the
project that I worked on

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.150
is the Freeport McMoRan
Grasberg copper and gold mine.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.140
That's one of the largest
mines in the world.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.810
And they spent something
like $42 million

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.490
on security in one year.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.810
And that keeps going up
because when they came in,

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.810
they struck a deal with
the national government.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.950
They didn't pay much attention
to local community issues.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.800
And now they've realized
that didn't work.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.640
But it's really hard to
turn these things around

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.590
once they've gone wrong.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.830
So I think in oil, gas, and
mining, it's pretty clear now

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.000
that you can't operate
these projects well

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.160
if you don't invest in
these issues up front.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.540
And other industries are
starting to see that too.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.200
I mean in apparel,
companies have

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.780
realized that if you
treat your workers better

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.280
they're going to
be more productive,

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.450
there'll be less turnover.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.370
So we're seeing that.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:30.170
And then in the tax sector
too, I think the challenges

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.300
to privacy and free
expression demonstrate

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.860
that you need the
trust of users.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:36.360
Right?

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.180
That's what your whole
business is built on.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.710
SARAH MURRAY: It's the
license to operate.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.760
CHRISTINE BADER: It's
the license to operate.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.560
That's exactly what it is.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:41.680
SARAH MURRAY: Yeah.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.596
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah.

00:19:42.596 --> 00:19:43.840
And so, you're right.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.500
That's still sometimes,
it's hard to demonstrate

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.570
a very specific
return on investment.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.520
So I think it's fine to have
a rigorous debate about that.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.900
Well, do we need to spend this
much or can we spend this much?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.010
I'm not crazy about going
too far down that road.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.920
Because for example
if I say, OK.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.920
Well, I want to
spend $11 million

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.057
next year to make sure that
our security arrangements are

00:20:07.057 --> 00:20:09.140
in line with international
human rights principles

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.750
so that we won't be
complicit in genocide, say.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.980
I don't really want to have this
conversation of saying, well,

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.480
I don't know if we
have $11 million.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.120
If we spend, like,
$4 or $5 million,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.020
is there going to
be a 60% chance

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.650
that we're complicit
in genocide?

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.580
And it's like, OK.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.500
You know what?

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.339
This is not-- like, seriously?

00:20:27.339 --> 00:20:29.380
I mean, you do have to
have a little bit of that.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.870
But I think it's OK to call
it out when it's ridiculous.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.260
SARAH MURRAY: Right.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:32.760
Sure.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.460
Yes, yes.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.762
But I guess, and again.

00:20:35.762 --> 00:20:37.220
Something you
mentioned in the book

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.678
which I thought
was very intriguing

00:20:38.678 --> 00:20:40.260
is the whole idea
that in this work

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.490
that you're doing,
even if you're not

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.770
having to sort of
measure dollar for dollar

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.750
and what the return is,
you're essentially doing work

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.435
to make something not happen.

00:20:50.435 --> 00:20:51.310
CHRISTINE BADER: Yes.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.860
And nobody gets
rewarded for that.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.140
SARAH MURRAY: Yeah.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:53.370
Yeah.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.328
CHRISTINE BADER: Right?

00:20:54.328 --> 00:20:56.620
So one of the people
who I interviewed

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.912
manages supply chains
for a really big company.

00:20:59.912 --> 00:21:01.870
And she said that one of
their internal awards,

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.140
which are really prestigious
in a big company,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.740
went to one of her colleagues
who managed a big safety

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.860
disaster.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.666
And she was like, I prevented,
like, 20 of those, right?

00:21:12.666 --> 00:21:14.540
But again, nobody gets
rewarded for something

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.170
that doesn't happen.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.210
And one of the people
who I interviewed,

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.793
Isabella [? O'Covey ?], who runs
the Business and Human Rights

00:21:20.793 --> 00:21:21.980
program at Yahoo.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.674
And she was brought in
after Yahoo was compelled

00:21:25.674 --> 00:21:28.090
to turn over user information
about the Chinese government

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.750
for Shi Tao, a journalist
who was in jail.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.340
And she was brought
in after that.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.450
But now it's been a while.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.992
There's been a lot of
turnover at the company.

00:21:36.992 --> 00:21:39.450
And she said that part of the
challenges of doing this work

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.712
well is that if
nothing goes wrong,

00:21:41.712 --> 00:21:43.920
then you get people sort of
looking around and going,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.420
well, wait.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.870
What are you doing here?

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.620
SARAH MURRAY: Yes.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.380
Yes.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.180
CHRISTINE BADER:
Why are you here

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.346
with all this budget, right?

00:21:49.346 --> 00:21:51.960
And she's like, I'm the one
preventing the bad things

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.370
from happening.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.819
But you don't always know that.

00:21:54.819 --> 00:21:56.110
SARAH MURRAY: No, that's right.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:57.485
And those stories
don't come out.

00:21:57.485 --> 00:22:00.660
I mean, one of the things
that I think also-- this

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.555
is sort of a topic quite
close to my heart--

00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:08.850
is the extent to which
companies are or should

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.600
be more open and
honest about both

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.422
their failings and
their successes.

00:22:13.422 --> 00:22:15.630
I mean, people are always
pitching me stories saying,

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:16.670
oh come on.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.424
We've just cut our carbon
footprint by x million tons.

00:22:20.424 --> 00:22:22.590
And they don't want to tell
me that the problem they

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.390
had doing it I think
because, you know,

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:29.040
there is very much this
sort of corporate message

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.710
that has to controlled.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.900
But do you think that
given what's going on--

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.600
and I think this
works both ways.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.540
Because a., I think
results in people

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.390
not seeing the real
story and so they just

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.181
see when the bad thing
happens, they think,

00:22:44.181 --> 00:22:47.420
oh well, there's that rotten
corporate sector again.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.520
But by contrast, I was speaking
to somebody the other day

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.830
and I was talking about
what I write about.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.557
And she said, oh, well I
try and do the right thing

00:22:57.557 --> 00:22:58.140
with business.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.180
And she said, I never
buy anything from Nike.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.230
And I said well actually,
the company's changed.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.690
It actually is now
seen as a gold standard

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.240
in managing labor rights
and things like that.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.590
So just how do you see
the evolution of companies

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.430
when it comes to sort of
telling their own story

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:17.404
about this stuff?

00:23:17.404 --> 00:23:18.320
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.020
You've totally hit
the nail on the head

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.930
because one of the challenges
of many of the people

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.994
that I interviewed is
I assumed that it would

00:23:26.994 --> 00:23:28.910
be with their legal
departments, because I had

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.210
some challenges in
BP of commissioning

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.390
these human rights
impact assessments

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.140
that I then assumed
that we would publish.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.848
And our legal department
was like, oh no.

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:37.930
Can't talk about that.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.330
Can't talk about that.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.790
But actually a
lot of people said

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.030
that the challenges were
in their communications

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.330
departments because they only
want to tell good stories.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.180
And that's a real
challenge, because being

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:53.260
open about your challenges
is what first of all

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.670
creates a more informed
public conversation, right?

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.110
I mean, I think that Google
and a lot of your other

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.880
peer companies issuing
transparency reports, right?

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.470
Like, issuing the
challenges and the requests

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:07.360
that you're getting from
governments for censorship

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.100
and for user data is
really important, right?

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.770
It helps convey to
people like, OK.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.112
Oh, here's the scale
of the problem.

00:24:14.112 --> 00:24:16.570
And maybe we should be turning
our attention to governments

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:17.610
as well.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.284
So I think it's
really important.

00:24:19.284 --> 00:24:20.700
And I think, again,
some companies

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.290
are starting to
come around to that.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.720
But it's still slow.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.011
SARAH MURRAY: It's a challenge.

00:24:27.011 --> 00:24:28.780
And of course, the
danger is as well

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.810
that you stick your
head above the parapet

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.630
and then you get attacked.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.520
So I remember
writing a piece years

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.980
ago about Gap's corporate
responsibility report, which

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.589
was a sort of
warts and all thing

00:24:40.589 --> 00:24:42.130
where they listed
all their suppliers

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:48.450
and they highlighted where they
had incidents of child labor

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.050
in their supply chain.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.540
And while most NGOs and a lot
of the press and the piece

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.530
I wrote for the FT was a sort of
fairly balanced piece about why

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.730
they were producing
this report, one,

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.810
I remember coming home and
watching a local news channel,

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.300
and it just said huge abuses
uncovered at Gap factories.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.800
And so the danger, I
guess, is that they

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.510
misinterpret that story.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.080
CHRISTINE BADER:
Well, that's right.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.871
But then you know what
happened years later

00:25:12.871 --> 00:25:15.040
when that story came
out about The Gap

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.405
finding illegal
subcontracting and there

00:25:19.405 --> 00:25:23.180
were some kids that were
making Gap Kids clothes.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.070
But that story, I
mean, people stood up.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.617
People like Mary Robinson,
the former president

00:25:27.617 --> 00:25:30.200
of Ireland, a former a U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.600
and other NGOs standing up,
defending The Gap and saying,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.100
hey.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.520
The Gap has been
working on these issues

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.720
longer and harder than
any other company.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.860
And frankly, if any
company says that they've

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.350
eradicated the problem of sub
subcontracting, they're lying.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.750
So the story kind of went away.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.037
So again, I think that's part
of taking the long term view.

00:25:49.037 --> 00:25:49.870
SARAH MURRAY: Right.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:50.560
Right.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.730
Honesty and openness
builds your credibility,

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.569
even if a few
stragglers don't get it.

00:25:54.569 --> 00:25:55.610
CHRISTINE BADER: Exactly.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.920
SARAH MURRAY: Yeah.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.710
Yeah.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:00.990
And another thing that comes
very strongly through the book

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:05.340
is the impact you're making
as a corporate idealist

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.170
in these companies.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.790
I mean, I don't know how you
felt when you left your own BA

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:15.390
and headed out hoping to change
the corporate world entirely.

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:19.710
But often there are
battles one has to pick

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:23.570
and there are
compromises to be made.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.580
What do you see as sort of
the balance for you and others

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.050
in this world of
trying to achieve

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.040
incremental change versus
complete transformation and

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.741
are they both
laudable objectives?

00:26:35.741 --> 00:26:37.990
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah, I
think they're both important.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.000
And frankly that's the
whole arc of the book

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.570
and what compelled me to
write it in the first place

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:46.150
is that I did come charging out
of business school thinking,

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.399
I'm going to change the world.

00:26:47.399 --> 00:26:48.710
This is going to be awesome.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.080
And then my first few years
with BP I really felt like that.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.480
I was doing amazingly innovative
and progressive and helpful

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.330
work around these projects
with the full backing

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.220
of senior management.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.585
And I thought, this was amazing.

00:27:01.585 --> 00:27:05.590
And then working with colleagues
around the world in BP

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:09.020
who felt the same way, who
were doing the same work.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.410
And then it was after the
Deepwater Horizon disaster.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.700
I had left BP at that point.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.320
But that to me was the
real sort of crisis

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.340
of confidence of
that BP that emerged

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.590
in the aftermath
of that disaster,

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:35.320
of this sort of reckless,
callous, risk taking company.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.900
It didn't at all
resemble the BP that I

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.347
thought I'd gotten to know
so well over the nine years

00:27:40.347 --> 00:27:41.180
that I'd been there.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.390
So my first reaction
was, well, hang on.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.704
That's not my BP.

00:27:45.704 --> 00:27:52.370
And then my second
reaction was, or was it?

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.580
So I started talking
to friends who've

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.440
been doing similar work
deep inside big companies

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.960
for a long time, like friends
who work in apparel companies

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.260
after the Rana Plaza factory
collapse in Bangladesh who

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.330
similarly thought, I've been
doing really good supply chain

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.900
work for 20 years and we
just killed 1100 people.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.060
So what does it really
mean to do this work?

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.460
So it started off as
this personal journey

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.480
of trying to understand, trying
to reconcile those two BPs,

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.320
and trying to understand the
work that I had done there.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.120
And realizing that
a lot of people

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.150
doing this work in big companies
have these similar challenges.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:35.600
And so what I came to, not
to give away the punchline,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.650
but what I came to was, yes.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.370
If you're going to go work
in a big massive company,

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.480
this work is really incremental.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.020
And it's not going
to change overnight.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.770
But that doesn't undo
good work, right?

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.410
Again, as long as it's
not, like, a carbon

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.765
offset for-- right?

00:28:54.765 --> 00:28:56.140
As long as it's
not like, oh, I'm

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.830
doing really good
philanthropy for the company

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.788
but it's harming people
with its core business.

00:28:59.788 --> 00:29:03.570
I really believe that the work
that I was doing in Indonesia

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.270
and China was exactly
the kind of work

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.060
that we want extractive
companies doing, that we want

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.320
them doing around
these big projects that

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.130
supply the world's energy.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.830
So there are moments for
transformative change, right?

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.989
When you can really
move your company.

00:29:20.989 --> 00:29:22.280
There are these moments, right?

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.730
And you can really
move your industry.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.130
Like, for example, Google's
part of the Global Network

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:31.190
Initiative which is this really
important initiative that it

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.160
was part of creating
with Microsoft,

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.630
with Yahoo, with some
socially responsible investors

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.910
and some human rights
groups and some academics

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.770
to come up with
a code of conduct

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:45.570
to better protect free
expression and privacy.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.970
And that's really important.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:48.680
And I think that's
transformative.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.121
I mean, it's taken a
while to implement.

00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:54.120
But still, that kind of
thing is transformative.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.347
But the day to day
work is much slower.

00:29:56.347 --> 00:29:57.180
SARAH MURRAY: Right.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:57.680
Right.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.400
Right.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.660
Now I mean, there are all these
initiatives that you mention.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.650
And in all kinds
of industries there

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:10.010
are collaborations to address
labor abuses in factories

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:14.760
from sort of human rights to
environment collaborations.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.520
Is this enough?

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.020
Where do we need to actually
just turn to government to step

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:25.740
in and start-- you see,
despite years of working on,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.490
despite examples like Nike,
despite companies that

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.300
have really worked on supply
chain issues in the apparel

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.750
industry, we still
have Rana Plaza.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:40.000
At what point do we have to say,
business can't do this alone

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.010
or can't be relied on.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.224
Do we need government to
just set stronger rules?

00:30:45.224 --> 00:30:46.640
CHRISTINE BADER:
We absolutely do.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.370
And so, none of the things
that I've talked about

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:51.207
relieve government of
their responsibility.

00:30:51.207 --> 00:30:52.790
I mean, if governments
were fulfilling

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.925
their responsibilities,
we wouldn't

00:30:54.925 --> 00:30:56.610
be having this conversation.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.160
I mean, we would.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:58.685
Right?

00:30:58.685 --> 00:31:03.520
There's no substitute for
strong, smart, good, properly

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.460
enforced regulation.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.880
But the problem I think is
that when something bad happens

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.760
with a company, the
conversation seems to be,

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.940
oh, there go those
evil companies again.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.810
We need stronger regulation.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:19.140
And it's like, well, we've
got a lot of regulation.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.610
Like, how's that working
out for us, right?

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.830
And so to me it's sort of like,
if you're watching a basketball

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.150
game and the basketball
players start throwing punches.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.858
And everybody's like,
where are the refs?

00:31:28.858 --> 00:31:29.962
Where are the refs?

00:31:29.962 --> 00:31:31.110
Well, hang on.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.540
Why are you letting the
players off the hook?

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.160
Right?

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.760
We can't just look at the refs.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.640
We need the refs.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.400
The refs have to be there.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.390
So there is no substitute
for strong, good regulation.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.520
But regulation takes a
long time to pass, right?

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.260
And the companies know
better than anyone

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.750
else what's going on inside.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.640
So that's the focus here.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.830
But I do talk a bit about
the role of government,

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.880
and in no way should governments
be let off the hook, nor should

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.560
the rest of us.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.070
Nor should consumers
or investors.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.570
SARAH MURRAY: Well,
and in some ways

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.790
it's companies' responsibility
to engage with governments

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:10.970
to develop the right kind of
regulations that doesn't hinder

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.080
business but does the
right thing as well.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.205
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah.

00:32:15.205 --> 00:32:18.220
SARAH MURRAY: I just wanted to
talk a little bit about life

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.590
as a corporate idealist and
how you get things done.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.610
Because you didn't
go in to be a CSR.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:29.200
You didn't join BP as a CSR
person or a sustainability

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.750
person.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.280
And we have lots of those people
with lots of those titles.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.630
But is it the case
that actually everybody

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.470
can be a corporate idealist?

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.136
And how do you do that from
within a position where,

00:32:43.136 --> 00:32:45.010
I don't know, you're in
operations management

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:49.002
or HR or communications?

00:32:49.002 --> 00:32:51.520
What would you
advise to people who

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.300
would like to get
involved in this

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.227
but are not working
in the CSR department?

00:32:56.227 --> 00:32:57.768
CHRISTINE BADER:
Yeah, well sometimes

00:32:57.768 --> 00:33:00.050
I think people can be in a
position of greater power

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:04.890
just by doing the functions that
they're doing and doing them

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.360
well and thinking
about the big picture.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.620
I mean, in China I was on
a construction team, right?

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.020
Because our biggest
risk there, I

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.900
was sent out there
to work on a BP--

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:14.410
SARAH MURRAY:
Didn't know that you

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.210
learned building when
you were doing an MBA.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:16.680
CHRISTINE BADER: Exactly.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.880
Who knew that
construction was my minor.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.230
But no.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:22.840
But I went out there because
BP had a joint venture

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.280
with Sinopec, one of China's
state energy companies,

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.030
to build a really big
chemicals plant that

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.530
was going to bring in tens of
thousands of migrant workers

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:33.120
into a town of
about 30,000 people.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:33.830
So, you know.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.100
Could be some impacts there.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.100
So my first week there
I was in this meeting.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.717
And it was like half BP
guys and half Sinopec guys.

00:33:42.717 --> 00:33:44.300
And we were going
down the spreadsheet

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.890
of the latest
estimates for the cost

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.080
and the timeline
for the project.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.340
And there was one label
in the spreadsheet where

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.070
the number was
eight but the label

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.590
hadn't been translated
into English.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:01.130
And so my BP colleague said,
what's the number eight?

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.360
What's the label?

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.831
And Sinopec guy said, oh.

00:34:04.831 --> 00:34:06.580
That's the projected
number of fatalities.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.739
He said, excuse me?

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:11.489
And he said, yeah.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:14.040
Based on a project this big
with this many man hours,

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.409
we would expect
eight fatalities.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:23.960
And my colleague said,
the target is not eight.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.250
He said, the target is zero.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:31.980
And the Sinopec guy said,
that's not realistic.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.949
And he said, if you
set expectations

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.080
that you're going to
kill eight people,

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.937
you're probably going to
kill at least eight people.

00:34:38.937 --> 00:34:40.770
And they guy said, well,
it's not realistic.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.610
And I realized
that he was right.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.944
Based on their track record,
it was probably realistic

00:34:46.944 --> 00:34:49.370
that they were going
to kill eight people.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.190
So that's the kind
of conversation

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.560
that I had to have there.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.860
This was on the
construction team, right?

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:02.806
So we managed not to kill
anybody during construction.

00:35:02.806 --> 00:35:03.305
Hurray!

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.360
But to make the case
there for example,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:13.270
it took me a while to figure
out the right language to use.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.840
So I went in there saying OK.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.270
We're going to protect the
human rights of the workers

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.600
and of communities.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.290
And you know, that
didn't work so well.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.520
I mean, it just fell flat.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.570
I didn't get thrown
out or anything.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.120
But it just didn't work.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.540
And then I tried, OK.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.260
These are the standards that
BP uses for our projects

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.515
around the world and that's
what we're going to use here.

00:35:34.515 --> 00:35:36.330
And it was like,
get out of here.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:38.470
That's incredibly
arrogant, right?

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.550
So I had to shut up
for a couple of weeks

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:45.640
and just listen to
what resonated, right?

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.040
What are people motivated by?

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.280
What drives them?

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.760
And so finally I
came back with, OK.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.640
I understand that you want
this to be a world class model

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.010
project.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.030
And if that is the
case, then these

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.290
are the standards, these
international standards

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:01.350
on working conditions.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.630
These are the standards that
world class model projects use.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:05.610
And they're like, OK.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:06.699
Why didn't you say so?

00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:08.240
SARAH MURRAY: It's
so true, isn't it?

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.240
So many different
parts of business

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.860
have their own language.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.602
I remember talking
to one-- no, I

00:36:13.602 --> 00:36:15.310
think it was actually
in the oil industry

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.520
and they were saying,
take the word integrity.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.179
If you say the word integrity
when you're standing in the CSR

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.970
department, they probably
think that you're

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:26.300
talking about being
honest and open

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.716
and treating your workers right.

00:36:27.716 --> 00:36:29.340
And if you say
integrity to an engineer

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.512
he means is our oil
pipe going to blow up?

00:36:31.512 --> 00:36:32.470
CHRISTINE BADER: Right.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.660
It's [INAUDIBLE], yeah.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.685
SARAH MURRAY: You know,
those language, those terms

00:36:36.685 --> 00:36:37.830
are very powerful.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:42.720
And I think one of the
things that comes out

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.890
very strongly in
your book is how

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:47.480
you, as corporate
idealists, how do

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.700
you connect with the
rest of the company?

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.160
But just to go
back to something I

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.500
mentioned at the beginning
of this conversation,

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.660
how do you create your community
as a corporate idealist?

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.030
You mentioned I think going to--
I think it was just after you'd

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.540
had the twins-- you
mentioned you were determined

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.246
to get to this BSR conference.

00:37:06.246 --> 00:37:08.370
CHRISTINE BADER: I couldn't
see straight, but yeah.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.661
SARAH MURRAY: And I think I
remember meeting you there.

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:12.410
You looked great by the way.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:17.700
But this need to be with other
people in your community.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.720
How would you advise people to
try building those communities

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.572
so that you don't feel such a
isolated person in this role?

00:37:25.572 --> 00:37:27.280
CHRISTINE BADER: I
think now it's easier.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.450
I mean, every company
has interest groups

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:33.400
and every company's
got a green team.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.540
And I think it's easier.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.200
And I think for
outside of the company

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.990
there are CSR sustainability
meetups everywhere.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.450
So I think it's a lot easier.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.834
But I guess one thing
that came through

00:37:44.834 --> 00:37:46.750
in a lot of these
interviews-- and again, they

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.083
were people who I'd known
professionally for a long time

00:37:49.083 --> 00:37:50.510
but never talked
to them about how

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.110
they found their jobs
in the first place.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.210
And one theme that
certainly was true for me

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:01.500
is that I did a lot of
thinking out loud about what

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.530
I was interested in regardless
of the job that I was doing.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.300
But what's our company's
role in society?

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.350
And oh, what's
going on over there?

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.520
I mean, you still have
to be good at your job

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.310
and focus on it, right?

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.330
But for a lot of these
people, again, they

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.660
fell into these roles
when corporate social

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.260
responsibility, CSR, was
not really a function.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.860
So like me, they fell
into it because they

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.220
were asking lots of
questions and talking

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.000
to other people in their
company about well,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.524
here's where I'm interested,
and what are we doing on this?

00:38:35.524 --> 00:38:36.690
And what should we be doing?

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:37.981
And shouldn't we be doing this?

00:38:37.981 --> 00:38:39.880
And I just saw a
documentary last night

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.610
and just read an
article about this,

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.610
and how do we react to that?

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:48.130
So that when something
opened up people

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.450
thought, oh, that person
would be really good at this.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:54.131
Very rarely does a job
posting pop up on the board

00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:54.880
and it's like, oh.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.580
I should apply.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.399
And then you apply.

00:38:57.399 --> 00:38:58.940
SARAH MURRAY: You
end up doing things

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.850
from within your
existing job and probably

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.730
doing nothing in your
spare time until somebody

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:04.830
comes along and says, hey.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.606
This is something we
need in the company.

00:39:06.606 --> 00:39:08.230
CHRISTINE BADER: So
I'm a big proponent

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.240
of thinking out loud
about the things

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.955
that you're interested in.

00:39:11.955 --> 00:39:13.500
And I have found
certainly for me

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.454
that that tends to create space
for opportunities to arise.

00:39:17.454 --> 00:39:19.120
SARAH MURRAY: What
does that mean though

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:23.220
for somebody who is thinking
they would like to do this

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.800
but they're graduating
from business school?

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.610
And where do you start?

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.600
I mean, as you say,
the job that says

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.859
CSR and sustainability
could sort of mean anything.

00:39:32.859 --> 00:39:33.775
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah.

00:39:33.775 --> 00:39:35.140
Yeah.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.870
SARAH MURRAY: How do
you go about that today?

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.160
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah, well I
suppose there are a few things.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.545
I mean, within business
school there's net impact,

00:39:43.545 --> 00:39:45.220
which is the association.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.050
And every business school
has a net impact chapter now.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.880
And they have their own job
boards and things specifically

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.280
for these jobs.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.780
But I suppose when I get all
of these inquiries of people

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.980
saying, oh, I really want
to get into this field,

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.740
I ask them, well, what do you
actually want to do all day?

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.950
Do you want to be
traipsing around villages?

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:10.540
Do you want to be sitting
behind a desk creating policies?

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.940
So I guess like any
job you break it down.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.260
What are the skills that I
want to be using all day?

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.500
What are the issues
that I really care

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.330
about that I want
to be working on?

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:25.060
Are there particular countries
that I'm really excited by

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.342
or geographies that I
have a specialty in?

00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:29.800
And then like
anything, and there's

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.570
a little bit of serendipity
in finding the right position

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.320
with the right people
at the right company

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.720
open at the right time.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.570
But people talk about
serendipity a lot,

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.152
and I think we give it
too much weight, right?

00:40:42.152 --> 00:40:44.360
SARAH MURRAY: You have to
make your own opportunities

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:44.900
in some ways.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.290
CHRISTINE BADER:
You have to make it.

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:45.680
Yeah.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.804
Because it drives me crazy.

00:40:46.804 --> 00:40:48.990
I mean, you guys hear a
lot of people speak here.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:52.160
And I will bet you that
whenever you hear illustrious

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.570
people talk about their careers,
inevitably there was always

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.340
one moment when
they say, and then

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.340
I just got this call one day.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.190
Right?

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.370
There's some knowing nods.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:04.490
I just got this call
out of the blue one day.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:06.480
And that's baloney, right?

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.460
So when they say that, ask
them to trace the call.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.860
Because people don't
offer jobs to somebody

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.120
who they've never met before.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.790
People offer jobs to people who,
oh, I was just playing squash

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:22.980
with my friend and he mentioned
that his friend's daughter

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.320
was looking for a job, right?

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.540
Or it's a conversation
that you had with somebody

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.360
three years ago.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.520
And something just
opened up, right?

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.010
I mean, you can't control
the timing of these things.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.880
And that's where
serendipity comes in.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.753
But I actually think it does
a great disservice when people

00:41:40.753 --> 00:41:43.086
talk like that, when people
say, I just got the call out

00:41:43.086 --> 00:41:45.544
of the blue one day, because
it makes you think that you're

00:41:45.544 --> 00:41:47.610
just supposed to sit back
and wait for the call.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:50.240
SARAH MURRAY: Whereas in fact
it's a lot of asking questions,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.145
talking about the right things.

00:41:51.145 --> 00:41:51.463
CHRISTINE BADER: Exactly.

00:41:51.463 --> 00:41:53.270
And thinking out loud and
building your network.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.570
SARAH MURRAY: Absolutely.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.307
Yeah.

00:41:54.307 --> 00:41:56.140
Well, on that note
actually is a good moment

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.370
to see if anybody has any
questions here for Christine.

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.870
AUDIENCE: CSI's very much
like [INAUDIBLE] the company

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:14.790
when it tries to fix the problem
because we're a good company.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:21.052
What can consumers
do to push companies

00:42:21.052 --> 00:42:22.294
to change their practices?

00:42:22.294 --> 00:42:23.210
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.340
That's a great question.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.605
And I think consumers
have to ask, right?

00:42:26.605 --> 00:42:28.610
Users have to demand.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.900
And so I think in
this sector we saw

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.262
that here where users are
saying, well, hang on.

00:42:35.262 --> 00:42:37.070
Why was this
information taken down?

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.302
Why am I getting
different search results

00:42:39.302 --> 00:42:40.510
in this country than in that?

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.890
I mean, I think users and
consumers have to ask.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:47.660
But frankly, I've gotten
really depressed with how

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.650
little consumers demand.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.470
And I site some of these studies
in the book of how people

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.050
say that they will pay
more for fair trade

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.640
or sustainable
products, but there

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.550
are all these studies
that show if you've

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.480
got two piles of socks sitting
next to each other and one's

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.220
marked fair trade
and one's marked not,

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.240
people will buy the fair trade
one if they're the same price.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.800
But as soon as you
bump the price up

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.510
people don't buy them, right?

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.440
So there's a little bit of
money where our mouth is.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.920
But I appreciate that
that's really hard.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.870
But I think just
asking the question.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.240
So one of the times when
I did one of those head

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.630
to toe inventories and I
realized that there were

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.880
a couple of brands that I'm
wearing that I didn't know

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.630
anything about, I tweeted
and I just said, hey x brand.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:33.280
What's your policy in
the wake of Rana Plaza?

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.350
Two of them didn't respond.

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.640
And so I re-tweeted
and I said, bummer.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.590
You're not responding.

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:44.080
I'm not buying any
more of your stuff.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.860
One of them I posted something
on their Facebook page

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.910
and they wrote this
long, awesome response

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:52.910
of how well, we try
to establish long term

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.570
relationships with
our suppliers,

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:55.890
et cetera, et cetera.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:59.015
And I hadn't verified
it yet, but I

00:43:59.015 --> 00:44:00.640
think it was a pretty
awesome response.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.410
And there were lots of other
people who liked the comment.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:08.470
So I think asking the questions
again is really important.

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:09.560
We have to ask.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.960
And it makes the job of the
people inside the company

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.150
a lot easier to be
able to say, look.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:19.480
This isn't my imagination
that this is important.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.840
Well, there are a couple
of interesting ways

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.370
that I talk about
this in the book.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:26.567
One of them, I interviewed a
lot of advocates an activists.

00:44:26.567 --> 00:44:28.900
And again, they're people who
I've known for a long time

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.550
but I had never actually talked
to them about their tactics

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.992
and how they think
about their work.

00:44:34.992 --> 00:44:36.700
So there were some
human rights advocates

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:42.310
that said, actually, we see
our job as creating space

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:45.580
inside the company for
you to do your job better.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.030
Which were so interesting.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.170
And one other person
inside a company

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:53.640
said, you know, I used to
have to call up quietly one

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:57.450
of my NGO or socially
responsible investor friends

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.150
to say, now would be
a really good time

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.927
for you to write a
letter to my CEO.

00:45:02.927 --> 00:45:04.760
And you don't really
have to do that anymore

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.880
because they're
a hashtag, right?

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.780
You don't need to
do that anymore.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.832
But I think users and consumers
absolutely have to ask.

00:45:12.832 --> 00:45:18.610
SARAH MURRAY: And technology has
made that so possible in a way

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:19.730
that it never was before.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.890
I mean, you can immediately
contact a company

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:23.890
and ask them a question.

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.070
CHRISTINE BADER: On
Twitter, on Facebook, yeah.

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:27.653
SARAH MURRAY: I mean, years ago
you had to write them a letter

00:45:27.653 --> 00:45:29.620
and it probably ended
up in some backwater.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:29.810
CHRISTINE BADER: Right.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.240
Because nobody else ever saw
that you wrote the letter.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:32.560
SARAH MURRAY: Right.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:32.940
CHRISTINE BADER: Right?

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:33.100
SARAH MURRAY: Exactly.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.710
So they didn't
have to answer it.

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:35.751
CHRISTINE BADER: Exactly.

00:45:35.751 --> 00:45:36.950
And now it's out there.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:37.330
SARAH MURRAY: Yes.

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:38.125
It's all public.

00:45:38.125 --> 00:45:40.108
So yeah.

00:45:40.108 --> 00:45:41.056
Another question?

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.218
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much
for being here first of all.

00:45:47.218 --> 00:45:48.640
Appreciate it.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.090
How do you deal with
the-- my thought

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.220
process is it must be very
disheartening at times

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:59.510
when you see something
like BP oil spill happen.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:03.230
And a couple of years on, zero
conversation really happening

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.920
about it.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.286
But with our
ecosystems [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:08.286 --> 00:46:12.870
disintegrated by all accounts I
think during that time period.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.730
So I guess for something like
environmental issues or climate

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.480
change, something like
that, it's kind of,

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.160
we're on a ticking clock.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.760
Versus something
like labor rights

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.890
which might take their
time from a policy

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.434
level down to the grassroots.

00:46:27.434 --> 00:46:29.600
How do you deal with something
like the environment,

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.864
and do you get
disheartened [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:33.864 --> 00:46:35.030
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah, sure.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:36.010
I mean again,
that's a lot of what

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.000
compelled me to write the book.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.030
Because it was after
the Deepwater Horizon

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:40.020
disaster, it was like,

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.764
[SIGHS]

00:46:41.764 --> 00:46:42.930
CHRISTINE BADER: What is it?

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:43.950
Like, what does it mean?

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.180
Are we making any
difference at all,

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.682
or is this completely useless?

00:46:49.682 --> 00:46:51.390
So again, not to give
away the punchline,

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.840
but I don't think it's
completely useless.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.240
But I think that all
of us as individuals

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.010
need to decide, what role
do we want to play, right?

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.640
And so some of us need to be
inside companies and fighting

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.830
that incremental,
everyday, like trying just

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:10.420
to tweak some practices
that take a long time.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.260
And some of us need to be
shouting from the rooftops

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.110
and being activists and
protesting out on the street.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:22.290
And obviously, those rules
have their frustrations too.

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:25.870
But I do have faith that
all of the people who

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:27.740
are doing this work do
believe that they're

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.876
making a difference.

00:47:29.876 --> 00:47:31.250
And one of the
themes that really

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.140
came through loud
and clear which was,

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.302
again, I didn't expect,
it was the optimism

00:47:37.302 --> 00:47:39.320
of people who are
doing this work.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.470
So one friend who's
worked in supply chains

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:49.520
for a number of apparel
companies, he went on a visit

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.739
to visit factories in India.

00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:55.280
And then the guy who was showing
him around said, let me just

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.280
take you to one factory
that's not on your list.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.620
It supplies the domestic market.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.490
Just to show you what it's like.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:02.990
And he walked in there.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:04.870
He said, it was filthy.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.520
There was a 10-year-old
kid on one of the machines.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.480
And it was horrible.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.650
And I said, well, what did
that feel like to see that?

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:17.557
And he said, well,
he said, it opened up

00:48:17.557 --> 00:48:19.140
this whole other
question that I don't

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.620
know what to do with of what
do we do with factories that

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.610
are supplying the domestic
market that aren't

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.070
held to international standards?

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:30.050
And he said, but actually
I left optimistic.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.950
Because I thought if these
were what the factories that do

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.730
supply us looked like
20 or 30 years ago,

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.060
we have made a big difference.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.910
And it's that optimism that
I saw over and over again.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:46.020
One guy who works for
a big mining company

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.380
and went to Papau New Guinea
on his first day of work

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:53.480
and saw the extent of
domestic violence there.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.540
And was trying to
think about, well,

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:59.146
what role could or should
or does the company play?

00:48:59.146 --> 00:49:00.350
Are we exacerbating it?

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:02.250
How could we make it better?

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:04.380
And I thought,
and I said to him,

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.064
wasn't that incredibly
overwhelming and disheartening

00:49:07.064 --> 00:49:08.980
to see that this is what
you're stepping into?

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.920
And he said, I thought
this was an opportunity

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.660
to do really good
human rights work,

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.010
that this is a place
where we could actually

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.620
make a difference.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.120
So yeah.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.440
It's incredibly disheartening.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.160
But what are you
going to do about it?

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.326
Are you going to do nothing?

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:23.880
Like, we've all got
to do something.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.047
And it's just,
what is ours to do?

00:49:26.047 --> 00:49:28.380
SARAH MURRAY: And different
people have different roles.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:31.199
I mean, I think even
within the NGO community,

00:49:31.199 --> 00:49:31.990
it was interesting.

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:34.323
I was talking to somebody
from Greenpeace the other day.

00:49:34.323 --> 00:49:37.460
And he was saying, we
pave the way for the NGOs

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.730
who are going to work with
companies by giving them

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:44.020
the agenda to do that.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.080
It makes it easier for
us to show up at the door

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.250
when Greenpeace has been
out there hammering away.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.510
So I think there is
this sort of ecosystem

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:55.862
of forces that will
shift companies.

00:49:55.862 --> 00:49:57.215
I think we have-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:57.215 --> 00:49:57.965
Yes, that's right.

00:49:57.965 --> 00:49:59.749
Another question there.

00:49:59.749 --> 00:50:02.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.530
So one thing that really
struck me about your book

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.984
was this feeling
of being isolated

00:50:10.984 --> 00:50:14.442
as a corporate idealist
in a massive company.

00:50:14.442 --> 00:50:17.159
And I was wondering
if you could speak

00:50:17.159 --> 00:50:21.150
about creating a culture
of accountability

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:26.910
in a huge company
such as Google or BP.

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:30.680
The supply chain
is just so massive.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.560
So for the Gap example that
you presented about the sub

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.307
subcontractor hiring
these laborers as opposed

00:50:37.307 --> 00:50:40.450
to corporate has that
Gap saying let's hire.

00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:45.260
How do you manage
for accountability

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:49.160
in these huge supply
chains and also,

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.750
if you could speak about your
experience at BP or elsewhere,

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:56.840
just creating that culture of
accountability among people?

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.870
CHRISTINE BADER:
And by that, do you

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:04.720
mean a culture of taking
responsibility for those issues

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.520
that previously somebody might
have said that's not our--

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.970
AUDIENCE: Right.
[INAUDIBLE] subcontractors

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:12.420
because it's no
longer in our hands.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:12.920
Yeah.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.880
CHRISTINE BADER: Yeah.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.730
That's a great question.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:19.200
Let me think to
my own experience.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:23.010
Again, I guess so
in China it was

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:27.700
about trying to make
the case that we

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:31.480
are accountable for those issues
whether we like it or not.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:37.340
And I think that's been
a big theme in this field

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.480
for a long time of companies.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.670
Every company's sort of
going through this journey.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:45.300
And it's like the seven
stages of grieving, right?

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.820
Or that first there's
this denial, right?

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.590
And we saw this with
Nike with sweatshops

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:52.120
and we saw it with
Shell in Nigeria.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.150
And we even saw it, I
think, with censorship

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:57.190
when the first wave sort of hit
this industry and these cases

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:01.270
coming to the fore of companies
saying, not my responsibility.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.772
That somebody else's
responsibility.

00:52:04.772 --> 00:52:06.980
And then I think realizing,
it's like, you know what?

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.180
That's not good enough.

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.020
And whether or not legally
this is your responsibility,

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.780
the court of public
opinion believes

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.902
that it's your responsibility.

00:52:15.902 --> 00:52:18.360
So I think a lot of companies
started taking responsibility

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:24.130
because they realized,
well, I guess it is now.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.270
So I think there are a few
factors that make that happen.

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:30.490
One of them is
external pressure.

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:34.390
And so we saw this with Apple
when the big "New York Times"

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:36.760
expose came out about
working conditions

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.640
in Foxconn factories.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.562
And at first Apple
sort of demurred.

00:52:40.562 --> 00:52:43.020
I mean, they've been working
on supply chain responsibility

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:43.714
for a long time.

00:52:43.714 --> 00:52:44.380
This wasn't new.

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:47.810
But we really saw them
step up after there

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:50.070
was so much public pressure
and join the Fair Labor

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:50.780
Association.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:54.130
Which is a big deal for
Apple in particular, right?

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.700
To have third party
auditors come in

00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:00.190
and inspect their
supplier factories.

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:03.960
And actually for Google to join
the Global Network Initiative,

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:08.770
that's a huge step because that
requires third party auditors

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:10.730
to come in and look
at your processes.

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.740
And you guys know
better than anybody.

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.390
I mean, do you let
anybody in here

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:16.300
to poke around
and look at stuff?

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.160
Like, that's
actually a big deal.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:21.750
But I think that your company's
leadership realized, because

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:24.520
of what enough of you were
saying also inside the company.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:27.590
And be like, hey, we need
to step up our game here

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:30.710
if we're really going
to live out our values

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:33.010
and take responsibility
for what we're doing

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:37.160
and be the most trusted
company for people.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.530
This is what we need to do.

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:40.750
So again, I think
in every company

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:43.840
there are going to be different
drivers and pressures that

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.920
will create that culture.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.440
But I think in all of
those cases a lot of it

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.835
will come from within,
of people saying, folks,

00:53:51.835 --> 00:53:53.477
this is simply
what we need to do.

00:53:53.477 --> 00:53:55.310
But I think it's different
in every company.

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:56.768
SARAH MURRAY: And
I think there are

00:53:56.768 --> 00:53:59.390
a lot of-- I mean,
shareholders for a start,

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:01.300
are starting, in
some cases, starting

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.640
to push the companies that
they own into disclosure.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.350
And then you have the power
of a company like Walmart

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:11.556
that can say, well,
look here suppliers.

00:54:11.556 --> 00:54:13.930
You've all got to meet certain
environmental standards as

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:15.790
if you're actually
going to sell to us.

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:18.742
So I think there's a
range of pressures.

00:54:18.742 --> 00:54:19.450
But you're right.

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:22.369
I mean, the internal is a
very important one as well.

00:54:22.369 --> 00:54:24.035
I think we might have
time for one more.

00:54:24.035 --> 00:54:25.598
FEMALE SPEAKER:
One more question.

00:54:25.598 --> 00:54:26.345
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:26.345 --> 00:54:27.720
CHRISTINE BADER:
If there is one.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:28.938
SARAH MURRAY: If there is one.

00:54:28.938 --> 00:54:29.729
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:54:29.729 --> 00:54:31.980
Well, I just want to thank
Christine and Sarah so

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.730
much for coming to
speak with us today.

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.300
It was a great conversation
and lots of issues

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.572
that Google's thinking about
too in a very different context.

00:54:39.572 --> 00:54:41.840
So interesting to hear
all of those perspectives.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.480
So thank you again.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.460
I really appreciate it.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.050
SARAH MURRAY: Thank you.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:46.633
CHRISTINE BADER:
Thank you, everybody.

00:54:46.633 --> 00:54:49.198
[APPLAUSE]
