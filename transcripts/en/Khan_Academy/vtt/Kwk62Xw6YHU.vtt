00:00:00.521 --> 00:00:02.906
- America's first roller coaster ride,

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:07.679
which opened in 1884 at
Coney Island, Brooklyn,

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:12.679
and capable of a top speed
of only six miles per hour,

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:16.743
and then we have the choice
E, which is no error.

00:00:16.743 --> 00:00:20.819
So let's think about if there
is an error here, where it is.

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:22.737
So, America's first roller coaster ride,

00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:26.380
which opened in 1884 at
Coney Island, Brooklyn,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.915
and capable of a top speed
of only six miles per hour.

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:30.935
So the way it's written right now,

00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:32.699
we never even get to knowing

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.981
what America's first roller coaster did.

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.879
Both of these clauses,
which opened in 1884

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.839
at Coney Island, Brooklyn,
that's one that kind of describes

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:41.883
America's first roller coaster,

00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:43.099
and then another clause,

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:47.039
and capable of a top speed
of only six miles per hour.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.313
That also, the way it's written,

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:50.320
it's still kind of just describing

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.559
America's first roller coaster,

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.685
but it didn't say what
it's actually doing.

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:55.305
If I were to say where the error is,

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.879
if I'm trying to convey this meaning,

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.017
I would have said something like,

00:00:58.017 --> 00:01:00.460
America's first roller coaster ride,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.520
which opened in 1884 at
Coney Island, Brooklyn,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.479
was capable of a top speed
of only six miles per hour.

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.786
So I would have changed and capable of.

00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:13.759
I would have changed
this to was capable of,

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.282
was capable of a top speed
of only six miles per hour.

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:21.398
So the error here is in part B.
