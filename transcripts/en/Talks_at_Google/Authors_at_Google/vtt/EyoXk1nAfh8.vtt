RACHEL O'MARA: Thanks everyone
for joining today.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.040
Thanks for coming during lunch
in San Francisco, and welcome

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.150
to Authors at Google.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.530
My name is Rachel O'Mara, and
I'm really excited today to

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.000
host our author, John Robbins.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.120
So John Robbins is the author of
nine best-sellers that have

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.890
collectively sold more than
3 million copies, and been

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.540
translated into 26 languages.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.690
His books include "The Food
Revolution," "The Classic Diet

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.390
for a New America," and most
recently, "No Happy Cows,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.520
Dispatches from the Front Lines
of the Food Revolution."

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.860
Currently, he is also one of
the most bloggers on the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.460
"Huffington Post."

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.480
As an advocate for a
compassionate and healthy way

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.310
of life, John is the recipient

Lifetime Achievement Award,
and many other accolades.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.700
Well done, John.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.930
That's great.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.900
The only son of the founder of
the Baskin Robbins ice cream

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.990
empire, John Robbins was groomed
to follow in his

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.220
father's footsteps, but chose
to walk away from Baskin

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.250
Robbins and the immense wealth
it represented to pursue the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.130
deeper American dream, the dream
of a society at peace

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.130
with its conscience, because
it respects the lives in

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.410
harmony with all life forms.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.800
John is the founder and board
chair emeritus of EarthSave

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.290
International, and has served
on the boards of many

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.150
nonprofit organizations.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.670
His work has been the subject
of feature articles in the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.650
"San Francisco Chronicle," the
"LA Times," "Chicago Life,"

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.810
the "Washington Post," "The
New York Times," the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.200
"Philadelphia Inquirer," "Time,"
"US News and World

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.270
Report," "Newsweek," and many
of the nation's other major

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.950
newspapers and magazines.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.050
His life and work have also
been featured in an

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.970
award-winning hour-long PBS
special titled "Diet for a New

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.070
America," and that's the book
we'll be talking about today.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.960
John lives with his wife of 45
years, Deo, and their son,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.970
Ocean, and his wife, Michelle,
and their grandsons River and

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.090
Bodhi, outside Santa
Cruz, California.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.290
Their home is powered entirely
by solar electricity.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.460
John also has a website,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.550
www.johnrobbins.info, for more details.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.850
So please welcome with
me John Robbins.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.780
Thank you for being here.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.680
Thank you.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.130
As was mentioned in your--
thank you for the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.820
introduction.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.800
I was born into an ice cream
company family, Baskin Robbins

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.840
31 Flavors.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.600
My father and uncle founded
the company, owned the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.030
company, ran the company.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.220
I'm an only son.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.980
I have sisters, but
no brothers.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.970
And my father groomed
me to succeed him.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.100
That was his plan for my life,
that I would one day run

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.890
Baskin Robbins, which was
becoming and became during my

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.540
childhood the world's largest
ice cream company.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.010
It's a billion dollar company.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.750
And it was assumed that's
what I would do.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.730
And I loved it.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.670
I grew up eating more
ice cream--

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.050
I don't eat ice cream anymore.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.060
And when people find that out,
they sometimes look at me as

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.420
if they're feeling sorry
for me, I think.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.280
And I say, please
don't, please.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.920
Really, I ate enough
ice cream in my

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.010
childhood for 20 lifetimes.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.940
We had an ice cream cone-shaped
swimming pool in

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.680
our backyard.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.520
We had freezers with all of the
month's 31 flavors, plus

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.790
experimental flavors, plus--

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.080
it was every kid's dream, in a
way, in a way, in that there

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.150
was unlimited ice cream.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.850
I did eat ice cream
for breakfast.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.420
It's true.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.150
It was really gross, actually.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.670
There's a shadow side
to all that.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.980
Ice cream is really
not a health food.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.700
It's not kale.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.940
And you can put some fruit
in some of the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.060
sherbets, and so forth.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.650
It's still basically very high
in sugar, and most of the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.370
flavors are very high in fat,
and the fat is highly

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.390
saturated fat.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.210
It's not healthy.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.930
And so people who eat a lot of
it have health problems.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.270
My uncle, Burt Baskin,
my dad's partner and

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.910
brother-in-law, died of a heart
attack at the age of 54.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.300
He was a very big man.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.910
He ate a lot of ice cream.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.810
And when he died, I asked my
father, do you think there

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.010
could be any connection between
my uncle's fatal heart

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.870
attack and the amount of
ice cream he would eat?

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.590
And my father looked at
me and very piercingly

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.060
said no, no, no.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.620
His ticker just got tired
and stopped working.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.300
And the expression on his face
and the tone of voice said

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.170
something else.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.580
It said, don't you ever ask
that question again.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.400
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.430
John Bradshaw, the psychologist
used to talk

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.240
about there being "no talk"
rules in families, taboo

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.910
subjects that you just don't
talk about in a given family,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.990
elephants in the living room
that take up a lot of space,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.120
but no one mentions it.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.000
Because there's some kind of
family dynamic at play in

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.240
which there's not an ability
to talk about that topic.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.640
In my family, one of the big
elephants in the living room

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.230
was that there could be a
connection between ice cream

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.030
and heart disease, or ice cream
and health, or even food

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.670
and health, that there might
be a connection there.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.730
Because if you start down
that slippery slope--

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.720
food and health--

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.360
you pretty soon get to ice
cream and heart disease.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.930
And my father did not want to
even consider the possibility

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.950
that there might be a link.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.840
And I couldn't understand why
he would not want to.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.280
By that time, by the time of my
uncle's death, which was in

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.760
1968, my father had manufactured
and sold more ice

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.760
cream than any human
being that had ever

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.880
lived on planet Earth.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.770
He didn't want to think the
family product was hurting

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.300
anybody, much less than it could
have contributed to his

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.370
partner, his brother-in-law,
my uncle's death.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.060
But I felt I should.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.410
I felt I needed to consider,
might there be that link?

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.210
And the more I looked into it,
the more I felt there was.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.140
And not just between ice cream
and heart disease, but ice

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.490
cream and diabetes.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.410
My father developed diabetes--

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.650
serious diabetes--

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.700
later on.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.570
Everybody in the family had
these various issues, problems

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.780
with weight, everywhere.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.960
And want to make it clear, it's
not just Baskin Robbins

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.170
as a company.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.560
It's ice cream.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.750
You know Ben and Jerry's.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.370
Ben Cohen--

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:59.400
marvelous man, peace activist,
very engaged person--

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.710
big guy, ate a lot of ice
cream, co-owned Ben and

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.400
Jerry's, co-founded it,
had a quintuple

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.000
bypass in his late 40s.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.240
These kinds of things tend
to happen when you eat

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.140
a lot of ice cream.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.630
And if you're in the ice
cream business--

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.540
if you're running Baskin Robbins
in particular, that's

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.800
what I would know about--

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.990
you want people to buy
as much as possible.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.840
That's the business model.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.380
That's how it works.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.150
So you want them to consume as
much ice cream as possible.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.820
And the reality is, when people
eat it in excess, they

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.730
get these health problems.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.530
So I was faced with an
existential quandary--

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.190
on the one hand, a lot of
financial security; on the

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.930
other hand, my integrity.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.580
And I made a choice
for integrity.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.160
And I told my dad that under the
circumstances, I was not

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.770
going to follow in
his footsteps.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.940
I was not going to work any
longer in the company.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.680
And what I specifically
said to him was this.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.050
I said, dad, we live in a
different time now than when

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.320
you grew up.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.730
We live under a nuclear shadow
where at any moment the

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.990
unspeakable could happen.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.460
We live in a time when the
environment is deteriorating

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.130
rapidly under the impact
of human activities.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.580
We live in a time when the gap
between the haves and the have

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.750
nots is increasing.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.370
And that does not, to my eyes,
create social stability or

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:31.280
security for anybody, even the
wealthy and privileged.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.320
It's undermining the
social fabric.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.230
We live in a time when 60,000
people on earth, many of them

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.480
children, die of hunger, die of
starvation every day, while

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.750
elsewhere there's abundant
resources going to waste.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.280
And then I said to him, dad, do
you understand that for me,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.820
feeling these issues and
concerns as intensely as I do,

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.160
inventing a 32nd flavor would
just not be an adequate

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.820
response for my life.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.340
And he understood to the
extent that he could.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.800
But I needed to be true to
myself, and so I made a choice

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.010
for integrity and
I walked away.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.790
And I also walked away
from the money.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.530
To be in alignment with my
integrity and my choices, I

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.120
needed to have no
access to it.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.910
And I told him that I didn't
want a trust fund.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.650
I didn't want to depend in any
way, not one dollar, on his

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.770
fortune, his achievements.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.700
And with Deo, my wife--

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.080
we've been together 46 years
now-- we moved away, and lived

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.810
very simply, back to the land,
built a log cabin,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.080
grow our own food.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.420
95% of what we ate for
10 years we grew.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.760
And it was a real
pendulum swing.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.850
In the family I'd grown up in,
I jokingly would say, perhaps

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.180
flippantly would say that
roughing it meant that room

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.410
service was late.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.400
Now we were really roughing
it, because we were living

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.000
very simply on land and trying
to grow our food and dependent

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.250
on what we could grow.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.530
Eventually I wrote "Diet for a
New America," and it became a

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.320
best-seller.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.060
It sold over a million copies,
and became something of a

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.580
phenomenon.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.240
I received 60,000 letters--

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.870
these are actual letters.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.120
This is before email--

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.520
from people who read the
book and wanted to

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.410
communicate with me.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.910
And almost all of them said,
this touched me deeply.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.720
How can I get involved?

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.560
What can I do?

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.500
And I want to give you a little
bit of what I was--

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.830
tell you a little bit about what
the book says, that so

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:41.370
many people felt that they
wanted to respond to that way.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.980
We just recently came out with
a 25th anniversary edition of

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.250
"Diet for a New America," and
that's what we have here

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.170
today, with a new--

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.970
not a preface, but a new
epilogue by me, a lengthy

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.280
epilogue describing what's
happened in the interim years.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.440
And I will talk a little
bit about that too.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.500
Basically, something has
happened in modern meat

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.460
production, and dairy
production, and egg

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.550
production, and animal factory
industries that most people

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.440
don't know about, and the
industries do not want people

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.950
to know about.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:27.100
In fact, this year, they are
initiating in many state

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.650
legislatures what are
called ag gag bills.

00:11:33.278 --> 00:11:38.850
This is legislation that makes
it a felony to videotape or

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.140
photograph what takes place in
slaughterhouses or feed lots

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.870
or factory forms.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.250
Because there's been a series
of exposes where people went

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.660
undercover working for Humane
Society United States, or

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.870
Mercy for Animals, or Compassion
Over Killing, or

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.620
some other animal protection
group--

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.710
have gone undercover as workers
in these places with

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.200
hidden cameras, and gotten
footage of what takes place.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.140
And it comes out, and people
who see it are abhorred.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.720
They just find it deplorable--

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.760
the cruelty, the lack
of sanitation.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.420
Sometimes there's
fines, sometimes

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.110
there's jail sentences.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.590
People get upset.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:22.090
There was a recent one in a
California feedlot where one

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.940
of the largest suppliers of
beef for the school lunch

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.800
programs, and they were breaking
all of the rules.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.706
We don't have very many rules,
but they were breaking all of

00:12:30.706 --> 00:12:32.230
them that we have.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.840
And so the industry doesn't want
this kind of footage of

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.320
getting out.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.040
They don't want you to know
what's happening.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.330
They don't want you to know--

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.690
this is a war against awareness,
basically.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.480
So the ag gag bills make
it illegal to do that.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.010
And they've passed in
four or five states.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.600
They've been initiated
in another 12 or 14.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.830
There's a real effort.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.440
All of these are the bills
are almost identical.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.270
They were written by ALEC, the
American Legislative Exchange

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.780
Council, which is a corporate
front group.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:12.350
And they're basically trying
to lock the veil down so

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.730
people can't know.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.550
Well, I'm trying to
lift the veil.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.300
And I have been for 25 years,
wanting to lift the veil so

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.290
people can see.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.140
I think you have a right to
know how your food is

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.630
produced, where it comes from.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.580
I think actually any animal
would want to know.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.540
This is a basic biological
thing.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.080
Before you eat something,
you'd want

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.310
to know, is it safe?

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.100
Is it what it says it is?

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.880
What's the back story here?

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.410
How did it arrive here?

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.630
Is it healthy for me?

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.390
What's going to happen
to me if I eat it?

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.400
We have a food industry that
does things to food.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.500
The problem isn't the food.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.890
I'm not trying to make
you afraid of food.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.070
I don't want you to
be afraid of food.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.220
I want you to love food.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.740
But you can't love what they've
done to the food.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.430
Because if they genetically
engineer it, and much of our

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:05.360
food is today, if it's grown
with poisons that residues are

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.960
in the food, these
things harm us.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.370
And they harm the biosphere upon
which we depend, and on

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.280
which our economy depends,
on which our

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.140
whole future depends.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.900
So when we expose when I expose,
when others like me

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.890
expose what's being done in
the media industry, in the

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.680
dairy industry, in the egg
industry in particular, I do

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.530
so because I want people to have
freedom of choice, not

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.280
because I'm trying to tell
you what to eat.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.870
And this is a critical
distinction.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.130
I myself, I eat a very
plant-strong diet.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.550
I'm virtually vegan.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.490
But I'm not asking
that you be.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.600
I'm asking that you be authentic
to who you are, to

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.020
what your values are, to what
is in your heart, to what

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.330
helps you live the highest and
best life possible for you.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.030
And that's your decision
and your determination.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.610
But you can't make those
choices honestly and

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.170
authentically if you don't have
accurate information.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.400
And the industry won't
give it to you.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.360
In fact, the industry is working
very hard to prevent

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.450
you from having it.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.650
I'm working very hard to allow
you to have it, so I'm

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.640
at odds with them.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.570
They don't like me very much.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.802
And that's OK.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.130
What I want you to know is that
modern meat production

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.150
has become--

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.330
it treats the animals very,
very differently than the

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.970
images most people
have of farms--

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.420
Lassie and Timmy running
around on a farm.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.980
They will use photographs
of beautiful--

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.230
I'll give you an example.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.240
The California Milk Producers
Association has an ad campaign

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.180
called "Happy Cows." It's
a national campaign.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.390
They've spent hundreds
of millions on it.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:52.560
And the tagline is "Great cheese
comes from happy cows.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.090
Happy cows come from
California." And they're

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.480
selling California cheese
nationally.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.680
We try to compete with Wisconsin
to become the

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.180
largest dairy state.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:08.470
So the photographs show cows
grazing on beautiful green

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.000
grass, pastures.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.330
Those photographs were taken
in Auckland, New Zealand,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.720
because the California dairy
industry is centered in the

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.300
Central Valley, particularly
the San Joachin Valley.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.040
And it's a desert there.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.330
It's dry.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.370
There's no grass.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.580
These are feedlot dairies.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:36.480
There's 20,000, 15,000 cows
in a penned area.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.720
It's nothing like the images
shown in the ads.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.535
In fact, I have sued-- along
with PETA, sued the California

00:16:44.535 --> 00:16:47.830
Milk Producers Association over
this ad campaign, because

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.960
I think it's false
advertising.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.730
And I think there's
a point here.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.100
If you--

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.200
we know that people will pay
extra for organic food.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.140
There's a subsection of
the marketplace--

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.880
I happen to be part of it--
that values organic food.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.819
And we'll pay a little bit
extra for that value.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.359
If someone were to sell as
organic, label as organic food

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:14.640
that was not, that was grown
with poisons, that would be

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.619
false advertising.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:20.230
That would actually be a
criminal act against the

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:24.470
people, cheating the people
who value this.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.579
And I'm willing to
pay extra for it.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:28.990
We don't allow that.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:34.690
We have organic certification,
which is third party, and it's

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.880
objective, and it's
verifiable.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.470
But when it comes to claims
about humane treatment of

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.710
animals, "happy cows come from
California," they say.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.520
That's a claim.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:52.110
It's not true, but we don't have
any way of asserting any

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.710
kind of verification on that.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.220
So they can get away with it.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.530
And then the people like me,
maybe like some of you, who

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.060
care about how animals
are treated--

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.100
and we're going to be eating
their flesh or their milk.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.240
It's going to be consumed
by us--

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.660
and want those animals to have
a decent life, to be treated

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:17.040
with some degree of basic
respect for their needs, are

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.400
being exploited.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.300
Because we'll pay-- we
see an ad like that.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.850
Oh, happy cows come
from California.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:22.865
That touches us.

00:18:22.865 --> 00:18:24.570
That speaks to our heart.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.860
So we'll go out of our way to
get the cheese that actually

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.130
comes from a feedlot, but we
don't know that, because

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.450
they're lying.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.365
This is one example.

00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:37.600
The examples are numerous,
way, way numerous.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.690
And what's happened is we have
put modern livestock in

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:49.450
confinement under conditions
that frustrate their natures,

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.960
that violate their natures to
such an extent, you do not

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.210
have to be a vegetarian or an
animal rights activist or even

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.740
a particularly empathic human
being-- if you see it, how

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.140
severe it's become--

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.190
to find it abominable,
appalling.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.720
If you have any feeling
whatsoever for animals--

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.380
and most of us do.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.290
Most of us, actually--

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.780
most Americans, actually, love
animals, to some degree.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.830
Now, I'm not saying you love
them more than people, but you

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.110
love them for who they are.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.840
And as a country, we treat our
dogs and our cats pretty well

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.320
as a rule-- not always,
but as a rule.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.600
Many of us to consider them
part of our families.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.970
We pay their vet bills.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.533
We buy their food.

00:19:36.533 --> 00:19:38.830
We have them sleep on
our beds with us.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:39.830
We give them names.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.100
They're part of our families.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.870
We feel enriched by those
relationships as human beings.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.920
We love them.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.750
They love us, very often quite
beautifully, back.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:57.570
But sadly, we also have a very
schizoid relationship to

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:03.460
animals, in that in this
country, if it's an animal

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:08.490
that we call a companion animal,
we treat it very well.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:13.710
But if we call the animal
dinner, if we find its flesh

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:19.550
tasty, we put it in a
different category.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.760
Now, there are laws in every
one of the 50 states about

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.650
cruelty to animals, restricting
certain

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.590
things you can't do.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.460
But in every one of the 50
states, the legislation that

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.250
exists exempts animals
destined for human

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.490
consumption.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:40.990
So, animals destined for human
consumption have no

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.230
protections under the law.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.600
And this is how the
industry wants it.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.350
And so their standard operating
procedures, the way

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.150
they treat the literally
billions of animals in modern

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.550
meat production that are
involved, if you did it to a

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.550
dog or cat, if you treated a dog
or cat that way, you would

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.190
be subject to felony
prosecution.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.720
And I am not talking
about the fact that

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.350
the animal is killed.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.740
I'm not talking about that.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.820
I'm talking about the lives
that the animals lead in

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.090
factory farms.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:12.750
It's severe.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.315
It's really extreme.

00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:15.700
I'm going to give just one
example so you know what I'm

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.610
talking about.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:21.170
And that's what happens to the
baby calves, the male calves,

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.390
born to dairy cows.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.770
If you think about it, they
have to keep dairy cows

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.472
pregnant all the time, because
they need them lactating to

00:21:28.472 --> 00:21:31.480
get the milk.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.550
Otherwise their udders
would dry up.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.070
So they're re-impregnated
every year.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.670
And then half the calves that
are born are female.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.130
Half are male, roughly.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:46.620
And the females are shunted off
to become four-legged milk

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.150
pumps like their mothers.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.080
But what happens to the males?

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.720
Can't get milk from a male.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.930
Infant calves, newborn calves,
are taken from their mothers

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:03.620
at birth, and they're put in
veal barns where they're

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.110
chained at the neck.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:09.660
And they have the space in
each stall so small, they

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.020
can't take a single step
in any direction.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.660
And they they're chained
there for four months.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.210
They can't take a single step
in any direction, and they

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.190
can't lay down in their normal
sleeping position because the

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.100
chain is so short.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.660
So to sleep, they have
to kind of hunch.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.665
They're kept in the dark for the
most part, often for four

00:22:28.665 --> 00:22:30.250
months in the dark.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.120
Most of them go blind.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.430
They are fed a diet that
is deliberately and

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:40.450
systematically devoid of iron,
so they become increasingly

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.330
anemic, eventually
pathologically anemic.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.000
Now, why would they want
them blind and anemic?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.120
Well, if the animal's
anemic, its flesh--

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.600
which, at birth, is kind
of a grayish color--

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.000
doesn't become pinkish
or reddish.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.400
That's the iron that
would do that.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.860
And we've been taught--

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.490
that the culture at large has
been taught that white meats

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.120
are healthier.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.570
So they call it milk fed veal.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:11.660
Now, it's not the
mother's milk.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.930
It's actually government surplus
skim milk powder.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.420
That's part of what
they're fed.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.440
It keeps them--

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.370
and there's no iron in milk
at all, nor in anything

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.000
else they give them.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.240
They don't use nails.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.045
They use plastic nails in the
stall so the animals can't

00:23:26.045 --> 00:23:28.930
lick and get any iron
from the nails.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:32.190
The whole thing is designed to
make them anemic so that the

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.780
flesh will be this
white color.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.600
Now, they chain them at the neck
so tightly because they

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.180
don't want them to move.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.640
The reason they don't want them
to move is because if the

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.260
animal moves, it will develop
some muscle tone, so

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.010
musculature.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.370
And they want the muscle
tissue to be

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.190
as flaky and tender--

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.970
ie., as undeveloped as
a muscle as possible.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.700
They call this tender veal.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.430
So this high-end product
that's made into veal

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.110
cacciatore and these dishes
that you'll find in fancy

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.420
restaurants, particularly
Italian restaurants, is

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.650
actually the flash of a tortured
baby animal, a

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.950
newborn animal that is kept
under conditions that I think

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.100
violate just about anybody's
sensitivities.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.660
I really want to emphasize,
again, this isn't an issue, I

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.830
don't think, for animal rights
activists and vegetarians.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.270
In fact, the vegetarians
are the people

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.910
what don't eat this.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:29.870
If I were eating meat, I'd
really be alarmed about this.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.030
I don't want to eat the
products of torture.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.450
And I actually believe, to tell
you the truth, that there

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.290
is some correlation.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.260
I can't prove this.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.450
I don't know how to
document this.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.410
But I do feel intuitively
there's some correlation

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.910
between when animals are treated
with this degree of

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:54.700
cruelty, their lives are this
much misery and fear, what

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.730
happens to the people's
emotional states who eat this,

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.410
day in, day out?

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.230
What happens to us as human
beings if the meat we're

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.180
eating, the dairy products we're
eating, are coming from

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.690
conditions, animals kept in
these kinds of conditions?

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.200
That kind of question I think
needs to be raised.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.610
I think it's an authentic
question.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.400
I don't know how to
answer it totally.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.380
But I think it's a question
we need, as a

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.830
society, to look at.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:25.120
If your prayer is at some level,
let there be peace on

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.420
Earth and let it begin
with me-- you

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.550
know that old prayer--

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.600
if you hearken to that, if that
speaks to you, does it

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.650
make sense, does it help
the manifestation, the

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.930
actualization of that impulse
to be eating food that comes

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.930
from conditions like that?

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.380
I don't think so.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.200
I really don't.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.640
And if you see how
severe it is.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.130
And what I've described as the
conditions in veal calf

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.270
raising is equivalent--

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.670
the details are a little
different-- but the degree of

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.880
control and the degree of
restriction of movement and

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.360
the degree of giving them
feedstuffs that are unnatural

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.120
to their physiology,
that's rampant.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.650
That's across the board, in
feedlot beef, in dairy cows,

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.180
in chicken--

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:15.120
in hens producing our eggs, in
turkeys, in hog production.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.370
The industry has become all
about the dollar, all about

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.770
the dollar.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.340
Not about the dollar and other
things, like the health of

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.640
people eating the product.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.760
It's only the dollar.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.570
So the health of the people
eating the product is not part

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.700
of the equation.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.170
It's not part of the thinking,
nor is the well-being of the

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.100
animals involved.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.800
These people don't wake up in
the middle of the night

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.110
thinking, how do I be
cruel to animals?

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.920
How I produce a product that's
as unhealthy as possible?

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.890
They don't do that.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.240
They do wake up in the middle
of the night asking

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.740
themselves, how do
I cut costs?

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.450
And it just so happens that the
things they end up doing

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.510
that cut costs almost invariably
end up being harder

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.690
and harder on the animals, and
producing food that is less

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.460
and less healthy
for us to eat.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.890
So I think we need to be aware
of this, in order to protect

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:12.730
ourselves, in order to reclaim
our food system, from

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:17.770
Monsanto, from McDonald's, from
industrial agriculture,

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.540
from the agrochemical
orientation,

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.590
from the GMO mentality.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:29.750
You see it in factory farms,
this a degree of chasing the

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.610
dollar at all costs.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.710
Nothing else matters.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.380
The well-being of the
environment doesn't matter.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.050
If you pollute--

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.670
you find a way to externalize
the cost.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.920
Someone else picks up the tab,
eventually the taxpayer,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.100
eventually the larger earth
community does, and then you

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.410
just move on.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.610
And that's how it's done, and
we're all paying a really

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.850
terrible price for it.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.560
Right now, as a country, we
have the highest rate of

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.750
obesity that any country
has ever had in the

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:08.020
history of the planet.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.880
We have the highest rate of
childhood diabetes of any

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.180
country that has ever existed
in the history of the earth.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:20.360
We spend more money on what we
call health care than any

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.130
other country.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.880
In fact, we spend more money
on what we call health care

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.220
then the next 10 countries
combined.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.960
And we are the only
industrialized country that

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.220
doesn't provide basic health
care to all of our citizens.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.130
We don't really have a
health care industry.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.720
We have a disease management
industry.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.500
The money is not in helping
people to keep their blood

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.000
pressure level, which is pretty
simple to do with a

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.650
healthy diet, actually.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:56.710
But the money is in the pills,
and so we let people eat food

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:58.370
that raises their
blood pressure.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.340
We actually encourage that.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.520
We subsidize those foods.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.660
Make them cheaper.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.575
People buy them.

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:06.820
Their blood pressure goes up,
then the drugs companies

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.150
profit from the sale-- this is
a disease-based economy.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.610
We spend $300 billion a year in
this country annually every

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.340
year on drugs, pharmaceutical
drugs.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.380
That is half of the amount
that's spent

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.100
in the entire world.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.600
We're 4% of the world's
population.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.410
We buy 50% of the drugs, and
70% of the antidepressants,

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:34.160
which, you can decide
what that means.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.650
Why do we have a Food and
Drug Administration?

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.460
Did you ever think about that?

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.670
Did you think food isn't
important enough to have its

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.570
own agency?

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.361
Our food?

00:29:44.361 --> 00:29:47.400
It's because if you eat
the food, you're

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.640
going to need the drugs.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.290
This is the system
we've created.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.880
And under these circumstances,
it's a revolutionary act, I

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.070
think, to be aware, and to take
action, to swim upstream,

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.960
against the current of society
which will wash you down to

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.390
the fast food joint, the Burger
King and McDonald's.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:07.350
And that's your choice.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.350
That's your freedom.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.290
That's consumer freedom.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.710
I don't think so.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.030
I don't think freedom
is, which of the 31

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.220
flavors do I want?

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.540
Believe me, I grew up
with that stuff.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.040
I think the freedom that we want
is to live-- how do we

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.520
choose and have available
choices that we can live

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.470
healthy lives and create healthy
communities, have

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:30.240
healthy families, look forward
to a healthy future on a

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.000
healthy planet?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.360
I mean, I think that seems
like a radical thought.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.650
That seems like pie in the
sky, almost idealistic

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.100
thinking, under the conditions
of today.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.560
That's why I call it
revolutionary.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.490
It does go against the grain
of our "ain't it awful"

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:50.290
society, and our victim
thinking.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:53.190
But we can take these actions.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:57.830
I just finished, a couple days
ago, a food revolution summit,

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.580
which I co-ran with
my son Ocean.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:05.430
And we had 73,000 participants
for the week, for eight days.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.480
There are a lot of people waking
up, a lot of people

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.370
wanting to be part of this food
revolution, wanting to

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.153
make their lives a statement of
compassion and how they eat

00:31:13.153 --> 00:31:17.460
and their health, so that what
you're eating is actually

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.800
contributing to your well-being,
and actually

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.120
contributing to the kind of life
and experience in your

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.070
body that you want to have, the
vibrancy, the vitality,

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:31.220
the beauty, the mental clarity,
the emotional

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:35.880
serenity, and the spiritual
alignment that makes life

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.030
fulfilling and wonderful.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.736
So that's the basics of--

00:31:42.736 --> 00:31:44.490
[INAUDIBLE] there's
lots I could say.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.820
But why don't we open to some
questions or comments.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.570
What's being invoked
in you hearing me?

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:53.260
Do you have any thoughts?

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.110
Do you want to share
a question?

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.530
AUDIENCE: And I think the open
question, at least in the

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.720
omnivore's dilemma, as far as I
know, is whether sustainable

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.130
farming is scalable.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:08.180
We know that Big Food is
mistreating animals and

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.550
polluting the environment
in order to

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.800
maximize their profit.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.720
But at the same time, they
do produce a lot of food.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.190
And so has anyone figured out
whether the sustainable

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.920
farming methods can feed
our entire country?

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.300
JOHN ROBBINS: Yes.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:27.520
Well, the reason that Big Food
is profitable and does produce

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.490
extravagant amounts of food-like
substances is that

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.180
they are subsidized heavily.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:39.280
For example, feedlots and
factories farms don't pay

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.800
their own pollution costs.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.790
The government's
picked that up.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.150
If they had to pay for the
pollution they caused, that

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.900
would raise the prices of their
foods considerably.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.660
People would be less inclined
to buy them.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.220
Another example is the
feed that they're--

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.190
it's basically corn and soy--

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:02.900
that they feed to the hogs and
the cattle and the chicken and

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.190
the dairy cows comes from
industrial plantations, huge

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:12.050
monocultures, most of them
GMO, saturated with

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.100
herbicides, just saturated
with them.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.090
And that's subsidized.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.440
So the cost to the industry of
those feedstuffs is almost

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.670
nothing, almost nothing.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:30.156
We pay for it as taxpayers, be
you vegetarian or a meat

00:33:30.156 --> 00:33:33.180
eater, you're paying for that
through your taxes.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:38.120
And also to the pollution that
we live with, the decrease in

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.885
soil fertility, the loss of
water resources, the drying up

00:33:42.885 --> 00:33:45.140
of the wells throughout
the Midwest.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.220
We're paying for it
in so many ways.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.570
But those costs are
externalized.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.420
We don't subsidize organic
agriculture.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.580
We subsidize agrochemical-based

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.790
agriculture.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.320
So that tilts the playing
field and makes

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.920
organics very expensive.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.970
Have you ever wondered why when
you go to Whole Foods or

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.650
anywhere, the organic
food costs more?

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.310
I mean, some people want it
more, will pay that premium

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:14.060
and can, but why does
it cost more?

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.850
Because of the subsidies.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.010
In the Farm Bill,
it's all there.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.830
I think--

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:23.270
and more than think I'm
working for this--

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.590
that we should not just tilt
the playing field so it's

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.380
level, although that would
be an improvement.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.070
I want to tilt it in the other
direction so that organic--

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.570
I want to put a tax on
pesticides, for example, and

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.750
then use the income from that
to lower the price to the

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.300
consumer of organic food.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.940
It's a revenue-neutral
solution.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.530
It's fairly simple.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:46.460
And what happens, is then,
that conventionally-grown

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.170
food, as we call it, food
grown with agrochemicals

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.820
becomes more expensive.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.150
Same thing, I would tax factory
farm meat production

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.990
and use the revenue to decrease
the cost of humanely

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:03.460
raised, again, turning the
turning thing topsy-turvy from

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.780
where it is now.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.050
The incentives are perverse
the way they are.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:12.360
Could we produce enough meat
that way, as much as we

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.010
produce now?

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.130
No.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.500
We eat way too much.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.930
We have heart disease.

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:20.150
It's still the leading killer
in the country.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.330
And people who eat far
less meat, we know--

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.210
all the data show.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.320
There's a mountain of studies
that shows this-- have far

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.680
less heart disease.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.130
They have far less
colon cancer.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.670
And it's a healthier diet
to get away from that.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.320
So we don't need
nearly as much.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.640
Now, McDonald's, though, wants
to sell all-- see, they've got

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.780
a tremendous marketing plan.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.710
I have to tell you, Ray Kroc
was the founder, owner for

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:47.770
many years, CEO for many
years, of McDonald's.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.590
Ray Kroc, before he started
McDonald's,

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.960
worked for my father.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.300
And my father invented
franchising.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.530
Baskin and Robbins was the first
franchised food place.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.040
And Ray Kroc was in charge of
the franchising department.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.230
And he said to my dad, I want
to go and try this with

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.160
burgers, and that became
McDonald's.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.940
I've actually never even
at McDonald's, because

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.670
I don't want to.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.520
I may be the only one in the
country that hasn't.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.090
When I see those signs, you
know, that brag about how many

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.900
billions have been sold, I
always think of how many

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.560
thousands of square miles
of rainforest have been

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.050
destroyed, how many heart
attacks have happened, how

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.970
many animals have
been tortured.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:39.240
I think of the families who,
like my uncle when he died at

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.690
the age of 54, his family,
what happened,

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.980
the loss, the pain.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.960
I think of the families where
that's happening.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:54.080
So I'm not, oh wow, another
billion sold.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.310
I'm like, how do we get
them out of business?

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.950
I would like to see plant-strong
diets become the

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:05.690
norm, people eating lots of
fresh fruits and vegetables.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:09.130
How about we put into a tax on
junk food and then use that

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:14.840
income to lower the
price of fresh

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.730
vegetables and fresh fruits?

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:23.280
So people now who are very
price-sensitive, the cheapest

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.090
calories are always junk, always
junk, high fructose

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:33.470
corn syrup, isolated soy
ingredients, highly processed

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:36.510
foods, McDonald's.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.080
You get a lot of calories per
your dollar, but you do not

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.070
get a lot of nutrition.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.520
That is why we have poor people,
financially stressed

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.525
people, who are obese
and malnourished.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.240
It's a terrible predicament,
and it's what we've created

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.220
with our food system.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.830
And there are ways we can change
the food system, and

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.360
then we could feed everybody
with good food, not at the

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.060
level of meat consumption that
we've grown accustomed to,

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.130
that we identify
with affluence.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:06.100
We've come to think of meet as
the reward of affluence, and

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:11.500
eating things like legumes,
lentils, and split peas, and

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.020
garbanzo beans as
peasant food.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.800
We have a class stratification
there.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.790
And when you think that way,
then you feel bad about

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.160
yourself if you're just
eating peasant food.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.380
And you're eating baked
potatoes, and you're eating

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.690
cabbage, and you're eating
carrots, and you're eating

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.860
lentils, and you're eating
split pea soup.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.930
And you feel like you're at
the bottom of the rung,

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:41.410
whereas veal parmesan is
like the high thing.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.580
But that's going to kill you.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:48.660
It's killing-- it's a terrible
thing to the veal calf.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:52.420
We've got to find our roots back
in the earth and not be

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.010
ashamed of it, that
we're creatures--

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.240
human comes from the same
root as the root humus,

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.390
or earth, or soil.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.870
And we can find our roots, and
then we can feed ourselves a

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:09.530
plant-strong diet, a healthy
one, with less resources, less

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:13.370
land than it is now going to
produce a meat-based diet.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:14.350
Yes?

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.040
AUDIENCE: What actually is going
on in terms of the data?

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.230
Because if you look around,
I feel like I see a lot of

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.330
people giving up meat.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:22.640
You see juice bars popping up.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.520
You see a lot more
healthy food.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.450
I read an article about
hummus taking off.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:28.710
But then you go to the Ferry
Building and there's a store

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:30.940
called Salty, Tasty Pig Parts.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.960
And there's all these cool
restaurants popping up that

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.760
are all about the most obscure
kind of meat you can eat.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.330
So, you know the data.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.360
What really is growing?

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.030
What's happening?

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.280
JOHN ROBBINS: Both.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.380
The light is getting
brighter, and the

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.920
shadows are getting darker.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:52.250
We're living in an interesting
time of crisis, in many ways,

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:56.000
in which both sides--

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.620
we're seeing some signs of real
progress, more awareness,

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.810
people take steps to live
healthier lives.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:05.870
We're going to have a GMO
labeling bill nationally

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.720
within the next two years.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.140
We may have Washington state.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.620
Vermont may pass
one this year.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.530
There's a lot of different
things.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.560
Organic food production
has increased 26-fold

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.040
in the last 25 years.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.150
Feedlot beef consumption, after
"Diet for a New America"

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:25.980
was published, went down 25%
in the next five years.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.640
There's a lot of good signs.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.930
But, on the other hand, Monsanto
is really trying to

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:37.270
control policy, and they're
succeeding to quite an extent.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:40.640
On the other hand, there's a lot
of dark things happening.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.780
That's why it's so important
to be alive today, to be

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.140
present, to be engaged,
to be aware.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.570
Because each of us makes
a difference

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.230
with the way we live.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.390
And sometimes you can
say, well, these

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.150
forces are so great.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.290
The numbers that are involved,
the dollar

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.740
figures are so great.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.030
These entities, corporations,
industries that have so much

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.450
to gain financially from the
way things have been, even

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.270
though it's destroying the
health of our nation and our

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:15.550
people, they're not
going to accede

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:18.140
lightly to their profits.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.220
So what can we do?

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.140
It's very important that we
do everything we can.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.520
My experience has been that
when you do what you can,

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.620
truly, and stretch yourself in
that way, you find yourself

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.730
capable of doing more.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:36.100
Somehow you become more
capable of bearing the

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.790
responsibility.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:42.020
You meet people, things happen,
you become stronger.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.740
Kind of a simplistic analogy
is to weight training.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:48.140
If you work out with a weight,
and you confront a weight

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.730
that's heavy for you and you do
so systematically, you find

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.940
it becomes lighter for you,
and you become capable of

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.170
lifting more weight.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.340
That's how the muscle responds
to the stress.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.600
That's a simplistic analogy,
but when we, as existential

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.850
beings, as spiritual beings,
as people on a journey here

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:06.430
together, do everything we can,
and stretch, and work on

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:09.670
that edge of ourselves, that
growing edge of how

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.970
accountable can we
be for our lives?

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.960
How engaged can we be with
others in a respectful way and

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.060
a passionate way?

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:21.150
How connected can be to the
earth, so that speak on its

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:23.550
behalf, we act on its behalf,
we live on its behalf?

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.690
And how engaged can we be with
the whole earth community, so

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:31.060
we find ourselves living with
some reverence for life, even

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.520
in a society that is as
materialistic as ours?

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.350
What happens is you become
a greater person.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.590
You become more human, and
more powerful, and more

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.750
connected to your soul.

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.090
And that's where your
power comes from.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:52.540
And more of us that do this,
the more we become a force.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:56.460
That It's certainly going
to be heard from.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.820
Will we be loud enough?

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.890
Will we be able to turn
the tide in time?

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.410
We'll find out.

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:07.140
But we're going to find out
kicking and screaming, and

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.960
we're going to find out doing
everything we can, as opposed

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.660
to just hiding in the "ain't it
awful" attitude, and being

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.230
passive and resigned and
suspicious and cynical.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:19.240
It's very cool.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:24.740
People are like, oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.990
That's going to get
us nowhere.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.590
AUDIENCE: I actually had the
pleasure to host Ingrid

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.090
Newkirk here at Google.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.910
So I learned a lot about the
dairies, and how, like you

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:42.060
just mentioned about the cows,
how they're impregnated, and

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.290
then their calves
are taken away.

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:46.310
So I contacted Straus
to learn.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.900
Because I don't need meat, but
I do like my milk and cheese,

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.430
because I wanted to find
what is available

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.870
out there as a consumer.

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.180
And one thing they shared with
me, and I'm glad they actually

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:01.060
share this, was the cows, yes,
they're in the field.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.080
They're fed pure, natural
products.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.400
But when it comes to the actual
slaughtering, not only

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.160
is their life span extended
because they are given good

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:17.362
food, which means, like, to
three to four years more of

00:44:17.362 --> 00:44:21.410
horror, of being constantly
impregnated, but then what

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:25.710
they also shared is that the
slaughtering, it's the same

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:29.200
process, whether it's organic
or non-organic.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:29.630
JOHN ROBBINS: Yeah.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:30.280
It's true.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.290
The USDA requires this.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.350
By the way, Straus Dairy, if
you're going to eat dairy

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:38.080
products in the bay area, Straus
is one of the best.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.870
I don't, personally.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.510
I feel healthier without it.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.230
I feel the data show most people
would be healthier

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.570
without any dairy products.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:46.610
But if you're going to, and want
to get them as humanely

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:51.620
as possible, Straus is
not a bad choice.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:56.180
But it's a low bar, because
the factory dairies are

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.580
deplorable.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:03.880
And as she was saying, the USDA
has requirements about

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.790
slaughtering of animals destined
for hamburger, or any

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.100
other form of meat
consumption.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:14.230
So they have to be slaughtered
in USDA-certified

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:18.320
slaughterhouses, which are
these horror chambers.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:25.080
So someone like Straus or Niman
Ranch, there's these

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.470
niche groups really trying
to do something in a more

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.600
environmentally positive way, a
more humane way, and a more

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.720
healthy way.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.300
And oftentimes they do,
to some extent.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.540
There are improvements there.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.050
But then when it comes
to slaughter--

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:43.360
and every diary cow, by the way,
every dairy cow ends up

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.060
as hamburger.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.970
So it's not that there isn't
killing involved there.

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:51.980
And every one of their male
calves ends up as veal.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:55.060
So they're killed at the age
of three or four months.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.950
So the dairy cows, instead
of in the typical factory

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:01.250
dairies, they live to four or
five, at Straus, they may go

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.300
to seven, but they end up
being slaughtered in a

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:08.320
conventional slaughterhouse,
trucked there under conditions

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.850
that are exactly the
industry norm.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:17.290
Nicolette Niman, whose husband,
Leroy Niman, founded

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:22.690
Niman Ranch, the largest
humanely raised operation in

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:25.240
the country, I've talked to
at length about this.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.810
She just hates it.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:29.350
She used to go, because she
would know the animals.

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:30.790
She'd have names for them.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:34.080
And then she would actually go
in the truck with, because the

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.340
poor animals were under
such stress.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.250
And she saw the misery, and she
got out of it because she

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:43.120
couldn't bear that part of it.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.150
We don't let them do their
own slaughtering.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:49.770
We don't let them find a
humane way to do it.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.990
And I've got to tell you, if I
were to describe to you in

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.210
detail what goes on in factory

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.770
slaughterhouses, you would cringe.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:58.340
You just would not
want to hear it.

00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.250
Would ruin your lunch.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:00.150
I promise you.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.640
I'm not going to do it.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.290
I don't want to inflict that.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:06.190
But at the same time, if we
eat the products of this

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.990
system, that's how we really
inflict it on the animals,

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.530
because we're paying them, the
producers, to do this.

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.530
Every time we buy a product,
we're basically saying to the

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:17.900
seller, do it again.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.390
And they will.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.670
They'll read your purchase
that way.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:24.560
And I don't want to support
these people.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.550
I don't want to support them
with what they're doing.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:35.520
That's another reason why I am
abstinent from their products.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.780
And also because I feel
so much better.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.570
I'm 65.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:40.600
I'm a marathon runner.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.670
I'm a triathlete.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:43.190
I feel great.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:48.130
My blood pressure is 90 over 60,
and that's not with drugs.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:53.770
And I see at my age of 65,
I see guys aging very

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:56.300
differently, depending on how
they've lived and the choices

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:56.800
they've made.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.040
And there's no guarantee.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.910
Some vegans die at 30.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.340
There's no guarantees.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.720
But there are probabilities
that are very strong.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.950
And if you want a higher quality
of life and a longer

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:10.740
health span, eat a
plat-strong diet.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.390
Don't eat processed foods.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.490
Don't eat a lot of sugar.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.140
Don't eat a lot of ice cream.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.410
I have to say it.

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:18.330
It's true.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.450
And if you make a choice for
your own integrity, you own

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:26.230
well-being, instead of the
consumer obsessions of our

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:30.810
society, you'll be a healthier
person and a happier person.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.700
You'll have more beauty
inside yourself Your

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.640
life will be richer.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.540
Your relationships will
flourish more.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.190
And you'll be glad that
you're alive.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.290
And I think that's
quite a lot.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:43.230
Thank you.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.420
RACHEL O'MARA: Hi.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.380
One more question.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.360
Don't clap yet.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.910
So can you talk a little
bit more about the Food

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:48.500
Revolution?

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.480
It sounds really interesting.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.110
Is that for folks in the
industry, or is it consumers

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:53.790
who can go?

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:57.330
How would people get involved
with that to learn more and

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:59.980
really be part of that?

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.610
JOHN ROBBINS: The best way to
do it, there's a fantastic

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.670
website if you go to
foodrevolution.org--

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:09.740
food revolution, one word, dot
O-R-G, you will find a great

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:11.730
amount of resources there.

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.180
And the Food Revolution
Network, of which I'm

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.550
co-founder, just put on-- and
we do this annually, an

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:18.860
eight-day summit.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.460
And that just ended, but we'll
do another one soon.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.680
But there are a lot of things
happening in the meantime.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.890
It's a network to support people
at whatever level of

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:31.100
political activism they
want to be at.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:36.860
Some people, their activism is
just to buy more consciously.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.150
That's a good step.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.770
That's real.

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:39.410
That's valid.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:40.850
That matters.

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.910
Other people start getting
involved with writing, or

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:48.670
signing petitions, informing
other people.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:51.400
There's those opportunities
too.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.560
We started the Food Revolution
Network 14 months ago.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.120
We now have 150,000 members.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.900
It's growing rapidly.

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:03.020
And what we have found is that
if something is happening in

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.640
Washington, and it's right that
day, we can send out an

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.670
email that day, telling people
what they need to do and

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:14.390
giving them the wherewithal to
do it, and we can get 150,000

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:18.100
people signing a petition
within 24 hours.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.540
And we can deliver that to--

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.400
and we can do it state by state,
so if we're trying to

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.090
influence a particular
legislator, or on particular

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:27.580
legislation, we can do that.

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.800
We can tailor it.

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.370
It matters.

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:36.370
So it's a way that
you can become

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:39.320
involved with these issues.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.390
And you might be more concerned
about GMOs, or you

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.500
might be more concerned about
pesticides, or you might be

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.640
more concerned about the
treatment of animals in

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.230
factory farms.

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:48.750
Or you might be more concerned
about something I hadn't

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:52.420
mentioned, but it's very big, is
the targeting of kids with

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.160
junk food ads.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:59.880
The soda pop Industry spends a
billion dollars a year on ads

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:04.230
that target children
with soda pop ads.

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:09.610
There is a small effort that
the CDC just this month

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:10.480
started to do.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.470
They have a budget of a million
dollars for it--

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.760
that's not much--

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:19.140
to try to encourage kids--

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.910
high school kids in particular--
to have a

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:24.500
soda-free summer.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:29.420
There is a congressman
from Illinois.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.430
His name is Aaron Schock,
young guy.

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:38.500
He has just proposed a bill that
would make it illegal for

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.710
the CDC or any other agencies
that CDC supports, or the

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:44.940
National Institutes of Health,
or an organization that they

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:54.000
support, to educate or
communicate any message that

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.920
would try to reduce the
consumption of any legally

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.790
marketed food.

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:03.010
ie., he's trying to make it
illegal for the CDC to spend a

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:06.410
million dollars telling kids,
soda pop isn't great for your

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:10.730
health, whereas Pepsi and Coke
spend a billion dollars

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:13.870
telling kids to drink
the stuff.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:18.090
This is a weird world
sometimes.

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:21.065
He says that the messages of
the CDC are propaganda.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.910
The reason that this guy, Aaron
Schock is doing this,

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.800
his district is the home
of Hostess company.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.360
They went bankrupt a
little while ago.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.460
They made the Twinkies,
and the--

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.780
you talk about junk food.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.250
They're kind of our
junk food central.

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:40.960
End they're in trouble,
and they're

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.180
going through a buyout.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.790
They're going to be back in
business soon, and he doesn't

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:48.880
want the government to put out
messages that would increase

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.930
the consumption of Twinkies.

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:56.630
Well, I ask, why are Twinkies
cheaper per

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:58.870
calorie than carrots?

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:01.810
Because of our subsidies.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:04.650
We've got to take this twisted
situation, this perverse

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:08.390
situation, and twist it back
so that we're in alignment

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:12.460
with our the goodness in our
hearts and in each other.

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.560
I think we can do that.

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.620
And that's why I'm
involved in this.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.550
And I invite all of
you to join me.

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:18.840
RACHEL O'MARA: Great.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.490
Thanks so much.

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:20.740
JOHN ROBBINS: Thank you.
