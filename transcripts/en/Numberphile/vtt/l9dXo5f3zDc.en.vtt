00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
Two sets of cards, 1 2 3 4, ace is one, 4 3 2 1, again ace is one,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.700
spades and hearts, black and red. They're in opposite orders. I now turn them over

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:12.940
and

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.859
we're going to shuffle them and you decide which one to shuffle but the shuffling means always to take the top card and

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.589
put it at the bottom. That's shuffling.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.760
Okay, that's one shuffle.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.100
And, each time we shuffle, you tell me which one to shuffle, I'll shuffle that one.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.860
Okay, so let's shuffle a number of times. Well, what can we say? Oh, let's use the phrase numberphile shall we?

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.260
So numberphile: N-U-M-B-E-R-P-H-I-L-E

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.080
So, for each of these letters you say well, shuffle the right one or the left one. And you can say

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.080
You know, N-U-M

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.240
B-E-R-P-H and so forth.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.900
You can choose whatever you like. Okay, so Brady, you tell me which one to shuffle, then.  So left or right?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.240
-So, N
-Yeah

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.980
U

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.180
M

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.380
B

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.600
-E
-Yes, sorry, E

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.040
R

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740
P

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.560
H

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.560
I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080
L

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.060
E

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.799
Okay, so those two cards emerged to the top as a result of your choice, I didn't choose this.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.660
So I'm going to set them aside. Yeah, two of them.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.420
Now, we repeat numberphile again and for each of those letters

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.140
We shuffle either of these and you choose which ones shuffle for each of those data. So which one do you want?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.140
Let's do . . . Let's do all of them that one.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.640
Oh my god.  So, okay N-U-M

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.640
B-E-R

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.660
P-H-I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.320
L-E

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.460
I wasn't expecting this. Okay those two cards emerged to top.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.839
In fact, this one didn't move but this emerged to the top so I put these aside.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.540
Now one last time, numberphile, and you choose which one to shuffle.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.880
OK

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.920
N

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.200
U

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.480
M

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.900
B

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.000
E

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.760
R

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.800
P

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.200
H

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.200
I

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.320
L

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.840
E

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.500
OK, these two emerged to the top,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.740
and these two are left over.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.490
OK.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.860
Now if we were really lucky and luck doesn't come except to the deserving.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.260
Because numberphile is such a magic phrase,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.630
these two

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.700
may be the same number.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.589
You know numberphile means "liking numbers" and these two numbers like each other, of course, 2 and 2, but that might have been luck.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.679
But if we really believe in that magical numberphile, these two might have matched

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.290
Remember, you chose which one to shuffle, yeah?  I didn't.  That's surely not possible.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.689
But what's really impossible would be impossible?

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.330
Is for the next two to match and the surprise par surprise, the last two also match.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.300
So they all match pair-wise.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.500
Lovely!  Numberphile -- I knew it was magic.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.760
We knew it was magic.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.159
So the trick that I have just shown you is a classic trick which was described for the first time as far as I know

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.480
by the late Martin Gardner called The Last Cards Match

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.010
and I made a variation on this and the variation is a little slower than the original trick

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.241
But it's also mathematically more interesting. So I'd like to reveal the secret.

00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:35.039
What we had was two piles of cards

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.820
You have 1, 2, 3, 4 in one order

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.320
and 1, 2, 3, 4

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.779
Or if you like 4 3 2 1 in the reverse order, and these should be thought of as like clocks

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.929
Okay, so a clock has you know, 1, 2, 3, 4 all the way to 12 and then it starts all over again.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.630
So you are doing modular arithmetic here

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.149
Also, if you go one two, three four, and if you want to go five here six here seven here eight here

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.860
And so we can keep going. Okay, you remember that our way of shuffling was very special

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.380
We took the top card and then put it at the bottom

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.249
So you . . . as you keep repeating this you are cyclically or cyclically depending on the side of the Atlantic

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.429
Permuting those cards so you go from here to here to here to here and keep going

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.690
Whereas in the other deck which had the reverse order you go from to here to here to here, okay?

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.309
We had four cars but let's generalize and explain a little bit because this card trick works with any number of cards in general.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.330
Let's say that you have cards one two three and so on

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.360
Arranged in a cyclic fashion all the way to M

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.930
So let's say M minus 2

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.729
M minus 1.  M is number . . . total number of cards and I choose that M for a purpose on the other side you have because

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.069
In the reverse order M, M minus 1, M minus 2 and dotto dotto

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.840
You keep going and then 3 2 1 you come back like that. OK?

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.620
So in our card trick M was four, but in general it works and one shuffle does this:

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.520
you start from one and go to 2 and

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.860
2 goes to 3 and here you go from M to M minus 1 and M minus 1 to M minus 2 and that kind of thing.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.560
Suppose that on the left, that is the red pile you made

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.070
L

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.540
shuffles

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.210
On the right you made R shuffles, L as in left, R as in right.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.720
Well, the total number of shuffles that we made was the number of letters in "numberphile"

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.380
N-U-M-B-E-R-P-H-I-L-E

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.920
11 letters. So we know that L plus R was 11 for us.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.909
So L and R are not independent.  If you chose to shuffle the red deck L times,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.559
automatically you are shuffling, whatever you else you do, the right deck R times, but R equals 11 minus L.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.310
And if you choose to shuffle the right deck, that is the black deck, R times,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.219
you cannot help shuffling the left deck, that is the red deck, 11 minus R times. So you have that relationship.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.820
So let's start shuffling.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.860
Say that you shuffle the red deck L times: 1 goes to 2. So each time you increase by one.  2 goes 3 and

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.960
if you keep going after L shuffles, it takes a little bit of thinking to

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.890
convince ourselves

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.390
You arrived at not L, but L plus 1

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.334
after L shuffles.

00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:33.049
On the right, black deck

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.449
After one shuffle, you go from M to M minus 1,  M minus 1 to M minus 2,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.460
And if you keep going, and that is slightly less confusing,

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.360
at the end, you arrive at, after R shuffles, M minus R.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.520
So, after those shuffles

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.700
the cards that emerge on the top of each deck is L plus 1 and M minus R. 
 Those two cards emerge.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.500
We used eleven

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:05.900
But let's say that L plus R was some number more generally which was chosen to be some number

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.259
Which is congruent minus 1 modulo M where M is the number of cards in each deck

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:19.700
So for us M was 4 and for us 11 was the chosen number and eleven is minus 1 mod 4, by the way.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.480
Where have you pulled . . .yeah, where have you pulled that minus one mod M from?

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.180
We'll see why this minus 1 becomes useful in a moment

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.820
That's . . . that's part of the magic

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.520
OK.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.500
You have to do magic at some point, okay?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.640
So, let's see what L plus 1 is compared with M minus R and we'll see that they are actually the same thing. You see?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.520
Because L we see is equal to . . . look at this,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.369
L plus R equals minus 1, or congruent minus 1, so L equals minus 1 minus R.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:55.100
Let's not forget plus 1, so minus 1 plus 1 cancel, and you are left with only

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.710
Minus R. So this is modulo M

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:06.080
But minus R can be written by modulism again as M minus R. That's the same thing, module M.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.959
Doing it like that. Ok, and so what we see is that

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.989
Module M, L plus 1, the top of the red deck and M minus R

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.020
top of the black deck,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.879
are actually the same.  So after those shuffles, the same cards

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.770
emerge on the top.  You put them aside now you have to start over again.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:36.820
And then the number of cards M changes, but that's where minus 1 becomes useful.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.540
11, that we chose,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.040
that's the number of letters in numberphile, has the beautiful property that it is

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.099
indeed congruent minus 1 mod 4.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:52.360
That's the initial number of cards in each deck.  After I set out the top cards together, you have now . . .

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.120
Do the same thing mod three?

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.250
But 11 is also

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.459
minus 1 mod 3 and

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.690
Next stage, you have you lost one pair of cards

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.839
You have to do mod 2, but amazingly 11 is also

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.839
Minus 1 mod 2 and that is why this number, magic number, key number, 11, worked.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.110
Just as you descended those different moduli, the chain of order, mod 4, mod 3, mod 2

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.589
Okay, and that's how I chose 11.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.969
Or, if you want to do this card trick in other . . . with other parameters

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.839
For example with larger number of cards and 10 and 12 and so forth and so forth

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.640
All you have to do is to solve this, what is called simultaneous system of congruences.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.280
Like a simultaneous system of equations but you are doing modular arithmetic and

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.890
There is a way of doing it's called Chinese remainder theorem

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.690
By the way, the standard way we teach and learn Chinese remainder theorem has modules all co-prime.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.719
They should all be co-prime, but this is a tricky case

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.390
of Chinese remainder theorem because for example 2 and 4  are not co-prime.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.299
But even there there is a version of Chinese remainder theorem that works.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.949
So this kind of congruence . . . system of  congruence is always solvable. So you give me any M,

00:10:03.199 --> 00:10:05.919
so use a lot of cards if you like

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:13.809
but just reverse the orders here and here and you find some key number which is equivalent to 11

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.019
But some X which is minus 1 mod M

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.200
also minus 1 mod M minus 1, minus 1 mod M minus 2,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.140
so all the way down all those moduli. You should always be minus 1.  You should solve

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.100
those simultaneous equations for X and using that

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.279
number of phrases, this trick always works.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.680
So if I had two powers of ten, there'd be some other word I'd be having to use?

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.740
That's right, but it could be a longer phrase and longer word and

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.940
But I'm sure it would be some word, like numberphile, which would be special significance to you.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:53.049
If you'd like to try your hand at some of the mathematical card tricks you've seen on numberphile, but don't own a deck of cards

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:59.769
Well, you could try these numberphile ones. There's a link with more information about them down in the video description

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.059
And if you'd like to see more videos about playing cards, well,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.679
we've got a playlist for that. Links are on the screen and again down in the description.
