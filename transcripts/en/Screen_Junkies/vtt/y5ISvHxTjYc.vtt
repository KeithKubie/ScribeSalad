00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.500
From the studio behind the animated classics
that defined a generation

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.020
and the bloated gritty live action reboot
that defined *this* generation...

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.610
comes another Disney cash grab that will ruin
everything you love about another childhood

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.000
classic.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.119
Maley-fishent.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.210
Male-Ficent.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.300
Malayfickent.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.960
Screw it.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.939
Sleeping Beauty.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.110
Two giant cheekbones star in the modern retelling
of Sleeping

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.850
Beauty,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.050
this time from the villain's perspective

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.070
where the character you loved for being pure
evil and turning into an awesome dragon

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.769
is no longer evil?

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.390
and doesn't even turn a dragon?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.930
Why is he the dragon?

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.110
You had ONE job, Disney.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.059
Instead, watch as the sorceress whose name
literally means " evil"

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.000
mildly punks people,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.220
feels sorry,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.110
"You stole what was left of my heart and now
I've lost you forever."

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.750
and is only mean because she was roofied and
mutilated by her childhood love.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.690
Ugh.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.500
Have fun explaining that to your kids.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.719
Watch everything scary and fun about Maleficent
get neutered by

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.409
the same thing that neutered Darth Vader...

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:22.649
Backstory.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.160
"Nooooo!"

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.990
Where you'll learn the answers to questions
you never had, like...

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.329
What if Maleficent grew up in a low-rent Avatar
rip-off?

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.340
What if the original was full of generic CGI
battle scenes?

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.700
Was Maleficent's pet crow actually a human
slave?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.479
Where did her stick come from?

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.969
And did Maleficent spend most of her time
creepily watching Sleeping Beauty grow up

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.950
from a few feet away?

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.759
Yes. She did, apparently.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.090
"I hate you."

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.880
But it's not just the Angelina Jolie show...

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.789
Instead, spend time with one-dimensional caricatures
like

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.840
The Mean King

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.240
The Handsome Prince

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.649
The Cute Princess

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.909
And the three fairies you love from the original

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.350
who are now three hideous idiots whose stupidity
borders on child abuse.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.360
"Oh look! The little beast is about to fall
off the cliff!"

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.690
Way to f*** up fairies, Disney!

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.910
So experience a more modern take on Sleeping
Beauty

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.610
Where we learn the most important lesson of
all:

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.290
if your movie comes out after Frozen

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.200
"An act of true love."

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.330
"True love's kiss!"

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.540
true love only exists between two girls.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.740
Awww yeah.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.220
Starring...

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520
You Know Nothing, Jon Crow

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.600
Huey, Dewey, and Louie

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.350
Groots

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.710
Harry Styles

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.030
Areola

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.440
Prawn King

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.860
and How Jennifer Aniston Sees Angelina Jolie

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.660
Sleeping Beauty: The Bad One.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.670
We're gonna be honest:

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.720
this wasn't our best trailer, but this wasn't
Disney's best movie either.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.440
Next week's will be WAY better. Trust us.
