00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.260
Okay, so the sandbox is where we
are allowed to save information.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.510
Let's look at those three
subfolders we mentioned earlier.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.850
Documents, this is where you
save important information.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.635
iTunes will make backups of this folder,
and

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:16.335
the OS will never delete its contents.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.955
Caches, this is for temporary info.

00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:22.607
iTunes and iCloud will never
make a backup of its content.

00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:26.505
Library is generally for any files
you don't want exposed to the user.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.785
We don't need to worry
about this folder for now,

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:32.354
but in case you were curious,
that's what it is there for.

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:36.400
The rule of thumb is,
important stuff goes into Documents.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.795
Things that won't be
necessary in the future or

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:41.900
are easy to recreate
should go into Caches.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.230
In order to save something in
the sandbox, we need to do two things.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.200
First, find where the folder
is within the sandbox and

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.880
then write to a file within that folder.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.530
To achieve this, we will use the
following classes, NSFileManager to get

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.480
the path to the folder within
the sandbox, and then String to write or

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.810
read text files, or NSData to write or
read by binary files.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.770
Enough talk, let's move to Xcode and
write some code.
