00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And there are many ways to do it. Here's how I chose to do it.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I go through the ranks, and then for each r in the ranks,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I check to see if the ranks has a count of exactly n of those,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so count is one of the methods that exists on lists.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We can ask a list to count how many times it has an element.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If that's equal to n, then return that element.

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And if not, then just return none.
