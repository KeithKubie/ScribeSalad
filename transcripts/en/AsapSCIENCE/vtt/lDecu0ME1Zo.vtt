00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
Got stress? With 75% of adults reporting moderate to high levels of stress in the past month, there has to be a solution

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.229
So what are the best scientific methods to deal with stress and anxiety?

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.900
How can you genuinely relax your mind and body they say laughter is the best medicine. Turns out,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.420
It's also the stress medicine when we laugh our oxygen intake increases stimulating the release of endorphins.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.239
Studies even show that simply waiting to see a funny movie can increase beta endorphin levels by

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.169
27% and Decrease stress hormone levels in the bloodstream. After a hilarious film, participants had lower levels of the stress hormone

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.549
Chromogranin a in their saliva and while you're at the movies why not make out with someone it decreases cortisol and increases

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.870
Oxytocin from the pituitary gland in the brain creating feelings of attachment bonding

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.259
Contentment and security study participants who kissed their partners regularly over six weeks has lower blood cholesterol

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.350
Level of course some chewing gum might help your breasts

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.949
But a japanese study also found that those who chewed twice a day for two [weeks]

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.920
[increased] their feelings of well-being other study participants who chews gum while being subjected to a stress inducing

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.390
task also shows lower levels of cortisol and their saliva than those who didn't have gum and

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.549
not because of the ingredients in the gum

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.399
But simply from the Act of chewing known as mastication

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.739
this repetitive motion is directly related to increased activity in the cerebral area of the brain and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.839
Relaxation time spent in Nature or even a simple house plant can lower stress levels [-] in

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.489
1982 the Japanese government started a Shinrin Yoku or [forced] [baiting] campaign

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.890
Promoting the benefits of spending time [in] the forest for this purpose in just one short visit to the forest

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.059
Cortisol levels heart rate and blood pressure have all been shown to Decrease even

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.479
hospital patients who have a view of nature tend to have better pain tolerance and faster recovery rates compared to those who faced only a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.368
Blank wall speaking of leaves even though relaxation from tea may simply be a Placebo

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.489
It turns out that the anticipation of a ritual linked with relaxing emotions may very well be a self-fulfilling prophecy

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.009
[in] other words if you're mentally preparing yourself to relax with your favorite calming tea or

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.690
relaxing scented oils our brain is primed to slow down and can actually influence well-being the amygdala in the brain is responsible for

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.800
emotional control

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800
and is directly connected to our olfactory

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.190
system. Inhaling a candle scent reminiscent of a happy childhood time like warm apple pie may very well help us relive those memories

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.499
creating a better mood. Music can have a similar effect. Songs with 60 to 80 beats per minute

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.050
but no lyrics have been shown to reduce stress even in patients who have undergone various types of surgeries [and]

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.348
If you can get or being near a pet do it having a dog correlates to lower scores on anxiety tests.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.499
12% compared to 21% for those without one and

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.699
being in the presence of a friendly dog has been shown to lower cortisol levels and increase

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.980
Oxytocin. Finally, some people relax and focused by fidgeting which is why we made another video on

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.459
fidget spinners the new toy craze and whether or not they actually

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.519
work. Head over to that video by [clicking] the screen or using the link in the description and subscribe for more weekly science videos
