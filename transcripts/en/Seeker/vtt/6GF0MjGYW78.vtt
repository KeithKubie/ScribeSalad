00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.900
We know climate change is a real thing, but
it turns out our climate isn’t the only

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.900
thing changing.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.920
The gravity of our planet is changing too.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.280
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.310
Gravity is pretty neat; it’s the force that
stops us from floating off the planet.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.890
But it’s not a constant, uniform force.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.359
The strength of gravity actually varies very
slightly at different points on the globe

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.900
because of things like the planet’s rotation,
the existence of mountains, and deep ocean

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.900
trenches.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.550
And it turns out that the Earth’s gravitational
environment isn’t constant in its variety,

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.550
either.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.730
According to data from the European Space
Agency’s Gravity field and steady-state

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.150
Ocean Circulation Explorer satellite, the
loss of polar ice to climate change is affecting

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.650
the gravitational environment.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.040
The melting ice in question is the Antarctic
ice sheet.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.430
The largest mass of ice on Earth, it covers
more than 8.5 million square miles and contains

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.470
around 90 percent of the Earth’s fresh water.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.760
Scientists looking at the ice sheet often
divide it into catchment basins to better

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.079
understand how the ice in each basin changes
and discharges into the ocean, and it turns

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.480
out to be quite a bit.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.309
Ice loss to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has
increased by a factor of three on a yearly

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.119
basis since 2009.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.829
The combined loss of ice between 2009 and
2012 caused a noticeable dip in the gravity

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.310
field over this region.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.350
Between 2011 and 2014, Antarctica has shrunk
by more than four million cubic feet.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.969
And the loss of ice means the area is becoming
less dense, and that means that the pull of

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.939
gravity is slightly less strong in the region
than it once was.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.492
But it’s not like you’re going to float
off the planet if you get too close to the

00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:29.270
Antarctic Peninsula, though you might weigh
slightly less.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.540
Still, it’s pretty significant that climate
is actually affecting the gravity level of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.540
the planet.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.540
What do you think.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.680
Is losing a little weight in a specific part
of the globe worth the damage to the climate?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.939
