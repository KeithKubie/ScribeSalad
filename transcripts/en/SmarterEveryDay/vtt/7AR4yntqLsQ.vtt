00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.060
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.080
Smarter Every Day. So you're probably well aware of the awesome science that comes

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
out of space telescopes, but what you might not be aware of is the awesome science that goes

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160
into making these things work. For instance check out this NASA photo. These guys are working on

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.200
the sun shield for the James Webb Space Telescope, and what I think is so cool about this photo

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.220
is that this guy in the bottom right corner is my Dad. You see the instrument

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.240
operates at about 45 degrees Kelvin but you have all this heat from the sun coming from the

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.280
other side. So what Dad's doing is he's using this 3D laser scanner to make sure

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.310
that the sun shield is perfect to provide a stable operating environment for the

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.340
telescope. Thumbs up for you dad, I'm proud of you. So I thought I understood

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.440
how space telescopes point at what they want to observe, but it turns out it's a little more complicated

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.510
than I thought. I'll explain two ways that you can apply an external force

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.560
on the satellite and get it to turn. First up, rockets.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.600
[ Rocket sound] OK. Now that our space telescope is on orbit

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.620
how can we point it at a star. [ pshh pshh ]

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.650
Rockets are cool, but they use fuel, which clouds up the area around the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.680
satellite, and you can run out of fuel, ending your mission. So how do we

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.800
do this without having rockets. Hang with me on this one. Think about

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.850
this little compass needle. It's interacting with the Earth's magnetic field, but what

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.980
if we scale it up and create a big needle like a rod or torque rod, and we

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.020
put a coil of wire over the top of it. And then we take this wire

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.060
and we hook it up to this power supply I have on my desk and then turn on the voltage.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.090
See that? An electromagnetic field. So is it true

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.140
that this electromagnetic field in my hand is interacting with the Earth's magnetic field

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.150
just like this compass needle that we were able to get to rotate.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.180
Yes, that's exactly what's happening. So here's the deal. This is called a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.210
torque rod. Scientists do this all the time on spacecraft. They take three torque

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.260
rods and they put them in three different axes and they're able to apply or remove 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.280
voltage as they need to rotate depending on where they are in the Earth's magnetic field.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.330
Now this is a very elegant solution because there's no moving parts, but the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.380
problem is it only works in places where you have an external magnetic field,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.440
like Earth. This wouldn't work in deep space or even on Mars where

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.480
you have a really low magnetic field. So in order to rotate a space telescope

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.530
somewhere like that, we're gonna have to use flipping cat physics. So if you go back to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.540
the last episode of Smarter Every Day I used a high speed camera to explain that a cat is

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.590
able to flip 180 degrees from rest by rotating against himself.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.610
Go watch that last video if you need a refresher. But what I didn't explain

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.640
is that this ability to change the overall state of the system without

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.690
violating the conservation of angular momentum is a very special problem

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.730
that's been studied by applied mathemeticians, neuroscientists, robot builders,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.770
and even astrophysicists. Just do a quick academic search for flipping cats

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.790
and you'll find out what I mean by seeing thousands of pages of equations.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.800
OK so to explain why cats are so special let's get a block of wood with a hole in it and a ping pong

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.870
ball with a mark on it. Then we'll mark the block so we can tell how the two line up.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.920
If we move the block the ball rolls, and when we return it,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.940
the system goes back to the initial state, and this is always the case right?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.000
Nope. If we move the block out but return it along a

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.030
different path, the system doesn't return to the initial state.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.080
Aah. This means that the path determines the state of the system right?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.100
So just like the ball never slips, angular momentum in both cats

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.130
and space telescopes never changes. But we are

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.190
able to change their final rotation. You see special systems like this are called

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.230
Nonholonomic systems. Look, I know that's a big word, and you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.260
might just be watching this video because it's a cat video, but I need you to hear this.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.290
The physics of flipping cats is what makes us be able to take photos

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.370
like this. No, seriously. Flipping cats!

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.410
One way to keep a space telescope pointed at a particular star is to use a device called

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.440
a reaction wheel. Multiple reaction wheels are spinning inside the space craft.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.470
If a rotation is needed in a particular axis, engineers calculate

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.520
which wheel should be sped up or slowed down at exactly what times.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.550
So I am in a NASA building and we are going to a special lab.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.590
We're here at the attitude control components lab.. [ knock knock ]

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.630
And these guys know about how to control space satellites

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.670
using cat math. Here's our guide here.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.730
(Dean) Come on in.
(Destin) OK Dean so thank you for alowing me to come over after I showed you my cat video.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.780
- That was pretty cool. 
(Destin) I appreciate that. So I have a question.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.790
So a cat is just free-floating in space essentially and then he rotates.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.850
- Correct.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.880
- Correct.
- How does he control his rotation without any

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.920
external forces on him?
- Well he basically uses his legs

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.950
and his body to rotate and have momentum transfers.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.000
- Oh and that's kind of what you guys do right? You're brokers of momentum.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.030
- Yes, we do momentum management. That's what happens on the space station

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.080
or any system that's flying in space. We have to manage

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.110
the amount of momentum that's actually in the system so that you can point and

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.130
focus at a nebula or a star that you want to look at

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.160
for a telescope.
- And so what is this device that you have next to you?
- Well this device

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.200
is a Control Moment Gyro. Now the difference between a

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.230
reaction wheel and a CMG is in the

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.320
CMG I can actually rotate it's axis. And you can see this actually

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.330
has two axes of rotation. And by doing that

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.350
- You made a lot harder math for yourself didn't you.
- Yes we did.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.370
But there are a lot smarter people than I am that go off and make sure that

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.400
they know how to point the satellite or the telescope

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.490
and they go from one point to another point along a specific trajectory.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.500
But if I keep rotating this up you'll see that there's a point where it will stop

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.520
and if for some reason I were able to get to this point

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.530
then I can't go any farther, so I have to have some

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.590
other system to allow me to get out of that

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.620
blocked position.
- Oh so that's where your external energy inputs start to come in..
- That's right

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.640
that's where your mag torquers or your

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.690
propulsion jets or thrusters come into play.
- And the torquers would be the Earth's magnetic field.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.690
- Yes you react against Earth's magnetic field.
- OK so 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.740
here you guys test the components to make sure that these things will work on orbit.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.790
- Yes we do, and in this vault over here you'll see we have a life test running

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.820
- Is that what I'm hearing here?
- That's what you hear.
- So what am I looking at?

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.880
- This is the Chandra X-Ray Telescope life test for the

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.900
reaction wheel, and what we're doing is we're testing the system

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.910
to see how long it will last, so that if there is a failure on

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.920
say the wheels, then we can go in there and say

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.960
we can take the wheel apart.
- I notice you have a really old computer running this thing.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.960
- Yes well Chandra was built in the early nineties and

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.010
so the hardware that is used to test Chandra is

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.040
the same hardware that is flying on Chandra, so you gotta remember

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.080
that Chandra is now about 13 years old I think?
- Oh wow.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.110
So it's like you're locked in time.
- Yes.
- When you launch the thing you're

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.140
locked at a certain time and you have to continue to use that same hardware.
- That's the same thing you had the

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.150
problem with the space station or the shuttle. They were locked into time

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.200
with the components that were built way back in the seventies.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.220
- Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
- You're welcome.
- So thank you very much for watching. I hope

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.250
you learned something about cats that you didn't know, and please consider subscribing,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.300
and sending this to your friends. Gigi, get it!

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.340
Get it.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.360
You hear a bird? Hear a bird?

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.480
We had a ball.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.510
The only reason you can do

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.560
this is because it's a Nonholonomic system and you know flipping cat math. OK

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.580
I'd like to thank Jimmy Neutron for the use of his farm,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.610
and his cat.
