00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.360
You voted for the 2017 movies you wanted us to do an Honest Trailer for, and here's your number five choice.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.220
Shrek made you laugh,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.360
How to Train Your Dragon made you feel,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.260
Now, DreamWorks' newest franchise will make you question the very fabric of reality

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.520
"I'll be there!"

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.800
Boss Baby

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.840
No seriously, it's a weird one.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.700
Meet Boss Baby,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.140
his actual given name

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.980
who also happens to be a boss, a baby, and a bossy baby version of Alec Baldwin's bossiest roles.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.840
"Cookies are for closers"

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.440
"Coffee's for closers only"

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.700
"You called?"

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.980
"Do you need Senor Squeaky?"

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.020
"You called for ice cream, sir? Here's two scoops."

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380
But if you think that's all there is to this kids flick,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.720
hold onto your powdered butts for a sharp left turn into madness.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.240
Where the companies who manufacture babies and puppies

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.560
compete for the limited amount of love in the world.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.700
"This is war, puppies are winning and babies are losing."

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.560
Baby Corp employees have adult level intelligence, but drink laced milk to keep their bodies tiny

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.020
"Without that formula, I turn into a normal baby!"

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.380
Pacifiers that let you astral project your soul through physical space

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.440
"I want you to suck it"

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.040
and a memory wiping baby task force can make you forget your own children

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.240
"Forget about the baby"

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.520
"Forget about the baby."

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.040
So if you think Logan was the darkest action movie that came out in 2017,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.120
or that Ragnarok was the craziest,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.740
you haven't really listened to anything I just said.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.460
Has your child ever asked where babies come from?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.920
Get ready to dodge that question with 90 minutes of lies that will take years of therapy to undo.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.920
"I wasn't born, I was hired."

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.120
Where babies start life on a dangerous assembly line,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.500
get assigned their sex via pinball machine,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.140
and even though it looks like women still get pregnant, the baby shows up in a... taxi?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.660
But then what happened to the... Oh no...

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.340
This can't be easier to explain than saying mommy and daddy want to bone sometimes.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.380
"No wonder kids are so messed up"

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.380
There's more than just babies along for the ride,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.120
like Tim, the boy who shows you how obnoxious owning children can be.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.220
"How would you like to have a baby brother?"

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.120
"No thanks, I'm enough."

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.720
Whose imagination borders on clinical insanity

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.280
"Perhaps your parents need to be... enlightened."

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.100
"With a great curse!"

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.960
And the villain Francis Francis, formerly known as

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.700
*clears throat*

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.580
Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.780
Who's made a puppy so cute, it will literally steal a mother's love from her kids

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.500
"Mommy?"

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.860
Man, this movie is weird!

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.940
And we haven't even touched on the part where the seven-year-old gets hammered in Vegas!

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.940
Prepare for a film that will fill up the diaper that was once your brain,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.920
as you question whether anything on screen is real or not.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.060
Because Tim falls asleep at the beginning, so it's all fake, but then the mom is actually pregnant so it's real

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.600
But it's all from Tim's point of view so it's fake.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.920
But the parents acknowledge the baby is wearing a suit, so it must be real.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.160
"He's like a little man."

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.740
But the action is shown to be exaggerated, so it's fake.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.500
But Tim records the baby actually talking, so that's real!

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.800
But the parents never hear the tape, so it's fake!

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.020
But the parents do hear the baby talk, so it's real!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.160
"Yes, the baby's fine."

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.000
"Who was that?"

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.800
But at the end, grown up Tim says "It's just how he remembers it", so it's fake!!

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.160
But his daughter is also a boss baby, so it's real.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.980
AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.060
Stop it, movie!

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.500
I can't take it anymore!

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.000
You've broken me!

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.540
So if you're looking to put thoughts in kids heads that they never would have come up with on their own

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.780
"You can't be fired from your own family!"

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.880
"..can you?"

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.240
Enjoy this acid trip that leaves you with more questions than answers

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.800
But if you ever get overwhelmed, sit back and enjoy the office talk:

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.360
"You're not going to write a memo, are you?"

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.160
"A memo can change the world!"

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.880
"But now I know that memos are very important things."

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.760
The one Beatles song they paid for.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.840
("Blackbird" plays as sung by characters)

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.980
And violence.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.420
"No!"

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.900
Lots and lots of violence.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.720
"Ow."

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.120
Hey stop it! This is literally child abuse!

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.640
"This, Templeton, is first-class."

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.040
"Why is it empty?"

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.520
"No one can afford it."

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.820
That... that is more socio-economic commentary than I expect from my talking baby films.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:05:00.300
