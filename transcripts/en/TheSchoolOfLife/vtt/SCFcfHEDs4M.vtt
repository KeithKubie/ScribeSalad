00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.510
Sometimes you can catch important things about
human nature in apparent incidentals. It’s

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.941
well observed that between the ages of around
one and twelve, many children manifest a deep

00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:19.520
attachment to a stuffed soft object, normally
shaped into a bear, a rabbit or – less often

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.360
– a penguin. The depth of the relationship
can be extraordinary. The child sleeps with

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.020
it, talks to it, cries in front of it and
tells it things it would never tell anyone

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.809
else. What’s truly remarkable is that the
animal looks after its owner, addressing him

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.129
in a tone of unusual maturity and kindness.
It might, in a crisis, urge the child not

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.600
to worry and to look forward to better times
in the future. But naturally, the animal’s

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.300
character is entirely made up. The animal
is simply something invented, or brought to

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.829
life by one part of the child, in order to
look after the other. The English psychoanalyst

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.909
Donald Winnicott was the first person to write
seriously and with sensitivity about the business

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.020
of teddy bears. In a paper from the early
1960s, Winnicott described a boy of six – whose

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.770
parents had been deeply abusive to him – becoming
very connected to a small animal his grandmother

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.600
had given him. Every night, he would have
a dialogue with the animal, would hug him

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.049
close to his chest and shed a few tears into
his stained and greying soft fur. It was his

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.409
most precious possession, for which he would
have given up everything else. As the boy

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.329
summarised the situation to Winnicott: ‘No
one else can understand me like bunny can.’

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.909
What fascinated Winnicott here was that it
was of course the boy who had invented the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.260
rabbit, given him his identity, his voice
and his way of addressing him. The boy was

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.490
speaking to himself – via the bunny – in
a voice filled with an otherwise all too-rarely

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.509
present compassion and sympathy. Though it
sounds a little odd, speaking to ourselves

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.280
is common practice throughout our lives. Often,
when we do so, the tone is harsh and punitive.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.430
We upbraid ourselves for being losers, time-wasters
or perverts. But, as Winnicott knew, mental

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.190
well-being depends on having to hand a repertoire
of more gentle, forgiving and hopeful inner

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.360
voices. To keep going, there are moments when
one side of the mind needs to say to the other

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.989
that the criticism is enough: that it understands,
that this could happen to anyone, that one

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.750
could not have known… It is this kind of
indispensable benevolent voice that the child

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.640
first starts to rehearse and exercise with
the help of a stuffed animal. In adolescence,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.659
animals tend to get put away. They become
embarrassing, evoking a vulnerability we’re

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.269
keen to escape from. But, to follow Winnicott,
if our development has gone well, what was

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.250
trialled in the presence of a stuffed animal
should continue all of our lives – because,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.430
by definition, we will frequently be let down
by the people around us, who won’t be able

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.000
to understand us, listen to our griefs and
be kind to us in the manner we crave and require.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.690
Every healthy adult should therefore possess
a capacity for self-nurture: that is, for

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.500
retreating to a safe secluded space and speaking
in a tone that’s gentle, encouraging and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.260
infinitely forgiving. That we don’t formally
label the understanding self ‘white rabbit’

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.239
or ‘yellow bear’ shouldn’t obscure the
debt that the nurturing adult self owes to

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.610
its earlier embodiment in a furry toy. A good
adult life requires us to see the links between

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.290
our strengths and our regressive states. Being
properly mature demands a gracious accommodation

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.860
with what can seem childlike, embarrassing
or humiliatingly vulnerable. We should honour

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.110
stuffed animals for what they really are:
tools to help us on our first steps in the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.650
vital business of knowing how to look after
ourselves.
