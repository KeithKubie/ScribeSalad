00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:31.820
[SINGING] Now we have
gathered here at Google

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.860
to tell the story of
a very famous show.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.722
It's the longest running
musical revue on the planet.

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:46.026
And it started up the
road in San Francisco.

00:00:46.026 --> 00:00:49.740
The story line is
simple, I'm going

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.830
to help you all understand.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.400
It's about Snow White
trying to find her prince.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.854
My job is to help
her with her plan.

00:00:59.854 --> 00:01:03.870
It's got big hair,
big hats and costumes.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.574
That's kind of how
the show began.

00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:13.125
And it was created by the
genius, Steve Silver, one

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.900
incredibly talented man.

00:01:23.804 --> 00:01:26.220
STEVE SILVER: One night, a
bunch of us were out at dinner.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.170
And we came outside
the restaurant,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.690
and there was a guitar player.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.177
People were throwing coins
at him, and I said, hey.

00:01:32.177 --> 00:01:32.760
Wait a minute.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.220
Let's go back to my
house, put some costumes

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.410
on that I had from Rent-a-Freak,
and come back and do an act.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.460
See if we can make some money.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.580
So we went to my house, got
the costumes on, and came back.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.264
Wrote the show from my
house to the restaurant.

00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:48.680
We started singing
"Close To You,"

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.510
by the Carpenters and
some really crazy stuff.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.220
And people started
throwing us money.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.800
We made $25.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.100
That was when I really
started understanding

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.440
what people wanted, what kind
of entertainment people wanted.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.220
And later that year, I decided,
I'm going to do a show.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.180
Maybe a crazy show.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.180
Yeah, for sure, a crazy show.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.130
And opened "Beach Blanket"
right up here on Grant Avenue,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.280
at the Savoy Tivoli in '74.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.430
And then, let me see.

[CHEERING]

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.160
Oh, in the beginning
days, I did all the hats.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.315
I would design them.

00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:49.296
And then I would make them.

00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:51.610
And I don't know how to sew.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.250
I just kind of glued
it all together

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.225
and stuck things in Styrofoam
and prayed, crossed my fingers.

through my drawing pad.

dreams years ago

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.810
was to produce a show
with Annette Funicello.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.959
It was impossible to
get Annette Funicello.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.200

never get her.

when people say, you

can never get anything,
you can never do it,

00:04:27.194 --> 00:04:28.235
that's when I try harder.

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:31.030
And I knew I'd get
Annette in my show.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.970

Funicello was a star.

numbers, or ideas, or stuff

that you have that are limited
by the size of the hats?

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.496

great idea to incorporate,

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.360
but we just don't have the time.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.930
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY: Well, we
were putting in a tap number.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.530
And they were going to put
it in the "Brazil" number.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.140
And if you've seen it, "Brazil"
has a ton of huge hats.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.680
So sometimes when we
try to put something in,

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.680
the hats are so large that
maybe a dance number is not

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.170
the best thing to have.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.890
So I think in that way,
they have to really consider

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.819
what's going on, what's on
your head, and can we do that.

00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:54.110

you for the specially created

So creating that, creating
the hats just in general,

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.481
is there kind of like a template
that the creators and designers

00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:07.980
use?

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.840

free, start from scratch

JACQUI ARSLAN: Well,
it starts from scratch,

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.960
but we all wear things
that are called buckrams.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.140
They're designed to
fit our head exactly.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.324
Like a lot of us wear our
hair in buns or pinned up.

00:22:23.324 --> 00:22:24.490
And then you wear a wig cap.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:28.880
And then they've made this kind
of paper mache buckram over it

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.240
that fits your head directly.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.060

and build the most amazing

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.731
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: I remember
the first I put on a wig,

00:22:46.731 --> 00:22:49.800
it was like-- you're
like trying to follow it.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.050
But after a while, your neck
muscles get really strong

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:52.960
and there's no problem.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.660
JACQUI ARSLAN: You
don't even realize

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.285
you have anything on
your head anymore.

00:22:55.285 --> 00:22:57.550
You're like clearly turning
the way you're supposed to

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.091
or something.

00:22:58.091 --> 00:23:00.799
But when you first
get it, you're like--

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:02.590
KEVIN BALK: Now is
there ever a backup plan

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.102
for when a hat goes
wrong or a bum?

00:23:06.102 --> 00:23:08.060
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
Well, it's live theater,

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.690
so anything can happen.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.420
And some of our
best moments come

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.741
from rolling with stuff
that happens onstage.

00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:15.240
You know?

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.360
It's live theater.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.120
And when a show goes
this long, you're

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.470
bound to have exciting moments.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.625
And we all just, we love that.

00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:23.574
JACQUI ARSLAN: We
totally live for it.

00:23:23.574 --> 00:23:24.740
MISA MALONE: Keeps it fresh.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.599
Keeps it new.

00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:27.890
KEVIN BALK: Now, are there
any-- every once in a while,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.473
there's always a pop
culture reference

00:23:29.473 --> 00:23:31.260
that happens in the
news and everything.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.371
So when do you determine kind of
how long that stays in the show

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:35.370
and if it's appropriate?

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.780
And does anything ever
get pulled from the show?

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.104
KIRK MILLS: As long as people
laugh, they keep it in.

00:23:39.104 --> 00:23:41.520
If the people are still laughing
four or five years later,

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.112
it stays in.

00:23:43.112 --> 00:23:44.570
STEPHANIE HARWOOD:
It really-- it's

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.810
the audience that
determines what we put in.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.110
Even we've tried things before,
and it kind of didn't go over.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.910
So we put something
else in its place

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.400
to keep it fresh
for the audience.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.600
That's why they come--
to see all the new stuff.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.150
Oh, I saw this on
the news yesterday.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.710
I wonder if it's going
to be in "Beach Blanket."

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.855
And it probably is.

00:24:01.855 --> 00:24:03.870
KIRK MILLS: Because there have
been whole numbers that we've

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.328
worked up, and choreographed,
and costumed, and everything.

00:24:06.328 --> 00:24:08.940
We tried it for one show, it
didn't go over, didn't go in.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:09.899
KEVIN BALK: Oh, really?

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:11.606
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
I'll never forget,

00:24:11.606 --> 00:24:14.140
too, the costume designers
when Kate Middleton and Prince

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.270
William got married,
they literally

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.690
made that wedding
dress in a day.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.057
Like overnight, as soon as
she walked down the aisle,

00:24:21.057 --> 00:24:22.390
they had to start working on it.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.790
And that night, she was in
a full-on gown in the show.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.920
KIRK MILLS: Replica
of the dress, yeah.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.750
KEVIN BALK: And do
each of you have

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.166
kind of your favorite reference
that you've been a part of

00:24:31.166 --> 00:24:32.262
or seen in the show?

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.220
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: There
are so many good ones.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.720
I think ones that are not in
the show now that I really miss

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.850
is a "Yokohama" number.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.740
And it's set to the
tune of "Oklahoma."

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.630
You know, [SINGING]
"Yokohama, where

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.890
the wind come sweeping
down the plains."

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.250
So I really miss that one.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.666
I mean, there's
so many good ones.

00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:50.690
But that's my favorite, I think.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.546
KIRK MILLS: My
favorite-- I'm lucky.

00:24:52.546 --> 00:24:54.420
I understudy four
different guys in the show.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.503
So I get to do everything.

00:24:55.503 --> 00:24:57.940
And my favorite bit that I
do now is Michele Bachmann.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.790
There's not a lot
of drag in the show.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.904
But it's done for
comedic effect sometimes.

00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:07.820
Like, the Queen of England
is played by a guy,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.570
and Michele Bachmann's
done by a guy.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.570
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
I've been really enjoying

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.750
our "Putin on the Ritz"
number with Vladimir Putin.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.327
I laugh.

00:25:17.327 --> 00:25:19.660
I'm in the corner, and I'm
kind of glad I'm in the dark,

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.380
because I'm just
laughing the whole time.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.890
It's just such a good time.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.765
KIRK MILLS: I haven't
gotten to do Putin yet.

00:25:25.765 --> 00:25:26.665
I'm waiting.

00:25:26.665 --> 00:25:28.790
JACQUI ARSLAN: Well, I play
the Pineapple Princess.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.069
And it's one of the
original characters that

00:25:31.069 --> 00:25:32.610
have been in the
show for many years.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:33.850
So I love that one.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.260
But I always laugh to
myself, because I literally

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.090
get paid to shake my butt.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.570
And I've been playing Kim
Kardashian for about five years

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.069
now.

00:25:41.069 --> 00:25:42.690
And she won't go away.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.580
So this was the newest costume.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.560
And we've tried it.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.960
And of course, I'm just
baring it all out there.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.601
You know.

00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:51.100
It's fun.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.430
It gets a good laugh.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.430
MISA MALONE: I think my
favorite is Tina Turner.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.971
I wear a wig.

00:25:54.971 --> 00:25:57.430
It's about this tall, kind
of looks like Cousin Itt.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.820
And I get to shake, and twitch,
and kind of act a little zany.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.339
So I think that's my favorite.

00:26:03.339 --> 00:26:05.380
CAITLIN MCGINTY: My favorite
is Barbra Streisand.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.740
She is there all the time.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.540
She's not going away.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.430
Nor why would she?

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.490
I mean, she's amazing.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.659
So that's kind of fun.

00:26:11.659 --> 00:26:12.950
I have really long fingernails.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.924
And I'm cross-eyed
the whole time.

00:26:14.924 --> 00:26:16.340
I didn't know how
to be cross-eyed

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.923
when I first started,
for some reason.

00:26:17.923 --> 00:26:20.040
So I remember my
roommate and I studying,

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.180
trying to make myself
look cross-eyed.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.319
And then we were actually
just talking backstage.

00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:25.860
This silly, silly
number, but I don't

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.943
know if you guys remember.

00:26:26.943 --> 00:26:30.190
Years ago, Marie Osmond on
"Dancing with the Stars,"

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.970
when she fainted.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.595
Like randomly, she's
being interviewed,

00:26:32.595 --> 00:26:33.970
and she just falls down.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.870
And that was just-- it's
just those silly things that

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:39.280
are just a moment in TV history.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.120
Yet it's such a funny bit.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.650
And we're dancing,
and I just faint.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.879
And then they sing,
[SINGING] "Poor Marie Osmond,

00:26:44.879 --> 00:26:45.670
lies on the floor."

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.170
You know?

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.110
I mean it's too good.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.610
KEVIN BALK: Now, do you guys
get to come up with ideas, too,

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.050
when you see something
that interests you

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.970
and kind of have some
influence over your characters?

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:55.136
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: Oh, yeah.

00:26:55.136 --> 00:26:58.470
I think Shawna comes up with
a lot of really good ideas.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.470
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY: We all
were like-- Jo is awesome.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.220
She emailed us.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.750
Before New Year's, we do a
big, new New Year's thing.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.980
And I think all the girls
were like, we-- booties, man.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.550
STEPHANIE HARWOOD:
Year of the booty.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.175
KIRK MILLS: One of
the guys in the show

00:27:11.175 --> 00:27:13.466
has been campaigning for
"Putin on the Ritz" for years.

00:27:13.466 --> 00:27:16.239
And so we're glad
it's finally in.

00:27:16.239 --> 00:27:17.280
KEVIN BALK: That's great.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.950
And what are some
of your backgrounds

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.187
in terms of theater,
or improv, or--

00:27:22.187 --> 00:27:24.020
CAITLIN MCGINTY: Well,
Shawna and I actually

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.061
went to college together.

00:27:25.061 --> 00:27:27.470
We both went to UC Irvine,
Southern California.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.949
So she started working here.

00:27:28.949 --> 00:27:30.240
We were musical theater majors.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.890
And she started working
at "Beach Blanket--"

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.389
you're a couple
years older than me.

00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:35.560
So she worked a couple
years before I did.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.810
And then she's the one
who kind of got me--

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.310
I had grown up in the area.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:43.490
So I grew up-- my 21st birthday
party was at "Beach Blanket,"

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.190
actually.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.391
So that was kind of fun.

00:27:46.391 --> 00:27:46.890
But, yeah.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.230
So it was really fun to
kind of come full circle.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.290
And we had another UCI
guy working there, too.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:52.981
So it was really fun.

00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:55.480
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: I think it's
a lot of theater background.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.900
But we all dabbled, I
think, in other things.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.400
I know I spent six
years in New York.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.630
I know Caitlin did as well.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.530
So you kind of go.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.079
And here, what's nice about
it is that it's-- I mean,

00:28:07.079 --> 00:28:08.620
the show's been
running for 40 years,

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.100
seemingly will run
for another 40.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.740
So as far as I can see, as long
as I can stand up and sing,

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.200
I have a job.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.090
And I get to go
home to my family

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.310
and have my kiddo go
to a great school.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.750
So to me, it's like
I can't believe

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.320
I'm the 0.0001%
of people who gets

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.600
paid to do this for a living.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.940
And as wacky as it
is, it's so fun.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.840
KEVIN BALK: It's incredible
and fun to watch.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.650
I think that's the thing, too.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.320
It's why the audiences
keep coming back.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.690
Now in the 40
years, how have you

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.940
seen the show just evolve in
general, other than the pop

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.110
culture updating and stuff?

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.680
Have you seen the show evolve?

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.680
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: Whoo.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.180
Yeah.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.870
I mean, for sure,
it has taken sort

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.740
of a natural-- because the times
change and interests change,

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.980
you know, I mean,
we still have a lot

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.190
of old-fashioned references.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.570
But we're really topical.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.986
I mean, I know that's as cheesy
as it sounds in that song.

00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.410
But we keep everything
really fresh all the time.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.794
So the show has to
naturally change.

00:29:02.794 --> 00:29:05.210
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY: And
with the internet-- and I mean,

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.014
nowadays it seems that the show
has gotten so fast because we

00:29:09.014 --> 00:29:10.430
have everything
at our fingertips,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.610
on YouTube and Google.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.050
I mean, it has to move.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.619
I think the difference, too--
like I started 10 years ago.

00:29:16.619 --> 00:29:18.660
There was a lot more time
to change your clothes.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.630
And nowadays, it's
like people have ADD.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.440
Like you got to move
onto the next thing.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.400
So this show has
gotten really fast.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.150
MISA MALONE: But I
think one of the things

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.890
that I really appreciate is that
Jo and Kenny have a tendency

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.920
to keep the iconic Steve
Silver "Beach Blanket Babylon"

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.850
icons in the show.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.064
So Planter Peanut,
Pineapple Princess--

00:29:38.064 --> 00:29:39.230
CAITLIN MCGINTY: King Louie.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.250
MISA MALONE:
Barbra, King Louie--

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.375
they're still in the show,
but they're topical now.

00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:45.310
So King Louie is singing about
something that is appropriate--

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.740
KIRK MILLS: Gay marriage.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.364
MISA MALONE: --and
applicable to today.

00:29:47.364 --> 00:29:48.981
Planter's Peanut is
carrying an iPad.

00:29:48.981 --> 00:29:49.480
You know.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.760
So it's fresh, but it's
still paying homage

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.940
to where we started
40 years ago, which

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.431
was with Steve Silver and
this great idea that he had.

00:29:57.431 --> 00:29:59.805
KEVIN BALK: You know, it's
really a Bay Area institution.

00:29:59.805 --> 00:30:01.846
And anyone who comes here
really has heard of it.

00:30:01.846 --> 00:30:04.184
So has that really
helped to kind of have

00:30:04.184 --> 00:30:06.600
your permanent home here and
helped kind of shape the show

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.627
and just to be like, this
is a complete iconic thing.

00:30:09.627 --> 00:30:11.960
When you come to San Francisco,
this is the thing to do.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.130
MISA MALONE: I'm sorry.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:14.370
You know, It's
funny-- I'm just going

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.990
to interject-- because we were
talking in the dressing room.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.640
This is the first
time that any of us

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.390
can remember doing a PR where
we did not sing "San Francisco."

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.380
It is such an ingrained
part of what we do.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.110
And it really does,
as you say, shape

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:34.660
the show and shape the themes
and the methodologies that

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.300
are in play.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.630
It's because of this
unique and fantastic city.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:38.160
I'm sorry.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.550
KIRK MILLS: And I
was just going to say

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.966
that we're in all
the travel books

00:30:40.966 --> 00:30:43.050
now, as far as when you
go to San Francisco.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.070
It's right there.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.320
That's one of the attractions.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.331
Come see our show.

00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:46.830
Yeah.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.390
CAITLIN MCGINTY: And I
can't say how many times--

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.881
and it's really touching--
I've seen, when we are singing

00:30:50.881 --> 00:30:53.380
"San Francisco" at the end of
the show, for whatever reason,

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.260
you don't know their story.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.590
But there might be
someone in the audience.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.080
And you'll see them sort
of like wiping tears away.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.942
But they're smiling.

00:30:58.942 --> 00:30:59.650
They're so happy.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.733
So maybe they've moved
away and they've come back.

00:31:01.733 --> 00:31:02.960
Or they're visiting.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.640
Or it's that there's something
touching them about it.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.842
And it's really lovely to
see because we touch people

00:31:10.842 --> 00:31:12.300
every night while
we're performing.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.775
And that's why we do what we do.

00:31:14.775 --> 00:31:18.632
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:18.632 --> 00:31:20.590
KEVIN BALK: And we're
going to do some audience

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.214
questions, too.

00:31:21.214 --> 00:31:24.400
So if you guys want to come
up to the mics, feel free.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.720
I realize there's
a matinee show that

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.800
allows, actually,
people who are under 21.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.880
So does the show
change there, too?

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.330
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY: Yeah.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:32.120
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: A little bit.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.161
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
For instance, on a Sunday,

00:31:34.161 --> 00:31:37.000
I will not unveil
my butt, I'm sure.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.700
And there's just a
few little things

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.920
that we change so we're not,
like, saying curse words.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.810
Or there's a very iconic
banana hat that comes out.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.960
And he lets his banana
up in the regular show.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.120
But on the matinees, the
banana does not go up.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.120
KEVIN BALK: Fair enough.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:56.300
All right.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.800
We have a couple
audience questions.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.500
How about you?

00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.833
AUDIENCE: That was a great show.

00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:01.901
Thanks for coming
here to delight us.

00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:02.400
What's--

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.080
What's your creative process for
coming up with the new songs?

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.840
And how long does it take
you to learn the new lyrics

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.840
and present them?

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.249
MISA MALONE: That
would be Kenny and Jo.

00:32:17.249 --> 00:32:19.790
JACQUI ARSLAN: And let us not
forget Bill Keck, our composer.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.165
MISA MALONE: And Bill Keck,
our amazing musical director.

00:32:22.165 --> 00:32:24.240
JACQUI ARSLAN: I
mean, he puts together

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.710
all these segues of tons of
songs that everyone knows,

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.180
all in one number, and
it's just incredible.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.370
And so he and Kenny
collaborate on that.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.453
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
Sometimes it's really fast,

00:32:34.453 --> 00:32:37.070
if they're really trying to
get it in the show right away.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.220
You know, Kenny will
come up with a number.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.596
Kenny and Jo will write
a number overnight.

00:32:41.596 --> 00:32:42.720
So it just kind of depends.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.845
If it's a number with a
lot of people and costumes,

00:32:44.845 --> 00:32:46.210
it takes a little bit longer.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.860
A lot of times, they'll have us
try, like, a line in the show.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:50.880
See how it goes.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.450
If it gets a really good
reaction-- like as Snow,

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.560
I used to have a Justin
Bieber crotch grab.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.780
And it was really funny.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.390
And then we put--
OK, it's time to put

00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.551
Justin Bieber in the show.

00:32:59.551 --> 00:33:00.050
You know?

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:01.680
So we kind of--
they'll gauge it.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.638
And sometimes, we'll just
put a whole number in

00:33:03.638 --> 00:33:05.240
and see how it goes.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.566
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:07.566 --> 00:33:09.394
KEVIN BALK: And how about you?

00:33:09.394 --> 00:33:11.310
AUDIENCE: Again, thank
you so much for coming.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.610
This would be my fourth
and a half time seeing you.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.630
So it's pretty great.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.050
I was just curious, we've
mentioned numerous times

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.340
that the show is so topical.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.270
And so you're obviously
adding costumes in

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.040
and different ideas.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.360
What you do with the
costumes that are retired?

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.440
MISA MALONE: There is
a big, beautiful land

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.930
called the "Beach Blanket
Babylon" warehouse.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.400
AUDIENCE: And where
might one be able to go

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.485
to see said costumes?

00:33:35.485 --> 00:33:37.610
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY: It
is absolutely fascinating

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:38.940
to go into the warehouse.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.950
When I went in, they
had to drag me out.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.010
It's really crazy.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:43.560
It's huge.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.830
I mean, some things, I
think that when they go out

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:50.049
of the show, because of
copyright reasons and stuff,

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:51.590
sometimes if they
build new costumes,

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.173
they may have to
destroy the old ones.

00:33:53.173 --> 00:33:56.680
But the warehouse is
just absolutely filled

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.780
with hats and props.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.435
MISA MALONE: 40 years.

00:34:00.435 --> 00:34:02.810
KIRK MILLS: I've been working
with the show for 15 years,

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:03.894
and I've never been there.

00:34:03.894 --> 00:34:04.809
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: Oh.

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:05.512
It's so amazing.

00:34:05.512 --> 00:34:06.470
You've got to go there.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:07.240
MISA MALONE: Closely
guarded secret.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.360
STEPHANIE HARWOOD:
And you'll say things

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.190
like, I need a new pair of
shoes, because my shoes broke.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.230
And they'll be like, oh.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.730
OK.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:13.690
We'll be right back.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.273
And they'll go over
there, and they'll

00:34:15.273 --> 00:34:17.350
bring back a pair of shoes
that are in your size

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.750
and were even better than
the ones that you had before.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.750
Because there's just--
there's like an entire wall

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:26.000
that's the size of that wall
that's just covered in shoes.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.696
They don't throw anything away.

00:34:27.696 --> 00:34:29.570
You know, it's like
everything sort of stays.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.610
Or costumes will
be picked apart.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.755
And when somebody new
comes into the show,

00:34:33.755 --> 00:34:35.630
everybody's sizes are
a little bit different.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.600
So they'll find, like, oh,
well, that bodice will fit her.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.909
But she's a little shorter.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.690
So maybe we should get a
little bit of a shorter skirt

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:41.810
so that it's not
below her knees.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:42.320
You know?

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.280
And they'll take it apart.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.530
And they'll build it together.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:48.311
And our costume
department is unreal.

00:34:48.311 --> 00:34:49.310
MISA MALONE: Phenomenal.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.770
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: I mean, for
the New Year's Eve, how long--

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:51.842
two weeks to put, like--

00:34:51.842 --> 00:34:53.550
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
And the hatmakers.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.440
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: And the hats.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.409
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
Matt James and Tim Santry.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:57.784
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: Like 20
different costumes like that,

00:34:57.784 --> 00:34:58.950
And they just turn them out.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:02.297
And they're the most beautiful
things you've ever seen.

00:35:02.297 --> 00:35:03.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.490
Agreed.

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:08.100
KEVIN BALK: Now was there a big
difference coming to Google?

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.040
I mean, obviously there was.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.664
But what was kind of
the big difference

00:35:10.664 --> 00:35:13.300
in the process for bringing it
here as opposed to your stage

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.017
that you have?

00:35:14.017 --> 00:35:16.100
CAITLIN MCGINTY: You always
just have to be aware.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.520
Like for all these wigs-- I
mean, Misa's is a little wide.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.387
But you want to make
sure that you can fit.

00:35:21.387 --> 00:35:22.970
KEVIN BALK: I was
worried about your--

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.160
CAITLIN MCGINTY: We did
a rehearsal earlier.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.490
Because I'm 6 feet tall.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.980
Like, I'm already giant.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.200
And then you put me in heels
and a 4- or 5-foot hat.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.470
I looked at that, and
went, oh, no problem.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.470
And then when we tried
it go through it,

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.720
I definitely had
to kind of do this.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.040
So you have to check
your surroundings

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.079
a lot of the time when we get
to a new space, wherever it is,

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:43.620
whether-- OK.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.610
Am I going up stairs?

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.130
Am I going up a ramp?

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.830
Just the surroundings,
the light,

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:51.050
the sound-- it just changes
from space to space.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.380
And we have everything
taped out right here.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.910
And it's basically the
choreography we do on our stage

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:57.780
at Club Fugazi.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.909
We just make it work for
whatever space we're in.

00:35:59.909 --> 00:36:01.700
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: I
think the show teaches

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.462
you to be on your feet, too.

00:36:03.462 --> 00:36:05.670
Kenny will come to you right
before the show and say,

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.530
you have a new line.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.170
And you're like, oh.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.940
So you have to learn this
whole new line or a new verse

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.050
in a song because something
happened that day.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.930
And so you have to be able
to let go of old information,

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.490
and bring in new
information, and go.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:19.390
You know?

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:21.110
And sometimes it's
a wing and a prayer.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:24.559
But I mean, most of us-- I
mean, I know I-- sometimes

00:36:24.559 --> 00:36:26.100
I can't even remember
things at home.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.630
Like did I do my
laundry last night?

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.835
And it's because I got too
much information coming in.

00:36:31.835 --> 00:36:34.410
And I've got to focus on
"Beach Blanket," you know.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:35.460
Memorize those lines.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.280
When you get here,
we practice it.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.902
But then we get here,
and he says, OK.

00:36:38.902 --> 00:36:40.110
You go here, and you go here.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.660
And then you just do it.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.736
JACQUI ARSLAN: Well, and
I'm the queen of gibberish.

00:36:44.736 --> 00:36:47.420
I get new lines, and
the show must go on.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.250
And I have no idea
what I'm saying.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:53.260
And I'm just, [GIBBERISH]
And it's kosher.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.140
Like I'll finally find
the note or the line

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:57.973
I'm supposed to say.

00:36:57.973 --> 00:36:59.181
And it's actually on YouTube.

00:36:59.181 --> 00:37:00.730
Don't YouTube it.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.980
KIRK MILLS: I was on stage
with her when she did that,

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.464
and she was so committed
to her gibberish.

00:37:05.464 --> 00:37:07.255
There were people in
the audience who said,

00:37:07.255 --> 00:37:09.100
I had a really hard
time understanding her.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.760
Like, they thought
she was talking.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.550
JACQUI ARSLAN: But you
didn't break face either.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.258
We didn't break
choreography or anything.

00:37:14.258 --> 00:37:16.090
I was just like, [GIBBERISH].

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.250
Because I was playing Lady
Gaga in the meat dress.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:20.870
But I mean, sometimes
your mind just goes.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:21.951
And you have no idea why.

00:37:21.951 --> 00:37:23.950
And then all of a sudden,
it pops back into you.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.786
But you just got to keep going.

00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:29.160
KEVIN BALK: I mean, the show
transcends different cities,

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:29.280
too.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.738
Because you guys have done
this, I think, in London, right?

00:37:31.738 --> 00:37:32.440
And New York.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.430
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:34.180
KEVIN BALK: Vegas.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.360
Vegas, I'm sorry.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.896
How was the reception there?

00:37:37.896 --> 00:37:40.270
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY: I don't
think any of us were here,

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:43.980
but I know that both shows
were super successful.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.742
I'm so jealous.

00:37:44.742 --> 00:37:45.700
I want to go to London.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.660
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: I know.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.960
People come all the
time, and they're

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.260
like, when are you coming back.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.670
We want to see you in New York.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.110
This would do so well.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:52.900
I mean, who knows?

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.660
Anything is possible
for the future, I think.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.950
KEVIN BALK: Next question.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.240
AUDIENCE: Hearing you
talk about the process,

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.170
I'm curious about a few
things, one of which

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.250
is how often do
performers change?

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.870
And what is the
audition process like?

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.960
Hearing you see all these things
with the theater background,

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.350
but it does sound
like you need to have

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.380
maybe some sort of improv
background or ability

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.100
to really just remember things
and do things on the fly.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.300
So I'm curious about that.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.000
MISA MALONE: I actually think
I'll speak to that, because I'm

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.791
the only one up here
that actually does not

00:38:17.791 --> 00:38:19.090
have a theater background.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.819
I actually used to work
here, believe it or not.

00:38:21.819 --> 00:38:26.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:29.280
What's really interesting is
that Kenny and Jo and just

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.890
the team, they make it
so easy, if you just

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.932
have a lot of personality,
to kind of step in.

00:38:35.932 --> 00:38:36.890
And they will help you.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:38.264
And then you have
your castmates.

00:38:38.264 --> 00:38:40.700
And you've got a
wealth of background

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.810
in history and theater.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.400
And they'll help you to kind
of guide you along the way.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.139
So the audition process-- my
audition story is a little

00:38:48.139 --> 00:38:49.430
different from everyone else's.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:52.000
But there actually
is an annual audition

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.330
for "Beach Blanket Babylon."

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.960
Typically happens in September.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.640
I actually had a
private audition

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.580
because I knew people
who knew people.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.910
But it's a really great-- it's
a really great type of a thing,

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.160
because it gives you an
opportunity to come in.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.010
And they'll give you
what you need to know.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:12.340
And they'll say, prepare
to sing like Barbra.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.260
Prepare to sing
"Ain't Misbehavin'."

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:19.040
Prepare to have a country
twang and speak like a Brit,

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.918
as Stephanie does
so wonderfully.

00:39:21.918 --> 00:39:23.664
JACQUI ARSLAN: Right in the eye.

00:39:23.664 --> 00:39:25.330
STEPHANIE HARWOOD:
Adele is my favorite.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.242
I love her.

00:39:26.242 --> 00:39:28.700
MISA MALONE: So you have an
opportunity to really showcase.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.700
So maybe if you don't have
that theater background,

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.966
but you have a lot of
personality and a little spark,

00:39:32.966 --> 00:39:35.590
they will recognize that in you,
and they'll give you a chance.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.530
They gave me a chance.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.950
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: I actually
went to the open call.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.385
The first year I auditioned,
my grandmother was like, oh.

00:39:42.385 --> 00:39:43.760
There's a thing
in the newspaper.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.370
You should go.

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:45.412
And I wasn't going to go.

00:39:45.412 --> 00:39:47.119
I had just moved home
from New York City.

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:48.610
And so I didn't
prepare anything.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.140
And I thought, well,
I guess I'll just go.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.680
I'm here.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.630
I might as well.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.210
And I go in.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:53.860
And I had no idea
what I was in for.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.630
You go into this room.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.800
And I didn't know anyone.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.800
I mean I didn't know anyone.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.980
I'd never seen the show before.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.380
I'd heard about it
growing up here.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.090
My parents went.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:02.290
But I never saw it.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.110
So when I went, and
I went up to sing--

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.160
and I think I was in,
like, the first group.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.080
And I went up there.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.780
And I sang my solo, which
was, like, "Maybe This Time,"

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.570
from Cabaret.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:11.270
You know?

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.380
And I'm singing my song.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.755
And then afterwards,
he goes, OK.

00:40:13.755 --> 00:40:14.410
That's great.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.410
Now can you do it
like Ethel Merman?

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:20.282
And I was like, uh.

00:40:20.282 --> 00:40:22.670
I think I can do that.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.274
And I did my Ethel Merman.

00:40:24.274 --> 00:40:25.690
And I walked out
of that audition.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:28.010
And I thought, that was bizarre.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.312
I'd been to, like, a million
auditions in New York.

00:40:30.312 --> 00:40:31.270
And they're just awful.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.780
You walk into a
room with a table.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.280
And you sing to
them, and you leave.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.160
And you have no idea how you do.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.540
And here, Kenny's
like, oh, my god.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.370
I just love it.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.220
It's just so great.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.178
Can I get more of that?

00:40:41.178 --> 00:40:42.210
Do it like Barbra now.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.520
And now you guys sing together.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.436
And you do this thing.

00:40:44.436 --> 00:40:47.445
And you're just like, it's
a really fun environment,

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.670
and you feel like
you can just slay it.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.795
And they want you to succeed.

00:40:51.795 --> 00:40:53.170
And they really
don't care if you

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:54.660
have a whole lot of experience.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.353
They just want you to
come up there, and let

00:40:57.353 --> 00:40:59.780
go of your inhibitions,
and go for it.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.030
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY: It's
so different from a theater.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.696
I mean, coming from
a theater background

00:41:02.696 --> 00:41:05.210
and going to this
audition was crazy.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.400
You know, sing your song
in a Brazilian accent.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.180
I mean, it's true.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.430
But it's so fun.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.170
It's so warm.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.520
Like Steph said, in New
York, it can be real cold.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.950
And they just make it a really
lovely, lovely experience.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.750
CAITLIN MCGINTY: And
I think you asked

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.250
how often the cast
changes and everything.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:24.530
It really depends.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:27.180
I mean, it's such a
wonderful gig as a performer.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.457
I mean, we're used to having
a show last a couple weekends,

00:41:30.457 --> 00:41:33.040
and then we're out of a job, and
we go back to waiting tables.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.460
That's what I did in New York.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.540
So to have a job
that you have really

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.480
until you're ready to move
on or something happens

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.910
and you're ready to leave,
you have a performing job

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:45.806
five nights a week.

00:41:45.806 --> 00:41:46.930
And it's really incredible.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:50.067
So we have people
who-- sometimes they'll

00:41:50.067 --> 00:41:51.150
have the annual additions.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.950
But people won't get
hired for a couple years,

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.460
because people haven't left.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.340
Kirk, how many years
have you been here?

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:57.540
KIRK MILLS: 15 years for me.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.623
CAITLIN MCGINTY: 15 years.

00:41:58.623 --> 00:42:01.060
And then Renee, who's one
of the stars of the show,

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.880
almost 30 years.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.032
And it's wonderful.

00:42:04.032 --> 00:42:04.740
And you can tell.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.090
I mean, the people who've
been there for so-- I mean,

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.170
everyone is so talented.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.220
I work with such a
wonderful group of people.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.185
But like, you learn so much
from those women and men who

00:42:14.185 --> 00:42:15.540
have been there for so long.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.102
I mean, they just-- you can
just see it on their faces.

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:18.810
They just get it.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:19.520
You know what I mean?

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.103
Like, they just
totally get this show.

00:42:21.103 --> 00:42:22.784
And it's so wonderful to watch.

00:42:22.784 --> 00:42:24.700
KEVIN BALK: So that's
really interesting, too.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.262
So do you guys go in with,
like, impressions that you have?

00:42:28.262 --> 00:42:29.220
KIRK MILLS: Not really.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.120
It's like Stephanie was saying.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.179
My audition, I went
in and did my song.

00:42:34.179 --> 00:42:34.970
And he said, great.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.280
Can you do it like Elvis?

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.810
OK.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:38.310
Great.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.007
Can you do like Richard Simmons?

00:42:41.007 --> 00:42:43.340
KEVIN BALK: You've just got
to be prepared for anything.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.010
STEPHANIE HARWOOD:
It's really just

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:45.259
fly by the seat of your pants.

00:42:45.259 --> 00:42:45.890
Just go for it.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:46.870
Don't worry about it.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:47.370
You know?

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:52.581
It's like, [SINGING] maybe
this time, I'll be lucky.

00:42:52.581 --> 00:42:53.080
You know?

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.570
It's like, you just
let it go and you try.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:56.704
Somehow it works.

00:42:56.704 --> 00:42:57.620
At the end of the day.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.580
And they love for
you to go crazier

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.680
and crazier and crazier.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.010
And we'll put something
in on the first day,

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.630
and we're all a little nervous.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:06.375
And then after week
of doing it, it's

00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:08.890
like we're finding
more things that you

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:11.390
can pull little pieces
of these characters

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.234
in to make it more
real for the audience

00:43:13.234 --> 00:43:14.650
and make them be
like, oh, my god.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:16.770
She's so like her.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.330
JACQUI ARSLAN:
For my audition, I

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:20.380
sang "At Last," I think,
at my second audition,

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.900
because I needed
to sing a ballad.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.667
And then, I'm singing it.

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:24.750
And I have my eyes closed.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:25.900
And then Kenny goes, OK.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.420
Can you sing it
with your eyes open?

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.250
But like you have toothpicks.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:30.130
But be sexy.

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.962
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:32.962 --> 00:43:34.774
[SINGING] At last.

00:43:34.774 --> 00:43:36.690
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
Open your eyes, be sexy

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.150
is one of our favorite things.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.320
It's the funniest thing.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:39.765
JACQUI ARSLAN: Like toothpicks.

00:43:39.765 --> 00:43:40.210
OK.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:41.030
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
Open your eyes.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:42.206
Be sexy.

00:43:42.206 --> 00:43:43.907
It feels so funny.

00:43:43.907 --> 00:43:44.490
But it's true.

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:45.448
That's "Beach Blanket."

00:43:45.448 --> 00:43:47.676
You know?

00:43:47.676 --> 00:43:49.300
KEVIN BALK: Another
question over here.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:49.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.416
So I think you guys
just kind of touched

00:43:51.416 --> 00:43:52.780
on this a little bit already.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.680
But I am curious.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.770
I love that you, the
guy in the red vest,

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.750
you play Michele Bachmann.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.380
So how specifically
are characters chosen?

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.680
Like if at night, do the
producers come and say,

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.320
you're Vladimir
Putin for the night?

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.845
Like how is that decided?

00:44:06.845 --> 00:44:08.560
And are there
particular characters

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.101
that everyone wants to play or
that they're required to play?

00:44:11.101 --> 00:44:15.190
KIRK MILLS: Well
there's 10 principals,

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:17.030
five guys, five girls.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:21.090
And out of the principals,
they decide who does what.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:23.117
And then the understudies
just sort of adapt

00:44:23.117 --> 00:44:24.200
to what the principals do.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.310
Like I say, I cover
four people, so I

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:30.650
do everything that's not done
by a black man or a woman.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:32.150
CAITLIN MCGINTY:
But there's tracks.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.980
That's specific.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.580
Like mine's-- I do
Chiquita Banana,

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.800
and Jacqui's the
Pineapple Princess.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.950
So we kind of know which
roles come with that.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.740
And then it sort of
depends on, well,

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.070
do you have a break right now?

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:45.080
Or are you on stage?

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:45.270
OK.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.870
You have a break?

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.370
OK, so we want you
to be-- you know?

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.990
It sort of depends on timing
and everything as well.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.260
JACQUI ARSLAN: Who
can make the change.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.301
CAITLIN MCGINTY: Exactly.

00:44:51.301 --> 00:44:52.870
Who can make the change.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:56.520
MISA MALONE: Unless, of
course, you're the black girl,

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.770
in which case, you get to
play all of the black roles.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.670
So my principal and I,
there are three of us

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.050
on cast, Team Black Girl.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:06.310
And we play everything
from Beyonce

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:09.170
to Nicki Minaj to
Michelle Obama,

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:12.700
Coco Chanel-- wrap your head
around that one-- Tina Turner,

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:14.130
and Glinda the Good Witch.

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:17.120
So there are certain
characters-- I've always

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.230
thought of it, just
as a newbie coming in,

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:22.200
there are tracks
that lead to an icon.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.560
So there's the Louie track.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.520
There's the Pineapple
Princess track.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.910
There's the pizza lady track.

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:27.410
There's--

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.110
KIRK MILLS: Elvis track.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.318
MISA MALONE: The Elvis track.

00:45:29.318 --> 00:45:31.820
Because those are
the iconic roles

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.400
that Steve Silver
originally created.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.720
And then that character, then,
will play some pop culture

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.790
icons and some
political as well.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:41.480
But again, as I said, it's
kind of predicated on,

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.730
do you have a break right now?

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.990
Do you think you
could make a change?

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.340
You can?

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:44.850
OK, good.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:45.960
This is you now.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.130
You get to play Katy Perry.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.122
You get to play--

00:45:48.122 --> 00:45:50.580
STEPHANIE HARWOOD: Well, and
like in Jacqui's case, I mean,

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.980
she looks like Kim Kardashian.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.249
So obviously they're going
to do whatever they can.

00:45:55.249 --> 00:45:57.540
CAITLIN MCGINTY: I am not
going to play Kim Kardashian.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:57.990
STEPHANIE HARWOOD:
You know, it's

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.060
like she looks
fantastic in that role.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.012
So they're going to
put her in that role.

00:46:03.012 --> 00:46:05.970
Tammy has just the biggest
personality and this big face

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.060
that has the craziest facial
expressions you've ever seen.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.580
So if somebody is
bigger than life

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.770
and has just this huge,
crazy personality,

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:15.860
she's going to do it.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.590
And they'll figure
out how to fit it in.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:20.490
Sometimes it takes
a lot of finesse,

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.770
and tweaking, and
cutting, and snipping.

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:27.270
But Kenny, and Jo, and
Bill do a fantastic job

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.560
of figuring out how
to fit it in there.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.520
And then we sort of
show up and go, OK.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.185
Sounds great.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.490
KEVIN BALK: That's great.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.270
I do want to-- any
more questions?

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:41.125
One more.

00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:41.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:44.450
I was reading in the brochure
about a scholarship program

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.950
as well.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:46.408
Could you talk to
a little bit more

00:46:46.408 --> 00:46:48.880
about that, how you recruit
the next generation folks?

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.530
CAITLIN MCGINTY:
I'll take that one.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:53.050
So actually, it's a
really wonderful thing.

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.530
I took place in it
a long time ago.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.310
It started in 2002.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.239
And I was going to college.

00:46:59.239 --> 00:47:00.780
It was my senior
year of high school.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.830
And is it just
northern California?

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:05.880
Is it the Bay Area, Jo?

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:06.830
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY:
It's the Bay Area.

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:07.620
CAITLIN MCGINTY: Bay Area.

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.630
SHAWNA FERRIS MCNULTY: Within a
certain radius of the Bay Area.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.380
CAITLIN MCGINTY: There's
a certain radius.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.900
And you can audition,
whether you're

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.710
a dancer, an actor, or a singer.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:16.470
And you send in a videotape.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.780
And it was kind of the
same thing, I think,

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.900
what you were saying.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.410
My mom saw it in the paper.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.561
And it the, was like, the
day before it was due.

00:47:23.561 --> 00:47:24.060
OK.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.320
Let's in the living room
record you singing a song.

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.270
And we'll send it in.

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:32.009
And so I was one of the three
singing finalists chosen.

00:47:32.009 --> 00:47:33.550
And then it's really,
really amazing,

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.190
because I was 17 years old.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:37.540
And I got to go to Club Fugazi.

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.130
And I met all the cast.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.680
And of course, I'm completely
overwhelmed and terrified

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.250
because these
people are amazing.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.615
And it's a live night.

00:47:45.615 --> 00:47:46.770
You get to invite friends.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.380
And there's a panel of judges.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.880
And each finalist performs
whatever they've chosen to do,

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.960
whether it's a dance,
acting, or singing.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.810
And a winner is chosen.

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:58.540
I did not win.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.450
But came in second.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:03.700
JACQUI ARSLAN: We love teasing
her about that, though.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.190
CAITLIN MCGINTY: The winner
receives a $10,000 scholarship

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:07.260
in each category.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.610
So they give $30,000
away each year.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.660
And it's a really
amazing program.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.690
I mean, it's such--
and we watch.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.960
We perform at it every year.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.030
And we watch these kids.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.900
And the talent that comes
through is just incredible.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.230
I mean, there's been--
if you guys watch "So You

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:23.604
Think You Can Dance," there
was an amazing dancer, Katie.

00:48:23.604 --> 00:48:25.490
I don't remember her last name.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:26.750
What is it?

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:27.280
Sheen.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.190
Yes.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.690
Yes.

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.470
She was a finalist, and
she won the scholarship.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:32.470
KIRK MILLS: Third place.

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:33.860

Oh, third place.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:34.670
KIRK MILLS: No, she
was third on "So

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:36.215
You Think You Can
Dance" that season.

00:48:36.215 --> 00:48:36.630
CAITLIN MCGINTY:
Oh, there it is.

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:37.840
But she won a scholarship.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.120
And it's a really,
really amazing program

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:45.390
that Jo and Steve left for
her to kind of take care of.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:48.650
And it's just such an
amazing thing for these kids

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:52.300
to be able to come in and have
such a huge chunk of change

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:55.657
to put towards their college
education right away.

00:48:55.657 --> 00:48:57.740
KEVIN BALK: And that's the
"Beach Blanket Babylon"

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.135
Scholarship for the Arts, right?

00:48:59.135 --> 00:49:00.010
CAITLIN MCGINTY: Yes.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:01.200
KEVIN BALK: So if any of
you guys are interested,

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:01.570

incredible amount

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.987

everything's perfect.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.270
