00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.229
Mario backpacks and SLR mount

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:07.160
for your iPhone. It's episode 17 of LÃœT.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.960
Wear your glasses
and shades together in one piece while

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:13.690
browsing

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.850
portal necklaces, Aperture totes,
laptop stickers and on and on and on.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.670
And here's a book that shows you how to
build weapons out of stuff you've got

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.710
around the office

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.310
or classroom. Now that you're officially
awesome, chew on some beef jerky

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.030
potato chips. And rather than buying
someone a card for

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.500
every occasion, buy a bunch of utility cards.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.840
Each cards' word search contains more
than 100 wishes and sentiments,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.120
so just circle the ones that apply to
that person on that day.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
With all the time you save relax with a
drink in a doom glass

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.850
while wearing literary-themed t-shirts.
Moby Dick,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.170
The Bell Jar, Tell-Tale Heart,
The Sun Also Rises and more.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.000
Now look, cats love chasing laser
pointers, but why do all that difficult

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.550
hand moving when you could have the FroliCat BOLT

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.970
do it for you?
The Museum of Modern Art carries toast coasters

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.960
and a bubble necklace. Or make a bubble
necklace for free in the shower while

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.590
storing products on the shower squid.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.210
Then clean your hands with some hand soap.
No, no, no.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.810
Some hand soap. Once they're clean,
shove on some pickle

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.869
finger puppets while your pet finger paints

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.030
masterpieces with no mess thanks to ThinkGeek,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.270
which also offers a bacon-scented air freshener

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.710
and chapstick.
I mean, SPAM flavored

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.790
lip glaze. Charge your phone in an emergency
with this solar powered USB charging

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.360
pack that gives you 8 extra hours of power

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.750
and teach your baby something new thanks to Tiffany

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.420
Ard. She designs X&amp;Y chromosome earrings,
as well as this baby room picture

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.979
that teaches not ABC's, not 123's,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.100
but prime numbers. From 2 ladybugs

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.200
to 41 pieces of bacon to 53 snails.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.220
Before we run out of time, let's talk about time.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.090
Telling it complexly and beautifully.
Tokyoflash designs amazing sci-fi

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.039
watches that you'll know how to read

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.660
while confusing strangers and attracting
hot alien ladies.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.849
I leave you with some of NeatoShop's
I heart shirts.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.520
And, not a free thing, but a free piece of
historical information -

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.970
what I like to call epic gifts in history.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.050
In 1865, Seth Kinman

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.239
gave President Andrew Johnson a chair.

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.090
A chair made out of a bear.
Who exactly was Seth Kinman?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.250
Well, he was a hunter who owned a bar and
once played fiddle for Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.580
You know, a fiddle that he made out of a mule

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.440
skull.
They're not yet available to buy online,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.240
but in the meantime...

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.480
As always,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.920
thanks for watching.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.519
