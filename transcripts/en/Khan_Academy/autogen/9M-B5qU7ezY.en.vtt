00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
 . 

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.780
 Let's solve some of the issues you are dealing with 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.970
 With a thin line 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.250
 You may see that this means 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.280
 Models of change, because we will formulate what 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.590
 Described in this matter 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.045
 We will represent him then I hope we are 

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.620
 We will be able to answer questions 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.540
 Let's see what is required 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.750
 The current standard for shower water flow is 2.5 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.000
 Gallon / min 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.189
 2.5 gallons / min 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.390
 Calculate how long it takes to fill 30 gallons 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.180
 The bathtub has a shower 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.340
 Works to connect water 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.010
 What can be done here is that we can put a model of change in order 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.310
 So it looks excellent, and say okay 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.690
 Let's put a small equation describing the number 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.610
 The gallons you have filled in - or the number of gallons you have 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 We need to use it after a certain number of minutes 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.600
 Let's assume that our gallons are equal to the ratio 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.780
 What we have filled of gluons 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:17.460
 If it equals 2.5 gallons / min × 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.710
 Number of minutes 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.060
 × minutes 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.380
 I will say that m is the minutes and g is the number of gallons 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.860
 And we just have to put a paradigm shift 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.780
 Nothing better than that 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.360
 We now have a formula that describes - give me 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.430
 The number of minutes, and I will hit it with 2.5 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.550
 Because that way we will fill the bathtub quickly 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.460
 After one minute, 1 x 2.5 = 2.5 gallons 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.220
 After two minutes, we have 2 × 2.5 = 5 gallons 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.330
 If this is the model 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.350
 This is also a line 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 Remember the line equation model y = mx + b 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.510
 We do not have b here 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.320
 b does not exist 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200
 We only have m × x time 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.250
 The x here is the minutes and y 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.760
 The gallons are and the inclination is 2.5 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.670
 Let us define it before answering the question 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.690
 Instead of naming this x axis - remember that x 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.730
 The independent variable, which is expressed as minutes 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.850
 Which the water flows out 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.470
 This axis m relative to the minutes 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.070
 And the vertical axis, instead of being called y axis 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.260
 I will call it a g-axis relative to the number of gallons 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.700
 Which we fill 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.866
 I will only solve the positive quarter, assuming it is 

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:26.710
 We only have positive minutes 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.620
 What's going on? 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.820
 Our inclination is 2.5 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.900
 We can also write this as a gallon = -2.5 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:42.930
 Equivalent 5/2 gallons / min × Number of minutes 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.030
 Now we know that the tilt is 5/2 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.280
 I use 2.5 as well, but I prefer 5/2 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.220
 We know that the intersection of y is 0 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.700
 We have no intersection y 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.050
 You can write + 0 instead 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.990
 Start here from the center 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.380
 This is the y intersection 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.280
 And for every 2 we move to the right, we will move by 5 to the top 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.240
 If we move - change in x is 2 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.120
 1,2,3,4,5 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.180
 The change in x is 2 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.160
 1,2,3,4,5 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.550
 If the change in x is -2, then the change in y will be 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.630
 5 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.540
 2 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.920
 1,2,3,4,5 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.300
 And so on 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.300
 We will be here 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.755
 If the line, if we want to represent the model graphically it will look like this 

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:26.800
 I'm doing my best to order all these points 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.360
 In fact, I said that I would only be there 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.050
 In the first quarter 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.810
 It is not logical to be present in this quarter 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.900
 Because it can not get negative points 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.370
 Or should not get negative minutes 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.240
 You should only deal with them here 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.560
 The question now is how long it takes to fill 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.540
 30 gallons of bathtub? 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.540
 Now, unfortunately, the graphic representation did not pass by 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.510
 Road up to 30 gallons 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.800
 If so - we have 10 gallons here 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.390
 These are 10 gallons if you move up by 3, I can 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.370
 Read the representation 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.780
 But we can also find it algebraically 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.150
 How many minutes does it take? 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.870
 Well, let's make the gallons equal to 30 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.450
 If we have 30 gallons = - I will write them 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:18.279
 In the same color - 2.5 gallons / min × number of minutes 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.510
 × Number of minutes 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.800
 All we have to do now until we find the number of minutes is to divide 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.400
 Both ends are at 2.5 gallons / min 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.950
 Divide both sides at 2.5 gallons / min 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.040
 2.5 gallons / min 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.080
 I'm writing modules so I'll show you the modules 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.970
 All will succeed in the end 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.170
 If this is deleted 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.280
 And we have 1 left 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.450
 The left side - or we can say m-- 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.100
 Will equal 30 2.5 2.5 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.770
 We have these gallons in place 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.890
 Gallons 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.580
 I want to see you, you can deal with the units like you 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.180
 Dealing with actual numbers 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.570
 If I had a gallon / min in the place, then 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.730
 Divided into this pairing, this is equivalent 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.840
 Beating in reverse 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.780
 Equivalent multiplication 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.230
 In minutes / gallons 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.020
 Right? 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.960
 These units were in place 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.850
 When I put them in the rugs, I overturn them 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.070
 If gallons are in rugs, the gallons are in place 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.200
 Are deleted 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.280
 I have 30 2.5 2.5 minutes remaining 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.900
 How much is 30 2.5 2.5? 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.110
 = 12 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.020
 It will take us 12 minutes to fill 30 gallons of bathtub 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.270
 We have minutes here 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.880
 12 minutes 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.850
 Let's solve another issue 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.940
 Amen - or man, I do not know the best way up 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.750
 The name is fuzzy - it uses a hose 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.880
 The water hose is used to fill the new swimming pool 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.070
 for the first time 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.850
 It started at 10 am - let me write this down 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:18.420
 It started at 10 am - this is the start time - and let it go 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.540
 The water pumps the whole night 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.150
 At 6 am, he measured depth only 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.520
 The amount of water was filled 4/7 of the pond 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.300
 When it started at 10 am - this time and that 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.470
 What has been filled of pond 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.680
 So, clearly when he started the pool was empty 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.760
 It's a new pool 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.240
 As we have given 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.530
 If filling the pool is 0 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.300
 It's 0 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.500
 There is no water in the pond 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:49.790
 Then at 6 am, Bassas did the depth and found the pond 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.660
 Filled with 4/7 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.920
 The amount of water is equal to 4/7 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.160
 At what hour will his blessing be filled? 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.530
 If we want to know when they are full 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.110
 When is 1/1? 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.500
 Or 7/7 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.420
 At what time? 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.290
 To do so, we have to develop a similar model as we did 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.500
 The last time 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.770
 We can say that filling the pond is equal 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.170
 Fixed what amount of time it took 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.320
 Fixed what amount of time it took 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.730
 We know that when time is 0 - let me write it that way 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.910
 This is the time 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.490
 Let me write it here 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.980
 This is the time 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.870
 This is the time, 0 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.920
 How much is the hour? 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.100
 It's been eight hours, is not it? 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.640
 These are 8 hours 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.150
 We do not know what it is 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.660
 This is another time 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.320
 When the time is 0 at 10 am, 0 × k, we have 0 filled 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.240
 M is filled 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:53.180
 When the time is 8, we have k × 8. Where k kicks off the ratio 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.210
 Which we fill with blessing 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.060
 k × 8 

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.600
 It was filled 4/7 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.490
 Now we can find the value of k 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.480
 We can find a constant ratio 

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.460
 Of the paradigm of change 

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.790
 All I said is, look, this 

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.120
 Fill the pond because it can be formulated using 

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.550
 Equation is so 

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.200
 The quantity we fill is directly proportional to 

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.790
 The amount of time the water hose is allowed to pump 

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.490
 This is the constant seed 

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.280
 We do not know how fast it fills them, but we can now find 

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.800
 This speed 

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.890
 Because we know that after 8 hours it will be filled with 4/7 

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.169
 Until k, we divide both sides by 8 hours 

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:45.370
 We get k = 4/7 8 8 hours, what 

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:53.150
 Equivalent to 4/7 × 1/8 water / hour quantity 

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.140
 If we find this, let me see 

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.980
 Divide on 4 

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.360
 Divide on 4 

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.050
 We get the amount of water equal to 1/14 

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.420
 It's a rather odd unit - the amount of water / hour 

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.690
 Or you can say, we have filled 1/14 of the pool / hour 

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.920
 If k = 1/14 

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.240
 If the equation - let me write it here 

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:23.300
 Fill the pond = 1/14 × time 

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.130
 So the equation we have to answer is when 

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.240
 This equals 1? 

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.910
 At what time? 

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.730
 Let's put the equation 

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.720
 We have 1 

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.035
 This means that we filled it completely 

00:09:34.035 --> 00:09:38.030
 = 1/14 × time 

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:44.520
 If we hit the two ends of equation B14 

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.420
 Then 1/14 and 14 will be deleted 

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.950
 Our remaining t = 14 

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.240
 If the pool is full after 14 hours 

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.490
 Remember that everything we dealt with was in the hours unit 

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.870
 If we start at 10 am - time is 0 - how long will it be 

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.860
 When 14 hours pass? 

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.240
 10 am on the first day - if we go to 10 am the next day 

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.280
 This is 12 hours 

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.010
 So I think 

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:14.600
 We need to go for another couple of hours to get 14 hours 

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.670
 The next afternoon 

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.490
 The next afternoon 

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.190
 The pool will be full 

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.260
 We can represent this 

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.290
 I have this datasheet here 

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.820
 Let us represent everything I talk about 

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.470
 The equation - I wrote it here - fills the pond = 

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.620
 1/14 × t 

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.860
 Let's assume that each age is about 2 

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:44.690
 Where it is 2,4,6,8,10,12,14 

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.990
 This shows that as we move by 14, we will rise by 1 

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:54.360
 If the change in x is 14, the change in y is positive 1 

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.360
 I will make these units 1,2 

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.600
 Staging is not excellent 

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.370
 I distort the graph a bit, but this 1 

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.480
 If the graphic representation will look like this 

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.340
 So 

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.690
 The tilt is 1/14 

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.210
 Anyway, I hope you found this ground useful 

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:10.533
 .
