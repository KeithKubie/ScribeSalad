Let's take a look at keeping customers for the web/mobile channel.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Web/mobile works almost exactly like physical channels--keeping customers.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's exactly the same idea--we might want to offer loyalty programs, contests and events,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
blogs, RSS and email, or social media--all designed to engage customers.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Why do you want to think about keeping customers is that customers are

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
a lot more expensive to acquire over here than they are to keep.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And the key thing that you want to worry about is churn or sometimes called customer attrition.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And here is why--so imagine if you are losing 5% of your customers a month,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
well in 3 years you'll only have about 16% of them left, but imagine if you can reduce churn to 1%,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so that every month only 1% of these customers left.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
After 36 months with 1% attrition, you'd have 70% of your customers left.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Just think about it, with 5% attrition, your average customers sticks around for about 20 months,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but with 1% attrition, they stick around for 100 months.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You get 5 times more revenue from the same customers by just working

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
on keeping these customers around.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now, by the way in reality, financial people discount the cash flows

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
from customers later in this life cycle.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The actual value you get is somewhat less--how much less depends on your industry

00:01:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and cost of capital, but we'll leave that for the accounting to set in a more detailed price
