idea was to allow readers to vote on
 

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.310
idea was to allow readers to vote on
their favorite theories and perhaps

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:35.320
their favorite theories and perhaps
 

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.450
their favorite theories and perhaps
construct a leaderboard of some sort so

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460
construct a leaderboard of some sort so
 

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.610
construct a leaderboard of some sort so
within the topics the little theories

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:41.620
within the topics the little theories
 

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.370
within the topics the little theories
down here will order based on the number

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:44.380
down here will order based on the number
 

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.130
down here will order based on the number
of votes they have but that's a little

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:47.140
of votes they have but that's a little
 

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.940
of votes they have but that's a little
subtle thing I Dilton so but now you

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:50.950
subtle thing I Dilton so but now you
 

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.760
subtle thing I Dilton so but now you
know now it's there any of the links on

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:53.770
know now it's there any of the links on
 

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:56.700
know now it's there any of the links on
the sides lead to articles where you can

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:56.710
the sides lead to articles where you can
 

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:00.539
the sides lead to articles where you can
read more about a given theory or topic

00:44:00.539 --> 00:44:00.549
read more about a given theory or topic
 

00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:03.880
read more about a given theory or topic
and

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:03.890
 

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:05.290
that's

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:05.300
that's
 

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:09.530
that's
pretty much covers it

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540
 

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.420
yeah I can use the rest of my time to

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:11.430
yeah I can use the rest of my time to
 

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:16.790
yeah I can use the rest of my time to
take any questions and one has

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800
 

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.910
no question

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920
no question
 

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.700
no question
people trying to

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:21.710
people trying to
 

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.320
people trying to
produce a network

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:24.330
produce a network
 

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:30.460
produce a network
relatedness between these different

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:30.470
 

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:34.940
well as you'd like to

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:34.950
 

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.470
so if you could

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480
so if you could
 

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.130
so if you could
I understand with

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140
I understand with
 

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.830
I understand with
both species in

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:42.840
both species in
 

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.260
both species in
you Jews have

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:44.270
you Jews have
 

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:54.940
you Jews have
histories and

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:54.950
 

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.770
then there are things like

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:57.780
then there are things like
 

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.780
then there are things like
ornithology trans

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:00.790
ornithology trans
 

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:11.010
ornithology trans
yeah so this is

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:11.020
 

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.760
chips

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:15.770
 

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:17.250
the bottom

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:17.260
the bottom
 

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.950
the bottom
I'm just wondering

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960
 

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.410
parts of things you will do it

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:23.420
parts of things you will do it
 

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.970
parts of things you will do it
right to that and also whether or not

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:24.980
right to that and also whether or not
 

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.310
right to that and also whether or not
you could take a sort of simplistic

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:28.320
you could take a sort of simplistic
 

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.160
you could take a sort of simplistic
why can't we based approach based on the

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:31.170
why can't we based approach based on the
 

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.809
why can't we based approach based on the
similarity of experience

00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:33.819
similarity of experience
 

00:45:33.819 --> 00:45:35.680
similarity of experience
it was a 21

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:35.690
it was a 21
 

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:40.359
it was a 21
uh 41 I think I like split them up and

00:45:40.359 --> 00:45:40.369
uh 41 I think I like split them up and
 

00:45:40.369 --> 00:45:43.160
uh 41 I think I like split them up and

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:43.170

Paschal mystery

00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:46.589
Paschal mystery
 

00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:48.849
Paschal mystery
that was kind of

00:45:48.849 --> 00:45:48.859
that was kind of
 

00:45:48.859 --> 00:45:52.800
that was kind of
really

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:52.810
 

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:55.040
yeah no I mean I would definitely add a

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:55.050
yeah no I mean I would definitely add a
 

00:45:55.050 --> 00:46:01.599
yeah no I mean I would definitely add a
level of granularity

00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:01.609
 

00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:06.789
and I want her to given the admittedly

00:46:06.789 --> 00:46:06.799
and I want her to given the admittedly
 

00:46:06.799 --> 00:46:11.470
and I want her to given the admittedly
simple hierarchies does represent

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480
 

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.470
that sounds like a different

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480
that sounds like a different
 

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.880
that sounds like a different

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:15.890
visualization perfectly that sounds like
 

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.310
visualization perfectly that sounds like
something I wouldn't necessarily want to

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:18.320
something I wouldn't necessarily want to
 

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.660
something I wouldn't necessarily want to
put in here because it would be imposing

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:21.670
put in here because it would be imposing
 

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.970
put in here because it would be imposing
a different temper a Latina pond

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:23.980
a different temper a Latina pond
 

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.530

something that didn't really have one

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:25.540
something that didn't really have one
 

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:26.880
something that didn't really have one
before them

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:26.890
before them
 

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.339
before them
but depending on you know depending on

00:46:29.339 --> 00:46:29.349
but depending on you know depending on
 

00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:33.980
but depending on you know depending on
the time

connoisseur that'll

00:46:37.339 --> 00:46:37.349
connoisseur that'll
 

00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:40.010
I think that would be

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020
I think that would be
 

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.230
I think that would be
great perspective to take I feel like it

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240
great perspective to take I feel like it
 

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.270
great perspective to take I feel like it
would not look like this though it is

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280
would not look like this though it is
 

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.800
would not look like this though it is
that writable you know it would be it

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:45.810
that writable you know it would be it
 

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.150
that writable you know it would be it
would be completely different it would

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160
would be completely different it would
 

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.240
would be completely different it would
be more directional this this is just

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:50.250
be more directional this this is just
 

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:52.880
be more directional this this is just
kind of floating here though it's like

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:52.890
kind of floating here though it's like
 

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.770
kind of floating here though it's like
the static state of things you know if I

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780
the static state of things you know if I
 

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.470
the static state of things you know if I
were if I were going to emphasize

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480
were if I were going to emphasize
 

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.730
were if I were going to emphasize
progression or temporalities more I

00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:58.740
progression or temporalities more I
 

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.490
progression or temporalities more I
would certainly have this appear to be

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500
would certainly have this appear to be
 

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.310
would certainly have this appear to be
more of a

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:04.320
 

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.500
