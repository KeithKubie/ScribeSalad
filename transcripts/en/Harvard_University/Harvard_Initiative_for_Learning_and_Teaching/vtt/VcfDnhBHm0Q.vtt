00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.690
We're going to start
with a moment--

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.220
a few remarks from
Provost Garber.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.970
And I just want to
pause for a second

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.700
and mention that,
when HILT first began,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.070
we did some research on what
makes an initiative like this

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.730
to improve teaching and
learning culture at a university

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.880
successful and what
makes it unsuccessful.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.210
And one of the key
attributes in the literature

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.060
is regular systematic
endorsement

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.770
and championing from the most
senior of our leadership.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.450
And so I just want to say
how lucky and wonderful

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.360
it has been to have
President Faust,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.960
Provost Garber be at
every one of these events.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.870
And it's because of their
care in the teaching

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.590
and learning mission.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.460
And I think it has made a
huge difference symbolically

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.500
and substantively
their interest.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.660
So help me welcome Provost
Garber for a few remarks.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.340
And then I'll come
back, and we'll

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.396
set up the exercise that
we're going to do over lunch.

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:15.294
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.770
Thank you, Erin.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.860
I just want to thank you
Erin and the health team

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.820
for once again organizing
a terrific conference

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.830
on an issue that matters
hugely to Drew, to me,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.730
to basically everybody who cares
about teaching and learning

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.860
at the university, which I
hope means everybody, period.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.890
These meetings have
been really instructive.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.990
They provided a way for people
to get to know each other,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.590
to set up collaborations,
to exchange notes,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.050
basically, about how
they deal with challenges

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.590
of teaching and learning.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.840
And I want to thank all of
you for taking the time out

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.250
of your busy days to be here.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.660
Let me just say briefly
about the topic today,

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.900
about evaluating teaching,
is one that's obviously

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.910
of extraordinary importance.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.250
And I don't know if Tom
Kane is here right now.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.910
But Tom Kane of the
Graduate School of Education

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.620
had very kindly sent me
some of his notes about what

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.360
are the most important
findings from the literature

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.600
on evaluating teachers in
the K through 12 setting.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.700
So there's really a lot there.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.970
There's a quite
a big literature.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.260
And I couldn't possibly do
justice to that literature

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.460
or even to his summary
of that literature.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.980
But one of the things
that really stands out

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.550
as an important finding
is how there is great--

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.390
much greater within
school variation

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.080
in learning outcomes
than across schools.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.110
And there is much greater
within school variation

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.300
in teacher quality.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.230
And furthermore, the teacher
quality, as it's measured,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.330
is fairly persistent.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.630
That is, there tend to be
good teachers and not so good

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.110
teachers.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.550
So if you're a student,
your learning outcomes

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.940
depend, in some respects,
almost as much on which teacher

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.140
you get as in which school
you are assigned to.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.890
And this means that the teacher
is also, from some measures,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.910
more important
than, for example,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.480
the specific curriculum.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.820
So clearly, evaluating
teaching, at least in the K

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.150
through 12 context, is
extraordinarily important

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.020
if you care about
learning outcomes.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.620
Now, I've taught in a variety of
settings in my teaching career.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.450
And they include, of
course, large lectures.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.890
It includes working in a
business school setting, where

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.780
it's highly interactive.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.360
See The grades
for the students--

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.690
I taught at Stanford, but
the rules are the same here--

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.600
50% of the grade is based
on classroom participation.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.190
It's an incredibly
easy, engaging setting

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.740
to work in when you have
those kinds of incentives

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.420
for the students.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.920
I've taught small seminars.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.260
And I've taught in
clinical settings.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.760
And clinical settings,
I mean really

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.250
in medical clinical
settings, where it's

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.600
a small number of students.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.390
It's highly Socratic.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.710
You know whether they understood
either what they've read,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.650
what they've seen in a patient,
or what you've told them--

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.630
you know almost instantly.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.310
There's no hiding it.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.460
And in each of those
settings, the teaching task

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.140
is somewhat different.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.490
And the evaluation tests--
the quality of teaching,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.780
is typically measured
in different ways.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.250
In clinical settings,
although it's

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.980
possible to be
evaluated by someone

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.440
other than a student
or a trainee,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.690
it's a little more difficult
than in lecture settings.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.020
One of the other things
I learned in my career

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.550
is basically how there's huge
variation in how different

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.392
parts of the university
evaluate teaching.

00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:25.100
And here, I don't
really want to bring up

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.320
any embarrassing facts.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.890
But suffice it to say
that in this regard,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.480
I think business schools--

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.980
and I use the plural
here, because I

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.660
think this is common--

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.760
sort of set the
standard, in that

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.260
faculty sit in on
lectures or the teaching

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.690
sessions of other faculty.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.750
That's part of the
promotion review process.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.800
And they get feedback.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.790
And even in very
large courses, it's

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.880
quite possible that
faculty members will never

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.350
have their teaching evaluated
by another faculty member.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.380
Of course, we do have student
evaluations of faculty

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.140
all the time.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.150
But it's really
not quite the same

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.730
as knowing that your
promotion, for example,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.430
depends on the views
of your colleagues

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.110
on the faculty in
the department.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.500
One of the other findings
that Tom mentioned from the K

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.070
through 12 literature is
that, not only do people not

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.230
like to be evaluated--

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.840
not a particularly
surprising result, I know--

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.260
but in fact, they don't
actually-- a typical faculty

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.340
member or a lecturer of
any kind isn't typically

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.830
aware of what they're
doing wrong or right.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.370
And they have memories of
their sessions teaching

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.640
that don't necessarily
comport with what

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.170
the students have observed.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.900
And in fact,
according to Tom, this

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.240
is why video is so
important in helping

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.720
teachers of any kind to
understand how they're doing.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.920
Because with video, depending
on what the video focuses on,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.790
you can start to see
how the students have

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.740
kind of blank stares
at a certain point.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.020
You can actually see how the
faculty member did not directly

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.430
answer the question
that the student asked.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.580
A lot of this, it's not
that people are exactly

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.250
self-deluding, but
we aren't wired

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.860
to sort of process
this information

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.720
and be objective about it.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.260
But we can't deny it when
it's put in front of us

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.920
in the form of a video
of the teaching session.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.540
So it's tremendously important.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.760
And here, let me just mention
something that many of you

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.450
know about.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.980
And it has to do with
HarvardX and edX.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.780
And of course, both HarvardX
and HILT, as well as

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.970
research operations
sit in the Vice Provost

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:04.390
for Advances in Learning's
office, Peter Bol's office.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.390
We started edX in--

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.460
we actually formally
announced the creation

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.920
of edX and HarvardX in 2012.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.310
But it had its roots
really in 2011.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:23.590
And I arrived here as
provost in the fall of 2011.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.810
And there was a
committee that existed

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:31.240
at the time I arrived called
something like Harvard at 400.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.840
So we were just about to
have the 375th anniversary

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.770
of the founding
of the university.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.289
And this committee was thinking
about what Harvard should

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.929
look like in 25 more years.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.090
And for some reason,
they had gravitated

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.050
more and more toward the
importance of online learning

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.780
and to the opportunities
it represented.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.570
As part of this
process, the committee

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.210
invited a couple of professors
from MIT to meet with them.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.760
MIT at the time--

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.170
still has-- they had the
OpenCourseWare initiative,

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.090
which was a very
broad initiative.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.250
I know many of you are
very, very familiar with it.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.230
But it includes online learning,
all kinds of course materials.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.750
But there were videos
of MIT faculty teaching.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.690
And these MIT
professors said, you

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.030
know what's really interesting
about this experience

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.270
of OpenCourseWare?

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.220
For the first time, when we
put our classes out there

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.630
on the web, the whole world, of
course, could see our lectures,

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.030
but our colleagues
could see us lecture.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.500
And they talked about what
a profound effect that had

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.480
on how they approached
their teaching.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.550
They cared in a different way.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.130
So, of course, the
light bulb went on.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.360
And I heard this.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.900
Members of the Harvard at
400 committee heard this.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.310
And I realized that this
new set of technologies

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.000
that we called online learning,
and later it was about MOOCs--

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.410
the terminology really
doesn't matter, could not only

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:13.000
change how we make what we have
to teach available to students

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.120
broadly, it would
actually change

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.340
how we approach teaching
in our classrooms.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.920
So think about the video.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.250
This is like the typical video
taken to the n-th degree,

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.860
because when you do a
formal online course--

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.730
and this really was taken
to a whole other level when

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.840
we created HarvardX, where we
have production teams helping

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.620
with these courses, all kinds
of scrutiny at multiple levels--

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.620
you have a kind of evaluation
that you would rarely, if ever,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.510
see in a typical
classroom setting.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.610
And in fact, this
is one of the things

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:49.840
we're trying to measure--

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.940
how our efforts
with online learning

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.550
are affecting
teaching on campus.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.090
Not every faculty member
who does an online course

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.230
has the same reaction.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.660
But we've heard from
several of them.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.100
People who had very
high ratings as teachers

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.320
in their regular
courses, they talk

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.780
about how the experience has
transformed their approach

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.370
to teaching.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.530
So I've spent a little more
time talking about that

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.620
than I really intended to.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.760
But the bottom line for
me is that we really

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.910
need to think about the
forms of evaluation that

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.630
are feasible that
people who lecture

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.170
and who teach in other settings,
other than lecture halls,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.830
will find acceptable, that
they will participate in,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.970
and how they can incorporate
them into their teaching.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.370
Of course, we care
about content.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.030
Of course, we care about
learning styles, and so on.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.850
But fundamentally, if
we don't figure out

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.390
how to improve our teaching, we
will now make all the progress

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.240
that we might in enabling
our students to learn.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.300
So thank you, again,
for participating

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.760
in today's events.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.810
This is-- obviously,
your work is

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.720
central to the mission
of the university.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.690
And I very much look forward
to hearing the outcomes

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.530
of today's conference.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.720
Thank you and enjoy.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.770
