00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:49.100
food systems so my concluding remarks
 

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.530

therefore is that if we're serious about

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:50.540
therefore is that if we're serious about
 

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.480
therefore is that if we're serious about
a transformation to a sustainable future

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:52.490
a transformation to a sustainable future
 

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.990
a transformation to a sustainable future
it is about sustainable and healthy food

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000
it is about sustainable and healthy food
 

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.230

get it right for people and planet thank

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:07.670

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.330
