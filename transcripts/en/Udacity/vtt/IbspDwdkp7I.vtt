00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.150
Configuration is also
connected to classification.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.696
In case of classification, you establish
and then define, establish and

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:07.680
then define.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.620
In case of configuration,
you're going to extension the plan,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.870
assign the values to the variables,
refine and expand.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.750
Extension the plan, assign values to
the variables, refine and expand.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.988
Second configuration leverages
classification's notion of prototypical

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:21.940
concepts.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.760
So the hierarchy of plans
is organized around these

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.120
prototypical notions of
a components of a chair.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.750
A chair typically consists of legs, and
seats, and arms, and back, and so on.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.350
The ranges of values that these
variables can take are also part of

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.810
a prototypical knowledge of
various components of a chair.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.690
In fact they are part of the default
value of this particular component.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.010
Clearly there are also differences
between classification and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.090
configuration.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.020
We use classification to make
sense of the world by mapping

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.120
combinations of precepts
into equivalence classes.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.790
We use configuration to act on
the world by designing actions.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.280
&gt;&gt; So it sounds to me like while
classification is a way of making sense

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810
of the world, configuration is
a way of creating the world.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.170
With classification, we perceive
certain details in the world and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.970
decide what they are.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.880
With configuration,
we're given something to create and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.760
we decide on those individual variables.
