00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
Destin: "You wanna do it,  yeah, do it"

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.490
"Very good"

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.899
"Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.339
Smarter Every Month... day! Smarter Every Day"

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.000
"If you've never had four children you know

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.450
that four children are a handful."

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.820
"Today on smarter every day my wife and I decide,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.580
well, here let me just show you what the deal is."

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.730
"Question. Question time. What is the most

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.130
important relationship in our family?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.540
Kids:  "Mom and Dad"

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.760
Destin: "Why?"

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.180
Kids: "cause if y'all break up, we won't be a family anymore"

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.800
Destin: "Is that going to happen?"

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.500
Kids: "Nope"

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.460
Destin: "Why?"

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.260
Kids: " 'cause of strong relationships"

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.240
Destin: "Why are you sayin that? Did I tell you to say that?"

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.560
Kids: "No"
Destin: "Okay that's just the way it is?"
Kids: "Yep"

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.340
(Destin's whoosing noise and excited child's noise)

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.480
Destin: "Okay, so, today on Smarter Every Day we're

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.100
going to go to Iceland because my wife

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040
and I want to go on aniver.."

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.340
(to child) "You wanna jump?"

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.200
"We want to go on an anniversary adventure,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.260
somewhere we haven't been before and we

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.120
don't know the culture.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.740
So after talking with John Green who said Iceland is a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.620
really great place to go, we decided to go.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.840
So let's go get Smarter Every Day in Silfra, Iceland where

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.180
you can scuba dive between the continents."

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.180
(Narrating) Kids make it really hard to travel but

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.750
every once in a while we get to go on a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.150
trip that's just us. It's like going on

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820
an adventure with your best friend.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.340
Anyway, we love iceland as a choice

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.880
because we didn't know the language,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.380
we didn't know the culture - we had to figure

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.090
all that stuff out together.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.560
One thing I really like every time I go

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.360
to a new country is to experience the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.159
currency for the first time because that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.630
tells you a little bit about the people.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.750
Destin: "Lady with funny hat is 40 dollars"

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.060
Destin: "Dude with big nose"
Tara: "80" dollars

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.640
Destin: (shocked) "This is 80 dollars? This is not 80 dollars"

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.220
(Narrating) We usually plan everything out but in this case we

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.120
only booked one thing which is diving at Silfra.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.680
Everything else we play by ear

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.880
which is pretty easy because Iceland is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.229
crazy beautiful.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.330
We saw geysers, we rode four wheelers, we

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.040
picked up hitchhikers, we visited several

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.229
waterfalls - which by the way I recorded

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.790
for the new channel called The Sound

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.140
Traveler. If you're interested go check

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.430
it out I think you'll really enjoy it.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.670
Anyway it was great, and for me the common

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.590
theme was connecting with my wife and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.119
strengthening the foundation for our

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.220
family; and it's pretty easy to tell by

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.690
looking at her eyes here that that

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.790
seemed to work.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.790
Right so Iceland is cold,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.380
like really really cold and we're about

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.760
to go diving here. This spot for example

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.709
is just a few dozen miles from where our dive

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.840
site is and those are icebergs.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.370
I mean they're beautiful but like,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.700
icebergs touching this water and knowing

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.930
I'm going to get into it made me

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.820
appreciate seals on a completely different level.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.340
Tara: "They can shut off blood flow to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.080
certain areas in order to preserve... vital areas.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.560
does that makes sense?"
Destin: "Yeah"

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.340
Destin: "Do you remember plate tectonics from like

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.880
elementary school? We're at a place called

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.820
Silfra and this is where the North

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.250
American plate and the Eurasian plate

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.590
which is on the other side of this

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.610
valley here this is where they meet.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.370
And so we're about to go dive... where?

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.870
Point out to me."

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.880
Tara: "Ooh. Out there, second patch of cars."

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.120
(Narrating) The North American plate and the Eurasian Plate

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.200
are pulling apart and these divergent

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.080
plates or what's called the mid-Atlantic ridge.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.600
Long story short this is why we

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.439
have Iceland and it's why you have both

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.290
glaciers *and* volcanoes in the exact same

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.830
area creating some incredible rock formations.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.450
Silfra is right in the middle of this.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.390
This is our divemaster Tebow.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.270
He explained that because Silfra is fed by

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.840
glacier water that's been filtered

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.730
through volcanic rock for over 30 years

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.859
before it reaches the site, it's one of

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.659
the highest visibility dives in the world.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.960
Just as a point of reference this

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.319
is the visibility my friend and I

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.090
experienced during a shipwreck dive in

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.500
the Gulf of Mexico earlier this year.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.100
It's really neat but you can only see a

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.329
few meters in front of your face.

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.500
Tebow said we're going to experience

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.209
over a hundred metres of visibility at

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.639
Silfra which is crazy. By the way, if

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.919
Jared and I were still cold in wet suits

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.620
80-foot below the Gulf of Mexico in summer,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.540
how on earth are Tara and I going to

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.040
survive 80-foot below the icy waters of Silfra?

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.020
The answer is a drysuit. Water has a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.519
thermal conductivity of 0.58 watts

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.479
per meter kelvin, while air is only 0.024.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.280
That means if you're in direct contact

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.540
with the water you lose heat out of

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.500
your body over 20 times faster than if

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.920
you can put a small air gap between you and the water.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.080
Because of the simple heat transfer equation,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.800
this little air gap and some fuzzy pajamas are all you

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.480
need to protect yourself from rapid heat loss and hypothermia.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.780
Destin: "Alright so this is the first time I've

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.150
ever had to stay dry before I went scuba

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.080
diving because we're getting in a dry suit.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.860
And we just met Scott today, hey Scott!"

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.500
Scott: "Hey, how's it going?"

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.140
(laughter)

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.020
(narrating) It's important not to compromise the air

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.800
gap, so you have a really tight seal around

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.539
your wrist and neck so you don't spring

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.729
a leak. The gloves and hood you put on however

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.560
intentionally fill with water and your

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.840
own body heat heats that water up which

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.080
eventually becomes somewhat tolerable.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.340
This dive is commonly called 'The Dive

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.440
Between the Continents'.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.540
Check out how beautiful this is.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.340
(narrating) It was super fun to learn about dry suit

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.639
diving together and it was even more

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.580
special to do it in an incredibly awesome

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.419
place like Silfra. Just like our

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:44.919
marriage, it's two totally different

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.960
forces that come together in this one

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.150
spot and make something beautiful.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.470
A lot of people don't know this but Tara

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.600
has more science degrees than I do.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.919
She's a hundred percent on board with

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.540
everything I do to try to get smarter,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.860
and that's huge!

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.120
I think it's clear that this channel

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.300
wouldn't be possible without her support.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.960
So happy anniversary baby.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.880
I really miss doing stuff like this with you

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.780
aaaand back to the kids... and real-life.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.620
"Okay, I hope you enjoyed this episode of

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.580
Smarter Every Day.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.440
Family's important which is why today's

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.240
sponsor is Kiwi Crate. You know how this

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.639
stuff works. A company approaches a

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:17.560
YouTube channel and asks to advertise.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.510
Well this is backwards, I like this

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.370
company so much because we got them for

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.740
Christmas one year, and we love them so I

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.180
asked them if they would let me

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.560
advertise for them on Smarter Every Day,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.140
and they said yes so today what do we have,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.740
what are those?"

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.860
Kids: "Kiwi Crate!"

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.200
Destin: "Why are you excited about the Kiwi Crate?"

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.480
Kids: "Because they're so fun"
Destin: "Koala Crate, who's that?

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.680
"Who's the Koala crate?

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.220
Why'd you go for the blue one?"

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.160
because its mine

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.360
Destin: "A doodle crate.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.250
Ok so anyway, kiwi crate is a really,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.050
really cool service because it gets kids

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.729
involved - they have to do things with

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:50.200
their hands so they have to think and

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.789
then they have to do, which I'm all for

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:53.710
on Smarter Every Day. I recommend the tinker

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.360
crate it's my favorite however, my

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.979
daughter said she likes the doodle crate.

00:07:56.979 --> 00:07:59.510
You sure you don't like the tinker crate? "
Child: "I like the doodle crate"

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.730
Destin: "She likes the doodle crate.  so if you'd like

That's it!  I'm Destin you're getting Smarter Every Day

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.180
have a good one.  Anything you want to say?"

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.320
Kids: "They're awesome"

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.000
Destin: "Are they really? You're not just saying this?"

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.640
Child: "It gives you more family time"

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.560
Destin: "So, all your skin, you pull it up above this seal

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.610
right here and ends up making an

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.850
incredible double chin like this."

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:32.870
Tara: "the North American plate"

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.820
Destin: "And what is this over here?"

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.800
Tara: "The Euro-Asian plate"
Destin: "Eurasian. we've said that

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.400
