Vsauce. Today on my subway ride into work I

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.080
earned the very final star I needed in
Angry Birds.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.160
But I know what you're thinking.
"Michael, I don't care. I want things I can do

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.990
online now, gosh!"
DONG. Let's begin

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.550
with Leanback. That's right, there's a
brand new episode of Vsauce Leanback

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.970
out today.
It's a television-length playlist

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.480
full of - this week - optical illusions.
You can start it by clicking the link

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.189
at the very top of this video's description.
'Idotidot2' pointed me to How Many

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.180
Of Me, where you can type in your name and find
out how many people in the US

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.449
have your same name. Now, if you wanna two games at
once, be like 'tjockislol'

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.949
and become Mario until you press the
spacebar and begin

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.000
Tetris to strategically help Mario.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.420
Want more pep? Well, be like 'DEEMEMH' and use GoBarbra.com

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.050
to make Duck Sauce's song about whatever you want. For instance:

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.360
"I'm watching DONG."

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.219
Too fast? Slow down with 'Erinbunny1's' reminder
of this oldie

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.689
in B-flat. Every embedded video is in the
same key,

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.220
so you can pick and choose which ones to
bring in

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.360
and when. 'Yorkerbird434' turns up the
violence with a Whack Rebecca Black game

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.750
built like YouTube.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.170
Throw her for points and if you kinda feel bad or

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.570
weird, don't work. 'MochaholicPuppy' thinks you're a licensed toy

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.470
and animal psychologist. This site let's you
evaluate toys and even administer

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.430
drugs.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.990
Last week I showed off a game that let's
you compose music with dots

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.210
and 'sofusser' created an entire Vsauce symphony.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.310
'Sofusser' also made some pretty sweet
designs on World of Text, so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.510
check them out.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.880
Last week I also talked about some work
from Mister

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.160
Doob. 'Gaigaigoo' said whoa, whoa, whoa,
there's more Stevens.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.040
And there is. Mr. Doob has made a lot
of awesome things, like this page you can

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.229
drag images into

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.420
right from your computer and then watch them warp and twist.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.979
Click to cause a whole new
transformation. He also built a sweet

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.440
browser-based fullscreen cloud simulator

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.680
you can fly through by moving your
cursor around.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.800
But what your browser really needs is
balls and he brought those too.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.140
This site of his gives you balls you can pick
up and throw, but you can also grab the actual

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.400
browser window

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.840
and give it a shake.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.459
I leave you with something very special.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.790
This link will take you to a video
were you can listen to what's known as

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.060
the IMG

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.680
montage music in its entirety. You now
have the power to make anything in your

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.150
life

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.050
an instant IMG montage. Of course what you
really want to do

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.440
is watch today's new episode of Vsauce Leanback all

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.709
about optical illusions sourced from all
over YouTube.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.190
It's a really cool collection and I'm having a lot of fun making them, so check it out.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.420
And as always,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.680
thanks for watching.
