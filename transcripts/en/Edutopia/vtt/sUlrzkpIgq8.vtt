00:00:02.486 --> 00:00:05.976
&gt;&gt;Human beings are born storytellers.

00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:07.226
We're communicators.

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:10.916
That's in our DNA, the need to
reach out and to communicate.

00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:15.536
And we do it through voice, we do it
through gesture, all those things.

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:20.726
But if you think about it, human
communication is gone in an instant.

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:24.616
My voice is gone in an instant,
this gesture's gone in an instant.

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:27.806
So, we've been creating technology

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:31.176
to extend communication
across time and space.

00:00:31.816 --> 00:00:34.946
Writing, at the base, is technology.

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:41.276
It's something we have created to
extend communication into the future.

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:46.526
So, new digital tools, internet
technology, it's the next leap,

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:51.216
maybe a quantum leap, maybe an
evolutionary leap, in the technology

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:53.986
that we've created to
communicate and to work together.

00:01:02.086 --> 00:01:05.396
&gt;&gt;So, thinking about this evolution,
I always think about three things

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:09.096
that even in my lifetime
have dramatically changed.

00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:13.136
One thing is I can remember
when I was a kid it used to be

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:17.346
that the writer made the words, the
writer handed them to a new person,

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:18.726
that new person was an editor.

00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:22.786
That editor was followed
by a publisher, a designer,

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:26.336
someone who distributed and
marketed and circulated the book.

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:31.076
Well, all of these professional
niches now can be done

00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:34.516
by one person using
new digital tools.

00:01:35.286 --> 00:01:38.286
We can create content,
we can design it,

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:40.486
we can circulate it,
we can promote it.

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:42.496
We can do the whole package.

00:01:49.326 --> 00:01:51.916
&gt;&gt;Two, we can control
our own publication.

00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:56.746
Anybody can circulate
content to any other person

00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:00.056
if they're connected via the
internet, point to point,

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:02.576
one computer to one
computer, anywhere.

00:02:02.896 --> 00:02:06.246
So, we don't have to go through
controlled channels anymore.

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:09.096
We can share with and learn

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:11.556
from anybody else connected
to the internet.

00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:20.536
&gt;&gt;And the third thing I think
of is the opportunity actually

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:25.186
to link those computers together
to collaborate among people,

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:30.456
to create ever more sophisticated
maps of content, pieces of content,

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:31.876
to build knowledge together,

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:35.066
even if actually we've never
met and may never meet.

00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:39.416
All of these things have
very low barriers of entry.

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:42.746
So, actually, these things,

00:02:42.886 --> 00:02:47.576
which just a few years ago could
only be done by professionals

00:02:47.576 --> 00:02:51.436
after long periods of apprenticeship
with really expensive equipment,

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:53.346
now can be done by anybody.

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:55.976
They can be done by children.

00:02:56.656 --> 00:02:58.196
They can be done by adults.

00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:01.386
They can be done in
school or out of school.

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:06.276
So, the capacity to be able to do
ever-more sophisticated writing

00:03:06.856 --> 00:03:10.026
at ever-younger ages,
it's just there.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.326
It's just in front of us.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:23.896
&gt;&gt;Well, just because, of course,
the tools that we use to write

00:03:23.896 --> 00:03:26.456
and publish might be
getting ever-easier

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:30.476
to use doesn't mean writing
itself is any easier.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:36.246
To write well really means to really
think about purpose and audience,

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:40.956
to be able to really have
credibility, to study, to prepare,

00:03:40.956 --> 00:03:42.756
to be able to put something out there

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:47.056
that really represents something
significant that you want to say.

00:03:47.256 --> 00:03:50.996
And that's no easier just
because the tools we use

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:53.856
to make it might be
getting easier to use.

00:03:57.196 --> 00:04:02.326
&gt;&gt;So, now that we can all actually
see our writing be published we

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:06.176
probably have to engage with the
fact that we really are writers.

00:04:06.886 --> 00:04:11.636
When we put something on YouTube
we really are a video maker.

00:04:11.796 --> 00:04:14.736
When we build a website we
really are a content publisher.

00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:18.476
And so that means we actually have
to be much more attentive to craft.

00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:21.476
We really have to take
more responsibility

00:04:21.476 --> 00:04:21.976
for what we put out there.

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:28.496
&gt;&gt;That's a change I think.

00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:32.006
And with that craft comes
actually the knowledge

00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:34.046
of some new kinds of writing.

00:04:34.356 --> 00:04:38.686
We certainly still have novels, and
we certainly still have the long form

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:41.576
in journalism, and people who
make their living as authors,

00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:46.006
but when I edit a Wikipedia entry
I'm actually thinking a little

00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:47.286
differently about my writing.

00:04:47.736 --> 00:04:52.786
I'm thinking both about what I want
to say, but how what I'm writing fits

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:55.316
in this amazingly larger context.

00:04:56.106 --> 00:04:58.856
So, the sense that I'm a
participant and a contributor,

00:04:59.106 --> 00:05:02.936
as opposed to a kind of lone,
solitary author, is really different.

00:05:03.326 --> 00:05:07.236
And it really means a more
collaborative stance on writers

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:10.986
and more of a sense of
building knowledge together.

00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:25.886
&gt;&gt;The issue in in this really
rapidly changing innovative moment

00:05:25.886 --> 00:05:27.646
in communications technology.

00:05:28.196 --> 00:05:29.646
How do we help students?

00:05:29.646 --> 00:05:34.536
How do we help young people
understand the form, the context,

00:05:34.696 --> 00:05:38.866
the purpose, the potential in
the tools, and get ready to learn

00:05:38.866 --> 00:05:41.096
about that, about ever-new tools?

00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:43.196
It's not what's out there today.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:46.456
For teachers it's not whether you're
using Facebook or Twitter so much

00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:50.226
as it's how are we preparing people
to be able to use what's going

00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:52.826
to be there in five
and ten years from now.

00:05:55.336 --> 00:05:58.036
&gt;&gt;The real core of learning to write

00:05:58.256 --> 00:06:00.856
and teaching writing isn't
actually about the tool.

00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:03.526
It's actually about what you're
going to do with the tool.

00:06:04.146 --> 00:06:09.426
It's about becoming better with
audience, better with purpose,

00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:12.866
better with what I really want
to say, clearer about that,

00:06:12.866 --> 00:06:16.956
more collaborative and able
to make draft by draft,

00:06:16.956 --> 00:06:19.326
iteration by iteration,
something that's better.

00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:22.546
Students can come into school
knowing how to use a pencil,

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:25.966
doesn't mean that that
exhausts everything there is

00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:26.736
in learning to write.

00:06:27.686 --> 00:06:30.106
They can come in learning how
to use, and knowing how to use,

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:33.326
a lot of these social
environments and tools and programs.

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:36.156
We should use that and bring
that into the classroom,

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:38.656
because there's still going to be
something for the teacher to work

00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:42.046
on with the students about getting
better, about getting broader.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:52.776
&gt;&gt;So, we need to be thinking and
teaching, not for today, but for 10,

00:06:52.896 --> 00:06:57.346
20, 50 years from now
when actually we settle

00:06:57.346 --> 00:07:01.446
into a world that's now been
transformed by the internet

00:07:01.626 --> 00:07:03.266
and transformed by digital tools.

00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:08.226
So, the moment to capture is not now,
the moment to capture is the future.
