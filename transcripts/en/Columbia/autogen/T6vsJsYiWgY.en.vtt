so let me start by asking the question

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610
so let me start by asking the question
 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.320
so let me start by asking the question
that I think a lot of us find ourselves

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330
that I think a lot of us find ourselves
 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.570
that I think a lot of us find ourselves
wondering about which is the current

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580
wondering about which is the current
 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.850
wondering about which is the current
generation really different from the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860
generation really different from the
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.799
generation really different from the
earlier generation is it over simplified

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
earlier generation is it over simplified
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.410
earlier generation is it over simplified
to say that people of my age were really

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420
to say that people of my age were really
 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.519

object to the way the world was and try
to change it in that sort of way whereas

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
to change it in that sort of way whereas
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.950
to change it in that sort of way whereas
the current generation is much more

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960
the current generation is much more
 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.810
the current generation is much more
concerned about helping individual

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820

people working within school systems
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.340
people working within school systems
working within not-for-profits but is

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
working within not-for-profits but is
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.190
working within not-for-profits but is
there a difference and if there is a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
there a difference and if there is a
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.639
there a difference and if there is a
difference what brought that about and

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649
difference what brought that about and
 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.500
difference what brought that about and
what is it is there anything in that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
what is it is there anything in that
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.590
what is it is there anything in that
change that that is important for us to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
change that that is important for us to
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.569
change that that is important for us to
know it's also possible it's an

oversimplification or wrong Diane what
do you think so I think what we have now

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
do you think so I think what we have now
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.960
do you think so I think what we have now
is a real pointed ways that service is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
is a real pointed ways that service is
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120
is a real pointed ways that service is
highlighted services encouraged and a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
highlighted services encouraged and a
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950
highlighted services encouraged and a
real pathway for those that choose to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
real pathway for those that choose to
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.280
real pathway for those that choose to
serve I think my position that I am the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
serve I think my position that I am the
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710
serve I think my position that I am the
first I'm New York City's first ever

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
first I'm New York City's first ever
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.140
first I'm New York City's first ever
chief service officer but really I am

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
chief service officer but really I am
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.149
chief service officer but really I am
the nation's first chief service officer

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
the nation's first chief service officer
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.600
the nation's first chief service officer
and we are incredibly excited we meaning

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
and we are incredibly excited we meaning
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.940
and we are incredibly excited we meaning
the mayor's office Mayor Bloomberg to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
the mayor's office Mayor Bloomberg to
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850
the mayor's office Mayor Bloomberg to
have the support of foundations such as

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
have the support of foundations such as
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.410
have the support of foundations such as
Rockefeller where we have reached

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
Rockefeller where we have reached
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.960
Rockefeller where we have reached
recently launched the ability to have a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
recently launched the ability to have a
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.749
recently launched the ability to have a
city's of service and so we plan before

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
city's of service and so we plan before
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.030
city's of service and so we plan before
June for there to be ten other cheap

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
June for there to be ten other cheap
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.390
June for there to be ten other cheap
surface officers across this country and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
surface officers across this country and
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.910
surface officers across this country and
so I don't know if the difference is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
so I don't know if the difference is
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.670
so I don't know if the difference is
fundamentally the people of the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
fundamentally the people of the
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.550
fundamentally the people of the
generation or if it is rather that what

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
generation or if it is rather that what
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.370
generation or if it is rather that what
we are seeing now is an outgrowth of the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
we are seeing now is an outgrowth of the
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.639
we are seeing now is an outgrowth of the
former generations commitment to service

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649
former generations commitment to service
 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.260
former generations commitment to service
and we're seeing the fruits of that but

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
and we're seeing the fruits of that but
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.940
and we're seeing the fruits of that but
you said something that I

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.060
you want my old one you said something I

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070
you want my old one you said something I
 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.699
you want my old one you said something I
think is worth highlighting as possible

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709
think is worth highlighting as possible
 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.090
think is worth highlighting as possible
and that is that the structures that are

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100
and that is that the structures that are
 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.740
and that is that the structures that are
now available to help into service right

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750
now available to help into service right
 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.570
now available to help into service right
really critical to having more of it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
really critical to having more of it
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.000
really critical to having more of it
more now and definitely and they're

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010
more now and definitely and they're
 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.820
more now and definitely and they're
clearer yeah I completely agree with

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830
clearer yeah I completely agree with
 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.729
clearer yeah I completely agree with
that I think what we've seen is an

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739
that I think what we've seen is an
 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.850
that I think what we've seen is an
evolution of the opportunities for

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860
evolution of the opportunities for
 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.059
evolution of the opportunities for
service not only being clarified but

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069
service not only being clarified but
 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.120
service not only being clarified but
being expanded not only service to

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130
being expanded not only service to
 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.729
being expanded not only service to
cities or to our nation but increasingly

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739
cities or to our nation but increasingly
 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.130
cities or to our nation but increasingly
service around the world and those

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140
service around the world and those
 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.970
service around the world and those
mechanisms certainly in my day as an

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980
mechanisms certainly in my day as an
 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.070
mechanisms certainly in my day as an
undergraduate we're simply not available

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080
undergraduate we're simply not available
 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.160
undergraduate we're simply not available
ruin and I think that is one crucial

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170
ruin and I think that is one crucial
 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.590
ruin and I think that is one crucial
issue but I'll go back to Lee's original

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600
issue but I'll go back to Lee's original
 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.250
issue but I'll go back to Lee's original
question and as a well-trained Columbia

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260
question and as a well-trained Columbia
 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.340
question and as a well-trained Columbia
social psychologists say that I really

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350
social psychologists say that I really
 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.550
social psychologists say that I really
do think it's a person's situation

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
do think it's a person's situation
 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.319
do think it's a person's situation
interaction so I think we all are

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329
interaction so I think we all are
 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.560
interaction so I think we all are
products of our times and I do think

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570
products of our times and I do think
 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.670
products of our times and I do think
that in the crucible of the 60s people

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680
that in the crucible of the 60s people
 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.520
that in the crucible of the 60s people
really were burned with a sense that

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530
really were burned with a sense that
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.099
really were burned with a sense that
they could change the world we felt we

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109
they could change the world we felt we
 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.180
they could change the world we felt we
stopped the war we and our actions after

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190
stopped the war we and our actions after
 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.860
stopped the war we and our actions after
that were really very much influenced by

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870
that were really very much influenced by
 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.949
that were really very much influenced by
that set of experiences those who

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959
that set of experiences those who
 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.289
that set of experiences those who
followed in the 70s and 80s had a

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299
followed in the 70s and 80s had a
 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.400
followed in the 70s and 80s had a
different set of experiences and I think

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410
different set of experiences and I think
 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.099
different set of experiences and I think
it made them different in response to

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109
it made them different in response to
 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.660
it made them different in response to
their view of how directly they felt

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670
their view of how directly they felt
 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.690
their view of how directly they felt
they could impact political processes

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700
they could impact political processes
 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.080
they could impact political processes
and political outcomes so that I think

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090
and political outcomes so that I think
 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.660
and political outcomes so that I think
what we started to see at the end of the

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670
what we started to see at the end of the
 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.180
what we started to see at the end of the
last century was people seeking more

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190
last century was people seeking more
 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.970
last century was people seeking more
individualized ways to express their

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980
individualized ways to express their
 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.640
individualized ways to express their
service aspirations because they could

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650
service aspirations because they could
 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.770
service aspirations because they could
see a more tangible causes that's

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780
see a more tangible causes that's
 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.259
see a more tangible causes that's
interesting yeah i tutor and I can

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269
interesting yeah i tutor and I can
 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.750
interesting yeah i tutor and I can
produce this road cop right I asked my

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760
produce this road cop right I asked my
 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.850
produce this road cop right I asked my
government to do something

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860
government to do something
 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.820
government to do something
so I you know and nothing happens anyway

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830
so I you know and nothing happens anyway
 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.660
so I you know and nothing happens anyway
and I think one of the resonances why

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670
and I think one of the resonances why
 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.030
and I think one of the resonances why
young people were so attracted to Barack

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040
young people were so attracted to Barack
 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.030
young people were so attracted to Barack
Obama and why they voted in such record

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040
Obama and why they voted in such record
 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.540
Obama and why they voted in such record
numbers was this return of the view that

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550
numbers was this return of the view that
 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.670
numbers was this return of the view that
maybe you could influence government

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680
maybe you could influence government
 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.880
maybe you could influence government
that government could be there in a way

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890
that government could be there in a way
 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.980
that government could be there in a way
that you could feel would be directly

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990
that you could feel would be directly
 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.550
