well we're always trying to look at the

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990
well we're always trying to look at the
 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.860

world and do better and improve and so
certainly from my point of view I look

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520
certainly from my point of view I look
 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.700
certainly from my point of view I look
at the economic crisis which is unfolded

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710
at the economic crisis which is unfolded
 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.920
at the economic crisis which is unfolded
and say okay well what's the lesson for

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930
and say okay well what's the lesson for
 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.320
and say okay well what's the lesson for
us in this I honestly don't subscribe to

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330
us in this I honestly don't subscribe to
 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.380
us in this I honestly don't subscribe to
the view that the crisis is something

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390
the view that the crisis is something
 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.029
the view that the crisis is something
which should be laid on the doorstep of

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039
which should be laid on the doorstep of
 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.660

MBA programs because we've trained a lot

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670
MBA programs because we've trained a lot
 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.220
MBA programs because we've trained a lot
of the people who will lead is of the

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230
of the people who will lead is of the
 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.770
of the people who will lead is of the
these companies but I do think there's a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780
these companies but I do think there's a
 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.570
these companies but I do think there's a
couple things that I take away from it

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580
couple things that I take away from it
 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.000
couple things that I take away from it
one is around our educational programs

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010
one is around our educational programs
 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.950
one is around our educational programs
but importantly the second thing is

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960
but importantly the second thing is
 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.530
but importantly the second thing is
around our research programs and you

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540
around our research programs and you
 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.130
around our research programs and you
know I think if I think if you look at

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140
know I think if I think if you look at
 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.830
know I think if I think if you look at
what's happened we in the academic world

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840
what's happened we in the academic world
 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.270
what's happened we in the academic world
have done a great job of now

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280
have done a great job of now
 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.160
have done a great job of now
reconstructing well what was it that got

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170
reconstructing well what was it that got
 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.799
reconstructing well what was it that got
us to this point obviously that is of

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809
us to this point obviously that is of
 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.380
us to this point obviously that is of
some value but a far greater value is if

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390
some value but a far greater value is if
 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.090
some value but a far greater value is if
you kind of get out ahead of the curve

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100
you kind of get out ahead of the curve
 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.790
you kind of get out ahead of the curve
so if you try to think about you know

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800
so if you try to think about you know
 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.630
so if you try to think about you know
what academia what is academia

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640
what academia what is academia
 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.400
what academia what is academia
responsibility or job in this I think

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410
responsibility or job in this I think
 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.230
responsibility or job in this I think
it's quite significant because if you

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240
it's quite significant because if you
 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.800
it's quite significant because if you
just arbitrarily say look at the top 25

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810
just arbitrarily say look at the top 25
 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.260
just arbitrarily say look at the top 25
business schools in the country and on

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270
business schools in the country and on
 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.450
business schools in the country and on

average they're going to have about 20
 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.030
average they're going to have about 20
finance faculty members and so right

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040
finance faculty members and so right
 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.450
finance faculty members and so right

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460
there you have 500 academic finance
 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.300

you know that's the you know us as a

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130
you know that's the you know us as a
 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.640
you know that's the you know us as a
research institution our faculty spend

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650
research institution our faculty spend
 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.560
research institution our faculty spend
more of their time doing research then

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570
more of their time doing research then
 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.530
more of their time doing research then
they then they duty teaching so in some

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540
they then they duty teaching so in some
 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.109
they then they duty teaching so in some
sense I think academia you really has

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119
sense I think academia you really has
 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.870
sense I think academia you really has
the responsibility we are in some sense

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880
the responsibility we are in some sense
 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.840
the responsibility we are in some sense
the largest think-tank going we're not

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850
the largest think-tank going we're not
 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.389
the largest think-tank going we're not
biased to any particular point of view

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399
biased to any particular point of view
 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.539
biased to any particular point of view
and so for me the question is how can we

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549
and so for me the question is how can we
 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.910
and so for me the question is how can we
sort of adapt and get ourselves more

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920
sort of adapt and get ourselves more
 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.280
sort of adapt and get ourselves more
into the world of business and having

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290
into the world of business and having
 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.850
into the world of business and having
our research impact day-to-day business

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860
our research impact day-to-day business
 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.910
our research impact day-to-day business
activity and also I think one lesson I

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920
activity and also I think one lesson I
 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.460
activity and also I think one lesson I
take from the recent events is that we

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470
take from the recent events is that we
 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.380
take from the recent events is that we
probably need a title coordination

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390
probably need a title coordination
 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.970
probably need a title coordination
between schools of business and schools

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980
between schools of business and schools
 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.580
between schools of business and schools
of Public Policy that that would be

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590
of Public Policy that that would be
 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.520
of Public Policy that that would be
another

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
another
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.010
another
a good thing for us to be doing so so I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
a good thing for us to be doing so so I
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.309
a good thing for us to be doing so so I
think for us in academia to try to move

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
think for us in academia to try to move
 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.080
think for us in academia to try to move
a little bit more in the direction of

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
a little bit more in the direction of
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.960
a little bit more in the direction of
the world of practice and also finding

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970
the world of practice and also finding
 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.680
the world of practice and also finding
ways to adapt our communication style so

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
ways to adapt our communication style so
 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.250
ways to adapt our communication style so
it's much more timely than is typical in

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
it's much more timely than is typical in
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.470
it's much more timely than is typical in
our in our world of refereed journal

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480
our in our world of refereed journal
 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.720
our in our world of refereed journal
articles to think about G we really want

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
articles to think about G we really want
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.580
articles to think about G we really want
to have impact on the world of practice

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
to have impact on the world of practice
 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.440
to have impact on the world of practice
and this is the way we we should be

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450
and this is the way we we should be
 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.290
and this is the way we we should be
doing it you know the second part of it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
doing it you know the second part of it
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.720
doing it you know the second part of it
this second lesson I take from the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
this second lesson I take from the
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.190
this second lesson I take from the
current economic crisis is if there is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200
current economic crisis is if there is
 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.240
current economic crisis is if there is
one dimension in which i think the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
one dimension in which i think the
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.949
one dimension in which i think the
business model or the educational model

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959
business model or the educational model
 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.740

of most MBA programs in particular could

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
of most MBA programs in particular could
 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.770
of most MBA programs in particular could
use some variation it's really in terms

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
use some variation it's really in terms
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.860
use some variation it's really in terms
of the contact that we have with our

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870
of the contact that we have with our
 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.520
of the contact that we have with our
students and in some sense a typical MBA

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
students and in some sense a typical MBA
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.770
students and in some sense a typical MBA

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780
program now the average age is going to
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.500
program now the average age is going to
be about 26 years old so we have you

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
be about 26 years old so we have you
 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.500
