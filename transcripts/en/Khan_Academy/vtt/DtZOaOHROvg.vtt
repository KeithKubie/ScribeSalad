00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:02.710
- [Voiceover] So we've been
talking about the progress

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.877
of the American Civil War
which started in early 1861

00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:12.590
after the 11 states of the
South, which were slave states,

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:15.807
seceded from the Union

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:18.943
and tried to establish
an independent nation

00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:22.117
known as the Confederate
States of America.

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:23.732
And in the first years of the Civil War

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:26.698
things went relatively well for the South.

00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:30.202
They defeated the North
at the Battle of Bull Run

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:32.818
which was a great surprise to many people

00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:34.569
because they thought
that this was going to be

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:38.736
a pretty short war, that the
South would be quickly defeated

00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:43.246
and scared away into
returning to the Union.

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:45.026
But the South had many advantages

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:46.976
including very good leadership

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:49.467
in the person of Robert E. Lee

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:52.677
and also kind of a home
court advantage at large

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:56.244
since the vast majority of the
war was fought in the South.

00:00:56.244 --> 00:01:00.411
So in this early stage the
Confederacy does quite well

00:01:02.392 --> 00:01:04.101
until we get to Antietam.

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:08.014
And Antietam was this first
foray by Robert E. Lee

00:01:08.014 --> 00:01:12.059
in trying to attack the states
of the North in Maryland.

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:14.267
And after the Battle of Antietam

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:16.949
which was the bloodiest
day in U.S. history,

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:19.726
more than 4,000 Americans
died on that day,

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:20.938
the South was defeated.

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:23.288
And that was a major
turning point in the war

00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:25.531
as we've talked about in previous videos

00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:29.295
in that it led to the
Emancipation Proclamation

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:32.692
and was kind of the moment at
which the nations of Europe

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:36.188
cease to consider intervening
on the side of the South.

00:01:36.188 --> 00:01:37.376
So in the next few videos

00:01:37.376 --> 00:01:40.391
I want to talk about the
later stages of the Civil War.

00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:44.558
So we get into 1863 and the
South is doing relatively well

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.902
here in Virginia, wins the
Battle of Chancellorsville

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:53.650
and now, nearly a year after Antietam

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.733
in June and July of 1863,

00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:00.622
Robert E. Lee decides that
he is going to try again

00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:02.397
to invade the North.

00:02:02.397 --> 00:02:04.511
Now he's several reasons for doing this.

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:06.745
One, is that the war has been taking place

00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:07.909
largely in the South

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.807
so it's summer, people are
trying to harvest their crops

00:02:11.807 --> 00:02:14.055
and Lee wants to give the South a break

00:02:14.055 --> 00:02:17.186
so he wants to take the attention away

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:18.975
from this area in Virginia

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:20.788
where lots of fighting has happened

00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:23.288
and he wants to take the
war up into the North.

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:25.028
And if the North is distracted

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:27.152
by having to defend its own territory

00:02:27.152 --> 00:02:31.461
then it can't go on the
offensive elsewhere as easily.

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:35.211
So Lee's plan is to take
the war to the North

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.187
and Lee has another reason in his sleeve

00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:42.619
which is that he is really hoping

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.786
that in the Election of 1864
which is coming up not too long

00:02:50.902 --> 00:02:54.743
after this period in
mid-1863, many people believe

00:02:54.743 --> 00:02:57.101
that Lincoln is going to
be kicked out of office.

00:02:57.101 --> 00:03:01.005
Now remember, that not a
single American President

00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:03.092
has been elected to a second term

00:03:03.092 --> 00:03:06.592
or reelected since Andrew Jackson in 1832.

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.787
So there's been a 30 year
drought of two term presidents.

00:03:11.787 --> 00:03:14.304
So Robert E. Lee has good reason to expect

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:18.260
why Lincoln might not be reelected in 1864

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.004
and he thinks that maybe
one of Lincoln's competitors

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:26.197
in the Democratic Party,
which will turn out to be

00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:29.262
one of his own former
generals, George B. McClellan

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:31.773
will actually want to end the war

00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:35.006
and make peace with the South.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.065
So there's kind of a
morale aspect to this.

00:03:38.065 --> 00:03:40.764
You can see that many of the
things done in the Civil War

00:03:40.764 --> 00:03:43.735
and especially as we get
into the later stages

00:03:43.735 --> 00:03:46.652
are designed at making
one side or the other

00:03:46.652 --> 00:03:48.859
tired of being at war.

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.557
Now you may wonder why
I'm spending so much time

00:03:51.557 --> 00:03:55.225
talking about battles because
most American History courses

00:03:55.225 --> 00:03:58.554
do not emphasize military
history whatsoever.

00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:01.820
But I think it's important
to keep in mind in this war

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.736
and in some earlier wars
like the American Revolution

00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:08.672
the battles really
determine the policy, right,

00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:12.491
because you can't make
a decree like the way

00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:15.937
that Abraham Lincoln decreed
the Emancipation Proclamation

00:04:15.937 --> 00:04:20.604
if you don't have the force
of military power behind you.

00:04:20.604 --> 00:04:25.213
So winning battles, winning the
war, those kind of victories

00:04:25.213 --> 00:04:28.942
give politicians the
popular mandate they need

00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:30.196
to get things done.

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:31.971
So that's why I think that
it's important to talk,

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.975
at least a little bit, about
the battles of the Civil War.

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:37.650
Now obviously, Bull Run,
Antietam, Gettysburg,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.502
and Appomattox were not the
only battles of the Civil War,

00:04:40.502 --> 00:04:42.560
there were hundreds of
battles of the Civil War

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.579
but I've chosen these as
particular turning points

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:48.795
just to kind of give you
a very brief overview

00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:51.386
of the way that military victories

00:04:51.386 --> 00:04:53.040
and defeats were trending.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.026
Because along with
those military victories

00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:58.275
and defeats went the
policy of the United States

00:04:58.275 --> 00:05:00.281
and the policy of the South.

00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:02.153
And if you're interested in the Civil War

00:05:02.153 --> 00:05:03.922
it's one of the most written about topics

00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:07.210
in American history and there
are many wonderful books

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.932
that will go into great
detail about the politics,

00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:12.869
society, and military
history of the Civil War,

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:15.510
and lots of great television
shows, and miniseries

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.751
that I definitely suggest
that you check out.

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:21.188
All right, well, with that said
let's talk about Gettysburg.

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:24.855
So Lee has brought his
forces into the North

00:05:26.563 --> 00:05:30.730
and, again, he's interested in
kind of distracting the North

00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:34.701
from attacking in the South
by bringing the war to them.

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.849
He's hoping to prolong the war

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.865
so that perhaps another
administration that's more favorable

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:43.793
to allowing the South to go peacefully

00:05:43.793 --> 00:05:45.522
might be in office in the North.

00:05:45.522 --> 00:05:48.690
And the other thing that
he's looking for is supplies

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.690
so once again the vast
majority of the Civil War

00:05:54.285 --> 00:05:57.544
has been fought in the South
and it's been fought here

00:05:57.544 --> 00:06:01.567
in this sort of Shenandoah
Valley, Tidewater region

00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:05.351
of Virginia which is really
the breadbasket of the South.

00:06:05.351 --> 00:06:07.611
So when men are out fighting battles

00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.090
and when battles are
being fought on fields

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.160
instead of crops being grown on them,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.995
there's going to be a serious
dearth of food in the South.

00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:17.396
You know I once heard it said

00:06:17.396 --> 00:06:21.583
that the most salient political
fact of the 20th century

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:23.833
was that the Americans speak English

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.681
which means that the United States

00:06:25.681 --> 00:06:29.658
repeatedly allied with
Britain in 20th century wars.

00:06:29.658 --> 00:06:32.171
But if I had to choose
the most salient fact

00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:35.231
of the American Civil War it might be that

00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:37.100
you can't eat cotton.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.534
You know the South went to war

00:06:38.534 --> 00:06:42.056
to protect its system of labor
so that it could continue

00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:46.223
to produce these cash crops
like cotton or tobacco.

00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:49.891
And cash crops they may be

00:06:51.337 --> 00:06:53.655
which means that you
can sell them for money

00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:55.738
but you can't eat cotton or tobacco.

00:06:55.738 --> 00:06:58.673
And when it comes down to it
being able to feed your troops

00:06:58.673 --> 00:07:00.429
and feed your populace

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:02.126
is something that's
going to really help you

00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:03.998
when it comes to winning a war.

00:07:03.998 --> 00:07:07.178
So Lee is taking his
troops up into the North

00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:11.156
and he takes them into
Southern Pennsylvania

00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:13.832
which is very lovely farmland.

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:16.318
It's a very beautiful place
if you've never been there,

00:07:16.318 --> 00:07:18.638
I absolutely recommend you take a look,

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:21.999
go to Gettysburg it's a very
well preserved battlefield.

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:25.140
And as Lee goes through
Southern Pennsylvania

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.436
his troops are taking
horses, and grain supplies,

00:07:29.436 --> 00:07:33.608
and all sorts of things that
the army needs to survive

00:07:33.608 --> 00:07:35.900
which are in short supply in Virginia.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.695
So this is like a run to the store for Lee

00:07:39.695 --> 00:07:41.200
going through Southern Pennsylvania.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.985
On the Northern side, General George Meade

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:49.152
has been trying to catch
up with Lee and cut him off

00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:52.550
from his invasion of the North.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.289
President Abraham Lincoln
asks for many volunteers

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:59.039
to try to stave off the
invasion of the North by Lee

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:02.755
and they end up meeting at Gettysburg.

00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:05.840
And Gettysburg is just a small farm town

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.334
in Southern Pennsylvania,

00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:10.276
it's just where these
two troops happen to meet

00:08:10.276 --> 00:08:12.043
as Lee was on his way

00:08:12.043 --> 00:08:15.007
to the capital of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg

00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:19.174
and Lee's forces and Meade's
forces meet on July 1st, 1863.

00:08:25.227 --> 00:08:28.307
Now the Battle of Gettysburg
goes on for three days

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:32.508
so there's July 1st,
July 2nd, and July 3rd.

00:08:32.508 --> 00:08:36.645
And the first day goes relatively
well for the Confederates,

00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:40.768
they break some of the Union
lines around the edges.

00:08:40.768 --> 00:08:43.176
The second day is kind of a stalemate

00:08:43.176 --> 00:08:46.020
where Northern forces and Southern forces,

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.787
they sustain a lot of losses

00:08:47.787 --> 00:08:51.284
but don't make any real
headway toward victory.

00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:54.917
And then the third day, Lee
decides that he is going to try

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:57.698
to break the center of the Union forces

00:08:57.698 --> 00:09:00.924
which means that he is going
to try to hit the Union line,

00:09:00.924 --> 00:09:03.576
and remember this is in
the era of military history

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:06.399
where people are still
kind of fighting in lines,

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:09.127
right through the center, and win the day.

00:09:09.127 --> 00:09:11.891
Unfortunately for him
that is not what happens

00:09:11.891 --> 00:09:15.244
so he tries all day to
break the Union lines.

00:09:15.244 --> 00:09:18.750
There's a very famous sort of last hurrah

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.743
for the Southern forces in
this called Pickett's Charge

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:27.910
when General George Pickett's
units charge up this hill

00:09:28.785 --> 00:09:31.499
at Cemetery Ridge trying to break the line

00:09:31.499 --> 00:09:34.902
and they sustain over 50% casualties

00:09:34.902 --> 00:09:37.654
so it's kind of a bloodbath
for Pickett's unit.

00:09:37.654 --> 00:09:40.922
And after Pickett's
Charge does not succeed

00:09:40.922 --> 00:09:43.646
the Union forces have officially won

00:09:43.646 --> 00:09:46.624
the Battle of Gettysburg and Lee realizes

00:09:46.624 --> 00:09:49.148
that there's no way that
he's going to be able

00:09:49.148 --> 00:09:51.667
to make anything out of
his invasion of the North

00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:55.628
and so he turns around and
starts heading back to the South.

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.511
Now what's important about Gettysburg

00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:01.678
is that this was what many
have called the High Water Mark

00:10:02.742 --> 00:10:04.832
of the Confederacy.

00:10:04.832 --> 00:10:06.261
And by that they mean

00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:09.172
this is as far as the
Confederacy ever managed

00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:13.238
to get into the Northern
part of the United States.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:17.031
This is a second attempt at an
invasion by Lee and it failed

00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:20.250
and many people see this as a
really important turning point

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.667
in the Civil War on July 4th.

00:10:25.239 --> 00:10:29.620
And imagine the good news of
receiving word that your troops

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.193
had triumphed on July
4th, Independence Day.

00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:35.221
President Lincoln and the United States

00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:37.401
get another really good piece of news

00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:40.126
which is that Ulysses S. Grant

00:10:40.126 --> 00:10:43.563
who will be the future
commander of U.S. forces

00:10:43.563 --> 00:10:46.813
has succeeded in his siege of Vicksburg

00:10:48.016 --> 00:10:51.584
which is a town on the Mississippi River.

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:54.055
And when he takes the town
on the Mississippi River

00:10:54.055 --> 00:10:56.364
Grant has complete
control of the Mississippi

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.726
which is sort of the
major highway in the West.

00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:02.086
So July 3rd and July
4th are really good days

00:11:02.086 --> 00:11:05.055
for the United States and
this is kind of the moment

00:11:05.055 --> 00:11:07.345
when it becomes clear that victory

00:11:07.345 --> 00:11:10.862
is going to be outside the
reach of the Confederacy.

00:11:10.862 --> 00:11:13.501
And with an unsuccessful
invasion of the North

00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:16.189
and the loss of the
control of the Mississippi,

00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:19.419
the South's time is kind
of coming to an end.

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:21.845
The other important thing
about the Battle of Gettysburg

00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:25.666
is that it is a tremendously
destructive battle,

00:11:25.666 --> 00:11:29.666
about 50,000 casualties
took place at Gettysburg

00:11:30.658 --> 00:11:33.793
which makes it the single bloodiest battle

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:35.715
in American history which is different

00:11:35.715 --> 00:11:38.097
from the single bloodiest
day which was at Antietam

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:39.827
because it took place over three days.

00:11:39.827 --> 00:11:43.380
And this is not 50,000 people
dying, just 50,000 casualties

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.419
which means either deaths or injuries,

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:48.471
those are men who can no
longer fight on both sides.

00:11:48.471 --> 00:11:51.927
So the tremendous loss
of life at Gettysburg

00:11:51.927 --> 00:11:53.914
is going to lead to the foundation

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:57.560
of a cemetery at Gettysburg
to bury these military dead.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.187
And it's going to be in November of 1863,

00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:02.997
just a couple of months after
the Battle of Gettysburg,

00:12:02.997 --> 00:12:07.164
that Abraham Lincoln will visit
the cemetery at Gettysburg

00:12:08.505 --> 00:12:10.513
and deliver the Gettysburg Address,

00:12:10.513 --> 00:12:14.418
one of the most famous orations
in all of American history

00:12:14.418 --> 00:12:16.626
and we'll get to that in the next video.
