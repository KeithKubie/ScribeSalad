00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's take a look at the conservation of charge, very similar to conservation of energy.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Conservation of charge means that the total charge in the universe never changes.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, this doesn't mean it's impossible to, let's say, create a positive charge.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It just means that when we do create a positive charge,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we better create a negative charge to go along with it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In fact, we can refine this definition. Let's make it a little more specific.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's say that the total charge in a closed system never changes

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Well, what does this mean? What's a closed system?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Well, for the purpose of conservation of charge, a closed system means

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that there's no charge being added to or removed from the system.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
For example, let's imagine a metallic sphere. This would be, in this case, a closed system.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Nothing is touching it. It's just hanging out somehow

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and there's no charge being introduced to it and no charge being removed from it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now in reality, this sphere would have to be held by something.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Let's say it's held by some stand and the only important thing

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is that this stand be what's called an insulator.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
An insulator is something which doesn't allow charges to move around inside of it.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But we'll get to that in a bit. Now, this metallic sphere, just like the human body, is made of atoms.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And those atoms contain positive protons and negative electrons.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And let me get rid of some of this stuff, so we can focus on the problem at hand.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I mentioned before that our stand has to be an insulator,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
something in which charges are stuck and can't move.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The other end of the spectrum is a conductor in which electrons are free to move.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now in the case for our conducting sphere, of course, the sphere is a conductor

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and the positive and negative charges in this neutral conductor are perfectly balanced.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I've drawn seven, in reality, they'd be trillions and trillions but what I want to know is,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
let's say, we're somehow able to find a positively charged object.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is a net positive charge and we could bring it close to this conducting sphere.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Can you think about this problem and tell me what would the charge distribution

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in this sphere look like when we bring this charge close?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Which of these pictures best indicates what the charge distribution in this sphere will look like

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
once we've brought a positive charge close to the right-hand side?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now, you have to think about this for a minute. Think of what it means to be a conductor.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Think of what sorts of charges are attracted and repelled?

00:02:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I think you can probably get this one right. Good luck.
