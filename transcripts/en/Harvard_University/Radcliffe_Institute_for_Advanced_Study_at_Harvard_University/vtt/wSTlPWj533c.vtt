00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.390
-Welcome, everybody.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.260
I'm so happy to have you
here, friends and colleagues

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.860
to Radcliffe Day 2016.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.700
And let me just say
before I get started

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.950
that I know it's warm in here.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.730
And I invite you to
take off your jackets.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.560
Do whatever it takes
to be comfortable.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.930
I'm Liz Cohen, Dean of
the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.610
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.740
Radcliffe convenes
faculty and students

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.910
from all of Harvard's schools
and audiences from far

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.740
beyond our gates
to share inquiry

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.950
into the arts, humanities,
sciences, and social sciences.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.530
That is why I am delighted
to welcome so many of you

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.920
today, both here in
Cambridge and online,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.330
to join in our
annual celebration.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.820
I am especially pleased to
welcome Drew Faust, Harvard

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.180
President and Founding
Dean of the Radcliffe

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:15.290
Institute, Provost Alan
Garber, and Bill Lee, Senior

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.330
Fellow of the
Harvard Corporation,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.070
along with other members
of Harvard's governing

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.020
boards, the Harvard Alumni
Association, the Radcliffe

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.400
Deans Advisory Council,
the Schlesinger Library

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.700
Council, the Radcliffe
Associates Program, the Anne

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.330
Radcliffe Society, as well as
past members of the Radcliffe

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.640
College Board of Trustees
and Alumni Association.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.720
We are very excited to have a
United States Attorney General

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.990
Loretta Lynch, class of 1981,
Harvard Law School, class

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:01.620
of 1984 with us today as well.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.740
And, of course, we are
thrilled to have Janet Yellen,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.830
Chair of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:18.740
as our 2016 Radcliffe Medalist.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.970
And a special welcome to former
Chair of the Fed Ben Bernanke

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.530
and to Harvard Professor
of Economics Greg

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.060
Mankiw for helping us pay
tribute to our guest of honor.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.390
Welcome, as well,
to the very few

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.620
of you here today hoping
to get advance word on what

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.400
the Fed will do with interest
rates at its June meeting.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.640
I would like to recognize
the reunion classes of 1941,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:08.390
'46, '51, '56, '61,
'66, '71, '76, '86, '91.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.810
Did I forget one?

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:20.690
'81, '86, '91, '96, 2001,
2006, 2011, and our newest

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:32.340
graduates in the class of 2016.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.310
We also welcome former
Bunting Fellows,

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.020
current and former
Radcliffe Fellows,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.100
and the Harvard
undergraduates who

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.440
so ably serve as our
fellows' research partners.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.660
Everyone, please join me
in congratulating members

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.050
of the earliest class
represented here today,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:04:04.320
the great class of 1939.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.100
All of us gathered
under this tent

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.090
are joined by an even larger
audience watching online.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.710
To the viewers who have told
us that they would be watching

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.269
in Japan and to all of
you tuning in from afar,

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.769
my warmest welcome.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.900
As we come together
on Radcliffe day

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.350
we think of classmates and
friends no longer with us.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.240
Please join me in
a moment of silence

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.855
to honor their memories.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.520
When Elizabeth Cary
Agassiz and her colleagues

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.440
founded Radcliffe
College in 1879,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.060
they knew that the world needed
the best minds, women and men,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.330
working together to forge
a world of action informed

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.290
by ideas.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.140
This mission continues at
the Radcliffe Institute

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.510
for Advanced Study today.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.080
Let me share a few
highlights from the year

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.060
we have just completed.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.600
We have enjoyed more than 50
enlightening presentations

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.300
from Radcliffe Fellows.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.470
To name just three--
anthropologist

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.680
Laurence Ralph discussed
police brutality in Chicago.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.310
Choreographer Karole
Armitage spoke

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.300
about creating meaning
through movement.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.350
And author Michael
Pollan delivered

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.140
an autobiographical talk about
his trajectory as a writer.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.640
An exhibition of feminist poetry
at the Schlesinger Library

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.450
opened with powerful
student readings

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.630
of their own original poems
and the work of acclaimed poets

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.360
like June Jordan and Adrienne
Rich, Radcliffe class of 1951,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.660
whose papers grace the
Schlesinger's collections.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.800
That exhibition entitled
"A Language to Hear Myself"

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.310
is open today and will remain
open through June 17th.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.490
I hope you will make
a point of visiting.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.090
Our annual science symposium
investigated the past, present,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.170
and future of DNA.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.250
While our annual
Gender Conference

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.940
examined the fascinating
and timely topic

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.740
of language and gender.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.230
All year we collaborated
with the Harvard University

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.140
Native-American program
to explore issues related

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.730
to Native Americans in the
US and indigenous peoples

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.090
worldwide.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.260
We organized new
research projects,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.240
compelling public events, a
major conference, performances,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.460
and more.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.720
An exhibition
featuring photographs

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.430
of Native American
women is on display

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.030
in the Johnson-Kulukundis
Gallery in Byerly Hall.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.520
Please stop by
after lunch today.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.120
This exhibit is
the most recent use

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.360
of our newly renovated
gallery, which we just

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.910
opened this academic year.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.910
We had high hopes
that this new space

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.900
would provide a creative
laboratory for experimentation

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.590
and original expression by
a wide circle of artists

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.070
and scholars.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.230
It has fulfilled those
hopes from the very first

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.930
installation, by Team Lab, an
innovative Japanese collective

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.740
of computer scientists
and artists.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.120
Since then, Radcliffe
Fellows, including

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.170
filmmakers and a composer,
have shared their work

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.710
in the gallery.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.220
More information and videos
of this year's exhibitions

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.660
and events are on our website.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.570
And ambitious plans are
under way for next year.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.090
We'll be holding conferences
on subjects ranging

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.380
from the world's endangered
oceans to gender and sports,

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.070
and from the international
refugee crisis to slavery

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.830
and universities.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.890
The Schlesinger
Library will continue

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.960
to diversify its holdings
by collecting even more

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.200
archives of
individuals and groups

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.850
whose stories contribute to a
fuller picture of US history.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.310
We will hold a panel
discussion about the challenges

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.470
and rewards of collecting
the papers of one such group,

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.830
political conservatives.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.680
Our fellowship
program will welcome

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.360
more than 50 new
Fellows, coming here

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.140
from six continents,
who will pursue

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.850
an astonishing
array of projects,

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.470
from novels and operas to the
history of the civil rights

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.460
movement, to epigenetics
and black holes.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.330
The support of many of you
right here in this tent

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.610
makes all of these
programs possible.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.159
We are in the midst
of a major capital

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.910
campaign for Radcliffe's
future, expertly

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.665
chaired by Sid Knafel
and Susan Wallach.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:04.810
More than 6,300 households
have made over 17,000 gifts,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.120
totaling $55 million dollars.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.410
We are approaching 80%
of our $70 million goal.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.670
And I am especially grateful
and proud that our donors come

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.000
from all 13 Harvard schools,
50 states, 23 countries,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.190
and every class since 1933.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.600
When Elizabeth Cary
Agassiz founded Radcliffe

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.880
with her vision of the world's
best minds leading together,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.230
she also had the
courage to imagine women

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.660
at the helm of that world.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.320
I think she would be very
pleased to see us awarding

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.490
the Radcliffe Medal
today to the individual

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.160
that CNN and NBC News have
called "the most powerful woman

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.150
in the world."

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.410
She went like that.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:08.460
Janet Yellen was born and
raised in Brooklyn, New York.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.580
Her mother was a former teacher.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.050
Her father was a
family doctor, who

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.560
saw patients at home, a
common practice at the time.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.250
Many patients were dock
workers and their families.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.450
These working families
made a deep impression

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.250
on the young Janet, because
dock work, by its nature,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.570
was vulnerable to economic
fluctuation, which

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.810
meant frequent periods
of unemployment.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.920
From her earliest
memories, she understood

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.785
that its effects
were, in her words,

00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:44.330
"simply terrible on the mental
and physical health of workers,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.970
on their marriages, and on
their children," end quote.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.880
The human effects of the
labor market and the urge

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.510
to do something about
them would go on

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.840
to shape Yellen's
remarkable career.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.140
Growing up, Janet Yellen
excelled at everything.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.830
As Editor-in-Chief of the Fort
Hamilton High School newspaper,

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.940
she was charged with the duty
of interviewing the senior class

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.870
valedictorian, which
turned out to be a very

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.060
awkward assignment.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.580
As you've guessed, she
was the valedictorian.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.350
So she interrogated herself.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.370
Her first tongue-in-cheek
cheek question began with,

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.600
I understand that
you are a versatile,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.672
attractive, talented, senior.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:39.300
The real question was, with so
much talent in so many areas,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.090
which direction would she go?

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.650
That question was answered
in her first semester

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.330
at Pembroke, which was then
the women's college at Brown

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.320
University and a sister
school to Radcliffe College.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.200
In her first economics class,
Janet Yellen found her calling.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.210
Years later, she explained, "I
remember sitting in that class

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.490
and learning about how there
were policy decisions that

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.190
could have been taken
during the Great Depression

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.180
to alleviate all
that human suffering.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.330
That was a real
aha moment for me.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.190
I realized that public
policy can and should

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.690
address these problems."

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.250
Yellen graduated summa
cum laude and went on

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.870
to earn her PhD in
Economics from Yeah in 1971.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.440
She was deeply influenced
by her professors

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.790
there to study how government
action can mitigate hardships,

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:38.530
especially unemployment,
caused by market cycles.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.550
Yellen was inspired to
undertake scholarship

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.420
that met the highest
intellectual standards

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.280
and held the potential to
improve people's lives.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.020
She adhered to that
ideal as she embarked

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.350
on a career that tacked back
and forth between academia

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.250
and public service.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.870
After graduating
from Yale, Yellen

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.950
taught economics
here at Harvard,

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:06.800
until she went to work for
the Federal Reserve in 1977.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.020
One day, she met another
economist, George Akerlof

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.070
in the Fed cafeteria.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.750
They hit it off immediately,
married the following year,

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.360
and took jobs at the
London School of Economics.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.370
In 1980, the couple
moved to California

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.560
to teach at UC Berkeley.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.270
There they wrote some of
their most influential work,

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.290
both individually
and collaboratively.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.740
One of their most renowned
jointly authored papers

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.380
analyzed why wages sometimes
exceed market minimums.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.830
Yellen and Akerlof
showed, in contrast

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.900
to the standard
theory, that it may

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.550
be in an employer's
economic interest

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.520
to pay higher wages
because workers labor

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.330
harder and do better work
when they feel valued.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.560
Another one of Yellen's and
Akerlof's significant findings

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.810
grew out of a different
sort of collaboration--

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.610
the birth of their son Robert.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.220
The new parents were
looking for childcare

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.370
and thinking about their budget.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.910
Yellen remembered vividly, "when
you hire a nanny, the question

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.600
you ask yourself is, what's
best for my precious child?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.430
And do you really
want someone who

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.900
feels that your motive in
life is to minimize the amount

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.010
you spend on your child?"

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.360
That experience taught
them that hiring a nanny

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.970
is not the time to
hoard your pennies,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.720
no matter what the
market dictates.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.200
They went on to support
this important insight

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.970
with a wealth of data
and rigorous analysis,

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.320
but their key
contribution was to show

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.220
that you can consult
all the models, graphs,

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.960
and numbers that you want.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.090
But unless you take into account
both workers' and employers'

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.360
non-rational motivations,
including emotions,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.710
you will not be able to predict
or explain the labor market.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.460
In 1994, Yellen took
leave from Berkeley

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.630
to join the Federal
Reserve Board of Governors.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.340
Upon arrival, she
raised eyebrows

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.680
with a habit that
was out of step

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.210
with other senior managers--
eating in the employee

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.940
cafeteria.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.420
By eating there,
Yellen learned what

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.480
staff members were thinking.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.110
She also communicated
an openness

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.760
and a transparency that have
been hallmarks of her tenure

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.360
at the Fed.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.640
Yellen served on the
Federal Reserve Board

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.900
of Governors until 1997
and then on the White House

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.610
Council of Economic Advisers
under President Bill Clinton

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.170
from 1997 to '99.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.200
She returned to
teaching briefly,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.770
before becoming President and
CEO of the Federal Reserve

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.790
Bank of San Francisco in 2004.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.230
That same year she
published an important paper

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.080
with Akerlof that offered a
robust defense of government

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.200
action to avoid recession
and to offset the effects

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.440
of economic downturn.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.260
Now, scholars love to be timely.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.450
But nobody realized
how painfully relevant

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.610
that paper would
soon prove to be.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.960
As 2004 drew to a close,
unemployment rested comfortably

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.300
between 5% and 5 and 1/2%.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.560
The stock market ran high.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.450
Housing market was hot.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.790
Corporate earnings
were climbing.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.290
But as Yellen watched it
all from the Federal Reserve

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.710
Bank of San Francisco, she
started warning of a bubble

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.440
in the housing market.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.670
Hers was a lonely voice.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.090
But as we now know,
she was right.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:44.120
The worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression unleashed

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.970
its fury in the fall of
2008, and what we now call

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.140
the Great Recession, followed.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.570
Unemployment nearly doubled.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.210
Stocks plummeted.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.790
Housing prices went
into free fall.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.990
Soon nearly 1/3 of
homeowners nationwide

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.790
owed more on their mortgages
than their houses were worth.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.740
The financial sector
was also in big trouble.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.390
Bear Stearns and Lehman
Brothers went under.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.349
Other firms were kept alive
only by federal bailouts.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:15.960
Credit disappeared.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.290
Capital and liquidity
ran dangerously low.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.910
And so things stood in
2010, the year Yellen

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:28.430
became Vice Chair of the Fed,
serving as second in command

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.940
to then-chair Ben Bernanke.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.530
It may be hard to
see why anyone would

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.570
want to take that job in the
depths of an economic disaster.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.210
But if we think back to
the little girl who was so

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.300
touched by her father's
unemployed patients

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.970
or to the young woman who
decided in her first economics

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.320
class that government
could and should

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.230
be an effective and trusted
force for the public good,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.190
then it makes sense that
Yellen would roll up

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.780
her sleeves, determined
to aid household recovery

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.760
and promote renewed
economic mobility.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.380
Normally, monetary policy's
first line of defense

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.020
would be to lower
short-term interest rates.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.160
But interest rates are
already at or near zero.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.620
Facing stormy seas
and fiscal headwinds,

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.310
the Fed had to right
the ship with limited

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.080
access to monetary
policy's usual instruments.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.320
As Chair, Bernanke skillfully
guided the Fed away

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.060
from its customary
closed-mouth habits,

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.310
summed up by the slogan
"never explain, never excuse,"

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.730
and toward new habits
of transparency.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:46.510
Yellen was crucial to fostering
this new sense of openness.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.530
She led a
communications committee

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.000
with the same refreshing
candor that she

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.540
had brought to lunch in
the employee cafeteria.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.880
As she put it, "I hope
and trust that the days

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.590
of 'never explain, never
excuse' are gone for good."

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.710
The Fed shored up
consumer confidence

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.180
and prevented the
crisis from worsening.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.260
But conditions
remain challenging,

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.270
as Bernanke's term as
Chair drew to a close.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.770
A woman had never
chaired the Fed.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.000
But President Barack
Obama nominated Yellen.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.190
She began her term
on February 1, 2014.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.510
With her values, her intellect,
and her calm leadership,

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.450
Yellen steers our economy
toward shared prosperity.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.450
She replaces the popular Main
Street versus Wall Street

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.760
dichotomy with the
claim that Main Street

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.390
needs a properly regulated Wall
Street, just as a healthy Wall

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.080
Street needs a
thriving Main Street.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.980
As she has pointed
out time and again,

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.480
a well-supervised
financial sector

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.150
fuels job creation, innovation,
and inclusive economic growth.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.650
And in turn, households capable
of meeting financial goals,

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.310
such as home
ownership, retirement,

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.810
and college savings, are
better able to boost markets.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:13.010
For Yellen, the key is careful
monitoring, through capital

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.510
liquidity requirements,
stress tests

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.940
for financial
institutions, and living

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.550
wills for firms'
orderly dissolution

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.350
in the event of insolvency.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.590
Yellen's leadership was
tested last December,

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.690
when, for the first
time in over nine years,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.850
the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.770
Speculation about an increase
had circulated for months.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:41.070
And then, as now, the topic
was fraught, to say the least.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.650
Some commentators
criticized Yellen

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.260
for not raising
rates soon enough.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.150
Other nervous voices
warned that raising rates

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.500
would lead to another downturn.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.620
Normally understated
publications, like The New York

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.880
Times threw around
adjectives like

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.600
"perilous" and "hazardous."

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.360
Yellen remained unflappable.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.930
When rates rose, markets,
the public, and the media all

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.060
responded calmly,
thanks in large measure

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.680
to her resolute demeanor.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.650
The economy is by no
means perfect today,

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.690
but when Yellen
addresses the public,

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:22.210
the markets usually respond with
what USA Today characterizes

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.800
as a "Yellen Rally."

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.210
Through it all, Yellen
steadfastly describes her role

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.920
as Fed Chair in terms
that are both principled

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.750
and unpretentious.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.420
To quote her, "the
job isn't just

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.780
about fighting
inflation or monitoring

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.440
the financial system.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.200
It's about trying to help
ordinary households to get back

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.270
on their feet and about
creating a labor market,

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:52.320
where people can feel secure
and work and get ahead."

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.430
In a few moments we
will have the pleasure

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.760
of getting to know this
extraordinary woman

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.090
a bit better.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:01.320
Nobody is better
suited to help us do so

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.900
than Professor Greg Mankiw.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.040
Professor Mankiw is a Harvard
economist and the teacher

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.220
of one of the college's most
heavily subscribed courses, EC

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.340
10.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.360
Like Yellen, he maintains one
foot in the academic world

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.620
and the other in
the policy world.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.480
In his case, he served
as Chair of the Council

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.050
of Economic Advisers under
President George W. Bush.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:30.770
But before Professor Mankiw's
conversation with Chair Yellen,

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.630
we will have the good
fortune of hearing

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.910
from the single individual
who probably has the greatest

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.840
insight into Yellen's
current role,

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.920
because he is only
one of three people

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.210
alive who has also inhabited it.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:52.022
I am speaking of former
Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.

00:22:52.022 --> 00:22:53.480
Bernanke grew up
in South Carolina.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.780
He grew up in South Carolina.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.100
He graduated from
Harvard College in 1975,

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.480
and he earned a PhD
in Economics at MIT.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.870
He taught at Stanford, before
moving to Princeton in 1985.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.500
As much as he enjoyed teaching,
after nearly a quarter

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.490
century of it,
Bernanke had begun

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.940
to wonder, in his own words,
"what good was economics,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.080
if it's not used to improve
policymaking and therefore

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.210
make people better off?"

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.500
He has answered his own question
with years of public service

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.120
on President George W. Bush's
council of Economic Advisers

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.040
as well as on the
Federal Reserve,

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.720
to which he was appointed
by President Bush

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.990
and reappointed by
President Obama.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.600
These days Ben Bernanke
is a distinguished

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.990
Fellow-in-Residence
at the Hutchins Center

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.940
on Fiscal and Monetary Policy
at the Brookings Institution,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.350
returning largely to
a life of scholarship.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.130
I am delighted that
we could pull him

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.050
back into the limelight today
to share his reflections

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.390
on fellow economist
and his successor

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.950
as Chair of the Federal
Reserve, Janet Yellen.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.952
Please join me again in
warmly welcoming Ben Bernanke.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.590
-Thank you very much. it's
great to be back in Boston,

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.150
where I spent many
years as a student.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.430
And I got over the
Red Sox by 2005,

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.511
when the Nationals
moved to Washington.

00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:33.260
So I'm glad to be here
on this lovely day.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.770
It's a pleasure for me to
introduce Janet Yellen, someone

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.390
for whom I have the greatest
admiration, respect,

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.840
and affection.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.020
She's an outstanding
policymaker, an outstanding

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.730
person, and we're lucky to
have her leading the Federal

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.590
Reserve.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.590
Of course, my
appreciation for Janet

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.350
has only increased
by the fact that we

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:57.150
are both members of a small
club of current and retired Fed

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.520
Chairs.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.720
It's a club that
doesn't meet very often.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.020
A rare exception to this
rule occurred recently

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.040
in New York City, when
the four of us-- Yellen,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.240
Bernanke, Greenspan,
and Volcker--

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.660
were joined the interviewed
by Fareed Zakaria.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.590
The greatest excitement came
in the middle of the interview,

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.045
when Chairman Greenspan
suddenly gave out a loud sneeze.

00:25:22.564 --> 00:25:25.230
I remember thinking that if that
occurred a dozen years earlier,

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.950
the cable news commentators
would have spent hours

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.372
analyzing what that
meant for markets.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.060
Janet also showed central
banking tendencies

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.085
kind of early.

00:25:36.085 --> 00:25:38.320
Dean Cohen talked
about the story

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.590
where she, as
editor of the paper,

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:46.080
had to interview herself as the
valedictorian of the school.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.145
She didn't talk about the
most relevant comment,

00:25:48.145 --> 00:25:51.872
though, which was when the
editor asked herself if she

00:25:51.872 --> 00:25:53.080
enjoyed working at the paper?

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.555
She replied, no comment.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.010
Like a good central
banker, entrusted

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.100
with the nation's
monetary policy,

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.380
Janet is also cautious
of temperament.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.630
There's an economist
maxim that if you've never

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.546
missed an airline flight,
then you're spending

00:26:11.546 --> 00:26:13.990
too much time in airports.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.910
Despite this wisdom,
Janet reportedly

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:20.920
arrives hours in advance of
scheduled departure times.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.440
I've heard that her crack
security team at the Fed

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.950
continuously
remonstrates with her.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.240
Janet Madam Chair,
we have sirens.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.210
We have flashing lights.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.685
We can skip the security
lines-- to no avail.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.422
Kidding aside, verbal
discipline and caution

00:26:39.422 --> 00:26:41.630
in the face of uncertainty
are indeed characteristics

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.700
of good central bankers.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.360
But so are the
ability to analyze

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.000
complex situations
and the willingness

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.630
to take bold action, when
circumstances demand it.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.810
Janet has both these qualities.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.710
I will forever be grateful to
her for her support and insight

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.360
that she provided when we
served together at the Fed

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.070
during some very
difficult years.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.070
In her role as President
of the San Francisco Fed,

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.770
where she gained
hands-on experience

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.400
in supervising banks,
and later as Vice Chair,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.470
she was consistently prescient,
as the Dean described,

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.450
about the peril that an
imploding financial system

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.784
posed for the economy as
well as about the risk

00:27:22.784 --> 00:27:24.450
that the economic
recovery that followed

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.580
could be very slow
and protracted.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.410
Throughout the crisis
and its aftermath,

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.040
her famously precise and
logical analyzes were frequently

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.310
critical for clarifying
the situation

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.490
and, equally important,
for persuading others

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.290
about the need for action.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.790
I recall how often, when in the
meetings of the Federal Open

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.370
Market Committee, which
makes monetary policy, when

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.120
it came Janet's turn
to talk, how everyone

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.280
would go very silent,
because everyone wanted

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.520
to hear the entire argument.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.770
And when it did come time
for action, as ultimately it

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.360
always did, She was
a forceful advocate

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.940
of doing whatever it takes,
to coin a phrase, to protect

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.090
our economy and, in particular,
to put Americans back to work.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:11.570
She was a terrific colleague
and invaluable ally.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.570
Of course, now Janet is at the
leadership role in the Fed,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.800
where she's continuing
her outstanding work.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.310
When it became apparent in
2013 that she was a leading

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.615
candidate for the
position, she came

00:28:24.615 --> 00:28:26.740
to talk to me in my office
about whether she should

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.724
take the job, if offered.

00:28:28.724 --> 00:28:30.140
Now, we both knew
that there could

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.250
be no doubt about
her qualifications

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.230
for the position.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.230
In her multiple previous roles
at the Fed, as an economist,

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.970
as a board member, as a
reserve bank president,

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.690
and finally as vice
chair, as well as

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.330
in her lifetime of study of
monetary and macroeconomic

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:48.830
issues, Janet probably had
more direct relevant experience

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.300
than any other previous chair.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.550
Nevertheless, as I talked
to her about the job,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.260
I wasn't entirely encouraging.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.140
It's a tough job, I said, and
it can be pretty thankless.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.570
Well, Janet recognized
those difficulties, I think,

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:04.450
very honestly.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.260
And she understood the stress
that the position would

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.710
put on her and on her family.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:12.417
But she, of course,
ultimately agreed to serve.

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:14.000
It seemed to me, at
the time, that she

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.460
had several motivations for
accepting the president's offer

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.250
to be nominated, including
her lifelong commitment

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.480
to using what she had
learned as an economist

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.496
to improve the lives
of average people.

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:25.870
But I perceived
that she was also

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.260
thinking about the
historic significance

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.600
of being the first woman
in this prominent post.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.360
I think Janet well understood
that by taking this position

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.660
and applying her
considerable talents,

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.470
she could provide
a valuable role

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.700
model for future generations
of young women, who

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.180
might otherwise not
engage with economics

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.100
or economic policy-making.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.530
That is, in itself,
a great contribution

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.422
on top of all the others
that she has made.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.020
Again let me join the
Dean in honoring Janet.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.190
I'm very pleased
and honored myself

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.960
to have been asked to
join this ceremony.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.260
She's an extraordinary
individual and certainly

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.200
well-deserving of
today's recognition.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.200
What I'd like to do now is
ask Janet and Greg Mankiw, who

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.700
is a Harvard Professor
of Economics,

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.020
of course, and also a long time
friend and colleague of mine,

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.230
to come up to the
podium-- Janet, Greg.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.080
-Well, welcome back to Harvard.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.580
-Thank you.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.180
-It's a great delight and
honor to be talking with you.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.380
Ben said that central
banking is a thankless job.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:14.186
So let me begin by thanking
you for all that you do

00:31:14.186 --> 00:31:18.790
and have done for this country.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:23.779
I thought I'd start off with
a little bit of biography.

00:31:23.779 --> 00:31:26.320
I've been an economist for many
years, and in all those years

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.140
I've never met a five-year-old
who comes up to me and says,

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.176
when I grow up, I want
to be an economist.

00:31:31.176 --> 00:31:33.800
But some of them do grow up and
become economists, and so there

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.671
always some moment
where they say, aha,

00:31:35.671 --> 00:31:36.670
this is a career for me.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:37.770
So at what point
in your life did

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:40.270
you say, aha, I think I'm going
to be an economist, and why?

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.470
-OK, let me answer that.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:47.880
But I'd first like to express
my great gratitude to Dean Cohen

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.610
and to Ben for their
wonderful remarks.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:54.430
I'm really touched and
honored by this award.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:59.300
And Ben is a good
friend and colleague.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.970
And let me just say
that America owes him

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.690
an enormous debt of gratitude.

00:32:18.725 --> 00:32:20.850
-OK, so when did you decide
to become an economist?

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:24.120
-So as Dean Cohen mentioned
in her introduction,

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:29.700
I became hooked on economics
when I took Econ 1 or Econ 10

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.720
here.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.760
And I think, in part, I'd
always been interested in math,

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.590
always enjoyed math.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:41.680
And I saw economics
as a field that

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.260
uses math and uses
quantitative techniques

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.400
but for an important
social purpose.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.350
And that is advancing human
welfare and understanding

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:58.110
problems that keep people
from fulfilling their lives.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:03.060
So it was the social welfare
implications of economics,

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:08.240
plus the analytic rigor that
it involved, was a combination

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.800
that appeals to me.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.500
Also, in my first
macroeconomics class,

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.800
I studied the Great
Depression and business

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.820
cycles more generally.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:21.650
It was my first exposure
really to Keynesian economics,

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:23.590
to the general theory.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:28.280
And I think I came to appreciate
that, although I don't think

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.700
anyone's ever invented
a better economic system

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.680
than capitalism,
and it works very

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.890
well for a large
number of purposes,

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.470
it is capable of
breakdowns periodically,

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.120
in which one has mass
unemployment-- the Great

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.240
Depression, the Great
Recession, fortunately

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.330
not nearly so serious,
but nevertheless a very

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.850
difficult episode.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.060
And I saw that monetary
and fiscal policy

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:00.560
were tools that could be
used to address unemployment

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.930
and improve people's lives.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:06.780
And that attracted me and it's
continued to be my motivation.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.749
-Well, as a teacher of
Principles of Economics

00:34:08.749 --> 00:34:10.540
here at Harvard, I'm
actually great to hear

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.380
that stat course can
be so transformative

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.618
in such important lives.

00:34:16.618 --> 00:34:18.159
Now, you mention
Keynesian economics.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:21.204
I'm going to talk about your
own intellectual pedigree.

00:34:21.204 --> 00:34:22.870
When you went to Yale
as a grad student,

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:26.156
you studied with James Tobin.

00:34:26.156 --> 00:34:26.739
You know this.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:29.114
But just to give the audience
a little bit of background,

00:34:29.114 --> 00:34:31.150
James Tobin was one of
the great macroeconomists

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.120
of the 20th century,
a Nobel Prize winner.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.080
He studied here at Harvard
under Alvin Hansen,

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.158
who was one of the early
Keynesian economists.

00:34:38.158 --> 00:34:40.199
He's one of the first
people in the United States

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:41.920
to take Keynes very
seriously and bring

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.565
a lot of the ideas
of the general theory

00:34:44.565 --> 00:34:45.440
to the United States.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.929
So you can see that intellectual
trajectory from Keynes

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:50.540
to Hansen to Tobin to you.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.165
And I actually I
learned at lunch today

00:34:52.165 --> 00:34:53.389
that you taught Alan Garber.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.949
-I did.

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:56.824
-So you can see it
continues to today.

00:34:56.824 --> 00:34:58.990
Can you tell us a little
bit about your relationship

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.780
with Tobin and how that worked?

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.450
-Well, I went to Yale, and
I chose Yale as a place

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:10.490
to get my PhD because I
was so impressed by Tobin.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:13.670
I took his course in
monetary economics.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.310
I served as his
teaching assistant

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.220
in the core graduate
macro class.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:23.790
He was certainly an important
mentor to me and a friend.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:28.600
And later on, when I went to
serve at the Federal Reserve

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.110
and at the Council
of Economic Advisers,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.550
he would visit me in Washington
and give me the benefit

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.910
of his policy advice.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:42.160
But Tobin, to me, was
more than just a teacher.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.940
He was really an inspiration.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.350
And what inspired
me so about Tobin

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:52.660
was that he had a passion
for social justice

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:57.060
and a moral compass that
pointed straight north.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.670
And to him, sometimes
economists are

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:08.630
accused of working on
highly mathematical models,

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:13.190
that the applicability
of them is questionable.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.560
For Tobin, that
was never the case.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.800
Economics was always important
because the policy applications

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.600
of it had the potential to
make people's lives better.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.800
As you indicated, he
studied here at Harvard,

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.790
read the general theory
shortly after it was published,

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:36.360
lived through the
Depression, saw not

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.050
only the horrific economic
toll it took on our nation,

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:46.340
but also the political and
social repercussions of that

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.370
for many, many years.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:53.330
And he was determined to make
sure that our country never

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:57.050
suffered through
such a situation

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.750
again, when there were policy
tools that could be deployed.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:05.240
And that was exactly
the focus that I've

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.460
had throughout my career.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.834
-Yeah, I had
noticed, by the way,

00:37:07.834 --> 00:37:11.230
as a macroeconomist,
that recessions

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.050
do have one positive
byproduct is they to generate

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.220
a lot of macroeconomists.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.212
So the Great Depression
generated a whole generation,

00:37:18.212 --> 00:37:19.420
including Tobin's generation.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.090
I went to grad school
during the '82 recession.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.920
A lot of people were
interested in macro.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.920
And this recent recession,
the financial crisis,

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.630
has got a lot of people
interested in macroeconomics

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.129
again.

00:37:27.129 --> 00:37:30.870
So there's one little upside
to economic downturns.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.670
So I'm going to think about the
evolution of economic thought.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.470
If you think about what you
learned how the economy works

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:42.130
as a student, both at Brown and
Yale, and what we know today,

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.976
what do we know
today that we think

00:37:43.976 --> 00:37:45.350
is really fundamental,
important,

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:48.190
that they didn't know back
when you were a student?

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.710
-Well, macroeconomics
as a field, I think,

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:53.850
is absolutely
continued to advance.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:58.970
And Dean Cohen in her remarks
talked about what I'll refer to

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:03.020
was the microeconomic
foundations of macroeconomics.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.347
This is something that not
only did I work on, but, Greg,

00:38:06.347 --> 00:38:09.910
you've have made important
contributions to as well.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.090
-Thank you.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.350
-Macroeconomic
theory, I think, was

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:19.350
criticized that wage and price
stickiness or rigidity played

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:22.770
an important role in
understanding unemployment.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:26.650
But the economic foundations,
the micro foundations

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.960
for why are wages
and prices sticky

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.880
hadn't been well understood.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.250
And I think we've really
made a lot of progress

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.680
in advancing that.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.720
And, Greg, as you
mentioned, when

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:43.510
there is a financial crisis or
a period of high unemployment,

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:47.780
it does stimulate people to
think about macroeconomics

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.920
and to take off
in new directions.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.730
And I think that's happened
since this financial crisis.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.840
And, in particular,
I would point

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:03.060
to a growing body of work that's
at the board of finance theory

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:07.310
and macroeconomics that's
really helping us understand

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:11.650
the nature of systemic risk,
the way in which it can arise

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.340
and propagate
itself, what to look

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.800
for as we monitor the economy.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.510
Obviously, we don't want to
have another financial crisis.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:24.530
We want to do
everything in our power

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:29.710
to spot developments that could
produce a financial crisis.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:33.770
And I think this work is going
to help us understand that.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:39.060
But I would say that-- you
asked me about Tobin's work

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.090
and what's new and changed.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:44.050
But I would say
Tobin's work continues

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.670
to have great relevance to
the problems we face today.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:52.870
So as Ben well remembers,
it was December 2008.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:57.080
We had lowered our overnight
short-term interest rate

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.110
to zero.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.310
Unemployment was
still high and looked

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.740
like it could linger
for many, many years.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.550
And we were searching
for new things

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.850
that we could do to
get the economy going.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.610
And one of the things
that we ended up doing,

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.060
and other central
banks have as well,

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:20.070
was engaging in
large-scale purchases

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:24.750
of longer-term assets, in our
case, long-term treasury bonds

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.120
and mortgage-backed securities.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.200
And the theory of
that was, in part,

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.420
that by removing these long-term
assets from the portfolio

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.460
with the public, we would
put downward pressure

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.590
on longer-term interest
rates, at a time when

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.990
there was no more to be
accomplished in the short end.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:48.250
And really a lot of Tobin's
work on portfolio choice

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:53.170
and portfolio modeling, trying
to understand what determines

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.450
the relative rates of return
on different financial assets,

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.160
how demand and supply
mattered to that

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.260
was, in effect,
intellectual foundations

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.220
for those policies
and comparable ones

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.810
that are being used in
other parts of the world.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:12.936
-It's maybe apocryphal,
but it's a legend,

00:41:12.936 --> 00:41:14.570
an old Chinese
curse that says may

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:16.234
you live in interesting times.

00:41:16.234 --> 00:41:18.150
And that certainly applies
to central bankers,

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:20.930
and you've lived in
very interesting times.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.520
Looking back over
the past decade,

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.660
we've experienced a
tremendous financial crisis,

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.955
fear that that crisis would turn
into a Great Depression, which

00:41:29.955 --> 00:41:30.455
it did not.

00:41:30.455 --> 00:41:32.650
It turned into a
Great Recession.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.910
The unemployment reached
10%, but not the 25%

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:36.550
that we saw in the 1930s.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.980
So it sort of wasn't great
news, but it wasn't as bad

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.290
as it might have been.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:43.650
So looking back at your time at
the Fed Federal Reserve system,

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.470
not just in your
current job, what

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.340
did the Fed do right,
and what did it do wrong?

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:55.280
-Well I think the Fed's handling
of the financial crisis,

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.640
once it was upon us, was
nothing short of magnificent.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.644
And the credit here goes to Ben.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:14.870
He was the right person with the
right intellectual background

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:21.610
and the courage to
think outside-the-box.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:26.630
Two, he saw in the height
of the financial crisis,

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:30.510
credit just drying
up in the economy,

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:34.600
something that would end
up crippling businesses

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:39.190
and households and
could've ended us up

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.880
in another great recession.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.830
And the immediate problem
that he and we in the Fed,

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:50.980
more generally, faced was how
to get credit flowing back

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:54.860
into the economy to avoid
that kind of outcome?

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:59.580
And although the Fed tends to
be a slow-moving and pretty

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:06.620
conservative institution, Ben
encouraged blue-sky thinking.

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.190
And he tasked
everybody around him

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:14.280
with being as inventive, as
innovative as they possibly

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.010
could to come up with
programs, some of them

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:22.900
might work some of them might
be rejected, might not work,

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.860
but to throw everything
we had at it,

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:32.080
to try to keep credit flowing
to the American economy.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.340
We invented a whole
bunch of programs

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.900
with an alphabet of mnemonics.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.330
I won't recall all
of them for you.

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:46.450
But I think that really stemmed
what was a very deep and severe

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:48.160
financial crisis.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.370
And then after
that, the programs

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:53.200
that we adopted--
asset purchases

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.680
and forward guidance--
have made a difference

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.820
and gotten the economy
back on its feet.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:07.130
So I think those are things that
the Fed can feel very proud of.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.780
Ben was immensely
courageous in doing

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.160
this in the face of a
great deal of criticism,

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.774
and it was a huge contribution.

00:44:16.774 --> 00:44:18.440
-I agree with you
completely, that Ben's

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.409
an absolute hero of this era.

00:44:20.409 --> 00:44:22.450
But [INAUDIBLE] push you
just little bit on that.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:23.795
Is there anything you
look back and say, I

00:44:23.795 --> 00:44:25.830
wish we done that particular
thing differently?

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.800
I For example, I wish
we had saved Lehman?

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.740
Well, I will say
that we didn't see

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.860
the financial crisis coming.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:40.660
Dean Cohen mentioned
my prescience,

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.880
which thank you for that,
in seeing the house price

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.200
bubble, which I did, and I
think others did as well.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.090
But I don't think
we saw-- and this

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.380
is true for the
regulators, and, frankly,

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:56.320
it's true of
economists generally

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.150
and the private sector.

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:02.350
None of us saw--
well, we saw trees.

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:06.720
The house price overvaluation
or bubble was the tree.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.470
There was growing leverage
in the shadow banking sector.

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.120
Some people saw that.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.410
But putting it all
together, how this

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:19.600
would come together,
create systemic risk,

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.170
erupt into a very
severe financial crisis,

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:27.860
the rule of derivatives,
how they fit into that--

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.610
we really didn't
see that coming.

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:34.260
And, in that sense, I would
say we're really trying now

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.565
to do a better job of that.

00:45:36.565 --> 00:45:37.440
It's a high priority.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.750
-Well, that exactly brings
me to my next question,

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.657
because financial
regulation is obviously

00:45:40.657 --> 00:45:42.240
an important part
of what the Fed does

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.365
and the federal government
more generally does, not

00:45:44.365 --> 00:45:44.990
just the Fed.

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:47.510
Are we doing a better job
of financial regulation

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:49.860
today than we did before
the financial crisis?

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.900
-Absolutely.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.650
I mean the short answer
is definitely, yes.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:57.600
And the starting point for
why we're doing a better job

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.760
is that we're focused
on systemic risk.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.840
We're focused on
financial stability

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:09.900
and wanting to spot
emerging conditions that

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:14.430
could potentially result in
another financial crisis.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:17.860
And I think we have a
better understanding of how

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:22.290
to look for those
conditions, and we're

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.800
putting a lot of resources
and intellectual effort

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.520
into doing just that.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.610
We now have an entire division
of financial stability

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:32.790
at the Fed.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.210
With respect to our supervision
of the banking system,

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.890
really the most
important thing is

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:42.170
we're bringing a new mindset
to how we supervise the largest

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.900
and most systemic firms.

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:49.430
That, instead of taking
a tree sort of approach,

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:53.670
is this institution individually
look safe and sound?

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.520
We're thinking about
the interconnections

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.220
among these firms
and their connections

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.190
with other parts of
the financial system.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:06.570
This is sometimes called a
macroprudential approach,

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.060
rather than a
microprudential approach.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:14.140
Beyond that, in terms of
regulating the financial sector

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:18.410
and making the banking
system safer and sounder,

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:20.680
I think we've
accomplished a lot.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.290
The amount of capital in the
banking system-- and this

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:27.370
is particularly true
for the largest and most

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:31.310
systemic firms-- has
increased enormously.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:35.440
The quality of that capital
is greatly improved.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.260
The amount of
liquidity that we're

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.710
requiring large banking
organizations to hold

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.740
is greatly increased.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.260
And with greater
liquidity, there

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:51.720
are less chance that if
one firm encounters stress,

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:56.540
that will end up
mushrooming into a liquidity

00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:01.020
shortage for the system as a
whole and a financial crisis.

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.330
We're also putting a great
deal of work into thinking how

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:10.030
to resolve the systemic firm,
if one were to fail or encounter

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:15.560
serious losses, without its
imposing costs on the taxpayer,

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:19.000
the so-called
too-big-to-fail problem.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.310
We have forced firms to
produce living wills that

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:26.960
would show how they could
be safely dismantled,

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.260
using tools at our disposal.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.790
And we're working very closely
with foreign regulators,

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:38.400
particularly in
England and in Europe,

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.010
to handle tricky
cross-border issues

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:42.890
and making sure that
we're all prepared.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.810
So I do think things
have improved enormously.

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:49.470
-Let's turn to sort of
current economic conditions.

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.910
We've been in a recovery
stage for a while.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:53.740
But it's been kind
of a slow recovery,

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:55.060
by historical standards.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.410
How do you think
economy's doing right now?

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.890
-So it has been a slow recovery.

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.950
But we've made a great
deal of progress.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:09.870
The unemployment rate peaked at
over 10%, and it's down to 5%

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:10.830
now.

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:13.370
Just over the last
year, we have created

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:18.000
around 2.7 million new
jobs, over 14 million

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.790
since the lowest
point for employment.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.840
And more generally,
the labor market,

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:30.790
on almost any metric that
you could use to evaluate it,

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:32.900
is really improved.

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.320
Labor force participation
has moved up

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:40.530
some over the last year, which
is an encouraging development.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:46.800
Because in a society that's
aging with more retirees,

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.290
there is a persistent
downward negative trend

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:52.240
in labor force participation.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.530
So people who became
discouraged about finding work

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.990
have moved back into
the labor force.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:02.970
So I definitely think we
have made a lot of progress.

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:08.400
But that said, I think the
further gains are possible.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.540
So we're close to
an unemployment rate

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.760
that, I think, most
economists would associate

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.790
with our full employment goal.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:19.650
But the number of individuals
working part time,

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:24.870
who would like to have full-time
jobs, is unusually high.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:28.490
And we've really not
seen much improvement

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.850
in wage growth,
which is suggestive

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:35.120
of some slack in
the labor market.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:39.306
Now, with the labor
markets improved,

00:50:39.306 --> 00:50:42.960
a notable and less
positive development is

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:47.840
that the growth of output
has been remarkably slow,

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:53.430
something like 2% on average
over the last several years.

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:58.370
And when you have a lot
of jobs being created

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:00.950
in the face of not
much output growth,

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.500
unfortunately, that means
that productivity growth,

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:08.900
which is the growth in output
per worker, is very slow.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.040
Over the last five years,
productivity growth

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.860
has averaged only half
a percent per year,

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:19.380
and that's a really
very miserable pace

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.700
in historical context.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.060
Since productivity
growth ultimately

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.470
determines the
pace of improvement

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:32.000
in living standards
for society as a whole,

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.960
that's a serious and
negative development.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.880
Finally I would say with
respect to inflation,

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.530
that inflation, for a
number of years now,

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:47.440
has been running below
the Fed's 2% objective.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:54.220
This last year, our measure
of inflation that we look at

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.300
increased only
8/10 of a percent.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:02.600
But very important reasons for
the shortfall are first of all,

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:06.350
the plunge we have
seen in oil prices,

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:09.410
and second of all, a
marked appreciation

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:14.240
of the dollar that's
pushed down import prices.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.750
Those factors seem
like they're roughly

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:19.030
stabilizing at this point.

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:23.900
And my own expectation is that,
although inflation is lower

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:28.710
than our objective, if we
continue to see stability

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:31.180
there and an improving
labor market,

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:35.170
that inflation will move back
up over the next couple of years

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:37.800
to our 2% objective.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.956
-I've been told that a bunch
of money managers in New York

00:52:41.956 --> 00:52:43.580
have delayed their
trip to the Hamptons

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:47.890
this afternoon, so they
could listen to your talk

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:49.876
here today, in case
it moves markets.

00:52:49.876 --> 00:52:51.500
So this is your chance
to move markets.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.090
Do you want to tell us
anything about the path

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:57.260
of monetary policy
going forward?

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.800
You're welcome to say no.

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.222
And if you do say no, they'll
leave for the Hamptons.

00:53:03.222 --> 00:53:06.050
-Well, let me say
a few sentences,

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:08.320
so I won't delay them very long.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.320
So the economy is
continuing to improve.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.650
We saw weak growth
in the first quarter

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:25.530
of the year and relatively weak
growth at the end of last year.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:30.630
Growth looks to be picking
up from the various data

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:32.200
that we monitor.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:38.180
And if that continues, and
if the labor market continues

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:43.130
to improve, and I expect
those things will occur,

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:46.260
we'll continue to
monitor incoming data,

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:51.020
and also we'll assess
risks to the outlook.

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.170
But it's appropriate--
and I've said this

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.890
in the past-- I
think for the Fed

00:53:56.890 --> 00:54:03.110
to gradually and cautiously
increase our overnight interest

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:04.960
rate over time.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.490
And probably in
the coming months

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:09.354
such a move would
be appropriate.

00:54:09.354 --> 00:54:10.160
-Great.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.990
You can go to the Hamptons now.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.490
-That's it.

00:54:17.274 --> 00:54:18.690
-One of the
interesting challenges

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:21.090
that the Feds faced recently
is the zero lower bound.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:23.570
In fact, interest rates have
basically gone to rock bottom.

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:24.836
They've stayed there.

00:54:24.836 --> 00:54:26.960
And some of the rules of
thumb, like a Taylor rule,

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.399
would suggest deeply
negative rates.

00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:31.940
Now, we're not in a situation
now where it's a big concerned.

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.154
But people are worried.

00:54:33.154 --> 00:54:35.570
I think Doug Elmendorf raised
this issue at this morning's

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.030
panel, that if we have
another recessionary shock

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:42.140
in the future, that the Feds
won't have many tools left.

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.390
How much does that worry you?

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:46.332
What do you imagine doing
in that sort of scenario?

00:54:46.332 --> 00:54:48.540
Could you imagine going with
negative interest rates,

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.600
as some European countries
have been trying?

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.210
How do you think about that?

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:56.150
-So let me agree with what
Doug said this morning.

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:58.920
It is a concern.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.860
We have very limited
scope at this point

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:07.240
to use our traditional
technique, namely lowering

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:11.480
overnight interest rates,
to support the economy

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:15.210
if there is an adverse shock.

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:20.440
Even if we go for some time
without an adverse shock,

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:26.150
and even if you take a
reasonably optimistic scenario,

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:29.840
participants in the FOMC
are asked to write down,

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.000
every three months,
what they regard

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:39.820
as a normal longer-run level
of short-term interest rates.

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.450
And so this is
something that they

00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:46.480
might expect to prevail, say,
five to seven years from now,

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.940
so quite a ways down the road.

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:53.700
They write down the number
now, like 3% or 3 and 1/4%

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.160
is the median.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.070
So even if we were to
go for a number of years

00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.860
without encountering
and adverse shock,

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:04.410
and the short-term rates
got back to that level,

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:07.680
that's lower than a
lower level of rates

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.740
than we have seen historically.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:13.720
We don't even know for sure that
the level of normal or neutral

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.210
rates will rise that high.

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:19.710
And in the typical-- I think
Doug mentioned this morning.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:25.580
In a typical recession, when
the Fed wants to respond,

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.420
we would cut short-term interest
rates by maybe 400 or 500 basis

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.200
points.

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.560
So we don't have that scope.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:38.520
Now, we did invent
other tools to address

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.660
stimulating the economy.

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:44.550
We use these longer-term
asset purchases.

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:48.480
And we try to shape
market expectations

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.120
about the path of
short-term interest rates

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.960
through our communications and
so-called forward guidance.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:57:00.010
I think we would resort
to those tools again.

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:02.240
Negative interest
rates is something

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.370
we considered briefly.

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:10.530
We were concerned, at
the time, that there

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:14.820
could be a number of negative
repercussions from lowering

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:20.620
negative interest rates, from
lowering interest rates to zero

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.460
or a negative territory.

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:24.240
And so we didn't
really pursue that.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.410
And it's not something
that we're really

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:31.200
thinking a great deal about now,
although other countries have

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.030
used it.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:36.260
But this is a concern.

00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:38.800
One of the reasons I believe
it's important for us

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.150
to be cautious in
raising interest rates

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:45.670
is precisely because if we were
to raise interest rates too

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:49.140
steeply and we were
to trigger a downturn

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:53.780
or contribute to a downturn,
we have limited scope

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:54.960
for responding.

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.830
And it is an important
reason for caution.

00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:00.030
I would like to
see-- Doug and others

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:02.500
talked about this
morning-- that there

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.040
should be greater scope for
fiscal policy in the future,

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.200
to be usable to address
economic weakness.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:12.380
And if we were to take
steps to raise productivity

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:14.700
growth-- and our
panelists talked

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:19.490
about a number of important
things-- education, children,

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:23.680
investment in infrastructure,
investment in innovation.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.510
If we had faster
productivity growth,

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:31.010
that would probably push up the
normal level of interest rates

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:34.700
in the economy and give us a
bit more scope there as well.

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:35.700
-Great.

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.380
I have one final question.

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:40.110
I'm assuming out here in the
audience there's some students.

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:41.693
And I'm sure there's
some students who

00:58:41.693 --> 00:58:44.210
are looking at you, and
they're saying, wow,

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:47.440
she's had a really cool career.

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.250
I want to do
something like that.

00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:53.440
What advice would you
give that student?

00:58:53.440 --> 00:59:00.280
-So I think the starting
point for me, as I've said

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:05.160
and others have
commented, was finding

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.890
a subject I loved and
have been able to feel

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:13.740
passionate about over all
these years of my career,

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.250
namely economics.

00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.650
And obviously, it's not going
to be economics for everybody.

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:22.560
But finding some
field, some interest

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:27.070
that you want to get up every
day, you want to work on.

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:31.910
Obviously, a successful career
it does require hard work,

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.680
and it's a lot less hard
if what you're working on

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.220
is something you're
really interested in.

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.860
So to me, that's key.

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:45.350
I guess I would also say
that something that's

00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:50.150
been important to
me-- in thinking

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:55.220
about a career-- I know I've
achieved a remarkable position.

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:59.480
But it's not just the endpoint
of one's career that matters.

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.330
A satisfying career
is about what

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:06.860
you do all the way throughout
your working years,

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.010
leading up to wherever it ends.

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:18.810
And for me, when I think
back on all the stages,

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:19.880
I've enjoyed them all.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.430
They've all been
satisfying, partly

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.930
because I love economics.

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:26.060
But also I'll mention
two or three things.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:30.420
One thing, I think it's really
important to affiliate yourself

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:36.050
with organizations that
you really feel identified

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.570
with their mission, that
you feel proud that you

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.150
work for the organization.

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:44.440
I've certainly felt that way
at the various universities.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.450
I've been at.

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:47.720
And I felt that way
very much working

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.220
in the federal government.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.820
Several of our
panelists this morning

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.480
talked about public service.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.180
And I will say that some
of the finest, smartest,

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:05.420
most dedicated, most passionate
people that I've worked with

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:10.540
have been at the Federal Reserve
and in the federal government.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:14.750
But throughout, finding
people to work with that

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:16.580
you brainstorm together.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.720
You have to figure
out what are we

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.030
going to do about this problem?

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:24.810
And coming into work and
having a group of people you

01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:28.660
feel these are people I
want to hang out with.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:31.880
I feel proud to have these
people as my colleagues.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.200
That's always been
important to me--

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.980
so the people you work with
and choosing organizations.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.880
Somebody says,
where do you work?

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.610
I work at the Federal Reserve.

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:44.790
I feel proud of that.

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:47.020
I feel it's an
important organization.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:50.710
It's devoted to the
well-being of America.

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:51.835
-Well, thank you very much.

01:01:51.835 --> 01:01:52.335
Thank you.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.670
-Thank you very much,
Greg, for leading us

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.860
in such a stimulating
conversation.

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.650
I think we've all had
a great tutorial today.

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:41.190
And it will stick with us,
I think, for a long time.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.970
And to Chair Yellen,
thank you for sharing

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:48.700
your time, your experiences,
and your wisdom with us today.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:52.820
Now the moment has come to
confer upon you the 2016

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.750
Radcliffe Medal.

01:02:55.750 --> 01:03:01.460
She unites scholarship and
leadership for the public good.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.730
She brings candor
and collegiality

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:07.900
to solving complex problems.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:12.910
She strives to build an economy
in which all Americans can

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:14.020
thrive.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:18.180
Chair Janet Yellen, I bestow
upon you this Radcliffe Medal,

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.740
with the deepest
admiration for a lifetime

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:26.564
of visionary and
principled service.

01:03:26.564 --> 01:03:28.260
-Thank you.
