00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Voiceover] Minli's house is located

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.544
1.4 miles from her school.

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:06.366
When she walks home from school,

00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.547
it takes her an average of 24 minutes.

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:12.089
Assuming that Minli
walks at a constant rate,

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:13.541
constant rate, we could figure that out,

00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:15.385
because we know how far she walks

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:16.780
in a certain amount of time,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.347
which of the following
functions best models

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:21.319
Minli's distance from home, D, in miles,

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:23.246
so we want the distance in miles,

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:26.009
if she has walked a total of T minutes?

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.727
So T is going to be in minutes,

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.642
so all our units are going
to be minutes and miles,

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.384
and that's good because
they gave us things

00:00:31.384 --> 00:00:32.742
in terms of minutes and miles.

00:00:32.742 --> 00:00:34.147
If this was in seconds or hours,

00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:36.027
we would have to do some conversion.

00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:37.362
So let's just think about her rate,

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.580
her constant rate that
they're talking about.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.565
The rate that Minli walks,

00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:44.943
well she covers 1.4 miles,

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:48.100
she covers 1.4 miles

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.004
in 24 minutes,

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.918
24 minutes.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.637
Well, this isn't a pretty fraction,

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:55.960
with a decimal in the numerator,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.141
so let's multiply the numerator
and the denominator by 10,

00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:00.476
so that we get rid of this decimal.

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:02.141
So that's going to be equal to

00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:05.851
14 over 240

00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:08.834
miles per minute.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.073
And then we can further simplify that.

00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:13.360
The numerator and denominator
are both divisible by two,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.974
so this is going to be, let's see,

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.878
14 divided by two is seven,

00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:20.012
240 divided by two, over 120

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:24.854
miles per minute, miles per minute.

00:01:24.854 --> 00:01:27.860
So we were able to figure
out Minli's constant rate.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.660
Now we need to figure out D.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.517
We need to figure out D.

00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:32.911
And we have to be very careful.

00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:36.892
D is Minli's distance
from home, from home.

00:01:36.892 --> 00:01:38.936
She's leaving from school,

00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:40.572
and it's her distance from home.

00:01:40.572 --> 00:01:44.113
Remember, her home is 1.4
miles from her school.

00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:46.098
So there's a bunch of ways
that we can tackle it,

00:01:46.098 --> 00:01:47.259
but maybe the easiest one is,

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.138
what's her distance, if you wanted to say

00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:52.088
distance from school?

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:56.650
Distance from school,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.061
distance from school.

00:01:58.061 --> 00:02:02.077
That's just going to be her rate times T,

00:02:02.077 --> 00:02:03.922
times how much time has passed by.

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:07.277
As when time is zero, she's
gonna be at her school.

00:02:07.277 --> 00:02:09.078
As time increases in minutes,

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:12.015
she's going to get further and
further away from her school.

00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:15.462
But her distance from home,
her distance from home

00:02:15.462 --> 00:02:19.874
is going to be 1.4 miles minus
the distance from school.

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:23.380
So let me just write D, cause
this is what we care about.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.698
D, which is her distance
in miles, from home.

00:02:27.698 --> 00:02:29.938
Distance in miles from home.

00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:31.761
That's going to be, that's going to be

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.453
1.4 minus distance from school,

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:40.552
minus distance from school.

00:02:41.742 --> 00:02:43.326
And if that doesn't make
sense, just think about it.

00:02:43.326 --> 00:02:44.996
If this is her home right over here,

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:46.617
I'll write H for home,

00:02:46.617 --> 00:02:49.274
if this is her school
right here, S for school,

00:02:49.274 --> 00:02:53.593
we know that this distance
right over here is 1.4 miles.

00:02:53.593 --> 00:02:57.935
Now, if she has walked,
if she has walked say,

00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:00.455
all right, let me do
this in another color,

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:03.752
if she has walked, I don't know, .4 miles,

00:03:03.752 --> 00:03:06.817
if this is 0.4 miles right over here,

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:07.733
then her distance from home

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:09.857
is gonna be 1.4 miles minus that.

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:12.133
It's going to be, it's going to be

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.012
this distance right over here.

00:03:15.012 --> 00:03:16.394
So distance from home is going to be

00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:18.855
1.4 minus the distance from school.

00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:20.596
And what's that going to be?

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:25.449
Well that's just going
to be 1.4 minus the rate,

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.329
times the time.

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.177
Well what's the rate?

00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:30.232
7/120 miles per minute.

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:33.157
We got the units right,
and so this says that D

00:03:33.157 --> 00:03:36.878
is going to be equal to 1.4 minus

00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:40.518
7 over 120th, T.

00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:41.866
And if we look at the choices,

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:44.908
that's going to be this
first choice over here.

00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:46.238
And it's fun to look at the other choices,

00:03:46.238 --> 00:03:47.225
and to think about,

00:03:47.225 --> 00:03:49.685
well how could we have ruled
them out fairly quickly?

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:52.658
Well this one has 1.4, the
distance between the two places,

00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:54.167
minus 24 T.

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.583
Well this isn't the rate, right over here.

00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:57.405
That's how long it takes her to walk,

00:03:57.405 --> 00:03:58.300
it's not the rate.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.377
So could rule that one out.

00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:03.639
This one is 1.4 minus the
reciprocal of the rate.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.997
So that's a strange answer.

00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:07.761
And this one, this one makes it look like

00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:10.089
she's getting further
and further from home

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:11.842
as time gets bigger.

00:04:11.842 --> 00:04:13.826
Notice, this one right over here,

00:04:13.826 --> 00:04:15.684
it does correctly say at time zero

00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:18.528
she's going to be 1.4 miles from her home,

00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:19.399
which is accurate,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.524
because at time zero she's
going to be at her school.

00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:23.904
But then after one
minute, after two minutes,

00:04:23.904 --> 00:04:25.157
after three minutes,

00:04:25.157 --> 00:04:27.201
she's going to get, based on this model,

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.057
further and further away from her home.

00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:30.683
So this would be a case where she's

00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:33.619
walking away from home, from her school.

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:35.769
So you would rule that one out as well.
