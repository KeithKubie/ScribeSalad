00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.500
So what will people ask me and
my happy with all my past investments?

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
I say that is the same question
like saying would you as manager

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.480
high school life the same that as
you managed them when you were a kid

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.960
knowing all you know now and
the answer of course no.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.720
I would have been great in high
school today, would had a great time.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.520
And similarly when you start investing
there's many things that you miss out.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.920
At least for me there were many
things I missed out on and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.160
then I only learned over the years.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.960
I think that if there's one thing that
is the most critical thing is that

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.440
earlier on I think my balance between
team and idea was very different.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.000
I think that if you
gave me a great idea,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.560
or something that looked like
a great idea with a mediocre team,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.510
I might have gone for it and
I actually have in the past.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.830
Because my view was,
which was a wrong view,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.990
that at the end of day the ideas
is very material in that.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.899
The reality being at the end of the day
that as I said most companies that come

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.396
even with the best of ideas find out
very quickly that they don't have

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:07.134
product market fit which
is a very depressing thing.

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:11.304
You start out, you start running you
go to the customers you do customer

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:15.614
discovery bang suddenly you find out
that nobody wants what you thought is

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:17.233
the best idea in the world.

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:21.530
At that point your ability to go back
to the drawing board come up with a new

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.135
assumption try again and
again and again and

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:27.430
again depends mostly on your character.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.980
And so
if you believe like I do that nobody is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.700
born with the ability to predict exactly
what's going to be the idea that works.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.220
And even if you're born with that you
don't know what Google is going to

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.370
do tomorrow, what Facebook's
going to do tomorrow, right?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.180
And then, you know,
you can work on something for years and

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.700
then Google comes and says,
I do that for free now.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.550
And so it's the ability of
the founders to look at the market,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.920
understand it, look at the customers,
understand their needs.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.270
Come up with ideas that serve these
needs and enter it very fast to success

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.990
which is the main thing that will
determine their success ratio.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.430
And so the initial idea,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.990
the only thing it does is that it tells
me whether they're really smart or

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.630
not because really smart people don't
come with really stupid ideas usually.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.889
But other than that,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.670
I don't put a lot of focus on this and
I used to do that in the past.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.470
So when I look at some of the companies
that invested in early on

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.090
I probably would not have
invested because I had

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.780
thought that some of the teams
were okayish, not perfect.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.440
But the ideas were good and these
company, it's clearly did not succeed.
