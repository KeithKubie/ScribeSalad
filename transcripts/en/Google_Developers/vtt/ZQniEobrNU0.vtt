00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.540
One of the interesting things that Clicker.com
showed is the use of video.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.040
Video is one of the most important forms of
communication on the Web.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.130
Just like images are very popular on the Web.
But as developers, when you use images on

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.780
the Web, you have a plethora of choices and
formats, including open and freely implementable

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.100
format like PNG.
We think video should have the great free

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.359
and open alternative as well.
It's really important for the Web to have

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.059
at least one alternative for video which is
high quality and open.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.559
So we've been thinking hard about this problem.
In fact, we are very, very committed to this.

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.120
And we have invested over $120 million in
acquiring On2 Technologies to contribute towards

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.620
this vision.
So today, we want to talk about VP8, but before

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.440
that, let me tell you a little bit about On2.
We got to know this team last year.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.420
They're a set of passionate, committed engineers,
based in Clifton Park, New York, they've been

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.670
working on the video space since 1992.
So when we started taking a look at VP8, we

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.740
were very impressed with its quality.
The VP line of codecs has had over 2 billion

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.270
installs and has been adopted by products
like Flash, Skype, et cetera.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.250
It's really suited for the Web.
To serve video on the Web, you need to deal

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.890
with a lot of varying conditions, from a bandwidth
standpoint, from a client standpoint.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.090
There are many, many mobile devices which
are connecting to the Web as well.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.110
VP8 is really good at adapting to these varying
conditions.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.380
It's very efficient with bandwidth as well.
We have our 2 billion video views on YouTube.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.789
So we care about that.
VP8 is very efficient with bandwidth.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.570
In addition, we believe it's the best-in-class
codec for real-time streaming as well.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.440
So overall, we are really impressed with VP8.
So today, we would like to announce that we

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.759
are fully open-sourcing VP8 under completely
royalty-free license.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:16.400
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: We are working with many

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.470
people in the community to do this.
And so there's a project called WebM which

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.880
we are announcing today, in conjunction with
many partners.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.210
And it's open Web media project.
It will have VP8 as the video codec, and it

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.330
will be packaged with open source audio codec
Vorbis.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.080
You can find more details about this at the
project site.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.770
But there's lots of excitement in the community
around this.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.240
And so to talk more about this, I would like
to invite two major browser vendors who are

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.610
pioneering a lot of the HTML5 work.
First, let me invited Mike Shaver, from Mozilla,

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.280
followed by Hakon Wium Lie, from Opera.
[ Applause ]

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:07.290
&gt;&gt;Mike Shaver: Thank you, Sundar.
And thank you, Google, for this huge investment

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.200
in open Web and open video.
We're now at a time whose idea has come, industrial-strength,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.900
royalty-free video with a high-quality open
source implementation, and, as you'll see,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.030
broad industry support.
More importantly, it will also have millions

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.060
of kitten videos.
As of today, I'm very pleased to share with

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.700
you, YouTube will be supporting the WebM video
format as part of its HTML5 beta.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.870
They've started converting their entire catalogue,
beginning with the higher-quality videos at

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.230
720P and above and that will continue over
time.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:51.810
With this, you can use high-quality video
built into the stack with great performance.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:03.150
[ Music ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Shaver: Mozilla has been interested

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.910
in open video for a long time, because we
want to see HTML5 reach its full potential.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.210
Since Firefox 3.5 almost two years ago, we
have been shipping the open source theora

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.160
codec and working with those developers who
were visionaries, really, in seeing the importance

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.870
of universal video very early on.
We're excited that they're joining with us

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.340
as well in supporting the WebM project and
have already started working on the code and

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.560
tools.
Video's key to the Web experience.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.790
And because of that, it needs to be part of
the Web, not just technically, but also in

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:41.340
terms of -- in terms of its use.
JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SVG, HTTP, all of these

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.660
technologies are usable under -- with no strings
attached, under any terms you want, to build

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.290
anything you want.
We wouldn't accept that HTML was only licensed

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.760
to be used for documents and not applications.
We wouldn't accept that you couldn't distribute

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.740
what you do with CSS unless you signed a license.
We've seen what happens and how much disruption

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.310
it can cause when the terms of a platform
change at the whim of one organization.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.061
And the Web needs to be above that.
The Web's growing important capabilities --

00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:14.000
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Shaver: -- to be clear, I didn't make

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.380
that happen.
[ Laughter ]

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.661
&gt;&gt;Mike Shaver: The Web's growing important
capabilities.

00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:22.900
As it does that, the demands on browsers increase.
We're working at Mozilla to make sure every

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.510
part of the stack is ridiculously fast.
This means taking advantage of graphics on

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.420
computers and mobile devices.
It means taking advantage of multiple cores

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:39.420
and DSPs and hardware from other WebM partners.
The VP8 codec itself in taking advantage of

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.060
multiple cores for low power and embedded
devices, is not only a great codec today,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.991
but it will scale in the future.
I say every year it's a great time to be a

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:52.180
Web developer.
And every year I get to be right about at

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.760
least that.
Open video's now here in high quality.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.570
Excuse me.
High quality, and it's embedded into the stack.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.400
It's part of everything you use now, like
text, like images, like CSS.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.030
Let me give you a taste of what you can do
when it's built into the stack and you can

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.040
use it with all the tools that you've come
to love over the past ten years of the Web.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.740
This is something we built with two videos,
a handful of images, and about 450 lines of

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.889
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG.
Anybody in the room could read through it,

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.960
understand it, use it in their own space.
No external libraries, no obfuscation.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.570
It's all right there.
You get real text built into the platform.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.000
You can select it, you can localize it, you
can search index it.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.130
You can animate it.
You get robots in circles, exploding and shooting

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.300
at each other.
You get high-quality video with custom controls.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.040
Scaling.
720P HD resolutions built into the platform.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.430
We give you control over the video experience
and how your users will find it.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.740
It won't surprise you to discover that Firefox
will be supporting WebM.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.919
It would surprise you to discover we weren't.
We don't -- our ambitions don't end there.

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.669
We want to see this in all browsers, on all
devices.

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.669
We want to see this available to every user
who is -- to take advantage of the great things

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:16.520
you people are going to built on top of this
platform.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.620
We've got nightly builds kicked off today.
You'll be able to take them and start building

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.040
your applications now.
And I want to thank you -- excuse me -- as

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.360
we get this technology out to 400 million
users on Maemo and Android devices as well.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.330
I want to thank you for your time today and
I want to thank you for building a fantastic

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:42.240
Web.
[ Applause ]

00:07:42.240 --> 00:08:11.250
&gt;&gt;Hakon Wium Lie: It's a fantastic day for
the Web. I'm very proud to be here. My name

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:19.060
is Hakon Wium Lie. I am the CTO of Opera Software.
Three years back in February 2007, we published

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.180
a proposal for the video element on the Web.
We also published a manifesto, because we

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.070
wanted there to be video on the Web.
The video was missing. We had text, we had

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.430
images, we had many things, but we didn't
have video.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.269
So we put forward this proposal, and we knew
it wouldn't be easy. Well, the first part

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:43.949
was pretty easy. The syntax was easy. We could
quite easily agree on the video element.

00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:55.379
The hard part was to find a high-tech, high-quality,
open, freely usable format for a video.

00:08:55.379 --> 00:09:02.470
And the great news mere today is that WebM
has joined the list.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:10.220
Tim didn't patent HTML, I didn't patent CSS,
Brandon didn't patent JavaScript -- we need

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.819
for there to be an open and freely usable
format for video on the Web, and, I think,

00:09:15.819 --> 00:09:27.610
WebM is it.
So I'm very proud to demo Opera here, running,

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:32.610
showing WebM.
The video you are seeing here is -- this is

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.750
from the 17th of May celebration in Oslo.
We do this every year to celebrate the video

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.740
tag.
[ Applause ]

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:49.839
&gt;&gt;Hakon Wium Lie: And you can download Opera
with WebM support in it if you go to this
