00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
As we've already seen for the algorithm that Alice was using, the running time of an algorithm

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:13.430
can often very dramatically vary with the size of the input that the algorithm has given,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.290
but the running time can also change with the content or the structure of the input.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.320
And here's the simple example to show you this.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:31.490
So the algorithm takes as input a string s(0) to s(n-1), which means it's a string of length n,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.450
so n characters in the string and here's the algorithm.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.700
So the algorithm does something very simple given that string.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.180
It counts the number of times that the character a appears in that string.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.280
So it sets the counter to zero and then goes through all the characters in the string one by one.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.380
And if that character is equal to a then it will increase the counter.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.220
So as in the previous examples, we're going to take this line here as a simple operation

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.400
meaning to take one time step each time it's executed.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.360
And we're also going to consider this one here as simple operation

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.310
meaning also this whole line here is going to take one time step each time it's executed.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.520
Now, what I would like you to do as our next quiz is tell me the number of time steps

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.200
this algorithm takes for a given string s.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.340
And to give you that answer, there are two things you need to know or two variables

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.190
you have to take into account.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.270
One is n, the length of the string, and the other one as you're going to find out is a,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.160
and with a, we're just going to denote the number of times that

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.300
the character a actually appears in that string.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.490
So your answer is going to be some formula that includes n and includes a,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.310
and I would like you to give me the running time by entering the coefficients in the following formula

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:04.370
so it's going to be some number multiply by n plus some number multiply by a plus a constant.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.250
Please enter those two numbers. So not the result of the formula.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.310
It's the running time of this algorithm when it encounters a string of length n

00:02:13.310 --> 99:59:59.000
where the letter a occurs exactly a times.
