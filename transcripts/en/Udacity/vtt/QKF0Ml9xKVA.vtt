That's right Lauren I'm here with Sean who seems to have the sharpest vision

00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:07.710
out of all our contestants. Tell me Sean how did you do it?

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.204
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well it's actually funny I don't have perfect vision.

00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:12.366
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You don't? How so?

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:15.928
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We'll I'm color blind. I have a really hard time distinguishing between green

00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:16.915
and red.

00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:20.324
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Very interesting. So your vision is still sharp but you can't distinguish

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:22.652
between those two colors. Do you know why?

00:00:22.652 --> 00:00:24.425
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Actually no, I don't.

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:28.306
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is interesting. Let's go back to the studio where we can discuss color

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:30.080
blindness in more detail.
