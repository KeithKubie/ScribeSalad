00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.300
Let's start out by talking
about assignments.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.820
On the left you will generally
see the assignments tab.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.340
This will bring you to a list of
assignments along with their due dates

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.140
throughout the course.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.680
If you've changed a time zone in
your preferences now you will see

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.550
the due dates in your time zone.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.130
To submit an individual assignment,
click on the assignment name.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.849
Once you're in the assignment,
you'll see the due dates here,

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.920
the instructions here.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.080
And then to submit the assignment,
you will type your answer here or

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.560
upload your submission here.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.260
Then you will click Submit here.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.020
So let me type in a quick response.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.450
Now I will click Submit.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.480
You should then receive
a Confirmation Screen

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.110
saying that your assignment has
been successfully submitted.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.310
Now if I go back to
the Assignments List,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.140
it will confirm that I have
submitted the assignment.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.550
Now let's talk about how I will
receive my grade for the assignment.
