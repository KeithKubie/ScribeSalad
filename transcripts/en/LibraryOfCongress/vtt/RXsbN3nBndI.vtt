00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.970
&gt;&gt; Roberto Salazar: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.720
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.930 position:56%
Native American History Month
programming is made possible in part

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.320
by the Office of Equal Employment
Opportunity and Diversity Programs

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.710
in association with the
American Folk Life Center

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.830
and Native American
Employees of the Library.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.740
Illustrating today's program also
is a display of collection items

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.210
from the holdings of the
Library's Curatorial Divisions

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.530
and the Veterans History Project.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.510
We're very thankful to the
Curatorial Divisions for providing

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.110
of their time, their staff
time to select, present,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.280
and safeguard these
treasures that include maps,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.130
manuscripts, photos, and books.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.220
One item of special note
is the <i>Cherokee Phoenix </i>,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.880
a rare original volume which is
described as a gold-level treasure

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.890
from the vault of the Serial and
Government Publications Division.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.690
One of four volumes,
it documents efforts

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.340
to connect Cherokee nationals and
gain support for Cherokee autonomy.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.360
We invite you to peruse
and view these items

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.370
after today's presentation.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.780
You will also be able to purchase
a book from today's presentation,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.040
<i>The Cherokee Diaspora </i>for
a very special price of $32

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.360
and our guest speaker, I'm sure,
will make himself available,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.160
we hope, to sign your
copy of the book.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.830
My colleague, Carrie
Lyons, will now join me

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.970
in introducing today's program
and our featured speaker.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carrie Lyons: Thank you, Roberto.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.890
Good afternoon to everybody.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.190
I am Carrie Newton Lyons.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.280
I am a section research
manager and attorney

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.170
at the Congressional
Research Service.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.350
I'm also an enrolled citizen of
the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.010
First, I'd like to thank everybody
for coming to our program today

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.050
to celebrate Native American
Heritage Month and I'm going

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.520
to give a special thanks to
all of my colleagues at CRS

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.730
who are out here to support me.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.030
So thank you very much.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.060
My deepest gratitude to all of you.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.370
This program came about -- about
six months ago in a meeting

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.450
that Jennifer Manning
and Eric Eldridge

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.110
and I were having in my office.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.500
We were discussing how we needed
to get an early start on planning

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.010
for Native American Heritage Month.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.040
And naturally, I got off topic and
started commenting on my desire

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.780
to write an article about
the belief of many Americans

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.720
that they have Native American
ancestry or Indian blood.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.890
Well, I was talking about
it because I'd had a friend

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.190
who had recently revealed

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.200
that he thought he might have
some Native American ancestry.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.130
And I'm sure you've seen
all of the commercials

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.390
for these DNA testing
companies where people discover

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.080
that they have a percentage
of Native American blood.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.730
Well, two weeks later,
Jennifer sent me an article

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.150
from <i>Slate Magazine </i>titled "Why Do

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.170
So Many Americans Think
They Have Cherokee Blood?"

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.350
And I had been scooped
by our speaker today,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.800
Professor Greg Smithers [laughter].

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.570
But it became very clear that
issues of identity and questions

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.660
about who are our people are
incredibly important in America.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.960
And the further evidence
is the success

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.940
of these DNA testing
companies and the multitude

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.390
of genealogy research sites that
you can find on the internet.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.100
It also became clear that Professor
Smithers would be a great person

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.750
to come and speak to us in honor
of Native American Heritage Month.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.450
And that his research, and his
articles, and his books are helping

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.460
to resolve some of those issues
that we're all grappling with.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.350
Now, before I turn it over
to Professor Smithers,

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.970
I just want to give a few
brief details about him.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.810
He received his BA in History from
Australian Catholic University

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.420
and his PhD in History from the
University of California at Davis.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.670 position:56%
He currently teaches at Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.100
And he is the author of
several books including one

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.160
that you could purchase
today on race and history.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.390
I am thrilled to have
him with us here today.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.510
So please help me welcome
Professor Greg Smithers.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.110
[ Applause ]

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.470
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: Thank
you all for coming today.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.230
Special thanks to Carrie
Lyons, of course,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.240 position:56%
and Roberto Salazar for inviting me.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.180
I'm delighted to be here.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.560
And before I get started,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.570
let me just acknowledge the
Algonquin-speaking ancestors

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.550
who are the traditional
owners of the soil

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.680
that we are now all standing on.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.060
I've been teaching for quite
some time now in various parts

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.810
of the world, in Australia where
I was born and raised, in Hawaii,

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.920
in Scotland, and of course,
here in the United States --

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.180
in various parts of
the United States.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.700
And it never has ceased to
amaze me when I teach classes

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.860
on Native Americans in the
Southeast, how that student body

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.990
who takes that class
insists that they --

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.690
as the title of this lecture
indicates, have a grandmother

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.880
or more typically a great-great
grandmother who has stories

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.350
of their Cherokee ancestry.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.270 position:56%
So common was this several years ago
that I started taking a head count.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.570
And it never ceases to amaze me.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.510
It's about 25% of the class
of about 40 students who claim

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.940
that they have Cherokee ancestry.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.860
And this has been the case whether
I was working at the University

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.490
of Aberdeen in the north of
Scotland, or giving guest lectures

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.780
at the Australian National
University in Canberra,

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.120 position:56%
or working back here in Virginia and
other parts of the United States.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.910
This is quite extraordinary and so,
that was the genesis for this book,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.770
to try and understand
why so many people think

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.090
that they have Cherokee ancestry
in their family and I do apologize

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.120
to Carrie for scooping you
on that <i>Slate </i>article.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.070
But I do believe there's much more
to be written about this topic.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.680
I don't believe that anything that
I had written or other scholars

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.520
of the Cherokee experience
have written is the final word.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.440
I think this is an
ongoing conversation

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.450
that we are having
and are involved in.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.030
I'm hoping that our knowledge
is being deepened by the work

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.120
that we are producing both for
academic audiences but also

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.870
for popular audiences
and the readers

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.910
of publications like
<i>Slate Magazine </i>.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:10.270
Today, there's approximately
one million Americans

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.190
who self-identify as Cherokee.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.660 position:56%
That is people who believe that they
have a Cherokee ancestor somewhere

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.030
in their genealogy.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.130
That's become an important article
of an individual's identity,

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.940
it seems, in the late 20th
and early 21st century.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.490
And this explosion -- for
one of the better expression,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.790
in people who claim
Cherokee ancestry,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.850
begins in its modern formation

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.300
around the late 1960s
and early 1970s.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.630
And it seems to have become
mainstream during the early 1970s

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.430
and it coincides with a
public service announcement

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.250
that featured the gentleman
you see there on the screen.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.860
He's -- his stage name
was Iron Eyes Cody.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.230
Some of you are no doubt old
enough to remember that commercial

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.290
and his work in Hollywood,
in film and on television.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:11.170
Iron Eyes Cody was the child

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.170
of Sicilian immigrants,
born in New Orleans.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:20.060
He appropriated an identity
for himself as a Cherokee man

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.790
and he became quite a
successful actor in his own right.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.540
If you ask his descendants, his son
and grandchildren, they will insist

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.190
that Iron Eyes Cody
was indeed Cherokee.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:40.610 position:56%
Now the evidence is contrary to that
but the question remains, well why?

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.720
Why were there so many people like
Iron Eyes Cody who appropriated

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:51.190
such an identity in the late 20th
century -- from the 1970s forward?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:56.520
Part of the answer to
that is directly related

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.210
to what some historians
and sociologists refer

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.030
to as the ethnic revival movement.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.430
Ethnic revivals begin in the 1970s

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:12.760
and what they basically entail
are Americans rediscovering

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.060
and reconnecting with their
ancestry -- their ethnic ancestry.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.140
This is also the era one must
keep in mind of multiculturalism.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.190
The Western world is
embracing ideals

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.660
around multiculturalism
in the 1970s and 1980s.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.970
And it's during this era then when
people discover that they're Irish,

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.990
that they're German, that they're
Hungarian, that they're Italian,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.980
and that they're Native American.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.620
That these identities -- excuse me,

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.770
begin to proliferate
throughout American culture.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.360
Part of this is a cynical attempt,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:59.350
as the historian Matthew Frye
Jacobson has pointed out to try

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.950
and mitigate the impact of racial
tension that existed in 1960s

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:09.370
and 1970s America to try and
flatten out racial experiences.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:15.160
That we are all immigrants and
that in some way, racial suffering

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.550
and racial experiences have a
degree of equivalency about them.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.640
And that's -- that is,
indeed, misleading.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.950
And I can go into more
details about that.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.730
But that gives you some
sense in the modern context

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.440
of where this proliferation

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.040
in people claiming Cherokee
identity comes from.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.940
Navajo was, at one point, the
most popular identity for people

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.120
to self-identify with in the
United States in the 1950s and '60s

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.220
and that's largely a product
of Hollywood filmmaking.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.700
Thank you, John Wayne.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:59.430
But Cherokee becomes the identity
of choice and it still is today

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:04.170
for people who insist that
they have Cherokee ancestors.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.790
So I'm going to come back to this
question then and take a detour

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.740
through some of the
major points that I talk

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.530
about in <i>The Cherokee Diaspora</i>
because it's in that book

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.120
that I wanted to understand
this modern phenomenon.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:24.610
<i>The Cherokee Diaspora </i>is really
a book about origins and becoming.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:30.920
It's a story that places
history and heritage in conflict.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.920 position:56%
Heritage is that phenomenon scholars
point out of creating meaning.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.680
And that's what many Americans have
been doing not only since the 1970s

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.990
but for quite some time,
almost from the beginning --

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:49.160
indeed, from the beginning of
our republic trying to create

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.090 position:56%
and cultivate some sense of meaning.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:59.340
Historians sometimes in a rather
snobbish fashion are dismissive

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.470
of the heritage industry.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.310
We trade in evidence we
like to convince ourselves.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.170
We get at the facts of the past.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.520
But as I like to remind my
students, all facts are mediated.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.510
They don't understand what I'm
talking about but by the end

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.150 position:56%
of 16 weeks, they get it [laughter].

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.550
I nail it into them.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.190 position:56%
So who are the Cherokee people then?

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.420 position:56%
Let me give you a brief
introduction to the Cherokee people,

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.050
their culture which I have devoted
my career and adult life to.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.010
The Cherokee are an
Iroquoian-speaking people descended

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:44.220
possibly from migratory people
from the Northern Great Lakes.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.630
And they migrated southward
and settled in and claimed

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:54.020
as their hunting territory
parts of what is today Virginia,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.990
West Virginia, North and
South Carolina, Georgia,

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:05.190
Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.010
The linguistic and ethnic heritage
that the Cherokee brought with them

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.830
to help them found their
communities in the --

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.390
that were thriving by the time
the Spanish encountered them

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.300
in the 16th century,
carried with them the legacy

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.400
of their Northern Great
Lakes heritage.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.760
Iroquoian etymology is evident
in a number of the town names

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.500
in Cherokee country
in the southeast.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:39.350
Towns such as Seneca and
Kituwa underscore those links.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.930
Most archaeologists believe that
the Cherokee people have been

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:49.060 position:56%
in the southeast, in the Appalachian
Mountain region of the southeast

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.490
for at least 4000 years,
if not longer.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.420
And the archaeological evidence
is dynamic and constantly changing

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.950
so that we're always
reevaluating that chronology.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:07.040
By about 1000, the Cherokee
understood themselves to be

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:15.080
"the principal people", the Tsalagi
became politically identifiable

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.450
as town and clan communities
throughout the southeast.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.660
And as I mentioned, when De Soto
and his Spanish entrada moved

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.500
through the south from
modern-day Florida all the way

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.330
through the mountain south and
interior south during the period

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:39.710
between 1539 and 1542, they
encountered wonderfully dynamic,

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.680
sophisticated and I should point
out, interconnected societies.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:51.140
Societies that had long engaged
in trade, diplomacy, marriage.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.310
Most Native People in the
southeast practiced exogamous

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.610
marriage practices.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.540
That is they married
outside of their clan groups.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.450
These were incredibly rich
and sophisticated societies

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.090
that the Spanish encountered.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.150
Above all, it's important to note

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.210
that the Cherokee people
lived in towns.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.230
Their identities were
centered on towns, in fact,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.710
by the 17th and 18th century.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.310
The Cherokee people, many
schoolchildren come to my classes.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.810
By the time they get to college and
they have some rough understanding

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.410
that Cherokee people
belong to matrilineal clans.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.610
And that is absolutely true, seven
matrilineal clans connect people

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.510
from the different towns in
the 17th and 18th century.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:42.140
But on a day-to-day basis, if you
were to meet your average Cherokee,

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.900
say on the upper trading
path that ran

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.330
through the Overhill Cherokee
towns in modern-day Tennessee,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.250
you would encounter people
who would identify their name

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.280
and which town they were from.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.470
Which gives you a sense of what was
most important to their identity

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.950
as Cherokee people in the
17th and 18th century.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:08.930
It was a connection to place and
ecology, the ecology of a region

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:15.520
and an ecology that connected
one's town to a region as well.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.570
And this is what makes the
removal of Cherokee people

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.640
in the early 19th century
so traumatic.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:30.880
Because this is literally a ripping
of people from a sense of place

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:37.470
that leads to a discombobulation in
one's mental compass of the world

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.620
and their sense of community.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.490
And above all, community was hugely
important to Cherokee people.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.030
These are people who
nurtured reciprocal cultures

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:52.270
for many hundreds and thousands
of years in the southeast.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.220
At the same time, as
I detail in the book,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.960
the Cherokee people also
nurture migration stories.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.730
There are some wonderful migration
stories that the Cherokee relate

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:08.780
to Europeans when they begin
to arrive in the interior south

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.660
on a more regular basis in
the 17th and 18th centuries.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.100
Some of these stories talk

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.740
about Cherokee ancestors crossing
a great bridge that later sank

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.110
to the bottom of the ocean.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:26.750
Others talk about Cherokee
ancestors, the Ani-kutani,

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:32.990
a group of priests -- seven
priests who allegedly migrated

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.790
from a mythical island in the
middle of the Atlantic Ocean

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:40.740
and ultimately settled and helped
to establish the seven mother towns

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.760
in Cherokee country
in the southeast.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.920
And there are other stories too,
of movement and resettlements,

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.450 position:56%
about stories of Cherokees migrating
to the darkening lands, that is,

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.280 position:56%
lands west of the Mississippi River.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.100
And some, the so-called Lost
Cherokee, migrating to the base

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.090
of the so-called Mexican
Mountains --

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:07.430
you might all know them as the
Rockies -- and not returning.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:12.680
So there are stories of
movements, resettlements that exist

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.220
within Cherokee folklore
and mythology

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.700
and Cherokee oral histories.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.440
And in some ways, I think
that these histories are part,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.940 position:56%
though part of the way to explaining
why there are so many people

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.820 position:56%
in the United States, Canada,
Mexico, and other parts of the world

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.250
who believe that there are
connections to a Cherokee ancestry.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:42.080
Cherokee people have
long been mobile.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.070
They have been willing
to adopt outsiders

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.710 position:56%
into their communities and families.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.440
So it comes as very little
surprise then that there would be

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.550
so many people who have these vague
stories that have become vaguer

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.700
over time that connect
them to some sense

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.970
of Cherokee-ness or
Cherokee identity.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:11.210
On the screen there, what you see
is a reproduction or a recreation,

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.050
I should say, of a
typical Cherokee town

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.740
that Europeans would have
encountered on a regular basis

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.890
in the 17th and 18th century.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.730
This is a town where one's identity
would have been totally consumed

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:29.910
by the day-to-day operations
of agricultural production,

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:37.410 position:56%
of cultural engagements, of
educating children which was the job

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.790
of the women of the town and
the uncles of the children.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.930
Fathers had very little
to do with their children

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.940
in most Native Southern societies
during the 17th and 18th century.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.700
And that's a product of these
being matrilineal societies.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.420
Cherokee people began
to move their towns

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.620
over the course of
early 18th century.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.860
Certainly after the major schism

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.780
that occurred throughout the Native
South that led some societies

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.560
to reform after the
Yamasee War, a major battle

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:25.590
that took place very near the Lower
Creek towns in 1715 through '18.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.890
This had an impact.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.880
This war had an impact on
all of the Native South.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.880
For the Cherokee people, this war

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.410
in the early18th century was
the beginning of sustained

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:42.230
and almost daily contact
with the British.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:47.470
The British coveted the Tennessee
River, the little Tennessee

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.800
and the other navigable rivers
that ran through Cherokee country

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.280
as highways of the 18th century
that would provide them with access

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:02.800
to the Ohio and Illinois Valleys
to connect plantations and markets

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.550
and make settlement possible.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:10.690
The problem was that chiefs
like John Jolly who you see

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.840
on the screen there, they
controlled the Native South.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.160
This was Native country.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.870
And it's really not until
the late 18th century

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:25.830 position:56%
that the British are able to acquire
the type of control that they hoped

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:30.740
for and indeed the ultimate
control over the Native South.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:36.840
It really doesn't come until the
Removal Era in the 1820s and 1830s.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:43.760
It requires effort to remove over
70,000 Native Americans from East

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.800 position:56%
to North America before Anglo-Saxon
people can dominate the Native South

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.830
and the Ohio and Illinois Valleys.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:56.210
Now for many Cherokee
people like Chief Jolly,

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.960
who you see on the screen there,
they begin to grow despondent

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.560
and resentful of the
aggressive of Europeans.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.210
And they begin to relocate
their towns.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:14.090
They begin to do that firstly by
relocating towns to the interior

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.020 position:56%
of Cherokee country which goes a
long way to explaining why there are

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:22.740
so many Cherokees removed
from Georgia in 1838 and '39.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.690
They had been taking refuge
in what becomes the colony

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.900
and ultimately state of Georgia

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.900
since the middle of
the 18th century.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.490
That's not enough for some people.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:39.850
Certainly, it's not for
John Jolly and his followers

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:45.130
who become what I refer to in <i>The
Cherokee Diaspora </i>as the vanguard

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.880
of diasporic communities.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.150
They migrate to Arkansas
Territory and they migrate not

00:22:52.150 --> 00:23:00.000 position:56%
as they had once done as men engaged
in hunting and slave-raiding.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.150
They migrated as entire communities

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.690
with relatively balanced
gender ratios.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.490
This is something that is entirely
new in modern Cherokee history

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.190
than at the beginning
of the 19th century.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:22.810
By way of party knowledge perhaps,
Chief John Jolly is the man

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:27.350
who adopts Sam Houston as his son.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:31.260
And indeed, when Sam Houston's wife
leaves him while Sam Houston is

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.720
governor of Tennessee, Mr.
Houston has a mental breakdown

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:43.280
and seeks refuge and comfort from
his adoptive father, Chief Jolly,

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:49.940
and indeed migrates with the "old
settlers" to Arkansas Territory.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.750
The movement of Cherokee
people west then begins

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.860
to really accelerate
during the first couple

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.850
of decades of the 19th century.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.120
The man you see on the
screen there and I'm not sure

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.500
if there's a picture of him.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.800
This image is from the Library

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.900
of Congress collections,
I should point out.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:10.430 position:56%
And in fact, most of the images from
the book do come from the Library

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.420
of Congress' collections.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.940
This is Tahchee or Dutch.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.210
He becomes -- he's a
great warrior chief

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:25.050
and historians have written much
about his knife and various poses

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:28.540
that he has throughout
his adult life,

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.520
prominently displaying his knife

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.410
to the artist making
the rendering of him.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:41.770
He is -- he's a celebrated
war chief among the Cherokees

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.630
and he leads a group of
Cherokees into Arkansas Territory

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.760
and ultimately into Texas.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.140
What's interesting about Dutch --

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.770
and I go into much more detail
about Dutch in the book,

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:57.380 position:56%
but what's interesting about Dutch's
followers is many of them break off

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:04.680
and settle in Northern
Mexico during the 1830s.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.120
This is as a result of the Texas
effort to remove Native Americans

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.990
from the Republic of Texas.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:16.200
Others try to stay in
Texas and assimilate

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.800
into white settler communities
or join Comanche communities

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.400
who continue to terrorize
Anglo-Texan communities well

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.590
into the 19th century.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:35.270
And others ultimately of Dutch's
followers are relocated in 1837,

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.960
'38 into Indian Territory.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.700 position:56%
One of the more interesting things
about Dutch's followers is that some

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.250
of them seem to exist
as small communities,

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.820
very small communities isolated
from both settler communities

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.230
and other native communities
that are indigenous to Texas

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.110
and its Cherokee search
parties that find them.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:00.780 position:56%
Chief Ross, when he's reestablishing
government in Indian Territory

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.170
after the Removal crisis, sends
out Cherokee search parties to look

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.710
for lost Cherokees and they're
often delighted to discover

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.970
that there are people
who speak their language

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.970
and they can be reconnected
with a sense of community again.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.500
And this is very important.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.890
This sense of community remains
important through the 19th century

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.980
through the trauma of Removal.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.700
And I should point out
something about Removal.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:40.580
It is an effort that embodies
the exploitation of peoples,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:45.880
the expropriation of their
lands, and the use of technology.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:53.790
Railroads, steam boats, and so
forth to relocate tens of thousands

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.630 position:56%
of people from land that southerners
covet for their slave plantations.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:04.320
And so in the midst of all of
this, how does one maintain a sense

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.410
of community which is so
important to being Cherokee?

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:12.510
Part of the answer to that
resides with people like Sequoyah

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.970
who you see on the screen there.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.270
Sequoyah is the man
who is responsible

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:22.120
for inventing the Cherokee
syllabary, a phonetic system

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.850
of writing that does catch fire
among Cherokee people during the

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.880
early 19th century.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.470
Sequoyah is -- Sequoyah
makes quite a deal

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.290
of money actually selling jewelry

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.440
that he manufactures during his
adult like and he's something

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:47.120
of a cattle rancher for a period
as well during his early life.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.260
He has links to some of the great
Cherokee chiefs of the late 18th

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:55.270
and early 19th century such
as Tahlonteeskee who I write

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.240
about in great length in the book.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.030
Tahlonteeskee is one of those
chiefs who leads the vanguard

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.640
of Cherokee settlements
in the early 19th century.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:10.980
So in other words, Sequoyah grows
up, certainly not impoverished

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.680
but certainly not willing
to be passive in the face

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.990
of settler encroachment
upon their lands

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.480
and settler cultural imperialism.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:27.120
And so he sees -- the story
goes in his adult life,

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.630
Cherokee people being intimidated
by European Americans being able

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:35.110
to speak without talking.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:41.970
"There's nothing special in
that," Sequoyah allegedly says.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:47.250
And so he sets about trying to
come up with a system of writing

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:52.170
that can connect Cherokee
people, to enable Cherokee people

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.910
to speak without talking.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:58.400
Now, sure but now the Cherokees
think he's absolutely nuts

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.380
when he's doing this.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.790
But as I say, it does catch fire
very quickly and you do have

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:08.290
as over here, you can see
after the talk an example.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.710
One of the great examples
of bilingualism

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.310
in early 19th century
America, the Cherokee Phoenix

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:20.280
which in many ways is a product
of Sequoyah's fabulous invention

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.980 position:56%
and the hard work of Elias Boudinot,

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.520
the first great editor
of the Cherokee Phoenix.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:33.580 position:56%
Who also plays a significant role
in using language and culture to try

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.520
and connect people over vast
distances in this new reality

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:44.580
that is Cherokee life in an
American imperial context.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:51.720
So it is then by the 1830s
in that awful era of Removal

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.770
that separates families --
Cherokee families that leads

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.640
to great suffering on the part
of Cherokee communities --

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.430
that creates two separate
homelands for the Cherokee people.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:10.690
One that the Cherokees have to
recreate for themselves in diaspora

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.300
in Indian Territory,
which is located

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.580
in modern-day Eastern Oklahoma.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.500
This becomes a political homeland

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.170
for Cherokee peoples living
throughout the Americas and beyond.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.170
But what gives that homeland --

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.470 position:56%
that political homeland its enduring
meaning during the 19th century

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:34.130
and into the 20th century is the
recognition that there are some

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:38.560
of our ancestors the Cherokees
note in their writings,

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.810
in their lectures and so forth.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:46.800 position:56%
Cherokees who remain in North
Carolina, in the ancestral homelands

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.810
and it's very important then that
these political and western --

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:56.740
political homeland remain
connected to the ancestral homeland

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.820
of the Appalachian region.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.520
And we do see and I talked --

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.830
I write about this in
great length in the book.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.500
Cherokee people coming,
traveling back and forth

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.230
on a regular basis during the
19th century and the 20th century

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:16.050
to remain to try and cultivate
a renewed sense of community.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:22.150
And it is quite possible within the
context of that movement of people

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:26.010
that new relationships are
forged with non-Cherokee people

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:30.230
that give rise to these family
stories that I hear so often

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.010
in my classes from my students.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:37.820
I should point out also at
this point that in the decades

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:44.340
between the 1830s and the outbreak
of the American Civil War in 1861,

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.230
there is a phenomenon
sweeping across the Old South.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.800
It is the phenomenon
of white men claiming

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.820
that they have Cherokee
grandmothers.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.210
This is not a phenomenon.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:07.810
Why? Why did this catch fire
in the Antebellum Decades?

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:11.450
Well part of the answer
goes to the idea

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:15.550
that American colonialism
had successfully in the minds

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:19.240
of white Americans
removed all Cherokees

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.950
from Eastern North America.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.540
And so by claiming
a Cherokee identity

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:28.840
like claiming an Indian mascot,
you are engaging in a form

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.150
of cultural appropriation
and cultural imperialism

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.750
that denotes your -- in this
context racial, political,

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.510
and military superiority.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:41.400
That's one aspect of this.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:46.400 position:56%
But the other aspect of this relates
to the growing tensions that emerge

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.750
between North and South
during the Antebellum years,

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:55.040
the 1830s through the 1850s.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.310
This growing suspicion that
there was this authoritarian,

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.380
overreaching federal
government that was trying

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.750
to impinge upon the rights
of Southerners were just

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.540
like the Cherokees who were
removed by this overbearing,

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:14.780
overreaching federal government
in the 1820s and 1830s.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.370
And so there's this
false sense of identity

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.130
and misleading use of history.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:29.410
Indeed, I would say a cultivation
of a heritage here that goes part

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.370
of the way to explaining
why you have this phenomenon

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.090
in the Antebellum Decades.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:38.830
And it's this phenomenon and many
of the students that I've had here

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:44.120
and oh, down in Virginia tell
me that their ancestors relate

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.010
that it is during the early 19th
century that their relatives,

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:55.030
they found letters in old suitcases
and so forth, of relatives talking

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.620
about their Cherokee
ancestry during these decades.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.660
I think that is very revealing
about the cultural context then

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.850
in which this belief
begins to emerge.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:13.080
At the same time -- at the same
time and I should say it's easy

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.570
to be cynical about
some of this stuff.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:17.500
But at the same time that
all of this is happening,

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:22.550
Cherokees continue to be
moving throughout the Americas.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.700
The image on the screen there is
an image of the California road

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:31.730
that Cherokees regularly took
to California in search of gold?

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.770
But some settled and of all the
satellite Cherokee communities

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:41.070
in the United States today, the
satellite communities in Northern

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.550
and Southern California
are among the most active.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:50.100
And many of them can trace their
ancestors back to Tennessee,

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:55.710
Georgia, and the Old
Nation prior to Removal.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:59.430
Interestingly, this
California road didn't end

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.420
when it got to California.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:06.630
Many Cherokees decided after they
didn't find gold in California

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:12.070
that they would hop on a steamer
in San Francisco Bay and head

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:18.030
to the antipodes, to
Australia, and try and find gold

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:21.680
in the Victorian Gold Rush that
was occurring simultaneously.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:26.640
This was quite an extraordinary
transnational exchange

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.050
of cultures that took place then.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.950
Many Cherokees returned
again impoverished

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.030
from their efforts
to try and find gold.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.990
But there are examples
of Cherokees who did stay

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.690
and intermarry in Australia.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.250 position:56%
And I've met many of those ancestors

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:50.150
over the years while I've
been researching this book.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:56.880
The overarching memory that
dominates Cherokee stories

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.910
of migration and resettlement
is what was called in the 1830s

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.410
by the Cherokees, the
Great Immigration.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.850
I'm not going to tell
you how that term,

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.410
the Trail of Tears came into being.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:10.900
You have to buy the book to
find that out [laughter].

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:17.160 position:56%
But this was truly, as I mentioned,
an example of the use of technology,

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.420
political power, military power.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:27.130 position:56%
And it's this migration, this forced
migration that dominates narratives

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:32.630
of what it means to be Cherokee
going into the late 19th century.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:38.210
And it's really not until the era
of the Dawes Act and Allotment

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:43.670 position:56%
that we begin to renew conversations
about what it means to be Cherokee.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:49.100
During that latter
period in the 1880s,

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.570
when the Dawes Commission is doing
its work and land is being allotted

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.740
in Indian Territory,
what becomes Oklahoma --

00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:01.310
there are many Cherokee people
who refused to have anything

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.360
to do with the commissioners.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:11.370
They are both disdainful of and
distrustful of federal officials.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:12.670
And with good reason.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.660
They've heard the stories.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.540
There are many stories that
I collected from the 1920s --

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.700
that date to the 1920s and
'30s which go a long way

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.870
to explaining why many
Cherokee people would avoid

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.280
federal officials.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:32.290
Now that has an enduring impact
upon Cherokee identity to this day.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:37.150
Because there are tens of thousands
possibly of Cherokee people,

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:43.420
some of them working in academia,
who now have a very clear sense

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:48.890 position:56%
of their Cherokee ancestors but they
do not appear on the Dawes Roll --

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:53.150
that list of names that
determines one's connection

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:56.010
to the Cherokee Nation
and eligibility

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.170
into the Cherokee Nation.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:02.730
So this is really a
fraught period that's

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.650
in some ways marks a
new beginning then.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:10.060
If the Great Immigration of
the 1830s marked this sort

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:15.340
of dramatic beginning for
Cherokee people's living en masse

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:22.020
in diaspora, then a period of
relative stability certainly upset

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.770
by the Civil War which I
talk more about in the book,

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:30.190
is again unsettled and
new understandings emerge

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:32.000
out of the Allotment Era.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.970
And in many ways, the debates
about what it means to be Cherokee

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:40.730
that emerged out of the 1880s
and 1890s are even more fraught

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:44.050
and traumatic and really
quite visceral and violent

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.510
in some cases during this era.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:53.110
This is also the era then
in the late 19th century

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:57.460
where we do see a further
dispersal of Cherokee people.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:02.390
Cherokee people deciding that this
is no longer Indian Territory.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:06.660
Oklahoma is no longer a viable
option for their families.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.780
Many people choose
to live in diaspora.

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.780
Narcissa Owen is one of those.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.080
She's well known in
Washington, DC at the turn

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.190
of the 19th and 20th century.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:22.540
She marries a prominent railroad
engineer and lives for a period

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:27.150
in Lynchburg, Virginia and travels
back and forth during her life

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:31.290
between the Cherokee
Seminary which is located

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:35.110
in the Cherokee Nation
and Washington, DC.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:40.520
But Narcissa Owen is
in some ways fortunate.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.010
She was able to put her
name on the Dawes Roll.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:48.120
She was able to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt her Cherokee

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.850
ancestry at the end
of the 19th century.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.900
But many others were not.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.560
And I want to sort of
conclude by pointing

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.090
to the Cherokee Citizenship
Commission which, to my mind,

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.490
the evidence suggests that this
commission has an enduring impact

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:08.060
upon what it means to be
Cherokee in the 21st century.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.730
This is the commission
as I detail in the book

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:18.130
which separates families
based upon race,

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:22.920
ethnicity, language, and culture.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.060
There are some really
quite heartbreaking stories

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:30.020
of Cherokee Citizenship
Commission as using their positions

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:35.110
for political reasons to
punish political opponents.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:37.120
Now this is not uniquely Cherokee.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.450
This is something that
is very human, I think,

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:44.470
in a modern context
to do such things.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.090
But nonetheless, many of
the stories that emerged

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:50.250
out of the Cherokee citizenship
commission are really quite fraught

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.110
and for African-American
people in particular.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:58.850
The Cherokee Citizenship Commission
is something of a disaster

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:03.940
for many thousands of people
who by genealogy and by virtue

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:08.080
of their ancestors being
enslaved by Cherokee slaveholders

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.650
at the beginning of
the Civil War are cast

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.130
out of the Nation during
this period.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:20.620
Their evidence, no matter how
clear it is of Cherokee ancestry

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:27.960
or connection to Cherokee citizens
is deemed never quite good enough

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.770
by most of the commissioners.

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:37.410
So then, this brings us to today
then and the 2000 census where

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:44.470
"Cherokee" emerges as the
largest self-identified segment

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:46.990
of the Native American population.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:51.580
At that time, there was a
little under 730,000 people

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.310
who self-identified as Cherokee.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:42:00.080
The second largest group at the
time were the Navajo with a little

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:05.450
under 270,000 people
self-identifying as Navajo Indians.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:11.220
By 2010, that number had
increased again to a little

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:16.570
under 820,000 Americans who
self-identified as Cherokee

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.970 position:56%
and according to some of the latest
data as I mentioned in the beginning

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:24.590
of this talk, there is now
close to a million Americans

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.310
who self-identify as Cherokee.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:33.060
Keeping in mind that there are only
three federally recognized Cherokee

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:40.190
tribes, the Cherokee Nation,
the Keetoowah band of Cherokee,

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:44.420
and the Easton band of
Cherokees in North Carolina.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.940
These groups keep a very,
very close eye on all

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.560
of these people claiming
to be Cherokee.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.930
And in fact, both the Easton band

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.440
and the Cherokee Nation have
established what they refer

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.290
to as fraud list, a list that --
there are hundreds of these groups.

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:04.460
It's really quite extraordinary
how many groups there are

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:08.030
out there claiming to be Cherokee.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:13.690
And I'm more than happy to
address some of the complexities

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:21.910
of that fraud list and the history
behind it in question and answer.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:29.340 position:56%
But it does, I just want to conclude
by saying that one of the reasons --

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.310
at the end of the day,
one of the reasons I think

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.380
that so many people do
claim to be Cherokee is

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:40.610
because I do think Cherokee people
are victims of their own success.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:44.330
They are -- as I was mentioning
to someone before the lecture,

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:51.180
they have a history of being superb
diplomats, excellent lawyers,

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:57.800
wonderful self-promoters and this
is something that is evident.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.350
I wrote a piece in the <i>Journal of
Native South </i>a year or two back

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:04.480
that talks about the role

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:09.260
that Cherokee heritage making
among the Easton Band had

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:16.780
in attracting ordinary Americans to
Cherokee country in North Carolina.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:22.540
That success, I think, has
contributed and led to the 1970s

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.600
in the era that we're
still living in --

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.270
in by helping to explain why

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:30.950
so many Americans believe they
have a Cherokee grandmother

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:33.290
or great-grandmother.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.110
And on that note, I'll
leave it there.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.540
And thank you for your
attendance and more

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.370 position:56%
than welcome to take your questions.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:41.170
Thank you.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:55.680
[ Applause ]

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.190
Yes, ma'am.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:04.600
&gt;&gt; In the beginning of your
talk, you mentioned that it was

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:12.400
in the late '60s or early
'70s when Americans started

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.910
to discover their [inaudible]
their ethnic ancestry.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:22.930
Was this even before Alex
Haley published <i>Roots </i>or are

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:24.230
there [inaudible]?

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:26.190
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: When
does Haley publish <i>Roots </i>?

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:30.930 position:56%
Isn't that like 1971 or thereabouts?

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.420
Who can correct me on that one?

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.830
It's about the same era.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:39.280
Yeah, it's part of this general
sort of cultural movement

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.120
in the United States at the
time for people to reconnect

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.920
with their ethnic origins
and their heritage.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:50.790
And I mean, ultimately this gives
way to this sort of modern stuff

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.740 position:56%
that Carrie was talking about in her
introduction with the DNA testing.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.490
&gt;&gt; 1976?

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:58.450
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers:
1976 -- thank you.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:02.510
And I should point out too,
the popularity of shows like

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:06.210 position:56%
"Who Do You Think You Are" and I
think PBS has genealogical detectors

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.440
or detectives or something.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:13.060
This is -- this is -- we're
still in this moment, I think,

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.490
of ethnic revival and
people reconnecting

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:16.790
with their ethnic heritage.

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:19.340
One of the things that's
interesting about this

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.510
from my personal professional
experience is that when I taught

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:29.610 position:56%
in the UK for several years,
English and Scottish kids and adults

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:34.460
that I spoke to couldn't
understand why Americans were

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.170
so obsessed with this stuff.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:40.530
They really -- they did not
-- surprise, to my surprise,

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:44.950
did not have that same sense
of connection or desire to find

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:46.640
out that connection
that Americans do.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.710
And I think that must be --

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:54.560
that it had something to do with
the settle colonial experience

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.840
of the late 20th century that
helps to explain that, I think.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:10.090
That sort of all the turmoil
that went on in the 1960s

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:14.120
and that resulted in so much urban
unrest, I think people then sort

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:18.320
of -- and the embrace
of multiculturalism,

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.880
I think it was then more
acceptable post Jim Crow

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.590
and post racial segregation
and lynching

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:32.010
to then fully trying
to embrace one's roots.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.930
&gt;&gt; Do you have a question?

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.030
Yes, [inaudible] in the corner?

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:40.270
&gt;&gt; Would you say a little bit about
Cherokee language revitalization?

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:43.670
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: Yeah, that's
something that's very important

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:48.250
that has been accelerating in
both -- among all of the tribes,

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.470
federally recognized tribes
since the Second World War.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:55.530
The Easton Band put in place
language revitalization programs

00:47:55.530 --> 00:48:00.490
in the 1950s and they sort
of went dormant for a while.

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.950
But they've been reignited again
over the past 10, 15 years.

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:07.980
And the Cherokee Nation is
doing the same thing as well.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.650
So -- and this is urgent work.

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:12.580
I should point out
that it's being done

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:16.390
because the language is the
more dire report that I saw

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.350
about six months ago suggested

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:23.410
that there are only 500 fully
fluent Cherokee speakers left

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:24.710
in the United States.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:27.210
There are many more who have
some smattering of the language

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:29.970
and knowledge of the language.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:34.020 position:56%
But in terms of being fully fluent
and being able to relate the stories

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.420
of what it means to be
Cherokee and Cherokee folklore

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:42.900 position:56%
and historical narrative in the
language -- to lose that would be --

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.320
would be a total tragedy
and tantamount

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.270
to a form of great cultural loss.

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:50.580
So it's urgent knowledge
that's being --

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:53.840
urgent work, I should
say, that's being done.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:49:00.310 position:56%
The problem, as I understand it
from linguist friends that I have is

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:05.980
that many children in Cherokee
communities don't see the relevance

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.330
of learning the language.

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:11.970
Again, sort of universality
of kids, I guess,

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:17.390
and they don't recognize the
cultural importance of this stuff

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:20.750
until often it's too late until
they're well into their middle age.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.280
And then their brains
are not as plastic and --

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.580
why are you laughing,
Carrie [laughter]?

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.150
Our brains are not as
nimble and able to sort

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:30.670
of grasp the intricacies
of learning a new language.

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:35.030
So that's one of the major
challenges that those involved

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:37.250
in these efforts are facing.

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:39.310
Just this one further
thing about that.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:42.350
I will say that I have some good --
there are some good friends of mine

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:46.190
and colleagues working at the
University of North Carolina,

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:50.910
Chapel Hill, and they are being
very aggressive and very proactive

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:54.720
in trying to ensure that
the language remains alive.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.570
They are connecting with the
Easton Band on a regular basis.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.040
They are holding symposia and
workshops for both Cherokee

00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.780
and non-Cherokee people in the hope
that this language will not die.

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.080
So there are efforts that are
being -- that are ongoing.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; All right, next is [Inaudible] --

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.680
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] you shared some of
those [inaudible] that your comment

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.980
on Cherokee in the [inaudible].

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.280
Is it likely that that's
really what they looked like

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.580
or there was some artistic
[inaudible].

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.880
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers:
That's a very good question.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.180
Yeah.

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.480
&gt;&gt; But they don't -- I
wouldn't have thought.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.860
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: Now
there's a couple of ways

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.910
to actually answer that question.

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:21.140
One is the artists often did
take liberties and imposed

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.790
on those Cherokee chiefs.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:26.410
We see this in 1730
and again in the 1760s,

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:31.050
in 1763 when there are Cherokee
emissaries who go to London.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:33.740
Some of the artists who
reproduced the likenesses

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.440
of those chiefs reproduced
them in this sort

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.710
of noble Greco Roman kind of form.

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:44.480
This is, you know, the noble
savage motif and imposing a sense

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:50.890 position:56%
of authenticity, indigenous
authenticity on these, on these men.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:53.800
So that's one way to look at it.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.610
The other thing and I think
there's more than a grain of truth

00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:59.810 position:56%
to this is that by the 18th century,

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.330
and certainly by the early
19th century when some

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:07.940
of those images were produced, the
Cherokee people had a long history,

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.800
several centuries now
of intermarriage.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.340 position:56%
And so many Cherokees looked awfully

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.290
like your average back
country settler

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.570
of Scottish or Irish ancestry.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:24.310 position:56%
It was very difficult to distinguish
based upon physical features.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:31.390
Cherokees from poor white
settlers or white settlers, period.

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:34.030
So that also, I think,

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:39.050
goes to explaining the
nature of those images.

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:44.600
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering when
you talked to your kids about --

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.450
your students, I'm sorry,
not your kids [laughter].

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.100
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers:
They are my children.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.000
&gt;&gt; What do you normally
[inaudible] about, you know,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.790
how many of them identify
as Cherokee or how many --

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:55.130
so you talked a lot about heritage

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:58.080
but do you ever discuss the
differences between people

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.170
who culturally identify as
Native American or Cherokee

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:02.840
and the difference between
people who just say,

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.140
"I have a great-grandmother."

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.440
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: That's a
wonderful question actually.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.740
Yeah, I do.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.040
We talk a lot about that.

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.810
And for a lot of people, it's not
something that's really lived.

00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:13.860
It's something that's just there.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:18.540
You know, Granny or Great-Grandma
talks about it as you know,

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.230
we have this Cherokee ancestors.

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:24.280 position:56%
And it makes us kind of exotic is
the sense I get from these students.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.250
So there's not the sense
that they're living.

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:32.140
They're not living at a
sense of Cherokee identity

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.490
and this is very important
because experience

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:38.310
and experiential knowledge is at
the core of traditional knowledge.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:42.810
So in that sense, what they're
actually articulating, I find,

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:47.260
is a racialized sense
of indigeneity.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:51.630
That is to say, this sort of
"Well, I have X amount of blood

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:57.460
that is Cherokee, or Creek,
or Choctaw and this makes me

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:01.340
in some ways connected to
this larger Cherokee diaspora

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.600
or community of indigenous people."

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:09.400
And it elides the sort of important
cultural and linguistic factors

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:13.440
that we've been talking about and
sense of community that remains

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:17.300
at the core of Cherokee
identities in the 21st century.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:22.520
So yeah, so at the bottom line is
my overarching sense of all this is

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.460
that people have a very
superficial understanding

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.780
of what Cherokee identity means
and when they do give voice to it,

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:33.410
it's in this sort of very
racialized blood quantum sense.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:36.640
&gt;&gt; So I know [inaudible]
from Australia.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.960
I was wondering in your research,
did you find any similarities

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.940
between Cherokee Nation
and the aboriginal tribes

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:46.090 position:56%
in Australia in terms of oppression?

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:47.890
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers:
Oh, yes [laughter].

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:51.650
My goodness, we don't have
enough time to go into that.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:56.140
I've written about that and I have
a revised edition of a book coming

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:59.520
up called <i>Science, Sexuality
and Race </i>which talks

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.330
about that in great detail.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:05.090
Yeah, the parallels
are quite striking

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:10.630
and I originally got my start in
studying Native American history

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:14.850
as an undergraduate when I was
working as a research assistant

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:17.690 position:56%
at ATSIC which is the Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Commission.

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:22.580
You see, I came of age in Australia
at a time when land rights,

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:26.280
recognition of aboriginal
land rights was foremost

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.370
in everyone's political
consciousness.

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:31.910
And as an undergraduate,
as a college student,

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:36.250
I worked on researching, doing
the historical research for some

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:40.670
of those legal briefings that were
being put together during the late

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:43.380
'80s and early '90s.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.400
And it's at that moment
that I realized,

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.510
well there must be a
broader context to this.

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:48.810
And indeed there is.

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:50.910
And it goes beyond
the United States.

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:54.720
In fact, it touches every
set withcolonial nation state

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.880
that there is today.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:01.910 position:56%
So yeah. So the parallels are really
quite striking of frontier violence,

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:07.770
of the removal of people to
access their lands and resources,

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:12.390 position:56%
the forced use of indigenous labor
which is not often something we talk

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:18.210 position:56%
about but the British colonies could
not have been possible if it was not

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.570
for the Indian slave
trade of the 17th century.

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:26.810
And the selling of so many
thousands of unnamed "Indians"

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:31.470
into slavery throughout the British
colonies and the Caribbean as well.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:36.150
So the connections then are
just quite extraordinary

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:38.350
across both time and space.

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:39.650
&gt;&gt; You [inaudible] --

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
for your presentation.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.500
Fascinating and really interesting.

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.800
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: Thank you.

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.500
&gt;&gt; There was an earlier question
about the notion of when identity

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.390
for Native Americans comes
sort of into a vogue or part

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:53.590
of the vocabulary and I think '76
is perhaps as [inaudible] goes,

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:57.210
'76 is perhaps a little
too late in the game.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:00.110
Unlike, you alluded to the Civil
Rights Movement, for instance,

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.660
of 1960s and certainly you'd
want to take into account things

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.320
like the occupation of Alcatraz
by Native American [inaudible].

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.620
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: Oh, I
absolutely agree with you.

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah and of course, you have
AIM and the Second Wounded Knee,

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:14.230
the massacres and, you know,
also for instance that 1968,

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:18.460
you have the Poor People's Campaign
which brought together people

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.490
from Native American communities
with African-Americans.

00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:25.280
And also Hispanic people to march
on Washington and actually set

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:28.570
up a tent city which was the last
major thing that Dr. King did

00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:33.410
and was planning on
before he was assassinated.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:35.440
They still went ahead anyway.

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:41.500
And then, you know, I was
in the southwest recently

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.930
and identity becomes a
very interesting thing

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:48.450
because you see the histories
of people who had to go serve

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:51.970
in the war with the Navajo
Code Talker [inaudible].

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:57.680
But there were other groups
from Native American --

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:07.300
from Indian country who were also
recruited precisely to do the kind

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:11.300
of work in the trenches
and do a lot of, you know,

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.340
break codes [inaudible]
transmit secrets in languages.

00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:18.790
But yet, their polarization
came when they came back

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:22.970
and were denied full
citizenship even though, you know,

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:29.680
they had fought for the
country in World War II.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.980
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: Right.

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.780
&gt;&gt; So I think there is a -- it's
a moving target [inaudible].

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.880
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: Oh, I
absolutely agree with you.

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:40.500
&gt;&gt; And then as you said, it's very
complex but it's something to think

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.690
about because in all
these instances,

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:49.690
identity is not just a claim
in the name of multiculturalism

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:52.100
but it's a very political act.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.480
It's a violent political act.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.780
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: Right, yeah.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.080
No, I agree.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.380
I agree. No, I completely agree
with everything you've said.

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.880
For non-indigenous community
members though, I think,

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.480
it's really this culmination
is, you know,

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.710
the appropriation is
what I'm referring

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:07.820
to in the late '60s and early '70s.

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:10.520
But you're absolutely right
about that pre-history

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.100
that you're talking about.

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:18.260
A term that I don't
particularly like to use but yeah,

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:22.170
Cherokee Code Talk, as
I should point out too

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:23.830
and I mention this in the book.

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:26.230
There were as many
Cherokee Code Talkers

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:28.740
or Code Breakers during
the Second World War

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.970
as there were Navajo
Code Breakers as well.

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:34.160
So yeah, so this -- and during
the Second World War also,

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:41.620
I should point out, that
Cherokee people living in places

00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:49.790
like Illinois and Ohio throughout
the east, in New England,

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:53.650
in the Mid-Atlantic,
they were very clear

00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:56.480
when they enlisted, who they were.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:04.560
So yeah, this is absolutely a
political statement on their part

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.170
but it's also just a statement
of their being as human beings.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:11.750
They did not want any -- a
single molecule of their identity

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:16.750
as human beings to be taken
from them by bureaucracy,

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:18.880
or popular culture, or so forth.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:23.490
So I think that those are
extraordinarily valid points

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:24.790
you raised.

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:26.090
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:27.500
&gt;&gt; Follow-up question.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.550
Were there among Cherokee people
the same set of circumstances

00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:33.580
that happened with the
Removal and the Indian Schools

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.900
which their whole point was to
[inaudible] Native American kids?

00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:36.370
Is that -- is there a similar
thing going on with the Cherokee?

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:37.670
&gt;&gt; Gregory Smithers: Yup, there is.

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:38.970
Yeah and it lasts well into
the 20th century as well.

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:40.270 position:56%
And again, this is one of the
tragic consequences of the Dawes Act

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:41.570
and the Era of Allotment
more generally is

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.000
that the federal government closes
down those educational institutions

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.710
that the Cherokee Nation had built
and cultivated since Removal.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:46.300
The Cherokee male and female
seminaries were the first advanced

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:47.770
level educational institutions
west of the Mississippi.

00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:49.300
And they are closed down by the
federal government during the

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.860
Allotment Era and this leads
to this sort of tragic era

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.540
of dispersing children throughout
all corners of the United States

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:53.840
and that is indeed
something that I talk

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.140
about in the book at great length.

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.440 position:56%
Because the consequences of it are
really quite tragic, because many --

00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.740
many children feel so ashamed
of their indigenous heritage

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.040
that they go to great
lengths to try and hide it.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.340
So much so that some
of those children refer

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.640
to themselves as Swiss.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.940
You know, adopt this sort of Aryan
identity in the early 20th century.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.330
So it's really quite sad
and tragic what happened.

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:07.740
