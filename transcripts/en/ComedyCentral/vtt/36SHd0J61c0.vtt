00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:05.205
( man )
She witnessed the
whole thing.

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.040
She is the key to
solving this murder.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.075 align:start size:72% position:28%
Okay, so what is it you
actually need from me?

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.711 align:start position:0%
She has multiple-personality
disorder.

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
The one that saw the
murder is named Kimberly.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.648 align:start position:0%
We need you to bring
out that personality.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.050 align:start size:59% position:41%
See what I can do.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.056 align:start size:47% position:53%
Hi there,
I'm Dr. Morgan.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.924 align:start position:0%
( with accent)
Hi.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.360 align:start size:63% position:38%
I'm from the South.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.863 align:start size:47% position:53%
Would you like
some lemonade?

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.331 align:start size:53% position:47%
That's a southern
accent?

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:34.501 align:start position:0%
I would love
some lemonade.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:35.969 align:start position:0%
What's your name?

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.570 align:start size:47% position:53%
( with accent )
My name?

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.072 align:start position:0%
Yes, I bet a beautiful
southern belle

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
has a beautiful
southern name.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:41.941 align:start size:38% position:63%
I'm not from
the South.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.710 align:start size:50% position:50%
I'm from London,
my name Will.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.645 align:start size:72% position:28%
She sounds like a
God-damn chimney sweep.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.313 align:start position:0%
Is this a
different person?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.882 align:start position:0%
You sound kind of...
like the other girl.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.784 align:start size:47% position:53%
( with accent )
What'cha mean?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.686 size:84% position:42%
A second ago I was talking
to somebody from the South,

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.455 align:start position:0%
but you're
from London.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:59.426 align:start size:41% position:59%
( Childlike )
I'm this many
years old.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.528 align:start size:59% position:41%
My name's Katrina.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.496 align:start position:0%
I got one that age.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.065 align:start size:59% position:41%
Doesn't this bother
you a little bit?

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.301 align:start size:56% position:44%
Doesn't this upset
you at all?

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.838 align:start position:0%
Okay, good, now
we're getting somewhere.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.441 align:start position:0%
Hi... Katrina.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.009 align:start position:0%
Can you tell me

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.144 align:start position:0%
if Kimberly can
come out and talk?

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.612 align:start size:41% position:59%
I'm Melinda.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.514 align:start size:56% position:44%
I'm the sexy one.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:25.318 align:start position:0%
Excuse me
a minute.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:28.988
She's mocking
us, right?

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:31.191 align:start size:47% position:53%
No, she's not.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.826 align:start size:47% position:53%
You know those
people who are

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:33.893 align:start size:63% position:38%
just really terrible
at doing accents?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.428 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.063 align:start size:50% position:50%
Well, she's one
of those people.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.665 align:start size:56% position:44%
Unfortunately, she
happens to have

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:39.866 align:start size:69% position:31%
a multiple-personality
disorder.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.501
For Christ's sakes.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.069 align:start size:66% position:34%
Fascinating,
she actually believes

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.737 align:start size:53% position:47%
she's these
different people.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:45.972 align:start size:66% position:34%
She just doesn't have
the faculties

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.440 align:start size:72% position:28%
to create the dialect.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.242 align:start position:0%
So you're saying
that she...

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.910 align:start size:72% position:28%
She sucks at having
multiple personalities.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.179
( with accent )
Get me out of here!

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:54.314 align:start position:0%
What is that now?

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.748 align:start position:0%
Is that an Asian?

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.283
Jamaican,
I don't know.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.052 align:start size:72% position:28%
Look, whoever you are,

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.020 align:start size:69% position:31%
we really need to talk
to Kimberly, please.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.188
Who?

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.156 align:start size:56% position:44%
Is this Kimberly?

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.858
Yes?

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.126 align:start size:59% position:41%
Kimberly, what did
you see last night?

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:12.198
I...

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:14.234
"sawr a moon
wid da goon."

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.436 align:start position:0%
Oh, what is
she saying?

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.904 align:start size:72% position:28%
She's worse at doing
accents than I thought.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.372 align:start size:34% position:66%
Can you...

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.407 align:start size:44% position:56%
slow down
when you talk?

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:22.942
I...

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.511
sawrs...

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:25.945
a moon...

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.214
wid da goon.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.283
Is that the Swedish chef,
what is it, come on.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.487 align:start position:0%
No Swedish chef, you can
sometimes hear what he's saying.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.990
Can we please just go round
up a bunch of black guys?

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:40.426 align:start position:0%
Yeah, let's do that.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:41.993
( with accent )
Hello?
