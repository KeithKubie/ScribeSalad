00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:05.672
NARRATOR: In the Blue Ridge
Mountains, with cash in hand,

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.708
Eustace is finally ready to make
his down payment on the land

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.276
next door.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.011
EUSTACE: Feels really
good to get this last bit.

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:14.814
I've been struggling so
hard so long all winter

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.751
long just to get
this down payment.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.619
Now I've got it.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.987
NARRATOR: He spent
three decades building

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.423
Turtle Island into
a sanctuary, hidden

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.059
away from the outside world.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.095
Now to protect it, he's
racing to beat the competing

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.697
bidder to the punch.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.599
EUSTACE: I'm heading
straight over to Ronnie's

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.202
cause I've got to get this
down payment in his hands.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.272
Because I'm just really afraid
somebody else might get it.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:40.039
I can't have that.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.278
What you say, Ronnie?

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.679
Hey how are you
doing, Eustace?

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.281
EUSTACE: Doing all right.
Good to see you.

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.582
Good, man.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.985
Man, you got a nice
spot for a garden here.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.253
RONNIE: Thank you.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.821
EUSTACE: That's like a million
dollar view right there.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:55.822
Beautiful, ain't it?

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.123
EUSTACE: Yeah buddy.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.792
Speaking of money, I
brought you something.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.326
I appreciate you
writing me that letter.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.528
You haven't sold
it yet, have you?

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.030
RONNIE: No.
Man I'm glad you showed up.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.432
EUSTACE: Well thank you.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.401
And it's just real nice sort of
like sense of relief like, OK.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.702
It's happening.
I'm doing it.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.737
I got the money.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.272
I'm handing it off.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.107
The land is secure
as long as I can

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.775
keep going with the payments.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.744
RONNIE: So since we last
spoke, you really been working,

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.212
ain't you?
EUSTACE: Oh my gosh.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:23.049
I've been selling hogs,
cutting trees for people,

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.251
milling lumber, selling lumber.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.653
Here's what I got
to show for it.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.987
I got the deposit here.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.289
RONNIE: Wow.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.056
Well thank you, man.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.090
You're a man of your word.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.492
EUSTACE: Yeah buddy.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:35.562
NARRATOR: The $30,000 payment
earmarks the land for Eustace.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:39.532
But he will fully own it until
he's paid off the balance.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.167
RONNIE: I'm glad to
have you getting it.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.902
We'll keep that land wild.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.304
RONNIE: Yes sir.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:47.040
NARRATOR: It's a process that
will take years of hard work.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.743
But it's a small price to pay
for the freedom to live free.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.479
Thank you again.
I really appreciate you.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.947
Yes sir, Eustace.
See you around, buddy.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.348
EUSTACE: All right.
Take care.

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:58.251
To me, there's a way too much
over development in this world.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.488
And I want to do at least my
part in keeping some of it

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.088
wild.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:10.096
NARRATOR: As dawn breaks over
the Blue Ridge Mountains,

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:14.067
Eustace begins a new
chapter at Turtle Island

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:17.170
by paying his respects
to its fallen forefather.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.559
Well buddy, I
secured that land.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:46.032
Yeah, we're going
to keep it wild.

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:49.102
I knew you'd appreciate that.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:52.472
Preston and I all of our life
have enjoyed the wild land.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:55.542
And it's just a commitment we've
had in our entire adult life

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:59.746
to try to keep some of it clean
and wild, preserved, taken care

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.215
of so that future
generations can enjoy it,

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.752
and even just like, see
what wild land looks like.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.987
And so here's one more piece.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.489
And I'm carrying
on the tradition

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.524
and keeping the
commitment and I feel

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.260
good about that achievement.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.262
It's been hard without you.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:19.365
We're keeping it
going best we can.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.668
Your son's been helping me out.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.972
Joseph, James,
Travis, all helping.

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:30.643
I appreciate you being
here with us in spirit.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.413
I'm missing Preston terribly.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.381
But he wouldn't
want me to give up.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.317
So I'm just going to
try to do the best

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:41.220
I can to honor our friendship.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.190
If I want to survive,
I got to keep going.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.993
So I'm just going to
keep forward thinking

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:48.728
and forward momentum
and hopefully, we'll

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.763
just keep going with
this vision and plan

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.333
and see it through til it works.
