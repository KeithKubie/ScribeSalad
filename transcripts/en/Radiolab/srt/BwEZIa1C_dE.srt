1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,433
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,680
All right, great. You're
listening to radio,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,010
the podcast from New York public radio
and public radio. Neville, you are

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,030
c. N. N. P. R. Hello.

5
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:19,470
This is Jad from Radiolab a while
we work on season four of radio lab,

6
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:23,940
which we hope to release sometime in the
new year very soon in the new year we

7
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:28,200
thought we would play you some excerpts
from a talk that Robert and I gave at

8
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,180
the apple store in Soho.

9
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,930
They asked us to come talk about the
show and we ended up talking about the

10
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,660
thing that we never actually
address explicitly on the air,

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,590
which is how we use sound, which
we do a lot of on radio loud.

12
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:42,240
This is the one time we
actually have to talk about it,

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,430
but 250 people showed up to hear us.
I fired some clips from my laptop.

14
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:51,720
They had this big beautiful sound system
and a very fancy screen behind us and

15
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:56,400
we started the whole presentation with
a a piece of tape that got stuck in our

16
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,200
heads as we were making
one of our programs.

17
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:02,310
It's a little clip that became the basis
for the musical language show and we

18
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:03,150
played it for the crowd.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,560
It happened during an interview with a
developmental psychologist by the name of

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,460
Anne Fernald.

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,840
She was talking about how moms talked
to their babies and she said this thing,

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,691
well you know,

23
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:17,760
I think it's more where we're used
to thinking of sounds like that as,

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,480
as being about something because
uh, speeches always about something,

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,700
but it feels to me more like touch
where touch isn't about something.

26
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:30,790
If you whack me on the
arm in a sudden sharp way,

27
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,240
I'm going to be startled or a gentle
touch has, has a different uh,

28
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,970
effect. And I think, you know,
actually sound is kind of touch at a,

29
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:40,960
at a distance

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,060
sound is kind of touch at a distance.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,290
For some reason that phrase
just stayed in the air,

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,570
sound is kind of touch at a, at a distance

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,350
and it just didn't. And I thought,
well, you know, that I said to him,

34
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,900
well you know that actually
that's literally the case.

35
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,260
Cause if I'm making the sound
basically through this enhanced device,

36
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,710
air is pulsing. And it's going into
your ears. And actually, you know,

37
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:06,470
we could do a journey, uh, that way. We,

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,440
there's another reporter in our group
named Jonah Lehrer was up in living in

39
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:12,590
Concord, New Hampshire. We called
him. He began sending us notes.

40
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,510
He had a notion, which
we'll explain in a bit,

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,900
but this is then what we made and uh,

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,860
Al gonna play it to you first and then
we're going to dissect it and yeah,

43
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,750
you'll see when a genius
I'm working with actually.

44
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,610
All right. So this is, um, this is
an interview with Robert and Jonah,

45
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:35,900
which we embroidered, shall
we say, more like Tut.

46
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,630
It's just waves of vibrating air.

47
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,463
Um, it's just

48
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,100
into my ear. A little
ton of waves of diffuse,

49
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:09,940
vibrating air focused and
channeled into my eardrum,

50
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,840
which vibrates a few very small bones

51
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,260
and the little bones transmit
the vibration into this salty sea

52
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,210
where the hairs are. And the
hair cells are fascinating.

53
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:26,980
The hair cells become active when
they are literally bent by weight.

54
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,190
[inaudible]

55
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,390
Ben, like trees and a breeze.

56
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,320
And when these hair cells band

57
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,340
charged molecules

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,860
blood inwards and activate the cell. So

59
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,963
all those changes,

60
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,130
it's only when the electricity

61
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,180
touch sound is kind of
touch at a, at a distance.

62
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,430
Now I don't exactly know how he did that

63
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,170
and I don't exactly know. You
know, I mean at the time, well,

64
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:38,440
should I show that I like jump on your,
if you could just break it down. Sure.

65
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,570
Of when you open up sound in a sound
editor, it looks Kinda like that.

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,450
So you see that each of the
[inaudible] podcast listeners,

67
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm going to interrupt here just to
tell you visually what happened next.

68
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,010
I took that scrap the sound that we just
heard sound is like touch at a distance

69
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,400
and I opened it in the sound editor and
it popped up on the big screen behind me

70
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:01,180
and what the audience saw was the way
form of that sentence in a way form.

71
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,580
It looks kind of like a mountain range.

72
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,900
Each little piece of sound
is like a peak or a valley.

73
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,480
And if it's a sharp continent, it's a
sharp peak. If it's a vowel, it's broad.

74
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,870
And I demonstrate it to people how
you can literally grab these little

75
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:18,010
mountains, these little hills of
sound and stretch them. For instance,

76
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,650
if you took the ch from touch,

77
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,410
just the Cha and you
grabbed it and stretched it,

78
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,120
he would sound something like this.

79
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,620
So that's true. Extended over
a long period of time. Yeah.

80
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,230
And you hear how it sounds, it starts
to sound a little bit like wind. Yeah.

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,190
So that plus let's take the breath
that you're just pointing to. Yes.

82
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,780
And let's do the same sort of, you know,

83
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:48,960
smearing of that moment
combined with the other thing.

84
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:49,980
And you get something like this

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,753
[inaudible]

86
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,490
that's built from an for nodes,
voice from nothing added,

87
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,510
nothing extra in her breath

88
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,480
and her, yeah, no, let's take
the tongue of touch. Yeah.

89
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,590
And just use that, the little grains of
sound that are in the top and then, uh,

90
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,360
started those and you
get something like this.

91
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,740
[inaudible].

92
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,240
So there you've got wind,

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,650
you've got a nice low sort of gravelly
watery thing going on and you've got the,

94
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,790
which is the, uh, the sound of the
hairs bending in the years perhaps.

95
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,940
And then you've got you,

96
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,960
you built the whole thing out of her
sentence with a few exceptions with the

97
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:44,050
bones, except for the bows, except
for some splashy splashy water.

98
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,290
The entire journey of sandwich you heard
a moment ago, and we'll play it again,

99
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,740
is built entirely of that
sentence completely and
totally from the [inaudible]

100
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,900
bones. I know we're
extra, right. I couldn't,

101
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,660
I couldn't figure out how to do
that with just, wow. It's just that

102
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,250
there's one last thing. Can
I just, with the electricity,

103
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,420
I don't know if you're wondering
that, is this the hard s on distance?

104
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,930
Can I have to use your imagination?

105
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:15,430
But that run through many distortion
filters in the volume jacked up becomes

106
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:16,264
this

107
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,730
really? Yeah. Because in a, in a,

108
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,710
I don't hear any or I
just hear [inaudible]

109
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,420
well if you can imagine that little
peak there at the very end being a much

110
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,810
more, um,

111
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,270
much more pointy and tolerant peak and
then running it through basically the

112
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:41,460
same kind of distortion pedals. I right

113
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,090
for everybody to listen again
to the exact same thing.

114
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:47,240
Now that you know that the entire
thing was the manufacturer from the raw

115
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:49,280
material of just one sentence.

116
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,620
Let's just hear it one more
time and then we'll move on.

117
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,430
But realize that this has been a re
this is just basically a reassembly

118
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,640
from the raw stuff. More like today.

119
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,390
It's just waves of vibrating air.

120
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,273
Um, it's,

121
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,993
yeah,

122
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,220
the little ton of waves
of diffuse vibrating air
focused and channeled into my

123
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,570
eardrums, which vibrates
a few very small bones

124
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:44,090
and the little bones transmit
the vibration into this
salty sea where the hairs

125
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:48,540
are and the hair cells are fastening the
hair cells become active when they are

126
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,740
literally bent by waves.

127
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:53,960
[inaudible] they bend

128
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,130
like trees and a breeze.

129
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,140
And when these hair cells
been charged, molecules

130
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,140
light inwards and activation itself.

131
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,590
Oh, so the sound triggers the bones

132
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,940
more like touch sound is kind
of touch edit at a distance.

133
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,550
Sound is also in our case we use it for
a variety of things and one of the more

134
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:58,551
important elements is at is is a kind
of paint we like emotion and feeling and

135
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:05,421
surprise and we are always trying to
goose what we've got and in a show about

136
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:09,540
minds and bodies and the
conversation between body,

137
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,290
brain and body that goes on constantly
and sometimes gets out of hand and

138
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,170
sometimes gets us confused
as to show coming up there.

139
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,790
So we haven't heard this
hasn't been aired yet.

140
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,090
There is a scene in which
we have some pilots.

141
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,080
These pilots have been brought into a
room and they'd been put into some kind of

142
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:27,210
a sort of a centrifuge kind
of thing. They [inaudible]

143
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,900
yeah, let, let me, let me,
uh, n Kara are you guys here?

144
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,830
Those two very fine radio
producers right there. Um,

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,770
they talked to a lot of
pilots about something that
was happening to pilots many

146
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,440
years ago. Pilots fly in
planes that go very fast.

147
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:47,310
And when they make these fast heart
turns, there's a tremendous amount of, uh,

148
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,910
gravitational force that's
applied to their person,

149
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,430
which if you've ever heard
the term g-forces, that's,

150
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,510
that's what we're talking about as the
turns get harder and faster is a very

151
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,410
unfortunate thing that
happens to the pilots,

152
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,240
which is that the blood in their brains
gets pulled violently and pools in their

153
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:08,070
abdomen and they black out,

154
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,560
which is not a good thing to happen
when you flying a plane. So, uh,

155
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,900
there was an experiment
which we wanted to profile.

156
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:18,780
And so Anne and Kara interviewed
the Guy who did this experiment.

157
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,760
He got a bunch of pilots
into a centrifuge,

158
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:24,990
which is this big lung 50 foot
arm that spins round and round.

159
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:29,991
And at the end of this arm is a mock
pretend cockpit pilots sit in that pretend

160
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,890
to fly a plane chasing an enemy
aircraft. And then all the way I'll get,

161
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,030
do they have to sit and do something?

162
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,400
They have to pretend they're flying and
it's a flight simulator essentially.

163
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,110
And they get spun around really fast.

164
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:43,170
And then they black out and
when they black out Jim wintery,

165
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:46,620
the researcher measures how long
they're blacked out. What happens?

166
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:49,050
Do they convulse don't they convulse
all kinds of various things.

167
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,950
The result and they're called back.
They try to get them to wake up.

168
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,980
Yes they do. No, right.

169
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,120
Yeah. I guess that's what saying. Um, so,

170
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,670
so we're going to play I guess a minute
and a half clip from that piece. Um,

171
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,770
they essentially they, those two
over there asked these pilots,

172
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,810
well what does that like
tell us about the experiment.

173
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,740
Give us a sort of sense
of, of, of how that,

174
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,050
how that was for you. Scared

175
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,830
pilots don't do scared.

176
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,320
[inaudible] 10

177
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,140
[inaudible]

178
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,720
the task was to chase
this little airplane.

179
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:30,380
So I'd sit there and you'd follow it.
And first couple of maneuvers would be,

180
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,640
you know, three gs g
forces as they is the,

181
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,540
well it's like a tick when
you're on a rollercoaster,

182
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,160
five gs that forest pins you back
in your seat. Yeah. Seven gs.

183
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,600
Except really on a roller coaster.

184
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:44,960
You're only ever going to experience
about two gs and then nine gs.

185
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,690
Nothing like these guys.
The Hydro g forces hurt

186
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,680
the skin on your face,

187
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:53,610
sags your eyelids sag so low that you
can't see out from under him and you end

188
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:57,360
up tilt your head back to look out from
under your own eyelids that are shaking

189
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,000
down in front of your
face. Meanwhile, yes,

190
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,830
you're tensing all your leg muscles
and your abdominal muscles in your arm

191
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:05,830
muscles as hard as you can. Learn
to use your body to fight it.

192
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:09,160
And what you do is you tend to every
muscle from your toes to your calves,

193
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,170
push it out, push it all the way
up, all the way up, okay. And uh,

194
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,050
you take a breath, right?

195
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,960
And you start to say the word Hook
and you hold it for three seconds

196
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:26,170
and then you finish it off by finishing
the k of the hook through these pilots.

197
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,390
They sound like they're wrestling
or fighting or something.

198
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,980
They're grunting and groaning and hook.

199
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,663
[inaudible]

200
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,690
making all these hook noises,

201
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,353
select that

202
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,750
the most you have ever pulled was 12.4 gs.

203
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,220
Now you can understand
when you listen to that,

204
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:57,280
there's a couple of tensions that
I, you know, that were introduced.

205
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,960
How do we know that what we've
just heard is a real thing?

206
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,020
All right. Our thing,

207
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,970
well, um, I see where you're
going with this. Um, I,

208
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,620
the Ed Moreau kind of
ques. Sure, sure. Um,

209
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,930
these are real interviews. If that's,
I mean, just to sort of clarify. Um,

210
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,410
they were done very much not knowing
how they would be sort of composed and

211
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:24,090
arranged in the, in the, in
the, uh, in the final product.

212
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,060
It just so happened in
the case of the hook,

213
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,400
that's just something that pilots do.

214
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,520
And every pilot that they talked to
made that sound and it's something,

215
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:39,450
there's something very visceral in
percussive and musical about that moment.

216
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,390
So when you get to that moment
where they actually do the hook,

217
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,200
it becomes a kind of musical event
at that point, you know, which is,

218
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:50,580
I think one of the secrets of our
notion to storytelling is that it is a

219
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:53,660
musical. You're trying, you're playing
with rhythm, you're playing with meter,

220
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,250
you're playing with beats. So when
you've got these sort of great vocal,

221
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,110
whatever those are, you just treat them
almost as, as a composer with notes.

222
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,850
I think you have a raw
interview with a pilot,

223
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:07,980
do you not and you have that enhanced one.

224
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,460
I think it'd be interesting just to hear
what it sounds like when they did it

225
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,250
and what it sounds like after he

226
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,840
abused it and then, so
let's just hear this.

227
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,320
Do we need to set this up at all?
This piece? Yeah, I'll do the setup.

228
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,990
This is a one of one of our guys
that we heard just a moment ago.

229
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:25,090
His name is Tim Sestak. He's,

230
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,300
if you can imagine the course of
this experiment getting spun around,

231
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:30,040
spin around, spin around
while he blacks out.

232
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,500
This is the moment which he comes to or
he's recalling that moment and he's in

233
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:39,640
this little pod and he has to
kind of assess the situation.

234
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,173
When I woke up,

235
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,430
I remember just sitting there and
I mean this little white space.

236
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,870
I actually had no idea who I was,
where I was sure what I was doing.

237
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,140
So I'm sitting in this little white ball
and I'm looking around and I hear this

238
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,350
beeping. There was this
white light beeping,

239
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,030
and then at that moment I realize
that I'm in a little room and that I'm

240
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:04,470
supposed to do something in that.

241
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,780
One of the things I'm supposed
to do is press that button.

242
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:12,010
Should I press the button? And at that
moment I realized, holy Macron a pilot.

243
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,330
I'm in an airplane and I'm not flying it.

244
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,380
And I grabbed the controls
and then just in a giant rush.

245
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,210
I'm Tim Sestak. Holy Mackerel.
Tim says stack. I'm Tim Stack.

246
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:23,921
I'm a pilot.

247
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:28,630
I'm flying in the centrifuge all came
back to me at once and I was okay.

248
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,560
Alright, so that's the
wrong sun sound design.

249
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,110
Let me just go right ahead
now see what you did. Do it.

250
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,430
[inaudible]

251
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,263
when I woke up,

252
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,500
I remember just sitting there and
I'm in this little white space.

253
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,350
I actually had no idea who I was, who
am I, where I was or what I was doing?

254
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,440
Why am I doing this?

255
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,510
I'm sitting in this little white ball
and I'm looking around and what is this

256
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:57,960
all about? I hear this beeping.
There's this white light beeping.

257
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:58,470
Okay.

258
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,490
And then at that moment

259
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,820
I realize that I'm in a little room and
that I'm supposed to do something in

260
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:08,130
that. One of the things I'm
supposed to do is press that button.

261
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,930
Should I press the button?

262
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,730
[inaudible]

263
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,990
and at that moment I realized,

264
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,020
holy macro on a pilot and I'm in
an airplane and I'm not flying it.

265
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,830
And I grabbed the controls
and then just giant run.

266
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm Tim Sestak, Holly macro. I'm
Tim Sestak. I'm too obsessed. Jack.

267
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,481
I'm a pilot.

268
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,890
I'm flying in the centrifuge all came
back to me at once and I was okay.

269
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,040
Okay. Commando [inaudible] Dr
Minute, how are you feeling again?

270
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,300
Am I to go home time

271
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,960
now? You see there's a real
difference there. I mean, there are,

272
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,850
there are stunning silences.

273
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,370
There are times when the sounds are
slightly piled up on each other and the

274
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:57,450
instinct to do that will raise in some
quarters some questions like, you know,

275
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,630
like who's the, what
experience are we having here?

276
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,400
[inaudible] hours or he is at the same
time. I mean, here's our argument.

277
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,590
I mean anticipating that
someone might have this problem,

278
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,960
we are manipulating reality
to a degree, but it is the,

279
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,490
it is the music that we create.
It is in some way our sort of,

280
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,770
yeah, I mean how I would, how
I would put it as that. Um,

281
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,630
in the case of the thing you just heard,

282
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:27,460
it's a little sort of story lit that has,
you know, he's, he's in a white space.

283
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:29,260
He's doing all these
things as a story. I mean,

284
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:30,680
you have to follow the story I guess.

285
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,360
I mean I think people are savvy enough
to know that when you are leading them in

286
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,390
places that the story doesn't want
them to go. And in that moment,

287
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:40,270
I mean there are, you look for the
transfer transformation moments.

288
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:44,770
Like he has five or six points
where he wakes up, you know,

289
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,460
he's in a white space kind of womb.
Like all of a sudden, oh my God,

290
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,430
I'm in a plane, I have to fly
the plane. And then, oh my God,

291
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,360
I'm Tim says stack.

292
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,510
It's like this whole journey of life in
this little like moment and so all that

293
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:58,690
the sound is doing there,

294
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:01,240
I mean there is some emotional
information's being conveyed,

295
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,630
but really it's just sort of hammering
each point of transformation.

296
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:08,410
It's saying it's sort of like
in a kind of punctuational way,

297
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,960
it's giving a kind of
explanation point on each one

298
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:11,730
and,

299
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,380
and we do this to ourselves in this
sections in which we're talking back and

300
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:18,020
forth and arguing and they
are real actual conversations.

301
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,960
We are very conscious of the musicality.

302
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,550
So there will be times when he will say
basically take it down or things like

303
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,090
that rather frequently. Yes. Cause
I, this is like a difference in age.

304
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:29,790
I mean if,

305
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,530
if you're born in the fifties and
sixties and stuff or you're born in the

306
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,320
eighties and nineties I think you
have different jokes, different music,

307
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,510
different conversations in your head,

308
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,990
a whole different set
of how you read life.

309
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,810
And when I often noticed
with Ellen and Shannon,

310
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,450
some of the people that I have to work
with who are younger than me is I'll come

311
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:50,530
in and I'll say, okay, here's how we
should do this. The Guy, I look up to,

312
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:54,920
a follower, Robert, Robert, quiet. Yeah,

313
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,100
they do that. And so I
accused him of this intense,

314
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,630
ridiculous desire for irony and distance.

315
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,480
And I feel that I'm being blamed for
my own heart pounding. I an opinion

316
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,100
deference to you. We, you often tell us
to get interested, stop being so mellow.

317
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,570
And then that's also,

318
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,020
but we are having absolutely
a generational struggle
in the middle of all this

319
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,060
because what I love to hear and with he
and g and them love to hear are actually

320
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:26,270
different sounds. And so
you really whack each other.

321
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,570
What we end up doing in these
conversations in the studio is I go,

322
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,410
those are my comments. I'm
the less, I go last and goes,

323
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,160
we have the Lego Llamas.
I go, yeah. I said, yeah,

324
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:40,010
that was, yeah. You know, and then I
look at Ellen and I said, that was young.

325
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,170
That was good. And it's frankly
in comprehensible to me,

326
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,190
it's still even now, I mean to sort

327
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,740
of bring this grid, it
is the middle space,

328
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,460
the middle space between your
tendency toward want to sort of uh,

329
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,200
perform in a more forward way.

330
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,360
My tendency to want to kind of lean back
there is that middle ground which I I

331
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:02,080
hope to show kind of lives in,

332
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,830
which I neither of us could
come up with on our own. No,

333
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,260
and we both share it. Fairness, this
idea about touching at a distance.

334
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,980
Okay. Here I played a clip
from one of my personal heroes.

335
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:19,981
Walter Merge is a great film editor who
did the Godfather apocalypse now called

336
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:20,690
mountain,

337
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,820
a million other great movies and he's a
great thinker about editing and sound.

338
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,360
As far as we can tell from
the evolutionary record,

339
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:33,361
the oldest sense that we have is either
the sense of smell or the sense of touch

340
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,130
that that's how Ubers and bacteria is
used to navigate around in the world.

341
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Hearing is a very refined sense of
touch and it developed of all the five

342
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:48,304
senses.

343
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,990
It's the latest to be
developed by living entities,

344
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,090
owners.

345
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,090
The paradox about hearing is that as
the child is growing in the wound,

346
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,320
it's the first of the senses to get hooked
up about four and a half months after

347
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,670
conception, which is to say
halfway through gestation,

348
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,680
the trial begins to hear now the child
was not seeing anything because it's dark

349
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:15,514
in there.

350
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,760
The child isn't tasting anything or
smelling anything but hearing for all

351
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:25,200
intents and purposes, the world into
which the child is developing that,

352
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,780
which is to say the mother's
middle is full of sound.

353
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,200
It's got the weather's
heartbeat 24 hours a day.

354
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,810
It's got her breathing 24 hours a day,

355
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,110
the gurgling of her intestines
at certain times of day.

356
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:43,111
It's got her voice and remembering
that the wound is pretty thin,

357
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,820
there's nothing to prevent
sounds from outside.

358
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:50,821
The father's a music penetrating in and
being heard by the developing child.

359
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,480
So sound as touch starts way, way early.

360
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,640
Okay. So moving right along,

361
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:03,020
we then played a clip from a segment
from our musical language show,

362
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,520
which looks at a particular piece of
music, Igor Stravinsky's rite of spring,

363
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:12,470
and what it can teach us about how our
brains deal with unpleasant noises.

364
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,480
In 1913, Stravinsky premiered the
rite of spring. It was a ballet.

365
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,650
Nijinsky did the choreography and when
it premiered, all hell broke loose.

366
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,290
Robert and Jonah layer
do the play by play.

367
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,550
So let's begin first. Uh, Jonah, what,
how does this, um, just set the scene?

368
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,320
This is May, 1913. The
spring night. It's a,

369
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,100
it's a balmy summer
night. Black Tie costumes.

370
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:42,640
The women have their fedoras. This
was evening clothes. Yeah. Well,

371
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,830
this was the Russian
ballet. This was high art.

372
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,420
And the program's had, this
is a concert about springtime,

373
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,650
but as they settled into their seats,

374
00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:56,160
it turns out that what's driven ski had
in mind was not spring like honeybees.

375
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,540
No, this spring Stravinsky
had in mind was about change,

376
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:04,320
about radical change,
ritual murder. Literally,

377
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:08,270
that's what the story of the play is.
It's, it's a pagan ritual where the end,

378
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,220
the virgin gets massacred. Oh dear.

379
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,290
[inaudible]

380
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,300
but the music itself is fascinating.

381
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,690
The beginning is this
very charming bassoon.

382
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,700
It's a classic Lithuanian folk and it
does sound like the earth is warming

383
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,080
and that lasts for about a minute.

384
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,840
And then we get some Tutti
of flutes and it's lovely.

385
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,280
It's getting a little more disturbing.

386
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,720
And then about three minutes into it

387
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,043
[inaudible]

388
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,470
everything changes.

389
00:24:59,560 --> 00:24:59,680
[inaudible]

390
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,700
there's this, there's just an
earthquake. Stravinsky plays this cord

391
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:06,570
[inaudible]

392
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,960
there's a great story that when Diaghilev
who's the head of the ballet reus

393
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:13,620
first heard this cord insurance. He
was playing on the piano for him.

394
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:15,720
He asked her Wanski how long
will it go on like that.

395
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,150
And Stravinsky looked at him and
said to the end, my dear. And,

396
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,130
and it literally does that
cord structures, the music

397
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,570
[inaudible]

398
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,500
it's one of the most difficult
sounds you've ever heard. It is.

399
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:31,790
It is just the stereotype
of desinence. Yeah.

400
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,050
[inaudible]

401
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,470
it hurts you, Huh? Well what happened?

402
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,270
Well, after about three minutes,
they ride it. They rided

403
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,230
meaning what? Like they scream
or through, they scream.

404
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,130
There was blood old ladies were
hitting each other with canes.

405
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,350
One Lady Lady, she had a gun
and hit Stravinsky with a cane.

406
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,550
But once they started screaming,

407
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:02,610
Stravinsky ran backstage and
by some counselors crying,

408
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,420
the ski was off on the side of the stage
screaming to his dancers to keep the

409
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,740
beat. Dude. Wow. Quite the fiasco.

410
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,560
And the question is why,

411
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:15,541
you know,

412
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:19,320
what I love about that is that it's
three minutes simply to ask a question,

413
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,230
which is a question we're
interested in, which is like,

414
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:27,231
why does music sometimes create
such a like intense emotion,

415
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:32,460
not always good emotion. And the
why that we go on to sort of answer,

416
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,000
uh, subsequently is that,
um, there, it turns out,

417
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:38,660
and this is new science and
it's speculative science,
we should say there is,

418
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:42,180
there are already these gangs of neurons
and a particular part of your brain

419
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:46,860
called the auditory that are
responsible for decoding new sounds,

420
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:51,000
sounds that you've never heard before.
And they generally do a really good job,

421
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:54,120
but every so often they hear
sounds, which are relentlessly new,

422
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,200
which it was in this case. And there
it never goes back to the sounds.

423
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
They know. And in those cases,

424
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,250
when they fail and they can't decode the
sounds, they squirt out some dopamine.

425
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,150
And dopamine is not always a bad thing
and little dopamine makes you feel happy.

426
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:16,020
That's why sex and drugs and chocolate
and various things make you feel good.

427
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,130
But too much dopamine has been shown
clinically to cause schizophrenia.

428
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,750
Now we don't want to oversimplify
schizophrenia, but perhaps,

429
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,220
and this is the argument we put forward,

430
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,840
what happened that night was that their
brains flooded with dopamine and they

431
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:32,010
literally went crazy.

432
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,170
And then we go on to propose
that a year later in Paris,

433
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,350
a year later, this same guy
comes back to the same hall,

434
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:43,530
plays the same piece of music and this
time he's carried out on the shoulders of

435
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,200
the crowd. 25 years later,

436
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,140
Mickey mouse is performing this particular
piece with Tuscanini and it's become

437
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,930
almost kitty music. So then
we asked what happened?

438
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,250
How did the music that was so fear,

439
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:58,350
so new and so disturbing on Monday
become kitty music on Thursday.

440
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,870
And that leads to to another
notion about the brain,

441
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,280
that it is a very conservative organ
and it steals from artists. Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,090
She could have to explain that a
little bit, but I don't think I will.

443
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,950
But what was very cool afterwards is
it turns out that with this speculative

444
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:14,784
notion, again,

445
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,600
Walter Mitch will conclude with welder
merge Walter Verge on the phone with

446
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,420
Ellen is talking. He, we send them
the piece and say, what do you think?

447
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,380
And he says, not only do
I think this, I did this

448
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,670
well number of years ago, I was
working at a radio station in New York,

449
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:33,030
which is now defunct, called wr VR.

450
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,330
And I was assigned the job of
catalog in the record collection.

451
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,960
Then they played mostly classical
music. They had a jazz section,

452
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,850
but it was mostly classical music.

453
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:49,210
I found myself in the basement in a room
full of records and I was supposed to

454
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,870
type out a card for each of the
records and I thought, well,

455
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,500
I'll just use this opportunity
to teach myself musical history.

456
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,320
So I began at the
beginning of what they had,

457
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:03,010
which was a couple of
shelves of Gregorian chants

458
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,620
[inaudible]

459
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,620
and so for two weeks I saturated myself
in that music from nine o'clock in the

460
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:13,740
morning until seven
o'clock at night, whatever.

461
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:16,920
I went home listening to
nothing but those tonalities

462
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,073
[inaudible]

463
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,650
then for some reason I had to go up to
the control booth to ask Gordon the the

464
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,740
engineer or question.

465
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,790
So I ran up the stairs and opened the
door to this car company of sounds and,

466
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,921
and I,

467
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:38,540
I had for a moment exactly what I
imagined the people at the rite of spring

468
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:43,750
experienced, which was a of a
cognitive dissonance. What is this?

469
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:48,430
Why is this radio station playing
this kind of musical nonsense?

470
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,920
I literally clap my hands to
my ears and said, Gordon, what?

471
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,310
What is this music?

472
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,680
And he sort of casually leaned over and
picked up the album and it was box St

473
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:00,550
Matthew Passion.

474
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,660
No, if you've never heard buck's Saint
Matthew Passion is what it sounds like.

475
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,450
[inaudible]

476
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,590
oh, the horror.

477
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,190
Two weeks I had managed
without knowing it,

478
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:21,191
to reset the rural musical receptors to
the kind of music that existed before

479
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:24,620
the 16th century.

480
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,933
[inaudible]

481
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:38,110
we think of Bach as being in the symbol
itself of musical respectability.

482
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,300
And yet here I was coming suddenly and
unexpectedly upon Bar and hearing the

483
00:30:45,441 --> 00:30:50,441
dissonances that are dissonant only
when you compare them with the 15th 16th

484
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,253
centuries.

485
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,103
[inaudible]

486
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,810
around this time we took some questions
from the audience and one came up that's

487
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:07,860
near and dear to our hearts. Someone
asked if we felt we were constrained by,

488
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,300
by radio, by the medium, by having no
visuals. And here's the answer we gave.

489
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,310
Now what I would say is that
you have to kind of reset.

490
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:18,980
But I think for a lot of
people, the, that you know,

491
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:22,130
you're cutting your carrots,
you're driving along and um,

492
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,050
if we are doing this right,

493
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,980
you should not be having that feeling
that you should actually be having

494
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:30,620
something close to a Richard
feeling. Because here's the deal.

495
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,720
If I'm on TV and I say to you, all right,

496
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:35,200
let's imagine a mountain and
on the top of the man lives,

497
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,300
but go little house on
TV. I have no choice.

498
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:42,770
I have to make the mountain my mountain
and put it on a little house, my house,

499
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,520
not your house and you will see it in a
piece of furniture in your room across

500
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,400
the distance and you will stare
at my house on my mountain.

501
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,830
And many of you will have some
exception about whether you don't,

502
00:31:51,831 --> 00:31:53,480
it's not Emilia House,
what kind of it is that?

503
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:58,520
Whereas in this case you are unwittingly
coauthors. If I say make a mountain,

504
00:31:58,521 --> 00:32:00,980
that's your mountain.
If I say add a house,

505
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,450
that's your house and I'm indoors,
I am in your hand already,

506
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,910
so it's a, I think we'll have to
just basically operate on you.

507
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:14,690
I said there are just sort of to to
play the other side for a second.

508
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,500
There are moments there've been one
that I could call the mind where the,

509
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,870
the lack of a picture
was frustrating to us.

510
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:24,800
We were doing a show about us swarming
behavior and emergence and this sort of

511
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:27,140
crowds coming together and forming a,

512
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:32,141
a personality irrespective
of the individuals and the
swarming footage of uh,

513
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,010
of what are those spirits
called? Starling, starling
flocking behavior. It's,

514
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,380
it's indescribable when
you see pictures. It,

515
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,470
that was the one time where were uh,

516
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,910
being sort of this felt like a constraint
only using sound but generally it's

517
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:50,460
about creating pictures and that are
much more rich as he was saying in,

518
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,290
in your brain.

519
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,280
I know, I'll be honest,

520
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,650
they are occasions where I really wished
I could be on television for certain

521
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,510
things. Yeah. Cause their
TV's good at some stuff. Uh,

522
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:02,530
but abstract stuff t v is
when you approach television
with an abstract thought,

523
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,770
television itself looks you
right in the face and it goes.

524
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,270
So uh, radio is a little bit more
helpful in that regard. However,

525
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:17,360
if you're murdering someone and
someone is dying and screaming, go TV,

526
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,380
go TV on that one.

527
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,790
Well that's all for now. Thanks
