00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
&gt;&gt; So you guys probably know her as an actress.
But you may not know that she actually has

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.980
been an avid
environmentalist for years and years.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.599
In fact, she was green before it was very
cool to be green.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.640
And she's going to share with you her most
recent body of work called

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.390
The Kind Diet.
And she's going to talk about her journey

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.330
through the experience of
going from the vegetarian to a vegan and how

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.160
that's changed her life
and her perceptions of the world and the community.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:39.810
So with that, I will keep it short and welcome
up Alicia.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:52.010
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Here's the book.
So I -- this book is -- I just want to, well,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.420
thank you for all for
coming.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.090
That's so great and having me here.
I'm really honored to be here.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.570
And I'm really, really -- oh, I'm going to
take that.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.220
[PAUSE]
I'm so excited about what I'm going to talk

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.850
to you about, so I may talk
really fast because I get really excited.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.750
But basically I'm not -- this is not a book
for vegetarians, so you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.800
should know that.
This is book for anyone who is eating whatever

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.030
the American diet is
right now.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.410
So if you're feeling like I don't want it
be vegetarian.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.140
Why am I sitting here?
It's exactly who I want to be talking to,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.630
just so you know.
This -- I guess I'll start by telling you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.210
just sort of what happened to
me.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.210
And in the book I go into great detail but
I'll give you sort of the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.560
brief version or I'll try.
Which is that I -- about 11 years ago, decided

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.520
that I could no longer
hurt animals.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.340
That was my thing.
And at that time, I, you know, being in Hollywood

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.400
people were saying
you know that I had it lose weight and all

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.900
this annoying stuff.
And -- and at that time, I was very rebellious.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.240
So the idea of being healthy was a no-no.
I was not -- I didn't want

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.970
it be healthy.
Nobody talked to me about being healthy.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.689
If I lose my career, that's fine.
Like I don't want to know anything about this.

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:20.910
So, so when I made this decision for the animals,
it was really -- like

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.489
I had no idea if I'd ever have a good meal
again.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.580
I had no idea if I would be healthy.
I just thought this is what I have to do in

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.079
order to look at myself in
the mirror knowing that I loved animals so

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.079
much.
Blah blah.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.640
So what happened was about two weeks into
being vegan -- cause I didn't

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.549
-- I just went straight vegan.
Cause I had known enough.

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.170
From about age 8 to 21, I was flirt.
You know, I would decide to be vegan or vegetarian

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.919
for a few weeks
because, you know, my brother would make animal

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.890
noises of the animals I
was eating.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.569
So I'd be vegetarian for like a month because
he'd be going -- making

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.080
lamb noises.
And then I'd forget because I was 8.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.440
So basically, by the time I was 21 and I made
this hardcore commitment,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.010
the reason I did it was because I saw how
animals were raised for food.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.919
So that really got me.
But about two weeks into it, I'm thinking

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.799
 -- I never knew, I thought
maybe I'd be really unhealthy. I didn't really

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.680
care, because again, I
didn't really care about my health at the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.450
time at all.
So when -- when I -- all of sudden people

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.239
started saying to me, You're
glowing.

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.540
What's happening?
Why are you -- and you look different.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.329
And the biggest thing I noticed right away
was that I felt this huge

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.040
weight lift off of me.
Like I just felt lighter walking through the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.060
world.
And that's sounds really weird but once you

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.249
experience it just it's
this amazing thing.

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:45.599
And I couldn't figure out if that was, you
know, the well I'll let you

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.700
read the book to get more details because
I could go on forever.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.749
But the point is that I started to have these
amazing, amazing

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:56.599
reactions from people and inside of myself.
My nails started to get really, really strong

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.129
and thick.
I started to lose weight.

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.199
And weight that I was happy to lose.
It wasn't a problem.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.749
And my -- my hair was getting stronger -- like
everything was just

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:13.230
growing and I was getting really healthy.
Oh and I was -- I had allergies and I had

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.979
an asthma inhaler.
And I had to have allergy shots twice a week.

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.169
And suddenly I stopped going to the allergist.
And I didn't think of it.

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.990
And the allergist said to me by e-mail, hey
Alicia, I haven't seen you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.370
in a long time.
What's going on?

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.540
And I was like oh my God.
It's been like a year or something I haven't

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.340
been there.
And I said oh I stopped eating all this stuff.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.360
I go, I guess that's why I haven't come.
Cause I was experiencing zero symptoms.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.560
And he said to me, oh, I hear that a lot.
I was like, you hear it a lot that people

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.460
change their diet and then
don't have to come for shots and inhalers

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.270
anymore?
He said yeah.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.320
Why didn't you tell me?
And he just laughed, and by like in e-mail,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.900
he was like ha ha.
So anyway, basically my life changed and I

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.580
went on this -- I started
to -- I thought this was a miracle.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.380
This must just be really good karma or something
for my decision.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.139
But I started to research it and realize that
there's all kinds of

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.830
doctors out there, and there's all kinds of
medical research and

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.780
science supporting this way of living.
And that this is actually a healthier way

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.009
to be.
This wasn't just some fluke that happened

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.080
to me.
That people like Bruce Lee, and people like,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.909
you know, amazing athletes
that I highlight in the book who are bodybuilders

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.350
who don't care -- who
didn't necessarily care about the environment

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.080
or animals or anything
like that.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.660
They just wanted to be the best performers
that they could be and feel

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.250
their best.
And they adopted this lifestyle.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.169
And so I started to figure out that this was
not just some like -- you

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.741
know, emotional, like, moral thing that I
was experiencing.

00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:51.520
This was an actual healing modality.
And started to see that, you know, Colin Campbell,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.289
Joel Fuhrman, and
Dean Ornish and all these doctors who are

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.729
doing incredible work healing
cancer and heart disease and diabetes over

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.289
and over and over again.
They just -- their voices aren't as loud because

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.220
there's a lot of
forces out there telling us to make -- in

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.629
order for them to make money,
they're asking you to eat all kinds of nasty

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.259
things that are hurting
you.

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:19.599
So my journey's been incredible.
And when I was about 25, I was doing a play

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.960
on Broadway with Kathleen
Turner and is was super fun and it was snowing.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.659
And I had kind of gone through a little bit
of a raw kick.

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.789
The raw food kick.
I don't know if you've heard of the raw food

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.099
kick, but anyway I was on
that.

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.110
And -- but it was snowing.
And I was trying to eat mangos, and mangos

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.401
don't grow if the snow.
And somebody pointed that out to me.

00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:41.300
Because at the same time my husband came home
and said that he really

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.790
wanted to start this thing called the macrobiotic
diet.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.820
And I was like, I don't need to be macrobiotic
 .

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.620
Because I thought those people eat fish, and
I'm already vegan and I

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.419
don't need more rules or whatever.
And I actually didn't feel like I had rules.

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.520
But I was just sort of being stubborn as we
do sometimes when your

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.960
husband says something.
And so I was just like -- and he -- oh and

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.759
especially, cause he also
aid that he'd read that Gwyneth Paltrow was

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.729
doing this.
And I was like well, just cause Gwyneth Paltrow

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.180
says, you know, like
what about me?

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:19.749
Why don't you want to do that?
But Gwyneth Paltrow is a very smart lady.

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:24.189
And so is Madonna and all these women that
are doing this.

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.919
Anyway, I was being resistant and I went to
New York.

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:31.900
And I was doing this play, and he was coming
to visit me for Christmas

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.430
and his birthday -- his birthday's on Christmas.
So I took him to see this macrobiotic counselor.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.909
Because everything always happens at once,
right?

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:42.789
So he says Gwyneth Paltrow wants to do this,
and then I'm in New York

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:44.979
and the director and Jason Biggs are making
fun of me constantly

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:49.449
because of my diet.
And saying any time I was tired it was like,

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:51.629
well, you better eat some
meat, you know?

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:56.659
And I was just really frustrated and I was
literally running around

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.939
trying to find green juice and mangos and
all this stuff and it was

00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:04.529
freezing.
And so I met this girl Temple who -- who I

00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:07.199
had known for years and she
looked amazing.

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:11.849
And I said what happened to you?
Like, her transformation was so extreme.

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:15.199
She was glowing.
Her hair was amazing, her body was amazing.

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:19.960
Everything was on fire with this woman.
And we walked 50 blocks home and she told

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:27.620
me about macrobiotics and I
was like, oh my God.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:33.020
So when Christopher came into town, my husband,
I decided to give him a

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.680
counseling session with this macrobiotic counselor.
And I sat in the back while he was getting

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.680
his thing, just like this is
so lame.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.010
But he was seeming to love it.
And finally she turned to me and she said

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.250
I don't know why you're so
resistant.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.060
That acne you have -- because I had just got
 -- and she didn't say it

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.320
nasty like that.
But she was really loving and sweet.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.430
And she just said, you know, you could really
heal that acne.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.430
And the reason I had acne was because I had
gone off the pill a few

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.521
years earlier because as I was getting healthier
through being vegan, I

00:08:57.521 --> 00:09:00.790
just noticed why am I putting -- not to say
you shouldn't take birth

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.550
control pills, but this is my journey.
I just was like, I don't want to put this

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.820
weird pink pill in my body
every day.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.430
This is weird.
And so I stopped doing that.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.930
But my skin started to erupt because you know
birth control pills are

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.490
doing all kinds of crazy things to our bodies.
And so anyway, that was happening to me.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:25.520
And I -- what am I talking about?
Oh, okay.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.330
So acne.
Sorry.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:33.480
So I got this acne.
And she says I can clear acne up.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.640
Now I'd had it for like two years and it was
so frustrating.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.920
And, you know, I still had the glowing skin,
my skin was really, really

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.970
glowing from the vegetarian diet or the vegan
diet,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.020
But there were just these breakouts that were
happening from the pill

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.720
detox.
And so I was blaming it.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.260
And it was that but there was soon to discover
other reasons.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.190
So the macrobiotic counselor says to me I
can heal this and I can give

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.890
you more energy.
And she already told me that mangos don't

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.300
grow in the snow.
And I was like, okay, this is all starting

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.490
to make sense.
And she said, you know, a mango is designed

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.830
to cool you off in the
heat.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.880
That's why it's in hot climates.
It's a tropical fruit.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.990
So that started to make sense to me.
And then on the environmental aspect, I'd

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.350
already become an
environmental-conscious person.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.650
So now she's talking about the energy it requires
to fly all that food

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.410
all around the place.
And I started to understand the local aspect

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.640
and having food be
seasonal and local.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.280
And I was just like, this is amazing.
So I decided to try it.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.450
And again, I'm reluctant.
But about two weeks in, my skin is, like,

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.510
clearing up magically.
And all I really had to do, the adjustments

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.250
that I made because I was
already vegan, the adjustments were to kick

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.680
sugar -- because I eating a
lot of sugar -- and white flour and processed

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.520
foods.
And right now you're probably going, you just

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.540
took away all of my food.
How am I supposed to eat?

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.320
And you have to know that I'm a foodie and
I love food.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.500
I get so -- you know, I'm obsessed with food.
There's no part of me that became like a,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.060
you know, boring eater.
I love to taste food.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.830
And that never changed.
And in fact it's become -- I'm more of a foodie

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.740
now.
And I feel like I have more of a sophisticated

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.730
palate now.
Because back in the day, when I ate regular

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.150
American diet, I sort of
though, oh, should I have chicken, fish, beef,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.520
or pasta?
Like those are sort of my brain choices.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.390
I don't know about you guys but that's sort
of how I thought.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.160
And you don't really think beyond that very
much.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.200
Maybe a little bit.
Maybe I'll have a burger instead of that.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.270
But you don't really have a huge array of
foods to choose from.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.350
And when I started to become vegan, I started
to learn all these

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.280
different cultures' foods and all these different
tastes that I never

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.980
tasted.
So my food thing grew.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.430
And I started to taste differently, too, because
my tongue was freed up

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.660
from all the chemicals and all the things
that were, you know, kind of

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.410
coating it -- the dairy and the processed
stuff.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.160
So anyway, even those it sounds like I've
just taken all of your food

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.060
away, what I want to guarantee you is that
if you go on this journey in

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.930
this book, inside here I've got amazing recipes
that I promise you, you

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.161
will not feel deprived.
Because I have to tell you that even those

00:11:59.161 --> 00:12:02.990
I did give up these things
-- I was on a steak and doughnut diet before

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.090
I went vegan, just so you
know

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.620
It's pretty much all I ate.
And I can show you pictures of me.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:13.000
And it doesn't look very good on you.
But I ate that and so I understand.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I loved pork chops.
I loved bacon.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.520
And I ate all of those things.
But I don't love -- like, I know they tasted

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.610
good but everything else
I'm having now tastes just as good or better.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.820
So it's not about taking away something good
and only having things

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.840
that don't taste good, it's about taking one
thing that tastes good and

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.910
another thing that tastes good, and one of
those things is really bad

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.720
for you and really bad for the planet and
has really serious

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.190
consequences that are really destroying our
planet and your body.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.760
And the other thing is just doing nice, happy
things.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.530
It's just nice and happy for your body.
It's nourishing for your blood.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.200
And so if you have a choice and they both
taste good, wouldn't you want

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.430
to pick the one that doing good things for
you?

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:57.940
So that's what I'm here to say is that this
is a no-deprivation diet.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.450
And the reason I call it "The Kind Diet,"
is kind of a trick is because

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.480
the actual definition of diet in the 1600s
was a day's journey.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.190
A way of thinking, and I want to restore that
word back to its nice

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.350
place.
Because we all think of diet as like deprivation

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:18.140
and calorie counting
and misery.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.520
And I want diet to be a way of thinking and
a way of life that isn't

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.330
about restriction.
It's about freedom.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.410
Freedom from your brain being all consumed
with what you can and can't

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.200
have.
Because of how it's going to effect you on

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.770
a -- you know, how big or
small your body's going to be.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.920
But more about how do I eat that will heal
me and nourish me so that as

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.060
I get older, I actually feel like I'm getting
younger.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.200
And I know that sounds insane because most
us think of getting older

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.430
was slowly falling part.
But I promise you that I'm getting stronger

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.040
and feel more alive than I
ever have before.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:59.250
And I think that's a pretty amazing thing.
So I just wanted to share all that with you.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.540
And is there anything else I need to tell
you about that?

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.540
Yeah, that it's really simple and I lay it
 -- in the book, I sort of do

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.290
it in this way where I give you sort of the
inspiration of what you

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.690
might want.
Like either you give want to feel better or

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.900
have more energy or be free
from, you know, taking all these prescriptions,

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.800
and you needing coffee
to get through the day.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.310
You know, I don't need coffee.
I like the taste of it and every blue moon

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.220
I'll have a sip, but I don't
need coffee.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.480
And I never really drink it at all.
And I don't take antibiotics, unless like,

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.258
you know, I get in a dog
fight. I got in the dog fight one time, I

00:14:35.258 --> 00:14:38.330
was -- I wasn't fighting
with a god but I was trying to break up some

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.600
dogs.
And I got 26 stitches in my legs so I needed

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.040
some, you know, I needed
some antibiotics that time.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.420
And some pain pills for that day.
But, you know, I -- I just think of medicine

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.840
as something is a last
resort.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.120
I don't take any -- I never need to, I don't
really get sick anymore.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.380
If I get sick it's like for 24 hours and it
passes really quickly.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.080
I know how to eat so that I'm -- and if I
do get sick, I know it was --

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.100
and not like I'm blaming myself.
But I go, oh, I know what I did, I ate that

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.280
that's what did this.
So I always kind of, it's bringing the control

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.590
and power back into your
life.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.380
So we're not these slaves to our doctors.
Like, we're these, you know, sort of victims

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.900
where we go, help me.
I don't feel good, and I need all this.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.800
And it's like the doctor is just going to
give you medicine.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.870
And just going to give you -- or cut you open,
if you're really

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.310
unlucky.
And really all of that is preventible -- in

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.710
most cases, it's
preventible.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.880
So I'm really excited about that.
So anyway, what I was saying is if you are

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.430
interested and inspired to
do -- to feel your best or you care about

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.710
the planet.
How about the planet?

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.140
I mean Google seems very interested in the
environment.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.540
And I don't know if you guys know this but,
you know, to produce one

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:53.000
pound of beef, one 16-ounce steak, it requires
the amount of water that

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.610
could shower you for six months.
That's crazy time.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:02.640
You know, I really save water but six-months
showering water for one

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.860
piece of meat?
Like, that's a big deal.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:12.070
And the amount of oil we're using.
We're using 20 to 28 billion gallons of oil

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:17.310
a year alone in America for
our meat consumption, for beef.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.310
So that's an insane amount of oil.
So when you're looking at trying to restore

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.330
our planet, and the
precious resources that we're just dwindling

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.490
away.
The coal, like I said the water, the oil,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.760
the rainforest, it's pretty
much out of control.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.030
So if you're concerned about the environment
or you care about the

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.660
environment, what I've done in the book is
each -- I have four nasty

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.020
categories of food.
And those foods, you go through each of them

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.190
and we say why it's nasty
to you, you know, health-wise.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.150
Why it's nasty to the planet, and then why
it's nasty to all the other

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.520
creatures and we just go through each of those
things.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.720
And then you go through the kind foods, and
talk about what foods are

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.430
not only not nasty but actually nourishing
you.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.910
And this is way we used to eat.
This isn't like a new thing.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:03.590
All of this is just taking uh back to your
ancestors' way of eating.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:09.150
It's a more natural, more simple, more delicious
way of eating.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.150
And it's eating with purpose.
Because you have to -- it's your fuel.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.410
It's like buying a beautiful Porsche and then
shoving it with like the

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.959
worst fuel ever.
And that's what doing most of the time.

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:25.459
And you need to protect yourself, so you can
feel your best.

00:17:25.459 --> 00:17:28.780
So I go through that and then I give it -- it's
a very easy how-to

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.990
book.
It gives you step-by-step how to do it.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.430
And there's three different plans.
You can be a flirt, if you want to, which

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.010
means no commitment.
You don't have to get married.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.730
You're just trying it on.
You know you can date your local vegetarian

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.500
restaurant.
You can date some new recipes in the book.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.400
Just see how you feel and start adding the
good foods and ridding

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.250
yourself of the bad foods.
And then knowing that it's not all or nothing.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.590
So the more good choices you make, the better
off you'll be.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.810
You'll feel better.
You'll notice a difference and the planet

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.080
will thank you.
And if -- and then after doing that flirting

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.330
thing for 30 days, if you
wanted to you could move on to the next section,

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.840
which is more
committed.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.080
Going to try this.
And then when you're doing that, if you fall

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.690
off, it's okay.
You just get back on.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.260
I think this all -- this whole all or nothing
approach really allows us

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.860
to do nothing, you know.
And it's a good excuse but if we keep trying.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:25.660
Maybe you want to be an aspiring vegetarian.
You're just going to try to move in that direction.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.650
Or maybe you just want to stay a flirt forever
but you keep adding and

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.760
being open.
So it's really just about opening and softening

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.770
your -- what it diet
will do also is soften your heart.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.460
And make you feel more grounded and connected
to the universe, and not

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:45.320
have anxiety and feel really purposeful.
And that's -- those are magical things and

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.670
there's magical foods in the
book.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.121
I go through foods that are literally magical
and how they effect you.

00:18:50.121 --> 00:18:54.010
And what they can do for you.
And there's frequently asked questions so

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.800
all your nutritional needs
are a hundred percent met in here.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.530
And we just tell you exactly what you need.
And how to answer all those questions about

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:06.290
iron and calcium and all
those things that you might be concerned about

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.780
 -- Omega-3's, B12,
everything is addressed in here.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.030
But the bottom line is you don't need supplements
when you eat well.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:15.150
The only supplement you need on this diet,
if you do this diet, is a

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.940
B12 supplement.
Because we have depleted our soil so much

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.790
that there's no good bacteria
in it anymore.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.510
We clean things so well that we don't have
the good bacteria.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.540
And the B12 lives in bacteria, and so when
you eat meat, it lives in

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.220
the organs of the animals.
So that's kind of gross.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:36.710
But that's where you're getting it is.
So there's vegetarian form that we used to

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.230
get from the soil.
And so when I'm making food from the garden,

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.450
if there's a little dirt
on it I leave it on, because I figure, yay,

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.600
bacteria.
Yay B12.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.230
Because I know that everything was cool in
that garden.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.600
But I don't do that when friends come over,
it's only for me.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.760
So don't worry.
But anyway, I think that's everything I that

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.450
cover --
Oh, and then there's this amazing website

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.630
that I have up and running
right now called thekindlife.com.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.970
And that is for anyone who's curious, wants
to know more, wants to

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.670
engage with a community.
It's kind of like -- you know, it's a community

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.230
basically for you to
engage with other people who are interested

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.150
and curious.
And people come on and say I've just been

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.980
doing it for three days and
it's amazing.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.560
Or I need help or whatever your deal is and
there's all kinds of people

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.470
helping each other.
And it's pretty exciting.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.940
And we're constantly updating it with new
information as it comes and

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.690
all my groovy -- I find all kinds of amazing
products.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.630
I really love, you know, good make up products.
And hair and make up stuff.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.450
And all the things that you could possibly
need but in an

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.780
environmentally sound, cruelty-free manner
that happens to be also be

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.780
delicious or fabulous.
So that's when we're putting on the site.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.720
Like clothing and stuff like that.
I think that's everything.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720
If you guys have any questions I'd love to
answer them.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720
[PAUSE]

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.050
&gt;&gt;The hair and nails getting stronger that
you mentioned is that

00:20:55.050 --> 00:21:02.810
vitamin K?
Which I understand vegetables to have a lot

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:07.460
of -- or green vegetables
at least.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:12.750
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Well, some people say
that the white marks are

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.180
calcium marks.
I didn't even talk about the marks.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.211
You know those white marks you get on, and
some people say, oh, it's a

00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:21.179
lack of calcium.
And then other people, more macrobiotic approach

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:24.270
 -- by the way, the
macrobiotics, I just say one thing because

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.270
I just remembered.
Sorry.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.740
That in the book I make -- I sort of -- I
don't -- we have a superhero

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.600
diet.
If you decide you want to be a superhero,

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.030
if you're already veggie or
you've already gone through the steps and

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.730
you want to get there, the
superhero thing is like the ultimate.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.960
And I call it that and not macrobiotics because
macrobiotics can be

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.890
complicated for some people.
So this is like the Cliff notes, all you need

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.880
to know version for now
unless you want to go further.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.020
But anyway, in macrobiotics, they say it's
sugar.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.820
So most people say it's calcium, macrobiotics
say it's sugar.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.400
Either way, they're all gone.
That I know.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.450
So I think that if it is the calcium, it's
because you're suddenly

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.990
eating so many leafy greens.
And you're eating a lot of seaweed which has

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.990
massive amounts of calcium
but maybe it's vitamin K, too.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.990
I'm not familiar.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.990
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Also it seems like you've said that there's

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.100
a lot of synergy between
what's good for you and what's good for the

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.520
earth.
Other than the B12, are there any, like, conflicts

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.561
or foods that are
really one and not the other?

00:22:17.561 --> 00:22:18.561
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: No, that's the beautiful
thing.

00:22:18.561 --> 00:22:21.850
It's amazing to me.
That's the thing that moves me so much, that

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:26.400
the same thing that is
healing the planet is healing our bodies and

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.650
also healing the animals.
Like what an amazing thing.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:34.040
Mother Nature took care of everything at the
same time.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.040
&gt;&gt; Do you think there's like an evolutionary
reason for that or --

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.309
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: I do.
I mean, Einstein said so.

00:22:38.309 --> 00:22:40.750
And I do.
I think that -- I think that this is naturally

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.600
the way we were.
I think that people were not so gluttonous

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.730
and trying to get theirs.
And why you're trying to get yours, you're

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.730
missing out on everything,
you know.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.990
And I feel like this convenience thing, this
sort of moving --

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.781
I mean there are some things that really wonderful
that are convenient

00:22:56.781 --> 00:22:59.900
but some things are just so overwhelming and
distracting.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:04.570
Like at first, e-mail was so awesome.
But now, it's like swallowing me.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.270
I don't know what -- I need help to get out
of the, like, how do you

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.490
have boundaries with e-mail, you know?
And so it's a similar thing with the food.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.700
We've made all these things so convenient.
And we're just destroying everything, you

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.790
know.
All your grandparents tend to be so inspired

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.730
when you kind of come with
your glass jar.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.851
They're like I used to do that, you know.

00:23:25.851 --> 00:23:27.401
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
Oh, and try Gmail filters.

00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:30.800
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Gmail filters, okay.
I will, thank you.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.460
I'm just becoming technically savvy, so I'm
very far away from getting

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.880
there, but thank you.
Yes?

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:43.790
&gt;&gt; I feel like eating is a very big part of
socializing in our society.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:44.970
So do you have any advice for reconciling
that with family and friends

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:45.970
who just don't understood this way of life?

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.620
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Yeah.
Well I go into that in extreme detail in the

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.950
book because that has been
my journey for sure.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:58.070
And eating with family-in-laws, and I guess
that's called in-laws,

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.570
right?
And, and just eating with friends over the

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.580
years.
Yeah, I found really easy ways to deal with

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.970
it.
Some of those ways are, you know, just making

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.760
it fun and light.
Because I first went this way, you know, I

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.290
wanted to scream.
When you read this information, it's like

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.490
I just wanted to go around
screaming at everybody, "fire."

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.220
You know, like, cause it is.
There's a huge fire.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.551
It's like you want everybody to know what's
going on.

00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:24.160
But I realize nobody wants -- nobody really
listens to you when you

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.990
scream fire.
So I just found the best thing for me was

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.010
to care of myself and feel my
best.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.430
And really keep it -- mind my own business.
And keep contributing to the world in the

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:37.840
way that I know how, and keep
improving upon my own choices.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.340
Every time a new choice presents itself that
I could make a better

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.890
choice, I do.
And in that process, people just come to you

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:47.570
and they ask you and they
want to know.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:51.120
So family members who I used to try and tell
them, now I don't tell

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:57.140
them anything and they're just like I want
to know everything.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.140
And you're like okay.
Calm down.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.320
I'll tell you or just read the book.
So it's really -- there's a lot of ways to

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.560
socialize.
And there's also ways, I mean I go through

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.340
it all.
It's adjusting to your friends, like, hey

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.200
can we go here?
This would be really fun.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.380
So kind of a more neutral territory or just
going there and finding the

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.890
best things for yourself at that place.
And then Thanksgiving -- but basically it's

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.410
like chapters.
So I don't want to bore you right now.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.000
But yes, it's all there.
And this community will help you with that

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.810
to.
The Kind Life community because they have

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.270
great ideas and tips for all
over -- all over America.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.070
And all over the world.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:33.769
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Thank you.

00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:34.769
&gt;&gt; Hi.
So spending lots of time with some of my friends

00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:35.769
who enjoy raw food,
and we go out to eat, I've often found that

00:25:35.769 --> 00:25:36.769
sometimes it's a little bit
expensive.

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:37.769
And unfortunately, as the structure is set
up now, buying a pound of

00:25:37.769 --> 00:25:46.690
chicken is way cheaper than a pound of apples.
So how do you kind of reach out to the population

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.680
that might not be
able to afford this lifestyle?

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.710
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: That's a great, great
question and I'm so happy

00:25:54.710 --> 00:26:00.970
you asked that.
First of all, financially -- well, I want

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.300
to talk about raw too.
But financially, this is really, it doesn't

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.120
have to be more expensive.
If you're going to go eat at fancy raw food

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.790
restaurants, then yeah.
And I actually am not a huge proponents of

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:15.679
a raw food thing which I'll
explain to you why in a second.

00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:19.540
But basically, you know, the poorer people
of our communities used to

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:24.260
always be the healthiest because they ate
local, fresh fruits and

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.480
vegetables, grains, and beans.
And the fat people were the kings.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.030
You know, the rich kings were always the fat
ones because they were

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.809
eating all kinds of meat.
So it's a very interesting indication of where

00:26:35.809 --> 00:26:39.640
health lies.
And so, you don't have to have lot of money

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.630
to eat this way.
And basically, if you follow The Kind Life,

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:47.500
the things that are the
most expensive in this book are the desserts.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.480
Because I don't like sugar.
But I also explain to you that you can use

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.960
sugar if a budget is the
issue, you can use sugar.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.770
I just can't in good faith tell you to have
it because it's not good

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:00.230
for you.
But there are alternatives and there's cheaper

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.830
 --
You know, the ones that are really expensive

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.480
is like the maple crystals
which is like maple syrup turned into like

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.410
a granulated powder.
That's the more expensive ingredients.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.380
But buying Earth Bound's butter instead of
regular butter, it might be

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.910
a little bit more expensive, but that tub
is going to last you forever.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.450
And when you're buying Veganaise instead of
mayonnaise which -- these

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.370
are like, you have to get these ingredients,
because they're so great.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.670
It might be a dollar more or something -- I
don't even know the price

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.850
difference, but I know it's not a lot .
And I know that where you really save your

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:32.559
money is doctor visits.
I don't go to the doctor.

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:37.870
Prescriptions and time off work, you know.
You have so much more energy that you get

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.940
more out of your life.
So if, if you're -- I think after living this

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.920
 -- and by the way, steak
way more expensive than beans and rice.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.890
You can feed your family on beans and rice
for very inexpensive.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.060
But I also give you much more interesting
and exciting recipes than

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.580
just beans and rice.
That's why it can kind of level out.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.830
But you can do this on any kind of budget
that you want.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.350
You can do it really cheap.
And you can did on a more fancy level buying

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.559
truffle oil and going
crazy.

00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:08.480
And buying things in bulk makes a big difference.
Or sharing with friends and buying in bulk,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.380
cause that's also better
for the planet.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.750
But ultimately you're going to save on life
force.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:17.840
That's a big price to pay.
And you're going to say -- so if your grocery

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.010
bill ends up being the
same, you gain more.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.950
I actually think it ends up saving you money
on your life.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:27.400
In terms of raw, the reason I ended up moving
away from raw was because

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.450
like I said, I was looking -- I don't think
it's absolutely the most

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:35.650
sustain -- you if love raw, fantastic.
But for me, I think it's very difficult to

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:38.651
ask someone who's used to
eating steak to suddenly convert to like sun

00:28:38.651 --> 00:28:40.820
burger.
Do you mean?

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:46.010
I feel like let's transition people in a direction.
And also I think it's -- macrobiotics is so

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.050
ancient.
And it's such an amazing thing from China

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.860
and Japan.
And they -- they just have a way of looking

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.450
at the body and going
what's going on with your eyes.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:59.860
It's very diagnostic, it's really scientific.
So it's different than raw food, which is

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:04.000
a beautiful concept.
But isn't really actually healing specifically

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.270
your organs.
And, you know, and I also, like, raw food

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.500
it's like blenders.
And, like, dehydration.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.150
And that energy just feels like -- like this
to me a little bit.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:19.610
And whereas macrobiotics is really balanced
and really rooted.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:25.040
And really about healing on a global level.
So for me, that's the direction that I sort

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.049
of -- and also by the way,
it cleared my skin up and made me skinnier.

00:29:28.049 --> 00:29:32.310
And so I -- duh -- like that better.
Whereas raw food, I was kind of like, you

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.720
know, plumping out a little.
Because I eating nuts and it's so extreme,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.470
so much nuts, so much fruit,
so much honey, and agave and all these things.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.279
And so I just felt a little bit unbalanced.

00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:43.279
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:45.190
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Thank you.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.690
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for coming.
I totally agree with your mission.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.690
I've been vegetarian for ten years.
I stopped wearing leather this year which

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:48.690
was the last step.
My question is sometimes when I go to restaurants

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:49.690
or I travel, I end up
eating really weird, random food that's probably

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:50.690
not that healthy for
me, it's a --

00:29:50.690 --> 00:30:05.830
You if go to Asia, there's fish sauce or something.
Or if you go to a

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:13.510
steakhouse, there's a salad with no protein.
I was wondering if you had any recommendations

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.510
for traveling or
restaurants menus?

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.570
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: For sure.
So in the book, again, I do go through in

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.080
detail how to eat out, how to
go travel, and what I do is I go to happycow.com.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.220
Wherever I go, I was just in Paris.
And I expected, you know, how am I going to

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.320
eat in Paris?
It's all cheese and foie gras.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.799
Like, what am I going to eat?
But there were amazing little veggie places

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:32.870
all over the place.
And they were adorable.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.750
And they weren't hard to find.
It's kind of everywhere when you start to

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.920
look for it.
So you just have to do a little planning.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.070
And so I go on this -- in the book, I describe
this whole thing that I

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:46.150
talk about planning for the next day.
Because once you make it your priority, which

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.500
clearly you have, but you
know for all of us who are so busy.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.030
I mean I don't -- I'm so busy I don't even
know.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.390
I wish there were like ten of me to be able
to do what I'm being asked

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.190
to do.
And I'm sure everybody can relate to that

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.680
feeling.
But I found that I can't be good at anything

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.280
I do if I don't eat well.
So I have to make that my first priority.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.419
And I really discovered that through macrobiotics.
Because I used to sort of just like be running

00:31:09.419 --> 00:31:11.311
around trying to figure
it out on the go.

00:31:11.311 --> 00:31:16.530
And it's like rather -- I'd rather not watch
that show on TV or make

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:20.340
plans to do this one thing and just take like
ten minutes before I go

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.410
to bed, and go where am I going to be for
breakfast?

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.650
Where am I going to be for lunch?
Where am I going to be for dinner?

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.280
And how did I get the best choice for myself
possible?

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.260
So when I'm traveling I make things like my
rice krispie treats, which

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.410
I bring like into London.
I make like a big batch and they sit in my

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.120
suitcase.
So that if I'm on the go and I need something

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.120
really quickly, I have
it.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.860
I also bring miso paste.
Really good quality miso paste like I had

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.410
this morning because I didn't
to have breakfast because I was coming here.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.210
So I just hot my little miso paste and some
hot water.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.630
It just sort of -- just so you know, miso
is one of those magical

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.670
foods.
Not the kind you get at a regular Japanese

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.000
restaurant because they put
of junk in it.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.990
But the kind you get at the whole foods store.
It's like pure miso paste, and it's, like,

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.669
loaded with enzymes, loaded
with -- it's like a natural immune booster.

00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:07.030
It's good for your immune system and almost
like a natural antibiotic.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:11.419
It just does wonders for your body.
So I like to have that when I'm traveling

00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:14.679
as a quickie.
And I bring -- and sometimes I bring, like,

00:32:14.679 --> 00:32:18.110
I bring nori.
I love to bring nori with me.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:22.720
That way, if I have leftovers I can always
wrap my leftovers in my nori

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.140
and that makes everything delicious.
Noir is the best thing on earth.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.700
Those sheets of nori that you get at a sushi
restaurant.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.179
So yeah it's really, really manageable.
And this community will also dial into you.

00:32:32.179 --> 00:32:35.390
You can say, oh, I'm going to Alabama.
I don't know where the world I'm going to

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.120
eat.
And somebody in Alabama will come on, and

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.086
you can help me out -- and
somebody will come on and go, I live in Alabama.

00:32:39.086 --> 00:32:40.980
You got to go here.
You know what I mean?

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.980
So it's out there.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.980
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:43.980
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Hi.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.980
&gt;&gt; I wanted to first thank you so much for
coming.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:45.980
I'm the biggest fan.
I love and own Clueless, et cetera.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.980
But --

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:47.980
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Thank you.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:53.710
&gt;&gt;Alex is one of my good friends.
She's obviously been a vegetarian for a long

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:54.710
time.
I'm an convert at least to pescetarianism,

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:55.710
five months ago today.
But one of the big things for me at least

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.950
is exercise.
And I wanted to find out for you, you know,

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.020
they always say diet and
exercise.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:12.179
How have you changed your exercise?
Or what do you do to be healthy not from a

00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:14.120
eating standpoint?

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:20.750
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Well the amazing thing
about The Kind Diet is it's

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.600
so flexible.
So it's like, if you love exercise, you can

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.549
keep exercising.
If you hate exercising, you don't have to.

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:33.840
Like this diet, when I was -- when I first
started doing -- I mean,

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.440
like I said, I lost weight from going vegan.
And then I lost weight from doing like the

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:43.410
macro thing even more.
And I never had to -- I never had to exercise

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.960
in that process.
Whereas before I was doing this diet, I had

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.950
to exercise a lot.
And people were always harassing me to exercise.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.730
They are like you have to do this much, and
you have to do this thing.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:57.240
And it was just so un-fun, you know.
And so for me, exercise has become something

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.730
that I've slowly learned
to appreciate.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.380
But for me.
Not to appease anyone.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.890
Not to get to a certain goal.
But just more like, my husband's really taught

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.519
me that sweating feels
good.

00:34:08.519 --> 00:34:11.429
I mean that sounds really weird.
Sorry.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.280
I don't mean it like that.
But I mean --

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.909
[LAUGHTER]
That was really weird.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:19.940
But I mean, he always was saying like I bet
you would really like to

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.789
run.
Or you know spin or whatever.

00:34:22.789 --> 00:34:29.029
And swim and I was like -- you know.
But over time, I do really love those things.

00:34:29.029 --> 00:34:33.089
I don't make as much -- I make my number one
priority my food and

00:34:33.089 --> 00:34:37.950
exercise comes after that.
But I often don't -- my work comes before

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:41.239
exercise.
So I feel -- but it probably shouldn't, according

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:44.839
to husband.
But in terms of like, you know, my life and

00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:48.319
my priorities, if I eat
well, I don't have to worry and that's the

00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:52.899
amazing thing to me.
Cause I see people in the gym and I'm kind

00:34:52.899 --> 00:34:54.299
of -- I hate gyms.
So I don't like that, but I go to like a spin

00:34:54.299 --> 00:34:58.569
place sometimes.
And I see these women who come in day after

00:34:58.569 --> 00:35:01.119
day, and they're not
getting slimmer, and their skin still looks

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:03.810
gray, and they don't have
glow to them.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.069
And so they're working out like maniacs but
nothing is happening

00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:09.339
because they still eat the cheese, they still
eat the meat, all those

00:35:09.339 --> 00:35:12.410
things that are clogging their organs.
So like maybe it's keeping them from being

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.349
like 400 pounds or
something.

00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:18.599
But it's not really doing the magic they want
it to do for them.

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:21.789
So I think you don't have to exercise -- it
depends on your thing.

00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:24.440
If you want to be an -- I mean, in the book,
there's all kinds of

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:29.470
amazing athletes that, you know, have done
this because they want to

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.170
have better performance.
So this works for athletes.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:35.369
And it works for a person who hates exercise
and really doesn't want to

00:35:35.369 --> 00:35:38.329
do it.
So you can kind of use it however you want

00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:41.799
to.
I do think that we all need to walk more,

00:35:41.799 --> 00:35:44.009
you know.
I think we all need to like walk.

00:35:44.009 --> 00:35:47.880
And ideally, with your feet, bare feet, like
feel the earth.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:54.339
And feel the grass, and you know, enjoy what
this earth has.

00:35:54.339 --> 00:35:58.000
But even just tennis shoes work, too, if you
can't walk on grass.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.529
Because there's not a lot of grass any more.
But, you know, getting a good walk feels great.

00:36:02.529 --> 00:36:07.280
So that's what I kind of do.
And the dancing and yoga and anything you

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.280
feel like.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.519
&gt;&gt; Well, I want to thank you for coming.

00:36:12.519 --> 00:36:15.369
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Thank you.

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:33.609
&gt;&gt; 
And I wanted to ask you about these like -- have

00:36:33.609 --> 00:36:41.489
you heard of, like,
Medifast?

00:36:41.489 --> 00:36:52.369
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Medifast?
I don't think I have.

00:36:52.369 --> 00:37:07.930
&gt;&gt; So it's one of these programs where you,
you know, you sign up and

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:30.979
you, you buy their food you know.
And you go on like three times a day and get

00:37:30.979 --> 00:37:35.650
weighed or whatever and
you sit on their program for quite a while.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:36.650
And you know, then like after a year you can
lose 75 or a hundred

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:37.650
pounds.
I just wanted to ask you about that because

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.650
I know people that have
done Medifast.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:39.650
And like, they lost 75 pounds over a year.
And then they moved and they got off of Medifast,

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:40.650
and then they -- they
gain it all back.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.650
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Yeah.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:42.650
&gt;&gt; And, you know it's -- it's you have to
buy their prepackaged food,

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.650
you know, and you blend it.
And you drink their shakes five times day

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.650
and then you have one meal a
day.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.650
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: I don't like the sound
of that.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.650
&gt;&gt; I just wanted it ask, you know, like cause
this person now, you

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.650
know, I know him.
And they want to lose their weight again and

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:48.650
they're thinking about
getting on one of these Medifast programs

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:49.650
again so they lose the weight
so --

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:50.650
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Well, I'd recommend that
 --

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:51.650
&gt;&gt; I was just wandering what to tell them
to help them --

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:52.650
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: So what I would recommend
that read this because

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.650
this will free them for that brain thing of
like -- I mean the whole

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:54.650
idea of going somewhere where they weigh you
three times a day?

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:55.650
Did you say?

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:56.650
&gt;&gt; Three times a week.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:57.650
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: That doesn't sound very
good either.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.650
And then the whole blending thing constantly
and the processed -- it

00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.650
doesn't sound like real food.
And sure, I don't know what is in there, but

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.650
I know that the real food
is what we're looking for.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:01.650
It's to get people back to eating nourishing,
delicious, real food.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.119
And if it takes a little bit of time, just
a little bit, to make that

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:07.369
effort to find it or make it yourself, it's
worth it.

00:38:07.369 --> 00:38:09.460
And then you don't have to be on a diet ever
again.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.319
And you can go to France, and you can go to
Italy, and you can go

00:38:12.319 --> 00:38:22.019
wherever you want in the world and be free.
And not have to have your little Medifast

00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:25.450
shake.
You know what I mean?

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:26.880
Yeah.
Thank you.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.930
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Alicia.
I wanted to say at that as someone who got

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:33.059
a copy of your book and
bought one and went through some of the recipes,

00:38:33.059 --> 00:38:37.089
it was so much fun to
just sort of explore parts of the grocery

00:38:37.089 --> 00:38:40.950
store that I never really
knew existed.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:45.460
Asking the people there, the people that worked
in the store, sort of,

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.599
if they know about these products and sort
of having them investigate

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:52.299
too because they actually didn't know these
products existed.

00:38:52.299 --> 00:38:56.099
But the greatest thing I think about the book
and maybe you can speak

00:38:56.099 --> 00:39:00.260
to this too is just sort of how it can be
a project.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.389
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Yeah.

00:39:01.389 --> 00:39:04.829
&gt;&gt; And just sort of a collaborative thing
for friends to do on a Sunday

00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:07.079
afternoon.
Get some friends together and cook some things.

00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:11.029
Like, I made your peach cobbler.
I told you about that earlier.

00:39:11.029 --> 00:39:14.109
But it's so awesome.
It's so tasty.

00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:19.099
And I would never have known that it didn't
contain butter or any other

00:39:19.099 --> 00:39:23.140
dairy or anything fattening in it.
So it was pretty incredible.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.690
It's better than like a diet book that I've
tried that kind of makes

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.599
you feel -- I don't know.
Cheap like you're -- you're skimping out on

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:28.599
something.
This doesn't feel like that.

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:32.760
So I just want today speak to that or if you
have any comments.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:38.380
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Well, thanks.
I think that the ingredients that you're talking

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.619
about maybe are like
umeboshi vinegar, which for some of you might

00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:46.010
be familiar. Maybe your
moms had it or -- umeboshi was that what you

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.079
were looking for?

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:49.230
&gt;&gt; It was like kuzu and shoyu.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.869
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: So kuzu and shoyu is -- really
what shoyu is it's

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:56.349
soy sauce.
We all know what soy sauce is but shoyu is

00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:58.089
just a cleaner version of
it.

00:39:58.089 --> 00:40:03.210
So it's not with all the yucky stuff in it.
And -- and kuzu is a seaweed that -- well,

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.450
well no sorry.
Agar agar is a seaweed.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.859
Kuzu is a seaweed, too, isn't it?
I can't even remember.

00:40:06.859 --> 00:40:10.339
Let me see.
I have to look it up.

00:40:10.339 --> 00:40:13.469
&gt;&gt; I know it's a thickener of some kind.

00:40:13.469 --> 00:40:16.799
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Yeah, it looks like crack.
It's really awesome.

00:40:16.799 --> 00:40:20.369
I want to show you a picture of it.

00:40:20.369 --> 00:40:23.020
&gt;&gt; It does come in little plastic baggies.
That's true.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.220
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Okay, look.
This is kuzu.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.309
Doesn't it look like powder, you know?
But it's so good for you, kuzu, it really

00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:34.989
is.
It's not crack, I promise.

00:40:34.989 --> 00:40:39.609
But it's so good for you.
But it's -- it's in the macrobiotic section.

00:40:39.609 --> 00:40:44.369
So you might have to like move over to the
macrobiotics section.

00:40:44.369 --> 00:40:48.299
But even in like regular groceries stores
these days like Ralph's and

00:40:48.299 --> 00:40:50.469
things -- there's this amazing new product
called Gardein.

00:40:50.469 --> 00:40:54.050
Not that new.
But he's developing newer products and he

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:55.380
has this, you know, fake
chicken.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:01.650
But it's not fake like processed, gross chicken.
He uses quinoa and all kinds of great things

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.630
but somehow it turns into
this amazing chicken breast thing.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.400
And my husband's been making it, grilling
the -- sautéing the chicken

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.960
cut up with onions and then putting it on
these pizzas.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.809
This is for when he -- I try not to have this
kind of food around me

00:41:16.809 --> 00:41:21.369
too often because I'll go crazy.
But it's really yummy for if you have -- well,

00:41:21.369 --> 00:41:22.369
you guys don't have
kids.

00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:25.799
I mean, maybe you do.
I don't know.

00:41:25.799 --> 00:41:29.720
But kids and husbands and whatever.
Because it's just fun foods.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.059
So it's -- Amy's makes these amazing frozen
pizzas and she makes them

00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:36.239
with no cheese. And they are like whole wheat
crusts and things like

00:41:36.239 --> 00:41:39.609
that.
And you can take the roasted vegetable, Amy's

00:41:39.609 --> 00:41:43.219
pizza, and put this
chicken that is from Gardein with grilled

00:41:43.219 --> 00:41:47.810
onions on top.
And he adds more cheese to from Earth -- a

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.290
few great new cheeses out
there but Follow Your Heart makes really a

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:56.079
great one.
And then he makes a milkshake on the side

00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:57.460
with, you know, rice milk and
things like that.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.980
And ice cream.
Not, you know, regular ice cream but Rice

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.910
Dream ice cream.
And they're delicious.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:05.259
And you can do so many great things.
And I'm so glad that you're loving the recipes.

00:42:05.259 --> 00:42:08.430
And I'm glad that you feel like it's a project.
That's how I feel.

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:13.279
I feel like everywhere I go is an adventure.
And I love engaging with the waiters at the

00:42:13.279 --> 00:42:16.970
restaurants and saying what
would make you sad if I didn't have while

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.430
I was here?
And sometimes they're like -- don't want to

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:22.020
talk to you at all and they
just look at you like you're the most annoying

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.079
person ever.
And sometimes they're so excited.

00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:24.960
And they're like oh my God, you have to get
this.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.039
And then you're engaging in a fun conversation
with someone.

00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:31.619
So I really think of life as a big adventure
and projects.

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:35.019
So taking the effort to take care of myself
and the planet and these

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:37.730
creatures, all at the same time, is so much
fun.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:41.589
And it's such a pleasure.
And putting something in a compost bin thrills

00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:43.670
me -- we have a compost
at home.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.420
And you know seeing the lizard that -- Larry
the lizard, who waits for

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.813
us every day at our compost thing.
I believe it's the same guy.

00:42:48.813 --> 00:42:51.849
It might not be.
But we like to believe he is.

00:42:51.849 --> 00:42:55.729
Looking up at me like it's so much fun, and
so yeah.

00:42:55.729 --> 00:42:59.660
I think it's all really exciting and I'm so
glad you feel that way.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:00.660
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:01.660
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Thanks.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.829
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a
little bit about, you know,

00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:08.690
why and how you decided to kind of make a
transition in your career to

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.849
focus so much on this stuff as both a spokesperson
to write the book

00:43:12.849 --> 00:43:19.230
and -- and what are your plans, you know,
in the future with this?

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.819
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Well, you know, I became
famous when I was really

00:43:21.819 --> 00:43:25.630
young.
And it was really scary and weird and freaky.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:31.630
And I wanted to -- I kind of got really isolated.
And I had these passions that were starting

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.079
to grow about all this
stuff.

00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:37.700
And it was just a way for me to focus -- to
kind of -- I was just

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:42.599
called like I felt like this was more important
than everything I was

00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:45.950
experiencing.
So in some ways I kind of, you know, turned

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.069
away from what was
happening.

00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:54.090
But I hope I can, you know, it's sort of like
this -- I never -- I was

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:56.400
always sort of being restrained from talking
about this.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.779
It was often like stop talking about -- like
you know, cause it was

00:44:00.779 --> 00:44:03.109
sort of like that was all I wanted to talk
about.

00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:07.950
And -- but I think now that I'm a woman and
I really know what I'm

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:11.550
talking about, and I really know from experience
of this being for so

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:15.749
long, the decision to write the book was that
all these -- I'd helped

00:44:15.749 --> 00:44:19.710
all these people.
I have a lot of friends who couldn't poo.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:21.940
They were like constipated and they didn't
poo for days.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.050
And I was like you have to be pooing every
day.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:28.009
It's terrible.
And so when you change their diets, suddenly

00:44:28.009 --> 00:44:31.559
they're going to the
bathroom every day and sometimes twice and

00:44:31.559 --> 00:44:35.239
three times.
So I saw such great results.

00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:38.300
And I also had a friend -- not from -- I wasn't
like studying their

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:43.220
thing, you know what I mean.
And then I had other friends who had ovarian

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.299
cysts.
There was this one girl who had ovarian cysts

00:44:45.299 --> 00:44:47.119
and she was going to have
to have surgery in one month, and I was like

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:50.450
I can please just have
this month of yours?

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.729
You can have your surgery, but let's see what
happens in this month.

00:44:53.729 --> 00:44:56.660
She did it, and after that month when she
went to the doctor's, they

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.380
checked and she didn't have to have them.
They were already shrinking.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:02.009
So when you see those kinds of results firsthand
 -- like I know those

00:45:02.009 --> 00:45:05.999
are happening to people all over the world.
Like all the doctors I mentioned who are curing

00:45:05.999 --> 00:45:08.780
heart disease, cancer,
and diabetes and all these things.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.140
I knew that was happening but when my littles
hands were able to be

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.109
connected to that and help people, that's
unbelievable feeling.

00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:18.279
It's so remarkable.
It blows my mind.

00:45:18.279 --> 00:45:21.730
And so, they kept telling me, you have to
write a book.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:22.730
And every time I'd give them my information,
it kind of came in the big

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:26.420
pamphlet or it was sort of like this big epic
file on the computer.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:30.170
And finally one particular person was like,
you need to write a book

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.410
right now.
Like stop this nonsense.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.930
Stop kind of like spending all this --
I was spending so much energy as a activist

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:38.960
for so long helping so many
different people but it was so exhausting

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:43.579
and not organized.
This is the organized sense of -- and I can

00:45:43.579 --> 00:45:46.609
reach more people.
And so that's really what I'm doing.

00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:49.509
But I've been doing, even those you haven't
seen me in film, I've been

00:45:49.509 --> 00:45:53.289
doing plays.
I love the theater and kind of went back to

00:45:53.289 --> 00:45:54.289
the root of what it all
was.

00:45:54.289 --> 00:45:58.710
So I play again and I found why I wanted to
be an actor in the first

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.170
place.
Because I started to hate acting and I found

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:04.575
that I love acting.
And I love theater and that's really what

00:46:04.575 --> 00:46:05.670
I want to do.
So I want to be in movies, too.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.609
But I've just been doing bunch of theater.
And so I did David Mamet plays.

00:46:08.609 --> 00:46:10.030
He directed me in a play that's fantastic.
David Mamet's a genius.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:15.619
I'm doing Donald Margulies play.
And I'm doing a play on Broadway this year

00:46:15.619 --> 00:46:19.920
with Laura Linney.
And so I'm going to continue to act, and I'm

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.519
going to continue to
hopefully help change the world with this

00:46:22.519 --> 00:46:28.549
book and the website.
And I also made these -- these bags that are

00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:32.309
really cool that are going
to be at Target and Walmart and places like

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:33.910
that, that are totally
environmentally sound.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:37.640
They're made with recycled PET -- they're
basically cosmetic bags that

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.690
are made with hemp, recycled PET and vegetable
dyes.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:45.400
And then there are make up brushes that are
all beautiful and they feel

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.339
really good.
And they're made with bamboo and recycled

00:46:47.339 --> 00:46:49.329
metals.
So we're trying to just create.

00:46:49.329 --> 00:46:53.019
Wherever we see a need, wherever I see a need,
I'm trying to fill it as

00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:57.309
best I can in my own little way.
And that's kind of what I'm doing.

00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:58.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.140
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Thanks.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.239
&gt;&gt; Second question.
So we at Google are very lucky because we

00:47:03.239 --> 00:47:04.819
have chefs that make us
incredible food every day.

00:47:04.819 --> 00:47:07.470
Vegetarian, so friendly.
Meat, also.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:16.869
I just was curious what you thought about
the food here and if you had

00:47:16.869 --> 00:47:17.869
talked to any of our chefs.

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:18.869
ALICIA SILVERSTONE: Yeah, I did.
I loved Elizabeth.

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:21.289
She's so sweet.
And she was chef over at Slice.

00:47:21.289 --> 00:47:24.200
And she, I loved that you had coconut water.
That was fun.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.029
Although, I do think that it's traveling a
long way to get here.

00:47:27.029 --> 00:47:30.910
We don't have coconuts growing here.
But it's a fun treat.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.190
So I had one.
Because it's delicious.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:36.559
And I mean I don't know if you ever had coconut
water but it is tasty.

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:41.089
And then I had those little energy bars which
were really yummy.

00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:45.209
I would think that would be a dessert or a
snack.

00:47:45.209 --> 00:47:48.059
And, she made some recipes from my book that
were delicious.

00:47:48.059 --> 00:47:49.059
So I could tell you that, the arame turnovers
are amazing.

00:47:49.059 --> 00:47:54.890
Arame is a really important seaweed to get
into your life, if you get

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:57.890
it in.
And so I'm sure if you ask her to continue

00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:59.239
making the arame turnovers,
she would here.

00:47:59.239 --> 00:48:05.999
They're so good for you.
And try to get some seaweed in your life.

00:48:05.999 --> 00:48:06.999
It's good.
I like the food here.

00:48:06.999 --> 00:48:09.670
It was really good.
I mean, I would love -- I was talking to the

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.719
guys, and it would be so
amazing if I -- you know, they have that sort

00:48:11.719 --> 00:48:16.400
of art piece project of
how the food is -- there's that one vending

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.109
machine where there's the
stuff and it shows you kind of how much it

00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:20.950
would cost.
It's the one place you have to pay.

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:24.330
But that kind of inspired me to think, wouldn't
it be amazing if here

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:27.359
at Google, you guys had all your plant-based
food for free.

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:31.210
And then you did the actual cost of what it
actually costs

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.450
environmentally, for your health, and all
that for all the other

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.749
products.
So that you can make that choice and it would

00:48:36.749 --> 00:48:39.619
make everybody a lot
healthier.

00:48:39.619 --> 00:48:42.940
