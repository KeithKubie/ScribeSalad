00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.341
<i> The work that I've
 been doing at MIT</i>

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.842
<i> focuses on finding</i>

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.444
<i> individual memories
 in the brain</i>

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.145
and then trying to actually
tinker with those memories.

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:14.881
Can we turn them on,
can we turn them off

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.916
can we change the contents
of those memories?

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.685
Ethical stuff aside, you can
imagine the implications

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:21.220
for things like
actually being able to

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.957
activate memories in
Alzheimer's, for example.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:27.159
Or using memories to
combat certain symptoms

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.395
associated with
psychiatric disorders.

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.264
<i> The main question that
 we started off</i>

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.998
<i> tackling was,
 can we go in,</i>

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:34.300
<i> can we find the brain cells</i>

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.935
that are active during
a particular memory

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.470
and again, can we actually
modulate those brain cells.

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:42.474
So, what we would do
is, uh, we would go in

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:43.643
we would find
these brain cells that

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.645
<i> we think are holding
 on to a particular memory</i>

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.680
<i> and we would actually
 artificially install</i>

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.349
<i> a light-sensitive switch
 in those brain cells.</i>

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:52.851
So, that means that we can
actually take an optic fiber,

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:54.654
do some careful brain surgery

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.422
and actually shoot
lasers into the brain

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:59.425
and reactivate these brain cells
or inactivate these brain cells

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.527
that we think are housing
a particular memory.

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:02.728
<i> You don't have
 to imagine any more</i>

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.797
<i> the possibility of
 bringing back a memory that</i>

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:07.900
was once thought to be lost,
in a patient with Alzheimer's.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.070
Or imagine going in and
turning the dial down

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.941
on the emotional gut-wrenching
"I hate my life" feeling of...

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.710
not a breakup but something more
seriously, something like PTSD.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.178
Imagine being able to
turn the dial down

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:20.479
on those negative emotions.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.250
Or being able to jump start
particular moods

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.451
when your mood is really low

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:28.688
or even under depression,
uh, in a depressed state.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:31.724
So, those are the things that we
don't have to imagine any more.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.226
Those are the things that
we are on the cusp of

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.760
actually being able to do

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.163
with, I think, powerful
therapeutic value.
