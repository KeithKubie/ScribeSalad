00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:07.000
Fanatee is a studio we started in 2013 introducing games with content,

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:10.333
especially word games, which we like a lot.

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:15.291
The most downloaded Fanatee game is STOP;

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.667
it has more than 10 million downloads on Android.

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:21.250
But today we have CodyCross, a game that was released in March of last year,

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:22.417
which we have grown considerably

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:24.792
and today already has more active users than STOP.

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:26.834
Android is growing a lot for us.

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:30.709
Today we get 75% of our downloads from Android.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.667
We live in an Google play's environment where distribution is done for the entire world,

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:39.625
and it's therefore important that you develop apps that can be used by anyone.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:44.500
In the case of the Fanatee games, location is extremely important.

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:48.291
The game has a local database, local content.

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:52.625
We practically make a game for each market.

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:58.166
We receive reviews from users in Canada who think our app was developed

00:00:58.208 --> 00:00:59.917
there by local developers.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.917
Because some questions were so close to their reality.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.500
People don't think that a company in Brazil

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:12.125
can create quality content that is relatable to such a different country as Canada.

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:18.583
We released CodyCross in March of last year and in July we tested the subscription model.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:23.083
We chose Germany and the United States for this test,

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:26.041
as these countries have a higher app purchasing rate.

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:30.125
Our subscription model gives you access to additional content,

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.333
this is its main benefit without watching ads.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:37.083
And our in-app purchases are hints and power-ups in the game,

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:39.625
which means ultimately there is no cannibalization.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:44.125
Our subscription revenue for CodyCross currently represents

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:48.875
between 15 and 20% of our total revenue in the countries where it is on offer.

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:53.208
We use some interesting tools like free trial, which is an important tool.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.917
Someone can test the app for 7 days,

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.875
after which around 50% of people convert into subscribers.

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:07.125
Currently, around 80% of our subscribers began with a free trial.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:12.542
CodyCross subscribers spend 50% more time in the game

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:18.417
and our retention of subscribers is up to 70% higher than other players.

00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:21.959
Subscription brings in more predictable revenues

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.917
and this is very attractive for the entrepreneur, for the developer.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.083
And it also gives you support as a revenue.

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:31.750
The main focus is to find an interesting

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:35.667
offer for the user that adds value and has a

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.583
cadence of content so the person remains motivated.

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:45.125
In addition, always communicate and release new content

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:51.041
so the user once subscribed, realizes that value is being created there.

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:55.542
The developer is concerned with increasing the amount of content or offerings.
