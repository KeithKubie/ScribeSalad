(class groaning)

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:22.589
- Excuse me, Ms. Klitnick is
in a BM today, a bad mood.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.659
Not one guy has winked at me
on PlentyOfGefilteFish.com

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.595
I'm feeling less than.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.897 align:start position:0%
Why don't you kids practice
writing writing the number five.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:31.931
(sniffling)

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.133
(class groaning)

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.734
- Danglers, see ya.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.339
- [Woman] Woohoo, my
period's late, lover.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.141
- I feel bad for Ms. Klitnick.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.076 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Why don't you do
reverse cowgirl with her?

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.210
(laughing)

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.112
- I want love.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.681
- Seriously Dana, what
can we do to help her?

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.516
- I know!

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.284
Let's catfish her.

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.186
Follow my weinerbush.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.155 align:start size:84% position:16%
(crying)
(keyboard clicking)

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.423
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.957 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Let's make a fake
profile so we can wink

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.826
at Ms. Klitnick to
make her feel better.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.161
Who's picture should we use?

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.996 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's gotta be
someone believable.

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.564
- (gasps) Barack Obama.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.132
- [Julia] (gasps) Yeah.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:07.300
- Want to love you.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.469
(beeping)

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.905
Oh my god, Julia, she got it.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.774
- (gasps) Oh my god, it's her.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.276
Let's meet at the Lazy Latke

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.578
at 3:00 p.m. to see
if we have chemistry.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.247
P.S. I won't have time to
shave so don't judge me.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.916
Dana, we can't do this.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.418
- Oh yeah! (laughs)

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.753
- See you there.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.788
(laughing)
(beeping)

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.191
- Class dismissed early today!

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.859
#blessed, #grateful.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.895
- Now what do we do?

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.298
- We just gotta find a
single guy to meet her.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.466
- Your dad's single.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.900
- Gross.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.103 align:start position:0%
- And your dad is a yoga
teacher so he has an open heart.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.204
- Shut your mouth.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.705
- And if it's a love connection,

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.441
we can spy on your dad
and Ms. Klitnick humping.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.009
- Boom!

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.178
(phone ringing)

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.515
- Well namaste my
little karma ball.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.584
Of course I'd love to
talk to Ms. Klitnick

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.553 align:start size:84% position:16%
about the importance
of breath work.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.755
- Mr. Goodman!

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.591
I didn't realize it was you.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:08.261 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's me, but please
call me Govindas.

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.530
(breathing)

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.365
- I've never done this before.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.235 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Not to worry, we're
in this together.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.904
♪ Can you make me
go ooh ooh, ooh ah

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.939
♪ Do you think you can touch me

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.008 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Wow, you have
really soft hands.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.378 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Truth be told, I
use a mashugana amount

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:28.882
of petroleum jelly to
moisturize my skins.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:31.618 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Why don't we
get right into it?

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.419
Follow my breath.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.256
(heavy breathing)

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.133
(shouting)

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:52.272
Wow, our chakras opened
up at the same time.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.008
- I feel so connected to you.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.643
- I haven't felt this connected

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.945
to someone since
Dana's mother died.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:02.448 align:start size:94% position:6%
- (sniffs) I don't want
Ms. Klitnick to be my mom.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.885
- Don't cry poopy pie,
your mom was the best.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.154
Ms. Klitnick can
never replace her.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.423
Look, Ms. Klitnick's underwear.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.692
(laughing)

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.161
- What?

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:16.229
Who?

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.964
- Look at me, Dottie.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.040
(moaning)

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:32.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That was a straight
up mitzvah y'all.

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:36.749 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're good girls trying to
take care of old Ms. Klitnick.

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.085
(smooching)

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.355
(laughing)

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.190
- Ham bump!
- Ham bump!
