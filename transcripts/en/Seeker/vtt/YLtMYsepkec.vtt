00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.990
If we have spacecraft that go like this, why
can't we have spacecraft that go LIKE THIS?!

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.059
Hey flight-suits thanks for stopping by DNews,
I'm Trace!

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.150
On December 15, NASA’s Cyclone Global Navigation
Satellite System --or CYGNSS -- launched into

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.539
Low-Earth orbit on a weird launch vehicle…
this one.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.619
Horizontal?

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:24.699
Wtf?

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.109
Why do we launch everything like THIS and
not like THIS?

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.670
When you picture rockets… you probably think
the Space Shuttle, Apollo's Saturn V, SpaceX's

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.260
Falcon, Blue Origin's New Glenn, and Orbital
ATK's Antares, or maybe just model rockets

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.610
at home -- regardless, they're all vertical
takeoff launches, but why?

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.350
In 2013, there were 81 space launches and
a handful of failures; in 2014: 92 launches

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.960
with 90 reaching orbit successfully.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.949
Vertical chemical rockets are risky and expensive.

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.010
But, according to the FAA, flight controllers
handle 50,000 flights every day.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.580
So why not "launch" sideways?

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.090
First, we have!

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.440
In 1963, NASA strapped a tiny plane called
an X-15 to the bottom of a B-52.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.270
Once they achieved altitude, they sent the
pilot just barely into space.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.190
These projects were essential in learning
how to enter and exit space, how to design

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.110
pressure suits for pilots, how air friction
could heat up the surface of a vehicle…

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.560
and so many other things.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.280
Then, in the late-1980s, Orbital Sciences
engineer Dr. Antonio Elias updated his old

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.020
design and ended up incepting the design of
Pegasus -- which is the launch you saw at

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.020
the top of this video.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.380
Pegasus launches from the belly of a mothership,
the Lockheed L-1011, and it's been used since

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.380
1990.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.330
Put simply, the L-1011 lifts the Pegasus to
the regular cruising altitude of about 40,000

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.000
feet (12,200m), and drops it!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.210
Then the delta-style wings and the rocket
shoot it toward space reaching low-earth orbit

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.860
in about 10 minutes.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.310
These horizontal systems have a few advantages!

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.430
For example, the atmosphere at about 40,000
feet (12,200m) is thinner which means less

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.470
friction and potentially less fuel, airplanes
can move the rocket above the weather avoiding

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.950
some of those launch challenges, and because
you can fly the payload anywhere you don't

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.150
need a launchpad!

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.390
In this case, the Pegasus launched over the
Pacific Ocean, about halfway between Hawaii

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.390
and Australia.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.860
Unfortunately, a DARPA study found when you
factor in the cost of the launch vehicles,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.780
it can make them more expensive.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.120
In the end, airplane-style launches versus
vertical launches have different goals.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.130
To escape Earth's gravity, a rocket needs
to go 7 miles per second or 25,000 mph (11,176

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.130
m/s).

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.270
The fastest airplane ever built?

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.120
That X-15, and it only hits 4,520 mph (2,020
m/s).

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.580
Shooting straight up is the quickest way to
reach escape velocity, and can carry a lot

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.790
of mass on it's way.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.960
The Space Launch System, that NASA is developing,
can carry almost 70,000 kilograms.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.180
The Pegasus can only carry 443 kilograms.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.540
That being said, the Pegasus isn't the end-all
of horizontal flight.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.260
The Stratolaunch system by Vulcan aerospace
will use a six-engine airplane and could fly

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.240
to 40,000 feet (12,200m) and launch a full-size
SpaceX Falcon9!

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.870
The plane would need a wingspan longer than
a football field… wider than the statue

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.460
of liberty is tall.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.480
It's crazy.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.790
More realistically, a NASA project is in the
works that uses tracks (similar to roller

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.740
coasters at theme parks, but ridiculously
fast).

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.870
These could be used to propel winged spaceplane.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.290
Though at the moment they're only thinking
about drones.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.290
If you want to launch people you could think
of the SpaceShipOne, which carried the first

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.900
human on a commercial spaceflight in 2004.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.900
It hooks onto the belly of a specialized plane
called the White Night.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.780
As commercial spaceflight expands, you'll
probably see more of these horizontal launches

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.780
in the future.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.069
So, why don't we launch from airplanes?

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.069
We do!

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.660
Just, not that often.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.540
Wondering why it's so hard to launch rockets
sometimes?

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.569
Amy and I have that answer here.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.569
Which is your favorite?

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.200
The booming excitement of a ground-based launches,
or the screaming freefall of an air launch?
