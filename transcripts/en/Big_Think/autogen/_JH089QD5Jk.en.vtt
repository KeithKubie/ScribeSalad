maybe life did evolved from viruses and

maybe life did evolved from viruses and

bacteria are different from viruses in

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
bacteria are different from viruses in
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.160
bacteria are different from viruses in
that bacteria have these separate

that bacteria have these separate
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.770
that bacteria have these separate
structures whereas viruses seem to be a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
structures whereas viruses seem to be a
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.899

single molecule what you might think of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
single molecule what you might think of
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.440
single molecule what you might think of
as a single molecule and so viruses are

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
as a single molecule and so viruses are
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.590
as a single molecule and so viruses are
more akin to proteins than they are to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
more akin to proteins than they are to
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.950
more akin to proteins than they are to
bacteria but proteins are created by

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
bacteria but proteins are created by
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.889
bacteria but proteins are created by
bacteria so it is very reasonable that

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
bacteria so it is very reasonable that

there was some ancestor to viruses and

there was some ancestor to viruses and

there was some ancestor to viruses and

could cause chemical changes that would

could cause chemical changes that would
happen very very fast and so the idea is

happen very very fast and so the idea is
 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.760

that you would look for or try to create

existence created copies of themselves
and so that was the goal it turns out

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660
and so that was the goal it turns out
 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.160
and so that was the goal it turns out
that creating amino acids these are

that creating amino acids these are
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.540
that creating amino acids these are
biological molecules that have a carbon

they're very similar but they're not

they're very similar but they're not
 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.009
they're very similar but they're not
that we don't find them in nature so all

that we don't find them in nature so all
 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.960
that we don't find them in nature so all
this makes me think that it is

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970
this makes me think that it is
 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.040
this makes me think that it is
reasonable that someone could create

reasonable that someone could create
 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.460

we would find that the maybe there is a

we would find that the maybe there is a

dangerous would it be like a super virus

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239
dangerous would it be like a super virus

it didn't kill us so maybe you'll be the
