00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's say I run some type of
sheep farm, maybe some type

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.240
of wool producing business.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.440
And in year one, I go out
there, I buy a bunch of sheep,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.890
and I put them on some land.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.090
And I go and I buy the
sheep for $1 million.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.020
And I buy the land
for $1.2 million.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.870
So I have $2.2
million in assets.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.520
Nothing confusing there.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.580
Now, let's go to
year two, and think

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.950
about how we want to account
for the sheep and the land.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.450
So one way we could
say is, oh look,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.560
the sheep are still there.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.850
The land is still there.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.534
I paid a $1 million
for the sheep

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.700
and they're all still there.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.060
So I'll put on my books that
the sheep are still $1 million.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.020
And I paid $1.2
million for the land.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.950
So I'll put on my books that
the land is $1.2 million.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.620
So in this situation,
I've accounted

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.080
for the sheep and the land
based on their historical cost.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.540
So let me write this down.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.820
This is based on
historical cost.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.756
Now, this is a legitimate way to
account for things, especially

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.380
if there's no other
way to really think

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.660
about what my sheep
or my land are worth.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.860
I'd say, look, this is
what I paid for them.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.650
Now let's say that there is
an active market in sheep,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.930
and you can get
a sheep appraiser

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.100
to come over to your
farm and tell you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.520
what your sheep are worth.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.190
And your sheep appraiser
comes and says,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.950
wow, your sheep
are looking good.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.469
There's been a big-- I
don't know-- sheep epidemic

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:28.760
in another part of the country.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.620
So there's a sheep shortage.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.960
So your sheep are
actually worth a lot more

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.670
than they were last year.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.040
And they say, I think your
sheep are now worth $2 million.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.390
So you say, hey, wow, the
market value of my sheep

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.380
is $2 million.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.880
So you could say, well, instead
of putting $1 million there,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.900
let me put $2 million.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.440
Let me put $2
million for my sheep.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.500
And let's say that the
land is also appreciated.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.820
A highway's gone by
and someone wants

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.160
to build a development nearby.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.900
So the fair value of your
land has also gone up,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.690
maybe it's also $2 million.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.740
So both of these.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.290
So this is $2 million.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.370
And this is $2 million.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.786
So this right over
here, you could

00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:13.300
view as the market value or
the fair value of your sheep.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.529
Now, either one of these are
legitimate ways of accounting,

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.070
but it's good to
know the difference.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.120
This is historical
cost accounting.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.910
This is fair value accounting.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.530
In general, most
accounting standards boards

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.070
want people to
report the fair value

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.580
or to market value as
frequently as possible.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.500
And it's very easy
to do if there

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.894
is kind of a market in that.

00:02:33.894 --> 00:02:36.060
Or you can get an appraiser
in and they can give you

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.010
a pretty good estimate of
what these things are worth.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.970
If that isn't around, or if
it's just inefficient to do it,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.610
then you'd probably want to
do the historical cost method.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.870
So that's all the difference.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.250
Historical cost, how
much you paid for it.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.020
Fair value, what's the
current market value today.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.830
So they sound like
very fancy words,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.560
but it's a pretty simple idea.
