00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.433
In this lesson, we're going to extend our knowledge of solving radical

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:08.890
equations. This time our radical equations will lead to a quadratic equation.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.418
We'll apply the same strategy of isolating the radical on one side, and then

00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:17.203
we'll raise both sides of the equation to the index of that radical. For

00:00:17.203 --> 00:00:20.636
example, if we have this radical equation? What will we get if we get if we

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:23.160
square the left side and the right side?
