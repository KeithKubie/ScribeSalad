00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.850
So to start off, I decided to grab the values of the street and city.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.660
And to do so I opened up Dev tools and

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.890
saw that street has an ID of street, and the city input has an ID of city.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.160
Back inside the script I created a new variable called streetStr, and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.030
I set it equal the value of the text inside the element with the ID of street.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.420
I did the same thing for city.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.100
And then I created a full address with a comma in

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.380
between by concatenating them together.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.970
I, of course, made our fun little heading that says, so

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.470
you want to live at the White House, or 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.972
And then I created a URL.

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:41.890
This streetViewUrl is simply a string that starts off with what we

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.090
saw before in the API.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.250
I decided to hard code the size as 600 by 400 pixels.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.030
And then we set the location to the address that we just created up here.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.790
Then it's a simple matter of appending the right image to

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.730
the page with the right class and the right URL.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.550
To test our code, let's use a different address.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.280
I've entered in the address to AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, and let's hit Submit.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.820
Okay. This looks good but let's double check.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.290
I'll go ahead and get rid of New York Times and Wikipedia real quick.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.630
And check it out, we've got AT&amp;T Park in the background.
