00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:12.417
In 1861, two scientists got into
a very brainy argument.

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:16.447
Specifically, they had opposing ideas
of how speech and memory

00:00:16.447 --> 00:00:18.923
operated within the human brain.

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:21.540
Ernest Aubertin, 
with his localistic model,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.822
argued that a particular region
or the brain

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:26.654
was devoted to each separate process.

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:30.744
Pierre Gratiolet, on the other hand,
argued for the distributed model,

00:00:30.744 --> 00:00:32.739
where different regions work together

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.507
to accomplish all of these 
various functions.

00:00:35.507 --> 00:00:39.105
The debate they began reverberated
throughout the rest of the century,

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.937
involving some of the greatest scientific
minds of the time.

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:46.955
Aubertin and his localistic model
had some big names on his side.

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:50.164
In the 17th century, RenÃ© Descartes
had assigned the quality

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:54.729
of free will and the human soul
to the pineal gland.

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.899
And in the late 18th century, a young
student named Franz Joseph Gall

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.193
had observed that the best memorizers
in his class had the most prominent eyes

00:01:04.193 --> 00:01:06.704
and decided that this was due 
to higher development

00:01:06.704 --> 00:01:09.140
in the adjacent part of the brain.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.968
As a physician, Gall went on to establish
the study of phrenology,

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:16.050
which held that strong mental faculties
corresponded to

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.843
highly developed brain regions, observable
as bumps in the skull.

00:01:20.843 --> 00:01:24.787
The widespread popularity of phrenology
throughout the early 19th century

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:28.040
tipped the scales towards 
Aubertin's localism.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.699
But the problem was that Gall had never
bothered to scientifically test

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:34.800
whether the individual brain maps
he had constructed

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.930
applied to all people.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.341
And in the 1840's, Pierre Flourens
challenged phrenology

00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:43.594
by selectively destroying parts
of animal brains

00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:46.125
and observing which functions were lost.

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:48.019
Flourens found that damaging the cortex

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:51.323
interfered with judgement or movement
in general,

00:01:51.323 --> 00:01:55.611
but failed to identify any region
associated with one specific function,

00:01:55.611 --> 00:02:00.393
concluding that the cortex carried out
brain functions as an entire unit.

00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:04.550
Flourens had scored a victory 
for Gratiolet, but it was not to last.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.258
Gall's former student, 
Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud,

00:02:07.258 --> 00:02:09.003
challenged Flourens' conclusion,

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.470
observing that patients 
with speech disorders

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.046
all had damage to the frontal lobe.

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:18.734
And after Paul Broca's 1861 autopsy of a
patient who had lost the power

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:21.812
to produce speech, but not the power
to understand it,

00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:24.749
revealed highly localized 
frontal lobe damage,

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.551
the distributed model seemed doomed.

00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:29.158
Localism took off.

00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:33.260
In the 1870's, Karl Wernicke associated
part of the left temporal lobe

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.188
with speech comprehension.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.587
Soon after, Eduard Hitzig and 
Gustav Fritsch

00:02:37.587 --> 00:02:41.673
stimulated a dog's cortex and discovered
a frontal lobe region

00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:44.281
responsible for muscular movements.

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:47.632
Building on their work, David Ferrier
mapped each piece of cortex

00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:50.741
associated with moving a part of the body.

00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:56.739
And in 1909, Korbinian Brodmann built
his own cortex map with 52 separate areas.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.226
It appeared that the victory of Aubertin's
localistic model was sealed.

00:03:01.226 --> 00:03:04.877
But neurologist Karl Wernicke had come up
with an interesting idea.

00:03:04.877 --> 00:03:08.825
He reasoned that since the regions for
speech production and comprehension

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:10.373
were not adjacent,

00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:13.109
then injuring the area 
connecting them might result

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.148
in a special type of language loss,
now known as receptive aphasia.

00:03:18.148 --> 00:03:21.004
Wernicke's connectionist model helped
explain disorders

00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:25.028
that didn't result from the dysfunction 
of just one area.

00:03:25.028 --> 00:03:28.046
Modern neuroscience tools reveal a brain
more complex than

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:32.043
Gratiolet, Aubertin,
or even Wernicke imagined.

00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:36.239
Today, the hippocampus is associated
with two distinct brain functions:

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.776
creating memories and processing
location in space.

00:03:40.776 --> 00:03:43.337
We also now measure 
two kinds of connectivity:

00:03:43.337 --> 00:03:46.122
anatomical connectivity between 
two adjoining

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:48.175
regions of cortex working together,

00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:51.033
and functional connectivity 
between separated regions

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:54.287
working together to
accomplish one process.

00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:56.285
A seemingly basic function like vision

00:03:56.285 --> 00:03:59.229
is actually composed 
of many smaller functions,

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.442
with different parts 
of the cortex representing

00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:04.581
shape, color and location in space.

00:04:04.581 --> 00:04:07.856
When certain areas stop functioning,
we may recognize an object,

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:10.536
but not see it, or vice versa.

00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:14.729
There are even different kinds of memory
for facts and for routines.

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.192
And remembering something 
like your first bicycle

00:04:17.192 --> 00:04:20.996
involves a network of different regions
each representing the concept

00:04:20.996 --> 00:04:24.491
of vehicles, the bicycle's shape, 
the sound of the bell,

00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:27.422
and the emotions associated 
with that memory.

00:04:27.422 --> 00:04:31.360
In the end, both Gratiolet and Aubertin
turned out to be right.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.147
And we still use both of their models
to understand how cognition happens.

00:04:35.147 --> 00:04:39.515
For example, we can now measure brain
activity on such a fine time scale

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:42.971
that we can see the individual localized
processes that comprise

00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:45.240
a single act of remembering.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.362
But it is the integration of these
different processes and regions

00:04:48.362 --> 00:04:51.268
that creates the coherent memory
we experience.

00:04:51.268 --> 00:04:55.328
The supposedly competing theories
prove to be two aspects

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:57.326
of a more comprehensive model,

00:04:57.326 --> 00:04:59.302
which will in turn be revised and refined

00:04:59.302 --> 00:05:04.060
as our scientific techologies and methods
for understanding the brain improve.
