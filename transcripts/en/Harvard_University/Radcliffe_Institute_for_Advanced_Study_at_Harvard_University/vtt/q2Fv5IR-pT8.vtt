00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.450
-Welcome back.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.900
So we have two panels
this afternoon--

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.120
one on public discourse
and this one on big data.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.850
So I'll ask the
panelists to come up.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.130
And I'm going to introduce the
moderator, Rebecca Lemov, who

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.340
is a professor in the Department
of the History of Science,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.450
and she's also the author of a
book called Database of Dreams,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.940
which is about using early
database technology to try

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.310
to construct a large database
of social, psychological,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.330
anthropological data,
and is currently

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.510
working on history of course of
interrogation and brainwashing,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.450
which sounds fascinating.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.360
So I'll turn it over to Rebecca.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.650
-Thank you for the
introduction, and thanks

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.590
for the chance to be here.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.280
I really enjoyed the day so
far, and I think our panel now

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.070
will offer a shift
in perspective

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.570
and also a shift in methodology.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.490
So I'll try to frame that.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.770
Let's see.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.790
So we live in what is sometimes
called the petabyte era,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.880
and this pronouncement
in turn causes

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.130
much discussion of
the sheer size of data

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.120
that is being produced
as well as the rapidity

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.290
with which that's happening.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.220
And I'm going to make
this statistic up,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.490
but you hear things
like more data

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.390
is being created in
the last 10 years

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420
than in all of human
history combined-- or maybe

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.420
in the last 10 minutes.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.560
We're not quite sure.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.490
But certainly it's mounting up.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.420
And what is often forgotten, I
think, or temporarily put aside

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.830
in such excited and
excitable discussions

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.650
is how much of this
newly created stuff

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.860
is made of and out of
personal data, the almost

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.540
literal mining, tracking, and
harvesting of subjectivity

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.310
of people's lives,
in other words.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.940
And I think that point was
made earlier by Janet Mock

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.620
in the keynote discussion,
where she said, "Our phones are

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.870
extensions of ourselves.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.080
We carry ourselves on them."

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.050
And so this panel,
in a sense, looks

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.980
at what happens when that
data circulates and is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.240
amassed in large amounts
or studied in other ways,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.810
and what we can
learn when it becomes

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.060
the topic of social science.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.860
And so when introducing
the topic of big data,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.190
I often start with the 1973
Charlton Heston classic Soylent

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.030
Green, which is set in the
sci-fi dystopian future of 2022

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.470
in case any of you
haven't seen it recently,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.360
in which pollution,
overpopulation, depleted

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.190
resources, dying oceans, and
assisted suicide are the norm,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.599
and the rations are this
stuff called soylent green.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.140
And, of course, the
famous tag line--

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.830
I hope I'm not ruining
it for anyone--

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.560
is that soylent green
turns out to be people.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.670
But you could also argue
that big data is people

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.870
in a, perhaps, suggestive way.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.130
And today in the press,
in the business world

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.220
and scholarly
journals, the question

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.780
arises of what is
unique about big data?

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.250
Is it hype?

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.540
Will the phrase even
exist in 5 years?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.700
Often definitions of big
data are strangely circular,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.500
as in this one from the
Columbia Journalism Review--

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.541
"Big data is a
catchall label that

00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:36.790
describes a new way of
understanding the world," which

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.340
basically boils down to big
data is data that is very big.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.650
I teach a whole
class on the history

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.840
and present and
future of big data,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.360
so ambiguity and the
hype of it, actually,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.650
is quite useful for
discussing a range of topics

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.140
about basically how technology
is changing our lives,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.010
and in that spirit
that's one of the reasons

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.440
we have titled this
panel Big Data.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.310
Many resort to
definitions of big data

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.860
that stress the three V's
which are volume, variety,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.590
and veracity.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.839
And these, in fact, were
coined in 2001 by an industry

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.860
analyst who was
trying to describe

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.630
the problems with big
data, not necessarily

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.760
its revolutionary
properties, but they've

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.640
gone on to become the very
definition of big data.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.140
Others talk about its
transformational properties,

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.540
and in a bold piece
for Wired magazine,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.060
the technology evangelist
Chris Anderson claimed

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.270
the end of theory
had been reached

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.510
and that so much data now exists
that it's unnecessary to build

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.260
a hypothesis to
test scientifically,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.080
but rather the data can,
if you properly handle it,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.450
speak for itself.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.800
And so I think we have
a couple data scientists

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.150
and an ethnographer of
identity in social media today

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.650
who will speak to some
of these questions.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.240
But I thought I would
start by just reminding us

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.830
that some of these
qualities of big data

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.990
that are important
to keep in mind

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.900
are precisely
where it comes from

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.930
and its quality of being
generated continuously.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.300
So if you think about things
like the continuous recording

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.660
of retail purchases,
digital devices that

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.900
record the history
of their own use,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.560
like mobile phones or
the logging of banking

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.550
or clickstream data,
recording people's

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.180
navigations through websites
or apps, or the way that we do

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.050
leave a stream in our online
interactions of comments,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.930
of likes and clicks.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.660
For example, in 2012
Walmart was generating

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.290
more than 2.5 petabytes
of data relating

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.090
to more than 1 million customer
transactions every hour.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.260
And Facebook reported
a couple years ago

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.170
that it was processing 2.5
billion pieces of content,

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.590
including language
links, comments,

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.800
and likes-- which
have now proliferated

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.100
into those other
little icons-- per day.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.450
And people upload 300
million photos per day.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.217
So today we have a chance to
listen to three researchers who

00:06:14.217 --> 00:06:16.300
are, in a sense, in the
trenches with this massive

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.470
proliferation, and
trying to figure out

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.190
what it means for
gender, in particular.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.210
The three people
we're going to hear,

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.690
I think it is fair
to say, have not

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.450
taken for granted the personal
and gender implications

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.810
of these new sources of data.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.310
And I should add each
is unique in how exactly

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.260
they approach their subject,
but what they have in common is

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.020
a deep concern with using
the unique properties

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.520
of these burgeoning
data sources to study

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.100
language's formative
role in gender identity--

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.902
both its maintenance
and reinforcement,

00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:47.860
and its deconstruction.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.570
So we'll see how
gender identity can

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.180
be both reinforced and
perhaps maintained, and also

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.630
deconstructed.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.300
And so our first
participant is Ben Hookway.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.750
He is the CEO of
Relative Insight,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.890
which is a UK-based
marketing analysis firm.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.370
There are longer
bios in your program.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.380
He has a really
interesting background,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.470
which I just thought I would
mention, in law enforcement,

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.930
pioneering the use
of language analysis

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.070
to identify sexual predators.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.370
And more recently, his firm
is moving towards marketing.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.830
He also has a background
in several technology-based

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.430
businesses such as Vidiactive,
Next Device, Critical Path

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.680
in the UK and the USA.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.573
So I'm looking forward to
hearing about his work.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.710
-So normally I present this
to venture capital firms

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.445
and big brands and
marketers and agencies

00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:55.070
and so on, so it's
probably fair to say

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.195
you're not my normal crowd.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.350
But I'm just going to tell you
what we do, where we came from,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.200
and since we're
all about data, I'm

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.690
going to show you
some data, as well.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.244
So I-- the language in
America are dear to my heart.

00:08:13.244 --> 00:08:14.910
I did actually used
to live in the-- I'm

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.240
from Scotland originally.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.970
And I moved to the
States when I was 24,

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.200
and at my first ever dinner
party, one of the guests

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.580
asked me at what age do
you start getting taught

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.450
English in Scottish schools?

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.720
So I said, well,
8, but I've only

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.630
just become fluent which is
why I still have an accent.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.049
The accent's been
kicked out of me

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.080
somewhere after staying
6 years in the states

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.520
and doing various things
and then go back to the UK.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.990
So now I'm CEO of
Relative Insight,

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.780
and Relative Insight is an
advanced language analytics

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.920
business.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.220
And essentially what we do
is specialize in comparing

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.910
sets of language.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.110
So we do two things-- we
turn this subjective thing,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.310
this unstructured thing called
language-- which people tend

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.300
to be quite emotive about
and have high expectations

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.314
of-- into data.

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:10.980
But then the second
critical thing we do

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.310
is that we compare
sets of data, and we

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.460
specialize in looking at
the differences between sets

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.820
of language.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.490
And this is important
because it's

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.760
the differences which
tend to be important,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.780
not the language itself.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.520
So we're actually
originally a collaboration

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.950
between government agencies
in the UK and academia,

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:39.420
and we were developed
to catch bad people.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.780
And one of the examples
of catching bad people

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.570
is online child protection.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.420
So in an open chat
forum, we can tell

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.790
if you're a 12-year-old
girl or if you're

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.280
a 30-year-old man doing a
very sophisticated impression

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.940
of a 12-year-old girl.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.420
Now, the way we do that is by
taking known 12-year-old girl

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.670
language, taking suspected
language, comparing them.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.662
And the two sets might
be 99% identical,

00:10:08.662 --> 00:10:10.370
but that's not what
you're interested in.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.880
What you're interested
in is the 1% difference

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.307
that's significant.

00:10:14.307 --> 00:10:16.640
And unfortunately, if an
offender's undertaken that kind

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.260
behavior, very often they'll
have more than one persona

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.460
in a chat room, so they
manipulate conversation

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.120
by pretending to
be multiple people

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.350
and trying to direct
behavior and so on.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.110
And we can detect when
that's happening, as well.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:36.110
So we do all that good
stuff, but we make our money,

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.300
actually, by using this
technology in brands.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.580
So we help brands
sell you all stuff

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.750
because you will respond
better to messages if it's

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.870
in your own vernacular, and
in the style of language

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.670
that you tend to use.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.090
The trick, though,
is how to find out

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.800
what that language
style is if you don't

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.008
know what you're looking for.

00:11:00.008 --> 00:11:02.700
And so by comparing
two given sets of data,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.810
understanding the
critical differences,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.420
then you can hone in on
how different people speak.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.686
So it's worth talking about.

00:11:11.686 --> 00:11:13.560
Earlier on in the sessions
this morning there

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.910
was some discussion about
channels of communication,

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.620
and Twitter was
brought up a lot.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.610
So we do analyze Twitter,
and we do analyze

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.120
Facebook language a lot.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.660
However, we also
spend a lot of time

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.880
analyzing forums
and review sites.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.240
So when you're looking at
language as a data source,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.840
you've got to consider
the source of the data.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.140
And what we find is social,
and Twitter, especially--

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.680
although it's easy to
get because it's API

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.600
accessible and so on--
it's very, very volatile,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.700
and it's not necessarily a
very good medium or long-term

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.770
reflection of what's really
going on in the world.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.300
Forums, by contrast, tend to be
a lot more thoughtful, there's

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.740
more room to write, people
aren't reacting or re-Tweeting

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.240
anything.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.739
They're giving a
considered opinion,

00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:09.510
so we spend quite a
lot of time on there.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.680
And we even do things like
call center transcripts,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.270
we do employee opinion surveys.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.180
So rather than having
to tick boxes 1 to 5,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.800
are you highly satisfied
or dissatisfied?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.560
You can actually write
free-form comments

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.617
and this can get analyzed
and tracked over time,

00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:24.450
and so on and so on.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.360
So when we talk about
language, what do we mean?

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.870
Well, we mean two things,
really-- the topics people

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.820
talk about, but also style.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.230
So are they emotive?

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.570
Are they particularly
expressive?

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.026
Are they factual?

00:12:47.026 --> 00:12:50.830
Are there particular
language markers

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.310
that they tend to use that
if you're not in that group

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.060
you wouldn't know?

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.700
So for example, in the UK,
one of the big mother's forums

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.150
is called Mumsnet.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.840
And so if you did
some analysis on that

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.215
and you look at
the language, you

00:13:05.215 --> 00:13:10.920
see things like DD, DS,
DH coming up all the time.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:16.530
And you just kind of
ignore these normally,

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.710
but only by comparing
language sets and seeing

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.890
these things appear as
something significant

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.650
do you realize they're
probably pretty important.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.280
It turns out they stand for
darling husband, darling son,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.570
darling daughter,
and so on and so on.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.362
And this represents the cultural
code of that group of people.

00:13:33.362 --> 00:13:35.320
So if you're trying to
engage with these people

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.975
and you don't talk like them,
you're instantly exposed.

00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:40.350
A really good
example of this was

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.810
we work with Microsoft
Mobile, as well,

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.160
and they launched a phone
which had a great camera in it.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.690
Part of the ad campaign
was to DSLR enthusiasts,

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.720
proper photographers.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.720
So use this phone and
take amazing pictures,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.300
was kind of the slogan.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.750
But if you do a comparison
between DSLR enthusiasts talk

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.240
and how smartphone
review people talk,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.610
you find, actually, that DSLR
people don't take pictures.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:13.010
What they do is shoot images.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.480
And if you don't
know this, you end up

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.750
with this what we call
Dad at the disco effect.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.085
So most people have probably
experienced-- and I'm a Dad

00:14:21.085 --> 00:14:24.280
and I've done disco dancing--
that technically they're

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.890
doing all the right things,
but it's just not cool, right?

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.020
For this kind of unknown reason.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.480
And language has
the same effect.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.380
So that's the kind
of stuff we do.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.000
This is just who we
sell our stuff to.

00:14:42.325 --> 00:14:44.200
So once you get it in
your head that language

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.080
is nothing but data and the
best results come from comparing

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.450
sets of data, you
can compare language

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.980
across lots of really
interesting axes.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:59.600
So two groups of
mothers forums in the UK

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.130
talk about the same topic
in very different ways.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.160
People will type and express
themselves differently

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.930
on an iPhone from an
iPad from a desktop.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.700
Tracking language over time
is fascinating-- everything

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.350
from how they're
talking about your brand

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.430
before the ad campaign compared
with after the ad campaign.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.070
The delta tells you the real
effect of the ad campaign,

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:29.940
not what the ad agency tells you
the effect of the ad campaign

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.030
is.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.960
But equally, forums have
been around so long now

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.940
that you can go back in time
and look at societal change.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.720
So we've done
projects, for example,

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.020
on attitudes to facial
cosmetic surgery have

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.440
changed over the last 8 years.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.440
And you can tell this by
looking at the language

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.590
and tracking it.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.670
Obviously different people
in different locations,

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.020
how different brands
speak to each other,

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.720
and so on and so on.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.440
But increasingly we're moving
into the world of beyond

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.210
conventional demographics.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.170
This is the other key thing
we're doing at the moment.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.440
So demographics are
a traditional way

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:14.420
for marketing people
to use a proxy

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.350
to identify an individual.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.140
And they're really out of date.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.120
I'm 43 and I live in
Manchester in England,

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.290
and I've got a house, and
I've got a car, and so what?

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.790
People hold multiple personas.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.115
I hold multiple personas
during the day, in the morning,

00:16:32.115 --> 00:16:33.490
in the evening,
when I'm working,

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.573
when I'm doing presentations,
and so on and so on.

00:16:35.573 --> 00:16:38.726
And so what we do is model
people with a commonality--

00:16:38.726 --> 00:16:40.350
either they're all
a member of a forum,

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.390
or everyone who follows
a particular music artist

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.290
on Twitter. .

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:49.160
You can grab these, all this
language together, and pull it

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.680
together and that's a much
better way of targeting people.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.430
So that's what we do.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.610
And I get to talk about
politics because I'm just

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.340
a bemused observer of
your political process

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.970
at the moment.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.286
Although I was in the states
when Bush Jr. got elected,

00:17:08.286 --> 00:17:09.660
so I've sort of
lived through it,

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.972
but I do have the right, I
feel, because I live in the UK

00:17:12.972 --> 00:17:15.690
to mock you.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:22.460
So we're going to
have a little quiz.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.790
What I'm showing you
here is candidate A,

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.220
and this is candidate
A's Twitter stream,

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.470
and this is how they tend
to talk on Twitter compared

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.280
with another candidate.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.130
So this is what
this candidate tends

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.900
to over index on
compared to candidate B.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.300
So they tend to use social media
mentions a lot, personal names,

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.260
so they name people
in their Tweets,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.190
evaluation-- good,
judgment of appearance--

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.750
beautiful, so that's beautiful,
awesome, gorgeous, and so on

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.840
and so on.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.530
They're degree boosters, so
they're quite expressive,

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.125
and so on and so on.

00:17:58.125 --> 00:18:00.000
This doesn't mean the
other candidate doesn't

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.610
use these attributes,
it just means

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.830
that this candidate uses them
consistently and statistically

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.580
significantly more.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.420
This is candidate A
compared to candidate C.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.280
And the green dots are
basically the same attributes

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.200
which keep on appearing.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.090
So the point being
it doesn't matter

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.170
who you compare
this candidate with,

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.110
they have these
significant attributes.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.970
Who wants to guess
who candidate A is?

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.167
It is Trump.

00:18:33.167 --> 00:18:35.500
And if you were a marketer
and you were looking at this,

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:41.290
you'd say this is great--
personal names, positive.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.420
You don't know anything
else about their persona,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.672
but linguistically
this is a good brand.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.430
Candidate D-- same thing.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.090
What candidate D says more
than candidate E. Sorry,

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.110
just one more thing-- this
is Trump against Sanders.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.183
That's Trump against Clinton.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.830
This is what candidate
D says-- same principle.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.820
And again, same
themes keep coming up.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.530
So this particular
candidate continually

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.990
keeps over indexing on certain
things, having to do stuff,

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.090
discussing conflict,
mentioning family, health care,

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.190
gun control, and
so on and so on.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.161
So guess who this is.

00:19:30.161 --> 00:19:30.785
That's Clinton.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.730
The point is Hillary Clinton
sounds like Hillary Clinton

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.440
no matter who you compare it to.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.164
You can compare it
to Carly Fiorina,

00:19:45.164 --> 00:19:47.330
and there's no real difference
between comparing her

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.330
to Carly Fiorina or comparing
her to Donald Trump.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.980
She's continually over
indexing on these things.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.290
Point being, from a pure
linguistic, blind point of view

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.250
in the presidential race,
gender has got no effect

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.880
at all on the language.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.820
So any time gender
comes up, it's

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.750
because of other
societal aspects.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.380
There we go.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.580
That was all I was going to say.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.496
I'm sure we'll get
questions about that later,

00:20:13.496 --> 00:20:15.100
but there we go.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.390
-Thanks, that was wonderful.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.510
Our next speaker
is Lyle Ungar who's

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.710
a professor and the Graduate
Group Chair of Computer

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.960
and Information Science at
University of Pennsylvania.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.780
He also teaches in the
Psychology Department.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.999
And he teaches an
array of courses

00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:42.040
from cognitive science to
artificial intelligence

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.200
to machine learning and
data mining, crowdsourcing,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.420
management of
technology, and he was

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.033
mentioning developing a course
on the singularity, which

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:51.820
sounds enticing.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.440
-So we heard incredibly
powerful personal narratives

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.056
this morning.

00:21:00.056 --> 00:21:01.680
This afternoon we're
talking about what

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.570
we can see in aggregate
looking at language.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.170
I work with a group
of psychologists

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.010
and computer scientists called
the World Well-being Project,

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.880
trying to measure
well-being of people

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.660
through the language they use.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.370
The theory is that measuring
stuff helps to drive change.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.060
If you measure GDP,
one focuses on GDP.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.080
If we can measure
well-being-- whatever that is,

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.960
that's a hard question--
we can try and define it.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.150
So people ask a lot of
questions, mostly very

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.880
ill-formed-- do women
talk more than men?

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.190
But we try, in psychology, to
take these sloppy questions--

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.040
what does it mean to be nicer
or be less assertive-- make them

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.670
precise, measure them, and
get away from abstract debates

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.120
to concrete measurement.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.100
One concrete
example-- not my work,

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.510
but before we get there--
Matthias Mehl measured

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.450
a bunch of men and women,
put little audio recorders

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.110
on their lapels,
counted the words.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.070
Who uses more
words, men or women?

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:02.470
Well, the top two, three
talkers in this group were men,

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.110
the least talkers
were mostly men, too.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.510
On average, there's
not a huge difference.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.260
OK, one can go back
and do similar studies

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.515
in the office place.

00:22:11.515 --> 00:22:14.190
It is true by and large--
men interrupt women

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.926
a lot more than
women interrupt men,

00:22:16.926 --> 00:22:19.300
although it's a lot different
for senior female managers,

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.591
at least in the tech industry
where it's been measured.

00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:24.090
A lot of these things can
be measured and quantified.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.620
Are you being interrupted?

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.310
Yeah, if you're female, you are.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.560
We don't need to
speculate anymore.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.380
Cool.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.600
So I'm interested not just
in these quantitative big

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.100
pictures.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.520
I want to look at the words that
people use and understand them,

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.950
and the wonderful
thing for me is

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.250
that people used to sit
around the campfire talking

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.860
and I couldn't measure it
because I'm a measurement guy,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.720
but now they're all Tweeting
and posting to Facebook

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.650
and sharing it
with me, and I can

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.130
monitor all their private or
semi-private conversations.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.870
So what I want to do today is to
talk about language and gender,

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.180
and then language,
gender, and personality.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.860
Let's see what we can measure.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.690
Now, luckily for
me, 70,000 people

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.840
agreed, each individually,
to share their Facebook posts

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.660
with me.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.020
They said yes, you may
download all the Facebook

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:09.870
posts I've made.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.380
This is opt in, not stealing.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.290
They declared their gender
as male or female-- sorry,

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.660
this is 2 or 3 years old.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.410
This is before the new
modern Facebook more choices,

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:21.910
so everyone in this
group has either

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.920
declared male or female--
very old fashioned, I know.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.610
We have their age to
control for statistically,

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:31.222
and they took a very
standard personality test.

00:23:31.222 --> 00:23:32.930
I'll say in a second
what the personality

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.590
things are, but things like
extroversion, introversion.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.220
Cool.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.250
So we can look at
what words differ.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.540
Now, before I show you
these horrible stereotypes,

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.590
which are just reality--
you can like them or not.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.872
They're like Trump--
they're there.

00:23:46.872 --> 00:23:48.450
I can't help it,
but I can at least

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.706
measure it and look at it.

00:23:49.706 --> 00:23:51.330
What I'm going to
show you is the words

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.580
that most differ
between men and women.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.480
On average, words like the, a,
it are used roughly equally,

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.910
but there are words that differ.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.610
So let's see how
these words differ.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.690
One of the words most
indicative of being

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:10.910
female-- oh, it's embarrassing.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.630
First of all, note for a
word-- "love you" is a word,

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.900
"so happy," "so" with four
O's, five O's-- very typical

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.930
of females.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:23.109
The old guys out there, you know
that little less than 3 means?

00:24:23.109 --> 00:24:23.650
Yeah, you do.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:24.960
You're not an old guy.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.780
A heart, OK?

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.980
And you see things like
"boyfriend," and "I miss"--

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.220
very cliche, sorry.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.300
What does it look
like to be male?

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:43.970
Words most predictive of
being male-- I'm a little bit

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.540
embarrassed, since
I'm obviously male.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.740
Let me say it's not all bad.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.210
Males do talk more about
engineering and politics,

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.680
and interestingly, subtle
things-- males talk more

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.530
about "my wife," whereas
females-- and these are,

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.490
again, averaged over everyone,
so this is predominantly

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.926
heterosexual-- females
talk more about "husband,"

00:25:04.926 --> 00:25:07.300
they talk about husband and
other people's husbands, too.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.750
They're a little more inclusive
in their discussion there.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:11.260
Cool.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.010
So I'm going to show
you a bunch of these.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.390
What I've done is
cluster together

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.480
sets of words that tend to
co-occur, which is often

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.960
a little more interpretable.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:25.310
So here's the same set of female
words, but you can see topics.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.675
And I'll call them topics--
their fancy technical term

00:25:27.675 --> 00:25:30.050
is Latent Dirichlet Allocation,
but don't worry about it.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.540
It's words that
show up together--

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.700
"happy birthday," "boyfriends,"
"cute baby," "adorable."

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.880
And similarly for
males, I can look

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:46.400
at the topics that
show up, Again, I

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.950
want to point out that
males do on average talk

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.598
more about government
than females.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.580
So this is what people are
distinctively talking about.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.880
How accurate is this?

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.040
We can tell you the computer
and, given someone's

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.740
Facebook posts and the
words that they use

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.970
and their self-declared
gender, were 92% accurate.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.820
We can also show these same
Facebook posts or Tweets

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.400
to human raters and say,
is this a man or a woman?

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.220
What do you think it is?

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.460
Humans are pretty good at
looking at a Facebook post

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.820
and say, that's a
girl, that's a boy,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.170
but they make some mistakes.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.440
One of the many
definitions of stereotype

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.710
is some mistaken view.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.420
I can look at the
words that most

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:35.150
correlate with incorrect
labels of people.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:39.200
So people who are judged
to be women but are men

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.280
are using words like "my" and
"love" and "hair" and "baby"

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.590
and "happy."

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.100
People who are, in fact,
women but judged as men

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.250
use words like "Ebola,"
"research history,"

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.210
and "state."

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.080
So what's happening?

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.800
Interestingly, the human
raters are picking up

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:00.000
on correct statistical
trends in the sense

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.430
that women do talk more
about love than men,

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.190
and men do talk more about
research and state than women,

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.800
but they're overweighting them.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.870
They see someone talking about
sports or about politics, they

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.000
go, crap, must be a guy.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.510
Wrong.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.700
It gives some
statistical indication

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.490
that it might be a guy, but it
doesn't mean it must be a guy.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.150
So it's interesting to watch
these systematic errors

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.640
that people make.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.280
I want to shift gears now
and talk about personality.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.480
We have 70,000 people,
these same people who

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.710
shared their Facebook posts
and took a standard five-factor

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.140
model, big five
personality measurement,

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.810
and we can then look at the
words that correlate with each

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.040
of these five factors.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.498
I'm going to talk
about two of them

00:27:42.498 --> 00:27:44.740
today, starting
with extroversion.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.300
What do extroverts talk about?

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.950
And these are controlled
for age and sex,

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:50.876
so this is as
balanced as I can get.

00:27:50.876 --> 00:27:51.750
And it's pretty good.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.871
It's "party," and I
love the "cant wait."

00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:56.370
These guys are in
such a hurry, they

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.630
can't even put the apostrophes
into with "cant," right?

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.270
This is amazing.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.280
This is fun.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.230
I wish I were an extrovert, but
most academics who do science

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.470
tend to be a little more
on the introvert side.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.344
What do introverts, my
colleagues, look like?

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.490
Apart from the angst, there's
words like "apparently," which

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.870
are words of more
cognitive complexity,

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.780
there's more "reading"
and "drawing,"

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.250
more books, more
zombies-- I'm not sure.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.886
OK, so that's
introversion, extroversion.

00:28:28.886 --> 00:28:31.010
We're also going to talk
today about agreeableness.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.840
Agreeable Americans-- these
are all American sampless--

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.390
talk a lot about religion,
actually-- awesome.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:42.630
Disagreeable people-- OK, sorry.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.480
I should have given
a warning, but I

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.430
assume everyone here is adult
and able to deal with these.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.420
So rather different
words of agreeableness,

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.730
disagreeableness,
introversion, extroversion.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.720
We have these for
a bunch of these.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.650
We can predict your
personality about

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.550
as accurately as your
Facebook friends can.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.194
So it's not great, but it's
a fair amount of signal.

00:29:03.194 --> 00:29:04.860
But we know for each
person whether they

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.070
say they were a man or
a woman, and again I

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.570
apologize for the
people who don't

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:09.880
want to pick either
of those categories,

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.320
but this is again old Facebook.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.406
This is 2 and 1/2 years old.

00:29:13.406 --> 00:29:14.530
So what are we going to do?

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:19.010
We're going to look at a classic
circumplex-- fancy word again--

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:22.960
looking to characterize people
on degrees of how assertive

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.700
they are, how
dominant or assertive,

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.650
versus how submissive,
the vertical axis,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:33.090
and something that's called
affiliation, connection,

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.090
agreeable-- it's not quite
the same as agreeableness,

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:41.140
but how much they tie to
other people versus don't.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.710
So we're going to put people
onto this piece there,

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:46.640
and people sometimes do
intermediate versions

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.390
of combinations of
these to say where they

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:49.755
fit in the personality scale.

00:29:49.755 --> 00:29:51.130
But the important
thing for us is

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.590
that we can do this
vertical dominance,

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:59.630
and this horizontal
affiliation maps roughly

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.405
onto the agreeableness
extroversion,

00:30:01.405 --> 00:30:04.612
with a slight rotation,
that I showed you before.

00:30:04.612 --> 00:30:06.320
So these are correlated
but not the same,

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.630
so extroverts tend to be
dominant and a little bit warm.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.917
Introverts tend to
be the opposite.

00:30:13.917 --> 00:30:15.375
So we can look from
our personality

00:30:15.375 --> 00:30:17.950
and say something about-- I
don't know if women are nice

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:21.490
or not, but I can see if they're
warmer and more agreeable

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.550
by their language.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.240
So we can map lots of topics.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.260
We have 2,000 Facebook topics.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.670
We can code them with how male
in blue or female in yellow

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.010
they are, where they
fit in this piece there,

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:37.290
we can look at all the words,
which we don't have time

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.460
to look through, but I want to
show you two dimensions of this

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.260
in some detail.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.330
So along the bottom axis,
which is a little hard to read,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.480
is male to female.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:52.470
On the vertical axis is hostile
to warm, to grieve affiliation.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.250
And every dot is a word topic.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.520
I've shown a few of those.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.000
I hope they can be seen.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.140
So you can see, for
example, in the bottom left,

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.050
all those swearing
are hostile males.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.960
Up in the right, "shopping,"
"Christmas," "grocery"

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.730
are warm females, but
"shopping" is not particularly

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.120
an affiliative binding thing.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.410
Up top, "family," "friends,"
"wonderful," "blessed,"

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:19.690
"amazing"-- strong
affiliation, strong female.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.960
And we can see in
general, women do talk--

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.030
and I think they actually
believe-- with more connection

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.330
on average.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.110
And again I have to emphasize
everyone is different.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.800
It's like talking
more or talking less,

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.890
this is averaged
over 70,000 people.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:38.780
But in terms of characterizing
a broader American population,

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.560
you can see that
women on average

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.680
do seem much more connective.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.589
Makes sense?

00:31:45.589 --> 00:31:47.130
The other dimension--
and this is not

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.770
a surprise in psychology--
that's been disputed more

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.490
is assertiveness,
the positive version.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.240
Dominance may be less positive.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.780
Where do men and women sit
in terms of how much they

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.490
tend to be assertive or not?

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.620
And there the connection
is much weaker.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.580
What we find again in the
bottom-- males on the left,

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.460
females on the right.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.810
And assertiveness, it's
statistically significant,

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:16.110
but not very big-- actually,
we find women slightly more

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.720
assertive than men.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.160
Now again, one has to
say this is on Facebook.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.930
May be different in the office.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.240
I'd love to have
lots of recordings

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.602
of office conversations.

00:32:26.602 --> 00:32:28.060
Some of the companies
I talk to are

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.300
starting to do this and
analyze those discussions.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.640
But you can see, again, these
sort of systematic differences

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.180
where very male and
very non-assertive

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.650
is "computers,"
"programming," "Photoshop."

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:43.371
Very male and very assertive
is, again, swearing.

00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:45.870
But sort of in the middle, this
"happy birthday," "wishing,"

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.804
"sister"-- quite
general neutral.

00:32:49.804 --> 00:32:51.720
So we don't have time
to look at all of these.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.677
If you go to
WWBP.org, our website,

00:32:54.677 --> 00:32:57.260
you can go and play with these
and look at different versions.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.551
It's all up there to play with.

00:32:58.551 --> 00:33:02.390
But lots of insight to mull
over what our people are talking

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.310
and how are they
talking about it?

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.310
So what have we seen?

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.800
Well, first of all, there
is systematic differences

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.190
between males and
females and how

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.860
they post on Facebook-- not
surprising-- and systematic

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.160
errors that people
make in overweighting,

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.570
for example, how likely
someone discussing sports

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.140
is to be male.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.700
We've seen that words
show personality.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.530
The marketers love that, but
I love that also in the sense

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.556
that I want to go and
customize hospital treatments.

00:33:33.556 --> 00:33:35.680
If you're more conscientious
or less conscientious,

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.330
you should probably be getting
different instructions,

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:39.630
do things there.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.672
We've seen that assertiveness
is often misjudged.

00:33:41.672 --> 00:33:43.463
I haven't given you
the literature on this,

00:33:43.463 --> 00:33:44.670
but a lot of controversy.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.030
But I think there's often a fair
amount of assertiveness going

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.480
by women, and if
you can quantify it,

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.180
you get a better idea of what's
happening or not happening.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.460
More broadly, I'm in the
business of building tools--

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.026
tools for measuring things.

00:33:59.026 --> 00:34:00.400
And I'm the business
of selling--

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.040
I don't do it for money, give
away for free, all open source.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.170
I'm in the business of
selling these tools to help

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:06.350
other researchers do them.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.949
Again, I want to
stress, for free.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:11.210
It's relatively cheap and easy.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.230
I haven't talked yet about
10 billion tweets, which

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.080
I've got, which I
can map to US county

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.400
and look at variations
in personality,

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.520
in inequality, in racism
across county level

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.760
piece or communities.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.070
It's a way to get at what
people are thinking and feeling

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.889
as they talk to
their friends or post

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:33.639
to their blogs or the
discussion boards.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.010
I want to end by noting
that what we've done here

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.370
is very basic-- male or female.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.170
We're now looking
at gender spectrum.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.870
People aren't either talking
male or talking female.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:46.510
Everyone sits somewhere
on a spectrum,

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.010
and maybe it's even
two dimensions--

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:50.840
there's a degree of maleness
and a degree of femaleness

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.650
to people's language,
which is something

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:56.310
we can explore when we have
these really large data sets.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.340
We can try to
understand-- eventually,

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.760
I hope-- across very different
subgroups of self-definition--

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.580
how their language varies.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.610
I think this would be a
great time going forward

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.690
to get a picture in the
very large scale of what

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:13.225
life looks like within
people's very small worlds.

00:35:13.225 --> 00:35:14.100
And that I thank you.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:26.110
Thanks, that was a
really rich talk,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.970
and we'll look forward
to some questions.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.860
But first we have
Alice Marwick, who

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.630
is a social media researcher
based in New York City.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.310
She's the Director
of the McGannon

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.370
Center for
Communication Research

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.110
and an assistant professor at
Fordham University's Department

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.120
of Communication
and Media Studies.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.630
Her first book Status
Update-- Celebrity, Publicity,

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.710
and Branding in the
Social Media Age

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.210
came out with Yale a
couple of years ago,

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:55.440
and is a really
fascinating ethnography

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.140
of how people in the
San Francisco tech scene

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.240
use social media to boost
their status and popularity,

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.590
and how this affects
their offline lives.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.730
And her current
research has moved more

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.870
towards the proliferation of
sexism and misogynistic speech

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.600
online using such
topics as Gamergate

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.370
and the Donglegate
Reddit controversies

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.610
and online harassment as
places where she's looking.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.311
So I look forward to this.

00:36:22.311 --> 00:36:22.810
-Thank you.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:23.810
It's great to be here.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.830
It's wonderful to be at such
an interdisciplinary event.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.880
I think that when we're tackling
these large, weighty topics

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.260
like language and gender,
it's great to see people

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.240
from across the spectrum
addressing them.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.990
I'm an ethnographer,
and so I deal

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.720
in what we might call
small data-- interviews

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.510
and observations
which often can help

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:44.010
us to contextualize
and problematize

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.074
the findings of big data.

00:36:46.074 --> 00:36:47.740
For the last 3 years,
I've been thinking

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.140
a lot about online
sexism, and today I'm

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.390
going to give a short
overview of the visibility

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:55.390
of online sexism, particularly
with regard to language,

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.240
and discuss the implications.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.200
Social media like Twitter,
Reddit, and forums

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.780
enable collective action
and participation,

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.510
but they also enable a
new type of organized

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.030
gamified harassment
that works to shut down

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.390
the voices of women,
queer people, and people

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.574
of color online.

00:37:11.574 --> 00:37:13.990
And I would like to give a
little bit of a trigger warning

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:17.550
that there is some very sexist
speech in this presentation,

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.100
and I think it's
important to present it

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.870
so you can see the magnitude of
what we're dealing with online.

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:27.980
So Zoe Quinn is a software
developer who became the target

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.530
of an organized brigade
after her ex-boyfriend wrote

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.690
a 10,000-word screed
about her on his blog.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:35.590
He claimed that she
had lied to him,

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.920
that she cheated on
him with five guys,

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.130
and most damagingly
he claimed that Quinn

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.350
had slept with a writer for
Kotaku, a video game blog,

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:46.650
to get favorable coverage for
her game Depression Quest.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.110
This was unequivocally
proven to be false,

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.990
but under the pretense that they
were trying to reform ethics

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.410
in video game journalism, a
group of gamers organizing

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.780
through websites and
chat rooms inundated

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.300
Ms. Quinn with thousands
of hateful messages.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.400
They distributed
nude photos of her,

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.810
and her address and social
security number were revealed,

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.380
and this is a process
called doxing, where

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.110
people's personal
information is revealed

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.480
online for the purpose
of shaming and harassing.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.490
People called her parents,
they called her phone

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.390
at all hours of the
night, they openly

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:17.870
discussed raping
her, her weight,

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.170
and the smell of her vagina.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.840
This brigade unified around
the Twitter hashtag Gamergate.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.490
As the harassment
escalated, Anita Sarkeesian,

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.740
a feminist media critic
and favorite target

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.080
of anti-feminist gamers
for several years,

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.390
was also doxed and
forced to cancel

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.760
an appearance at the University
of Utah due to a death threat.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.920
Another game
developer, Briana Wu,

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.680
posted anti-Gamergate
memes on Tumblr and Twitter

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.430
and also received death threats.

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:46.830
And actress Felicia Day, a
longtime gaming advocate,

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.170
wrote an emotional blog
post about the effects

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:52.560
that Gamergate was having on her
ability to trust male gamers,

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.570
and she was promptly
doxed for her trouble.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.690
But Gamergate is only
the latest kerfuffle

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:01.640
in a series of well-documented
and often high-profile

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.470
incidents in which
women have been openly

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.560
harassed, stalked, or otherwise
systemically targeted online

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.450
for political and
feminist speech,

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.750
for criticizing the video game
or technology industry, or just

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.030
for existing.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.250
These high-profile cases
are the most extreme

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.820
of a general atmosphere
of sexist speech,

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.070
gendered harassment, and
misogynistic comments

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.834
in many places online.

00:39:22.834 --> 00:39:25.250
Moreover, and what I think is
most interesting about this,

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:27.320
is that these brigades
are organized.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.900
Sarkeesian refers to these
groups as cyber mobs.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.840
They're collectives which engage
in cooperative competition

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.230
to increase the harm
to their victims.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.880
They reinforce their
social dominance

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.094
over marginalized groups.

00:39:38.094 --> 00:39:39.510
And what this means
is that people

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.580
use social media
to work together

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.080
to learn personal information
about their targets.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.740
They gain status
in their community

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.410
as they escalate the harassment.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:51.540
And in this way, online
harassment becomes a game.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.030
Those of us who have ever
read YouTube comments

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:58.010
or waded into forums like 4chan
or even some parts of Reddit

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.900
have seen sexist
terms, jokes like women

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.890
should be in the kitchen or make
me a sandwich, or men simply

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:07.220
calling women fat,
ugly, and slutty--

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.330
the triumvirate of uncreative
but expected gendered insults.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.960
Now, of course, this is
not restricted to sexism.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.080
The comment sections
of blogs and websites

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.420
are often rife with
racist, sexist, homophobic,

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:23.160
transphobic, and just plain
mean and profane language.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.260
The harassment of women
of color and queer women

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.370
is often compounded
by intersectionality.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.130
When I appeared on television
to talk about online sexism,

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:33.260
the channel posted
the video on YouTube

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.190
and the comments on the
channel were terrible.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.970
So I posted my favorite
comment-- I respect women

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:38.930
but I hate feminists.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:41.100
I believe that feminists
should be gang raped.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.410
And Helen Lewis, a
British journalist,

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.790
posted what she
calls Lewis's law--

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:49.350
the comments on any
article about feminism

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.710
justify feminism.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:54.110
And unfortunately,
Lewis's law has

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.980
proven to be very much
true in my own experience.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.160
Women in certain online
spaces frequently

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.050
find themselves the
subject of attacks

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:04.230
that use sexual violence
and gendered speech

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.780
acts as intimidation.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.040
I have heard about this from
political writers, economists,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.540
feminist bloggers,
technologists,

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.660
music writers, and journalists.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.920
One friend moved her
family to a different city

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.660
after she was stalked based
on her feminist writing.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.420
The blog Feministing had
a dedicated FBI agent

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.130
to deal with death threats,
and a science blogger I know

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.690
has been stalked for 9 years
by someone who follows her

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.810
on every social media platform.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.530
And as Laurie Penny, a financial
writer for The Independent,

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.380
wrote, "An opinion, it
seems, is the short skirt

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.390
of the internet.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.190
Having one and
flaunting it is somehow

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.280
asking an amorphous mass of
almost entirely male keyboard

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.460
bashers to tell you how
they'd like to rape,

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.580
kill, and urinate on you."

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.390
So you might ask,
don't both genders

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:48.610
deal with harassment
and meanness online?

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:51.270
And yes, this is
definitely true.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:53.570
And as you can see in this
graph from the Pew Research

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.770
Center, which is a
nonprofit that researches

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:58.070
online behavior,
both men and women

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:00.631
experience online harassment,
meanness, and cruelty.

00:42:00.631 --> 00:42:02.380
But two interesting
things-- first of all,

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.963
you can see that the rates are
much higher for younger people,

00:42:04.963 --> 00:42:06.790
and this only looks
at people 18 and over,

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.090
and so the youngest
groups of people

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.470
are the ones who are
experiencing the most

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.220
harassment.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.729
And if we had numbers
for 13- to 18-year-olds,

00:42:12.729 --> 00:42:14.520
we might also see that
they're experiencing

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.830
large amounts of harassment.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:16.750
And the other thing
I think that's

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:18.333
interesting about
this graph is if you

00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:20.880
look at the number of men versus
women who are being stalked

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.260
or sexually harassed or that
the harassment is sustained,

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.950
it's greater for
women than for men.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.210
But besides harassment,
the normalization

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.190
of misogynistic
language online is

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.710
something that
I'm also following

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.110
and that I'm concerned about.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:40.280
And scholars have pointed to
the emergence of a Manosphere

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.640
as a central contributor to
the spread of online sexism.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.410
And the Manosphere-- this is
the men's rights Subreddit.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:49.440
So Reddit is a
discussion forum and it

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.430
has a lot of subsections,
and each Subreddit

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.880
is dedicated to a
different topic,

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.920
and this one is dedicated
to men's rights.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.720
And the Manosphere consists
of websites and message boards

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.850
where men discuss
men's rights, pick up

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.960
artist techniques,
the feminist agenda,

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:06.430
and in more extreme cases,
bond over misogynistic ideals.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.090
And the Southern
Poverty Law Center

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:10.910
characterizes the
Manosphere as "an underworld

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.026
of so-called men's rights groups
and individuals on the internet

00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:15.400
which is just
fraught with really

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.990
hardline, anti-women misogyny."

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.230
Now, the Manosphere, to a
certain extent, is diverse.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.000
It's spread across different
websites and technologies

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.270
from mainstream sites like
Reddit and Hacker News

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.390
to more obscure corners
of the internet.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:28.970
But these separate
subcultures are

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.780
homophilous In other words,
birds of a feather flock

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.650
together.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.440
When people with
similar views spend

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.560
most of their time
interacting with other people

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.790
with the same views,
a polarizing effect

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:42.280
happens in that their views
tend to become more extreme.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.870
Thus the development of these
male-centric communities

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.650
may encourage sexist speech
and allow men to work together

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.110
to systematically devalue
women's contributions

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.670
or even harass women.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.560
And I want to make a
note on demographics.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.880
The title of this talk
No Girls on the Internet

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.470
refers to a maxim that's thrown
around on male-centric sites

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.589
like Reddit or in gamer
groups-- oh, there's

00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:01.630
no women on the internet.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.713
Every woman you meet on
the internet is just a guy

00:44:03.713 --> 00:44:04.910
pretending to be a woman.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.550
But actually we see in the
United States that about 86%

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.060
of both men and women
are on the internet.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.570
There's a gap in access in
terms of class and education,

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:15.630
but there is not one
in terms of gender.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.560
But we also know that most
social media users are women.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.280
About 60% of Facebook
users are women.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.010
Most Twitter users are women.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:26.140
The same with Flickr, Tumblr,
Instagram, and Pinterest.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.810
On the other hand,
LinkedIn, 4chan, and Reddit

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.030
are primarily used by men.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.470
Now, there may be a
participation gap.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.670
87% of Wikipedia
contributors are male.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.040
Male students are more
likely than female students

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.570
to create, edit, and
distribute digital video

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.070
over YouTube or Facebook.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:45.280
But this doesn't hold
true for content creation

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.620
over Tumblr or Instagram.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.350
So if there are plenty of girls
and women on the internet,

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:53.530
but they may not be hanging
out in the same spaces as men,

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:56.230
this homophily may be
compounded by a relative absence

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:58.679
of female contributions
in some spaces.

00:44:58.679 --> 00:45:00.220
And this combines
with what we really

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:03.960
see as an emerging troll
culture on spaces like 4chan

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.790
in which extreme racist, sexist,
homophobic, and ablest insults

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.210
are used to insult
people, to shock them,

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.890
and to produce a certain
type of affect in the people

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.730
that these insults are aimed at.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.570
Now, what this means is that
egregiously sexist slurs online

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.700
are becoming normalized,
and this is especially

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.600
true for young people.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.480
This is a graphic
that I have love.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.560
MRA stands for men's
rights activists,

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.420
and surrounded by misandry.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.970
And much of the
Manosphere's supporters

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:33.190
are speaking about
sexism and gender

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:36.310
extensively, but in
a bizarre world way.

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:37.310
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:39.820
I think that the patriarchy
hurts men just as much

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.220
as it does women,
and I think that men

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.710
should talk about
masculinity and changes

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:47.660
in masculinity and
things like that.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.357
But that's not what's
going on in these spaces.

00:45:50.357 --> 00:45:52.690
Let me give you an example
from another Subreddit, which

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.770
is called The Red Pill, which
is a pick up artist community.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.480
And The Red Pill
summarizes itself

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.430
as "discussion of sexual
strategy in a culture

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.630
increasingly lacking a
positive identity for men."

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.900
And it refers to the
moment in the sci-fi movie

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.450
The Matrix where the
protagonist, Neo, takes

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:11.760
the red pill and has his eyes
opened to the dystopian reality

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.330
of his world-- what
1970s feminists would

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:17.410
call consciousness-raising,
and what people today say

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.250
means to be a "woke" person.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:21.950
To Red Pillers, the red
pill reveals the reality

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.340
of a world where the deck
is stacked against men

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.350
and feminized
behavior is rewarded.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.070
And I could spend the rest
of this lecture just talking

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:30.444
about The Red Pill, but let
me give you an example of one

00:46:30.444 --> 00:46:33.070
of their theories.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:35.085
Women are very
emotional, and most women

00:46:35.085 --> 00:46:37.210
make their decisions based
on their emotional state

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:38.190
at the time.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.540
The rationalization
hamster is an analogy

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.570
for the thought processes used
by women to turn bad behavior

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.540
and bad decisions
into acceptable ones

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.100
to herself and her friends.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.730
When a woman makes
a bad decision,

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.530
the hamster spins in its
wheel-- the woman's thinking--

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:53.520
and creates some type
of acceptable reason

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.890
for that bad decision.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:57.250
The crazier decision,
the faster the hamster

00:46:57.250 --> 00:47:00.370
must spin in order to
successfully rationalize away

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:01.340
the insanity.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.970
So that's the type
of deep thinking

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:07.400
about gender and sexism that
is going on in these spaces.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.020
Now, Subreddits
like The Red Pill

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.870
and groups like men's
rights activists

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.430
do not agree on
everything, but they

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.270
do share a common language.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.450
They have been highly
successful in popularizing

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:19.360
their own vocabulary including
terms like misandry--

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.600
their word for feminism, the
male equivalent of misogyny--

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.180
defined as dislike for, contempt
for, or ingrained prejudice

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.280
against men, white
knighting, which

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.630
is men who espouse feminist
views or speak up for women,

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.150
and the idea is that
they're doing so in order

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:36.460
to appear heroic
and appeal to women,

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:38.350
and social justice
warriors, which

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.050
is a pejorative
term for anyone who

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.990
engages in feminist, anti-racist
or pro-queer activism

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.800
or discourse.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.270
And they often co-opt activist
and social justice rhetoric.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.796
So not only do we have an
increase in sexist slurs,

00:47:50.796 --> 00:47:52.670
we have an increase in
these rhetorical moves

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:56.580
to discuss feminism using
intrinsically anti-feminist

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.789
words like misandry.

00:47:57.789 --> 00:47:59.580
And you'll see this
throughout the internet

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.760
in a wide variety of
spaces, from Twitter

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.980
to comments on tech blogs,
to places like Facebook.

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.960
And this graph is
from Google Analytics

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.900
and it shows how
misandry basically

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:11.000
came out of nowhere before
2007 and has gradually

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.560
increased in popularity in
terms of people Googling for it,

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.480
talking about it, and
speaking about it.

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.050
So I want to talk about
a couple of implications

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.470
in my last few minutes.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.100
First, I want to
think about the idea

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.800
that internet culture encourages
participation and creativity.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.450
Websites like 4chan or
the men's rights Subreddit

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:32.240
are generative communities
of online participation

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.330
and activism.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.160
In many ways they are what we
might call social movements

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.960
or communities of practice.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.100
They often resemble
organized fandom

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.870
in their desire to learn
everything about and obsess

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.880
over their targets, but they
are anti-fans in that they hate

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.450
and despise their subjects.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:49.460
And I think we need
to stop categorizing

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:54.110
creative participation as, by
definition, a positive thing.

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.220
The second implication is the
chilling effects of harassment.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.300
Kathy Sierra, a prominent tech
blogger who wrote about user

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.120
experience-- hardly a
controversial topic--

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.430
was so badly harassed
that she stopped blogging

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:07.230
and stepped away from
her former career

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:09.850
as a public speaker and
visible tech expert.

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:11.570
She was discouraged
from earning a living

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:13.180
due to online harassment.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.020
Now, this is very
understandable given

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.620
how scary and problematic
harassment can be,

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.840
but it also compounds
the problem.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.020
If women stop voicing opinions
in traditionally male realms

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.270
like economics, politics, and
technology, the women who do so

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:29.560
will continue to be
seen as outliers.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.210
But I think that
what is more likely

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.260
is that rather than
stopping participating,

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.700
women will move to the
more female friendly parts

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.259
of the internet.

00:49:37.259 --> 00:49:39.300
Now, there's nothing wrong
with fashion blogging,

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.330
mommy blogging, or
Pinterest, but they

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:43.890
tend to focus on very
traditional views of women

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:46.390
and have a somewhat conservative
norm of femininity--

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:47.990
looking pretty,
being a great cook,

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:49.730
or making your own baby food.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:51.934
I interviewed fashion
bloggers during my postdoc

00:49:51.934 --> 00:49:53.850
and what they all said
to me is that the norms

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:56.790
of their community was that
you must be nice online,

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:59.346
that you couldn't openly
criticize other people.

00:49:59.346 --> 00:50:01.470
So this means that the safe
corners of the internet

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.500
may box women into
expressing themselves

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.220
through very traditional, almost
stereotypically feminine ways.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.810
And as we all know,
women have plenty

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:11.150
to offer the world that is
not about fashion, cooking,

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.700
parenting, or homemaking.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.580
It should not be the case that
the only way women can reliably

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.790
avoid online harassment is to
adhere to stereotypical gender

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:19.320
roles.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:23.390
But I worry that that's where
these instances are heading.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:25.170
So let's think about solutions.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.010
Gendered harassment
and online sexism

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:28.980
is a very complicated problem.

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:32.000
It goes far beyond Gamergate
or even the technology industry

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.020
itself.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.820
But unfortunately
there is as of yet

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.410
no good legal or
policy solution.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.380
Internet harassment is
difficult to come about

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:40.630
through legal means.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.250
There are issues of jurisdiction
and most importantly free

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.120
speech.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.810
The police are
often unsympathetic

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:47.900
or do not understand
the technical issues.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.140
They often tell victims to
simply stay off the internet.

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.290
Moderation is very expensive.

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:55.150
Companies like
Twitter are finally

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:57.702
beginning to build tools
in to combat harassment,

00:50:57.702 --> 00:50:59.910
but they have been slow to
adopt proactive solutions.

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:02.050
And I will say that
as companies build

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:04.230
in things like being
able to flag posts

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:07.240
or being able to turn people
in for various violations,

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.220
those are frequently
used against women,

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:12.990
against feminists, against queer
people as a form of harassment

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.090
by these sort of brigades.

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:17.165
Every day new online
communities and apps

00:51:17.165 --> 00:51:18.540
are launched with
the assumptions

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.540
that their users will be good
actors, without any protection

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.340
for those who may be harassed.

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.520
Online sexism, however,
is not something

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.340
that we merely have to tolerate.

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.880
There are already many
women organizing themselves

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:33.010
to combat it on blogs,
Tumblr, Twitter, and Reddit,

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:35.670
whether by technical
means or support networks.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:38.240
If you are the victim of
harassment or sexist speech,

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.960
I urge you to seek out social
support from other people going

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.220
through similar things.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.900
And I also urge
everyone in this room

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.610
to speak out against
sexist language

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.820
when you see it online with
the goal of, if not eliminating

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.910
online harassment
and sexism, making

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:54.150
it less common, acceptable,
and part of the every day.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.906
Thank you.

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:03.500
-Thank you.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.270
That's an excellent
contribution.

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:09.560
And now we're going to
have about 15 or 20 minutes

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.100
of discussion among
the panel, and maybe we

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.670
can talk about the differences
in their approaches and aims

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:17.639
for their research.

00:52:17.639 --> 00:52:19.430
And then we'll have
time for some questions

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:23.210
from the audience, and
we'll set up a mic shortly.

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:28.530
So I was really struck
by some commonalities

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:31.540
among these presentations
in the sense

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:35.290
that there's a kind of
overwhelming feeling

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:39.000
that a lot of data produced
from the online world,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.010
from the sources that
you've all worked with,

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:47.630
tends to retrench or reinforce
preexisting stereotypes

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:52.260
and norms, despite the rhetoric
we often hear about disruption,

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.330
revolution, new forms arising.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:53:01.810
And so I wonder if you could
each comment on that paradox.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:03.880
-I think it goes
both directions.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.150
So on the one hand,
there is this huge weight

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:07.880
of reinforcement
of common things

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:10.580
because people form
these homophilic groups

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:11.440
and do things.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.490
Other hand, we haven't
talked about social change.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.160
And one thing we've
been looking at

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.170
is tracking, for
example, changes

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.880
in domestic partner violence
discussion which has changed.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.950
The names behind it have changed
many times in the last decade.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:28.332
You can see the use
of mainstream events

00:53:28.332 --> 00:53:30.290
that are reported in the
mainstream media being

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:33.800
picked up by social media
and in turn driving policy.

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.400
You can see this tremendous
groundswell of organizing.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.590
So I think that on the one hand,
there's this reinforcement.

00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:42.090
On the other, hand,
it is a great medium

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.270
for social activism,
and you can actually

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:46.790
see public policy starting
to be affected more

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:47.660
at the local level.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.909
It's harder at the national
level to have this effect,

00:53:49.909 --> 00:53:52.240
but I live in Philadelphia,
reasonably big city,

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.780
and it's still the
case that organizers

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:59.190
can get enough of a groundswell
to influence public policy.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.570
-So perhaps there's
some backlash,

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:03.410
but also evidence of--

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:08.040
-Also organizing and
people mobilizing.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.220
-I think that it depends
which way you cut the data.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:15.440
Comparing your
assessment of how women

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.190
tend to talk online compared
with men on Facebook.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:21.120
Interestingly, we
ran something--

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.270
it's very, very unusual
for a client of ours

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:25.330
to ask for a gender split.

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:27.470
That almost never happens,
which is a good thing.

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:31.650
They're more interested in the
persona in general of people.

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:36.740
But we were asked to compare
self-validated Twitter--

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:41.200
successful people on Twitter.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.900
So this is normally people
who in their bio on Twitter

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.890
describe themselves
as successful,

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:49.780
and then split it male female.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:54.180
And women talk about
politics and issues

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.225
more than men in that group.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.420
And on the whole, actually,
women use more pronouns,

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:06.730
they're more conversational,
and so on and so on.

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:10.210
So on the whole,
I think, men still

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:12.205
kind of resort to
numbers, and sport,

00:55:12.205 --> 00:55:13.330
and all this kind of stuff.

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:14.246
That's generally true.

00:55:14.246 --> 00:55:18.730
But I think when you split away
from just the straight male

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:21.600
female split and you split and
compare things in other ways,

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:25.054
then I think other truths
revealed themselves.

00:55:25.054 --> 00:55:26.970
-One of the things I
think is most interesting

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:28.780
about social media
is that it's used

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:31.110
by a very wide,
diverse group of people

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:32.770
with a lot of
different opinions.

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:34.597
And often this means
that conversations

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:36.930
that have been going on for
years among different groups

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:39.160
and communities get bubbled
up and other people can

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.770
see those who aren't
necessarily part

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.978
or don't understand the
context of this conversation.

00:55:42.978 --> 00:55:45.230
I think this speaks
to what Janet Mock was

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:48.590
saying in her keynote about
the title of her memoir.

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:50.330
What we see on
Twitter especially

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:53.090
is that often there'll
be a group like, say,

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:55.670
young African Americans
talking about something

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:57.582
with a particular
hashtag, and then that

00:55:57.582 --> 00:55:59.790
becomes visible to other
groups who don't necessarily

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.130
understand the context of that.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:04.586
And then you can get this harsh,
quick backlash against it.

00:56:04.586 --> 00:56:06.960
Like, you'll see people making
a bunch of racist comments

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:10.634
because a conversation is
visible to them that has always

00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:12.550
gone on, but they have
not been able to see it

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:15.610
until social media
has made that visible.

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:17.710
And so I think that
when we're looking

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:20.710
at how social media both
contributes to reinforcing

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.620
and resisting these
norms, I think

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:26.780
we can see that a lot social
activism, as Lyle said,

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.340
has gone on through
social media.

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:30.298
You just have to look at
the black lives matter

00:56:30.298 --> 00:56:33.880
hashtag, you have to look
at the contemporary moment

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.700
in popular culture around
feminism, which is something

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.170
that for, like, a
decade there was

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:40.550
lots of feminist stuff going
on, but it really hadn't made it

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:41.140
into the mainstream.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.640
And it's a pop
culture, and I think

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.100
a lot of that has been due to
the work of young feminists

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:47.877
on different platforms,
doing that work,

00:56:47.877 --> 00:56:49.710
and then that work being
able to disseminate

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:51.220
into the mainstream, as well.

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:56.350
So for all of my terrifying
rhetoric in my talk about how

00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:57.810
terrible these
clashes are, I think

00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:59.090
that there's something
quite empowering,

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:00.450
especially for
young people, to be

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:02.658
able to have these conversations
and have them impact

00:57:02.658 --> 00:57:05.170
the mainstream in a way that
wasn't possible before they had

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:06.740
access to social
media technologies

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.660
and other ways of broadcasting
their thoughts to a larger

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:11.410
audience.

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.710
-Yeah, I think what
strikes me is that there's

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:19.970
a kind of dynamic of this rapid
emergence of proliferation

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:22.590
of voices.

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:25.100
I love the comment
in our keynote,

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:29.730
we can now broadcast
our lives, and this idea

00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:33.810
of multi-layering, the idea of
the proliferation of genders

00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:36.300
and even the way
they're obviously

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.200
reflected in Facebook.

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:43.220
But at the same time there's a
kind of retrenchment and fear

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.590
that gets triggered by
these kinds of things,

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:48.140
and so you see other
forces arising.

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.330
And so this reinforces,
I guess, the idea

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:52.130
that this is a very
rich area for research.

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:54.000
And I wondered
what you all think

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.850
are the advantages
and disadvantages

00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:57.060
of the methods you've chosen?

00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:00.500
I mean, Lyle and
Ben work largely

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:04.390
with quantitative methods
and Alice with qualitative,

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:08.067
and I wondered if you could
comment on the advantages

00:58:08.067 --> 00:58:09.150
and disadvantages of each.

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:11.830
-We do actually both
qualitative and quantitative.

00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:16.455
I think the key thing is the
amount of data you can collect.

00:58:16.455 --> 00:58:18.080
I don't care about
the number, but just

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.160
get a flavor of
different subgroups--

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.600
what are they
talking about when?

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.990
What language are they using?

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:24.630
What do they care about?

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:27.850
To go out and run
interviews-- really expensive.

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:31.060
To do telephone calls,
surveys-- Gallup

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:33.860
recently finished
their millionth survey.

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.410
I have 10 billion tweets.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:38.310
I can't afford the
budget of Gallup,

00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:40.810
but I can run more
questionnaires than they can.

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:44.300
I can look at changes at a finer
spatial and temporal resolution

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.400
than they can.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.810
The world is changing from
a research standpoint--

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:51.790
be able to pinpoint look at
what's happening in Cambridge

00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:54.340
versus Boston over this debate.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.600
And I think this
level of exposure

00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:00.400
is, in fact,
tremendously powerful.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.590
-Yeah, I think we
have a similar view

00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:06.630
in that until
comparatively recently,

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:09.340
you had the choice
between quant-- that

00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.860
is, number-driven stuff.

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:13.020
But in language on the
internet, that basically

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:14.830
gave you something like
sentiment analysis,

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:19.982
so is it 34% positive?

00:59:19.982 --> 00:59:22.020
A, it's not particularly
accurate, and B,

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:26.940
even if it was really accurate,
what does that even mean?

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:30.650
The other way is with qual,
you get a lot of nuance,

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.670
a lot of complex
answers and drilling in,

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:38.030
but of course, you get to ask
20 people in a focus group who

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:41.060
never tell you the truth anyway
because you're asking them

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.120
the question so you
bias the answer.

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:45.280
So we are getting
to the point now

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:53.890
where you can get qual-type
insights at quant scale.

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.370
From our perspective,
doing comparisons

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.296
is always the key thing.

00:59:58.296 --> 01:00:02.750
The hard bit is always what
comparisons do you want to run?

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:04.330
Because there's
so much to compare

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:07.129
and so much to draw
out, it's almost

01:00:07.129 --> 01:00:08.170
too powerful a technique.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.820
-As somebody who
mostly does, as I

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:16.811
said, small data work in
that I interview people,

01:00:16.811 --> 01:00:19.060
I often spend large amounts
of time in the communities

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.476
that I'm studying, I spend a
lot of time talking to people

01:00:21.476 --> 01:00:23.920
and trying to
understand how they

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.450
make a meaning of their
world and their lives,

01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:29.700
I think one of the most
important issues in data

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.000
analysis right now
is that of ethics.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.320
Just because you can collect
and look at something

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.020
doesn't mean that you should
collect and look at it.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.370
And a lot of colleagues--
well, not a lot.

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:41.470
There's been several
cases in my field

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:44.360
in which, say somebody was doing
an ethnography of, like, Tumblr

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.650
feminists or something,
and one of the research

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:49.860
subjects posts a
Tumblr post saying,

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.474
researchers are
not welcome here,

01:00:51.474 --> 01:00:53.890
I don't want you looking at
my stuff, this is not for you,

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:55.390
this is not your space.

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:57.490
And we see lots of
indicators by which people

01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:00.220
are trying to target
their online communication

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.620
to a particular audience.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.520
They're using particular
linguistic codes,

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.740
they're marking their
speech in some way,

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.770
saying it's for a
particular peer group.

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:11.110
And I have another
whole research area

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:13.790
on online privacy, which is
one of my other main research

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:16.960
areas, and what we see
is that people often--

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.830
even if they know that
someone can see something

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:22.130
that they post on Facebook
or Twitter or whatnot,

01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:24.390
they assume that
people will know

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:27.730
what audience it's for based
on the language that they use.

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:29.770
And the problem with big
data research methods

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:31.620
is that that's all lost.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.660
It all gets scooped
up and analyzed

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:37.270
and there's no IRB,
Institutional Review Board,

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:39.390
review usually needed
for big data whereas--

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:40.860
-No, everything we do is IRB.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:41.910
-Oh, everything is IRB?

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:44.570
-I have a full-time
person doing IRBs.

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:47.640
Every person who shares their
Facebook consents both to me,

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.890
something approved by IRB--

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:50.839
-No, your work-- 100%.

01:01:50.839 --> 01:01:51.880
You said you have seven--

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.630
-Everthing is IRB.

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:54.690
I can't say how much
time I spend making sure

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:55.960
that everybody signs off.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.230
-All right, I'm sorry.

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:59.357
I was not meaning
to single the two

01:01:59.357 --> 01:02:00.565
gentlemen to the right of me.

01:02:00.565 --> 01:02:00.830
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:03.230
-I know I sound defensive,
but it's important.

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:06.280
-There's a lot of conferences
where people are presenting

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.052
work that is not as rigorous
as Lyle's in terms of the data

01:02:09.052 --> 01:02:09.760
collection they--

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.550
-And most companies
don't have IRBs--

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:12.370
-And most companies
don't have IRB.

01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:13.750
---is a much worse problem.

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:16.310
-And one of the things that
we see that's also problematic

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:20.064
is that companies like Facebook
have enormous internal research

01:02:20.064 --> 01:02:21.480
departments and
they don't publish

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.690
a lot of their research, and we
don't know what they're doing,

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:25.439
and we don't know what
kind of experiments

01:02:25.439 --> 01:02:27.140
they're doing on Facebook users.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.400
So first of all,
academics in general

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.370
are at a disadvantage when
it comes to big social media

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.540
organizations.

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.420
And second of all,
there is this sense

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:39.284
that there are
bodies of researchers

01:02:39.284 --> 01:02:41.700
who aren't doing that kind of
ethical work that I'm doing,

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.950
that Lyle is doing, that other
researchers around the country

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:44.540
are doing.

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.560
So I think these
are some of just

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.540
the general ethical
questions that are brought up

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.998
in the age of big
data, and I think

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.590
we're going to be
working those out

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:53.540
in our various subfields
for years to come.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.980
They're very hot
topics right now.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.670
-Just from my
experience teaching

01:02:58.670 --> 01:03:04.100
this class on big data, a
couple of the greatest areas

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.110
of the growth of
the use of big data

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:09.860
are in predictive policing,
so use by police forces

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.950
to target certain
areas where crimes

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.310
may occur based on
patterns and data,

01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:20.370
and then send more police
there or patrol differently

01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:23.830
or interview people they
believe at the age of 17

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:25.280
may commit a crime
when they're 19

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.770
or things like that that used
to be reserved for dystopian

01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:33.860
fiction are actually programs
in at least five cities already

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.490
underway.

01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:37.040
And also as Alice
indicated, there's

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.900
quite an unregulated
use of data.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.000
When you sign your user
agreement with Facebook,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.330
I believe you agree
to basically to become

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:46.000
an experimental subject.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.020
And it's interesting when you
look at the Facebook experiment

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.900
that came out about 2 years
ago, which was published

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:56.450
in a high-impact
journal, that this caused

01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:58.850
a huge uproar,
that it turned out

01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:01.350
this was quite a simple
experiment where it was shown

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:06.070
that with something
like 33 million-- many,

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:08.610
many users, if you
change their feed,

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:13.380
the news feed, if you move it
towards more positive stories,

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.830
people would then start to
make more positive comments

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:17.450
in their feed.

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:19.290
And there was also
a negative result

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:21.630
so you could apparently
emotionally engineer

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.150
the Facebook audience.

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:25.300
And this caused an outcry.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.010
But in fact, these
type of small changes

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:29.990
are being tested all the time.

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:31.790
It was more the fact
that it became public.

01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:34.160
So there's actually an
increasing divide, perhaps,

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.910
between the academic world
and the commercial world,

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:43.560
or perhaps between data-driven
science and big data.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:49.900
So these are all areas
that are a lot going on,

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.190
I guess we could say.

01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:53.440
One theme that I thought was
interesting that came out

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.902
in all of your
presentations was--

01:04:55.902 --> 01:04:58.360
or I would be interested in
hearing your comments on this--

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.750
was that there were
changes among younger users

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:05.140
or in the data that you got
from younger people, or else

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.890
as Alice said, that younger
people seem to experience

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:09.630
greater levels of harassment.

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:11.730
And I would imagine
that maybe also--

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:14.050
or maybe you could
comment on this--

01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:17.380
was the language that younger
people using showing up

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.490
as different?

01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:19.795
-Yes, I didn't show it.

01:05:19.795 --> 01:05:22.370
We can tell within 5
years someone's age

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:26.217
from their Facebook language
extremely straightforward.

01:05:26.217 --> 01:05:28.050
Some of them are use
of things like pronouns

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:30.790
or "the," which old people
say "the," putting spaces

01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:35.020
after periods, but down
to fine-grain versions.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:38.410
People keep talking about "lol"
here with the [INAUDIBLE],

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:44.090
but in fact the current "lol"
is mostly League of Legends.

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:47.370
You old people are still
laughing out loud from, like,

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:49.760
the '90s, was that?

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.220
So there's huge
changes happening,

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.970
and several people
have alluded to it,

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:57.540
but there's lots of
in-group signaling.

01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:02.080
And it really is the case
that you ship people.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.260
It's a verb, not a noun.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.890
These things have
shifted massively

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:08.240
in the last couple of years,
and you can see them stratified.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.781
The 14-year-olds
and the 16-year-olds

01:06:09.781 --> 01:06:11.360
look really different.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.470
Also, they're shifting
in terms of moving away

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.730
from old, slow platforms like
Twitter to Snapchat, Instagram,

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:20.570
much more communication with
images with small amounts

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:22.280
of text attached.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.900
You old people still type words.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.080
That's very retro.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.190
I'm in favor of it, I'm a
word guy, I use words, too.

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:31.300
But the whole notion
of how communication

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.710
occurs-- visual,
streaming, instant.

01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:37.990
If you missed it, you'll get
something else the next hour.

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:41.510
Why are you going to store
at look at yesterday's email?

01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:43.040
That's so antique.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.320
So I think the style
of communication

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.780
is changing even more
than the content,

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.060
and I think it's something
to look at-- the notion

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.290
of how does communication occur?

01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:53.555
How does bonding occur?

01:06:53.555 --> 01:06:54.930
I'm old enough to
remember people

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:56.800
talking on telephones
to each other, very

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.210
quaint, slow
communication, not texting

01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:03.580
in the middle of the conference
to see what you just saw.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.162
-Yeah, so maybe just
comments from Ben and Alice

01:07:06.162 --> 01:07:07.620
and then we'll have
some questions.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.370
-I actually had to explain
to my 9-year-old son

01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:10.870
last week why it's called "YLS".

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.770
By the way, David
Cameron thought

01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:20.120
it was "lots of love," as
well, our Prime Minister.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.870
That shows how in touch the
UK is with the modern times.

01:07:26.479 --> 01:07:28.520
I don't know about platforms,
but we've certainly

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:33.090
seen significant differences
between the way younger age

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:35.490
groups discuss a given
topic compared with olders.

01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:40.330
And there's a unifying theme.

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:42.785
So we did this for a
handset manufacturer,

01:07:42.785 --> 01:07:45.570
and if you look at the reviews
of mobile phone handsets

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:51.270
by age group, the younger
you are the more expressive

01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:53.690
you tend to be, so it's
beautiful, gorgeous, awesome,

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:56.060
sleek-- that kind of stuff.

01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:59.220
Younger people talk a lot more
about the quality of the camera

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:02.800
being important, they talk a
lot more about the battery life

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.900
being important.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:09.580
But my favorite, I think,
is overuse of the word

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:13.460
"definitely" because
you only know everything

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:14.360
when you're young.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:21.050
And your opinions are far more
polarized the younger you are.

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:24.270
And so it's beautiful,
gorgeous, fantastic,

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.880
and I definitely recommend it.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.029
And I won't go into what
old people talk about.

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:30.029
That's too embarrassing.

01:08:30.029 --> 01:08:33.420
But definitely big differences.

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:36.880
-I want to echo Lyle's comments
about platforms like Snapchat.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.430
And one of the projects
I'm working on right now is

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:41.370
on privacy and
socioeconomic status,

01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:44.411
and we're interviewing
16-to-26-year-olds.

01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:46.660
And one of the things that
I find so interesting about

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:50.399
the 16-, 17-, 18-year-olds is
that within every high school

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.689
there are often apps
that-- well, first of all,

01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:54.899
apps and mobile devices,
they're very trendy,

01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:57.450
so the kids will all use an app
for a specific amount of time

01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:59.116
and then they'll move
on to another app.

01:08:59.116 --> 01:09:02.000
And often that is very localized
within a group of friends

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.920
or a high school, and kids will
share the same media ideologies

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.674
around a particular
communication platform

01:09:06.674 --> 01:09:08.423
and then they'll move
on to something else

01:09:08.423 --> 01:09:11.740
usually once their parents
discover that it exists.

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:14.850
So it's not even
solely generational.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:18.500
Communication is extraordinarily
contextual in every single way.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:24.029
It differs by age, by
community, by class position,

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:25.750
by access-- whether
you're mostly

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.580
accessing the
internet on your phone

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.794
or whether you have
access to a laptop or not.

01:09:29.794 --> 01:09:31.460
All of these things
are quite different.

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.069
And so this is one
of the nice things,

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:35.640
again, about qualitative work
is that you can drill down

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.080
into these very particular
ways, and rather

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.580
than trying to make
generalizations,

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.850
you can really understand how
communication technologies

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:45.410
affect young people's sense
of identity expression

01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:47.160
and their relationships
with other people.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.534
And what we find
is these effects

01:09:48.534 --> 01:09:50.279
are often quite profound.

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:50.954
-Thank you.

01:09:50.954 --> 01:09:53.279
So we'd love to take some
questions from the audience.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.850
-Hi, my name is Ashley.

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:02.940
I am a graduate
student in psychology,

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.490
and I just want to
put the disclaimer

01:10:05.490 --> 01:10:08.790
that I am heavily entrenched
in qualitative research,

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:11.440
so that's a big bias.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.940
I'm currently
involved in a study.

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:16.020
We use personal narratives
of HIV-positive women,

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.000
ethnic minority.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.400
And if one were to
look at their language

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.210
among these
100-something narratives,

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:25.290
it would look really similar.

01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:28.390
They're all from pretty much
the same socioeconomic status

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:32.262
right outside of Chicago,
around the same age.

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:34.470
But what we find is when we
look at these narratives,

01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:37.050
there are just vast
amounts of nuance,

01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:39.920
like you were speaking to,
and we've used this data--

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.200
it's longitudinal, so
we've used a lot of this

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.200
to look at coping styles
in women and viral loads.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.240
And it has affected
policy change

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.510
on a really effective level.

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:52.760
And that's a little
bit of a tangent,

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.380
but I guess I just see
this really big danger

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.640
and clumping this
together in almost

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.310
like an essentialist
notion, and I

01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:07.040
see some possibility of
it moving social justice

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.154
movements backwards.

01:11:10.154 --> 01:11:12.570
And this may be a knee-jerk
reaction to seeing women being

01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:16.430
associated with using the
word "shopping" so much,

01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:18.400
but when you're just
looking at their language,

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.720
you're not getting
their backstory,

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.220
you're not getting
the demographics,

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.140
you're not getting
the nuance, it

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:26.560
would be easy to come up with
essentialist notions of what

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.660
this is looking like.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:31.150
So I guess I'm
just wondering how

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:33.190
do you keep it from
moving us backwards

01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:37.000
in the feminist movement,
the queer movement, so on?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.610
-I think the big data does offer
a huge benefit, which I did not

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:43.970
talk about today, in actually
splitting rather than lumping.

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:47.460
So it is the case I look
at our 20-something year

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.870
old, poor, African American--
they use Twitter really

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:53.660
different than 50-year-old
white men or women who

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.520
are more professional,
or blacks of that age.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.580
There's huge differences.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.090
The thing is we
can actually look

01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:03.560
at detailed narratives of
people from Camden, New

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.070
Jersey, different
parts of Philadelphia.

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:07.640
We do collect,
actually, narratives.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.720
People volunteer and write
essays and share them with us.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.370
So I think it really is
important to contextualize,

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:15.730
and I apologize if
I over-simplified.

01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:19.060
Really different to look
at work discussions,

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:22.410
family discussions,
peer discussions.

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:25.980
So I think different platforms--
all these things can be done.

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.730
It's really easy to just
average, and what do you get?

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:32.430
You get straight,
you get middle-aged

01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:34.790
because that's the average,
you get white because that's

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:35.770
the majority.

01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:37.630
So sure, if you
don't split stuff,

01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:40.270
then you obscure
all the variation.

01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:42.680
The nice thing, certainly
if you're a Facebook or

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.140
of that size, you can
split it is finely

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:48.520
as you want and look at the
really micro-communities

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.650
and the variations.

01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:51.380
You can get the backstory.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.850
We're now taking
people and getting

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:54.830
them to share their
entire medical history

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:56.201
and their full Facebook history.

01:12:56.201 --> 01:12:58.700
We know their age, their sex,
we know what sort of insurance

01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.370
they have.

01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:00.870
We know a lot about
these people--

01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:03.210
again, with their
informed consent.

01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:06.600
And you can go back.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.550
So I think it's a
real danger that it's

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:12.650
easy to be facile and say, oh
yeah, girls say "shopping."

01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:15.350
That's nice but that's
not true of all girls,

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:18.180
and not all of them are girls.

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:22.040
-I'm thinking of a couple of
examples where-- much of this

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:24.870
is about how you apply and
think through what you're trying

01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:27.510
to communicate and who you're
trying to communicate it to,

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:31.300
and where the potential
for miscommunication lies.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.600
So there's a medical example
where we've done work

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.870
with some pharmaceutical
companies,

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:41.610
and if you think about the
journey from the pharma company

01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:44.520
to the patient getting
a benefit, the way

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.990
the pharma company
talks about a condition

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:49.700
compared with how doctors
talk about the same condition

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:54.290
compared with how patients talk
about the same condition subtly

01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:58.520
shifts to the point where this
word that the patient uses--

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.920
they're meaning the same
thing as the pharma company,

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.150
but it all gets
lost in translation.

01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:06.920
And we've had some reasonably
interesting and successful

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.970
results where
somebody has modified

01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:13.580
their style of communication
for the person they're

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:17.990
trying to target, and it's
had very positive results.

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:20.270
-I just want to add to
that the on social media,

01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:21.940
a lot of the
language that we see

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.779
is quite performative in that
people are often attempting

01:14:24.779 --> 01:14:27.320
to manage the impression that
they're making on other people.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.940
So they're using affiliative
language practices in order

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:32.845
to either-- the
woman who constantly

01:14:32.845 --> 01:14:34.640
is talking about cute
dogs and shopping--

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.620
I mean, I talk about cute
dogs on Twitter-- quite a bit,

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.409
I might add.

01:14:38.409 --> 01:14:40.450
But she might also be
trying to affiliate herself

01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:42.640
in certain ways or
trying to perform

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.350
a particular type of fem
identity for a particular end.

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:49.160
And I think that
when we're thinking

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.782
about the visible identity
cues that people are making

01:14:51.782 --> 01:14:53.990
on social media, we also
have to think about the fact

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.870
that many people see social
media as somewhere where

01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:58.390
they have a particular persona
that they're furthering.

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:00.900
And one of the other things
that I'm interested in

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:04.294
is how a lot of the time
those personas get branded,

01:15:04.294 --> 01:15:05.960
that people start
thinking of themselves

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.420
as using advertising and
marketing strategies in using

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.440
social media and
reaching out to others,

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.270
and I think that that's
the kind of thing

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:14.909
that the qualitative
work that you're doing,

01:15:14.909 --> 01:15:16.700
that Lyle is talking
about, that can really

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:18.991
add to our understanding of
those types of social media

01:15:18.991 --> 01:15:20.620
linguistic practices.

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:23.420
-Thank you.

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:24.730
-Hello, my name is Kiera.

01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:26.140
I'm from Connecticut College.

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.590
I'm a sophomore there.

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:29.620
And I'm curious-- this
question's for Alice--

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.330
what's your opinion on Yik Yak?

01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:36.480
-Oh, so those of you who don't
know, Yik Yak is a mobile app.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.330
It is sort of like
anonymous Twitter,

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:40.940
that you can say things
anonymously and it can get up

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.440
or down voted by the
rest of your community.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.310
And it's geolocated, meaning
that generally you're

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:48.350
seeing Yik Yaks from
people around you.

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:50.790
So I work at Fordham
University, I often

01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:53.260
look at the Fordham Yik Yak.

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:57.200
And also it's been accused of
being used for bullying a lot,

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.580
so Yik Yak has tried to put
all these really interesting

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.605
technical affordances
to police user behavior,

01:16:01.605 --> 01:16:03.980
like you're not supposed to
mention other people by name,

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:06.320
and they geofence
off the boundary.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.700
So my apartment is close
to a secondary school,

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.599
so I can't use Yik Yak
within my apartment

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.432
because it thinks I'm
a high school student.

01:16:12.432 --> 01:16:13.780
All right, whatever.

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:18.350
I think anonymous internet
communication is interesting.

01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:20.954
I think that it affords
some very positive things.

01:16:20.954 --> 01:16:22.370
Quite frequently
there is evidence

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:24.578
that people find it easier
to share with other people

01:16:24.578 --> 01:16:27.430
when they're not having
their information tied back

01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:30.847
to a singular identity, tied
to their marketing profile.

01:16:30.847 --> 01:16:32.430
And I think it is
important for people

01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:34.860
to have places to
express things that they

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:36.300
can't express in other places.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.806
On the other hand,
I think it's also

01:16:37.806 --> 01:16:39.430
a place where people
can express things

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.220
that are very offensive
or problematic

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.160
or might really
hurt somebody else.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.743
And the thing about Yik Yak is
they'll give personal data over

01:16:45.743 --> 01:16:47.850
to law enforcement without
even thinking about it.

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:49.050
That's one of their things.

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:53.812
If you, say, Yik Yak, oh,
I want to bomb the school,

01:16:53.812 --> 01:16:55.770
they'll give that over
to the cops and the cops

01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:59.780
will arrest that person and
that's happened several times.

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:04.010
So I go back and forth.

01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:10.400
I don't believe that
technology is neutral at all.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.370
I believe that technology
can and does express

01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:14.950
its own politics and values.

01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:17.610
And the people
behind Yik Yak seemed

01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:22.160
like their ideal was to create
something for self-expression.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.050
I don't know, what's
your opinion of Yik Yak?

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:24.615
I would be curious.

01:17:24.615 --> 01:17:25.275
-I don't have Yik Yak.

01:17:25.275 --> 01:17:26.020
-You don't have Yik Yak?

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:27.310
-I deleted it a while ago.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:30.930
-Does it have influence
on your campus?

01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:36.460
-Yes, but I try not to see it.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:37.230
-Yeah.

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:39.130
But I do know that
there's been a lot

01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:42.900
of other similar, anonymous,
campus-based things

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:43.400
in the past.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.316
There used to be something
called JuicyCampus,

01:17:45.316 --> 01:17:46.770
which was a gossip.

01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:48.210
People like to gossip.

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:49.990
College students love to gossip.

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:51.174
People like to gossip.

01:17:51.174 --> 01:17:53.590
that People are going to use
social media sites to gossip.

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:56.110
I'm not sure whether I would
say that the negative effects

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:58.197
of anonymity outweigh
the positive effects,

01:17:58.197 --> 01:17:59.780
but I think it is
important for people

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.890
to have anonymous spaces online.

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:03.470
-As a researcher
I think it's also

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:06.160
important-- people are
always performative.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.546
They're putting on a
persona on Facebook,

01:18:08.546 --> 01:18:09.920
they're putting
on one right now.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.320
As we talk to each other,
we're doing a persona.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.170
And it's interesting
to me to be able to see

01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:17.820
some of these people who are
often fairly nasty on Yik Yak,

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:20.480
but the chance to actually see
what they're seeing in a way

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.840
that they will not
show me as an authority

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:26.320
figure from the establishment
to know what's going on.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.440
So I don't find much of the
discussion very pleasant,

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.390
but I guess I do like to know
what people are talking about.

01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:35.430
And in the end
end, that, I think,

01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:37.010
is an important
facet quite apart

01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:39.676
from the separate question of is
it beneficial or harmful, which

01:18:39.676 --> 01:18:42.270
is not so obvious.

01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:48.620
-Since we have four more
questions let's move on.

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.060
-I'm writing a history of
the Equal Rights Amendment

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.880
in graphic novel form, which
ends up being really look

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.340
at the citizenship
of women and men

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.210
and the history of
it in this country.

01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:02.400
And one of the things you
notice in the early on

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.100
is that there is a
very deliberate attempt

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.995
to create spheres--
the women will operate

01:19:06.995 --> 01:19:08.620
in the domestic sphere
and the men will

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:10.030
operate in the public sphere.

01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:14.530
And so it's interesting to
look at how men talk publicly

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:17.460
about politics and about
sports, and you often

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:20.280
find, of course, they
talk about them similarly,

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.020
that they're the teams.

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.830
And I've noticed
as someone who is

01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:28.660
a woman who talks publicly about
politics, I get policed by men.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:31.900
And I also get women who write
to me and say, oh my god,

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.100
thank you for saying
that publicly.

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:35.880
And then I get little
secret messages.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.430
And I have lots of
little background forum

01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:41.680
of women reassuring each other.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.460
And a friend of mine, a man,
wrote a piece supporting

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.500
Hillary Clinton, which
went kind of viral,

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.749
and he said he got lots of
messages from women saying,

01:19:48.749 --> 01:19:50.000
thank god I had this to share.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.374
I was afraid to say I supported
Hillary Clinton because I

01:19:52.374 --> 01:19:55.020
didn't want to get yelled at,
but I could share this and be

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.685
like, look, this guy likes her.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:02.460
So it's funny to compare the
women talking about shopping

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.800
publicly and then the
harassment that women

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.400
get for talking publicly.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.779
How much of that is about are
women talking in the background

01:20:09.779 --> 01:20:10.820
that we don't know about?

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:13.209
How much of that is
affecting each other

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:14.250
and what they talk about?

01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:19.800
-Does anyone want
to tackle that one?

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.250
-I think the different
platforms are very different,

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:25.000
so you're communicating with
your friends over Facebook

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.056
is very different from
publishing in a blog,

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:30.430
and very different from being
in a gaming community which

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:33.310
are notoriously competitive,
would be a polite way

01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:34.400
to put it.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.820
So I think that there are many,
many different communities

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:40.870
and each person participates
in them in different ways,

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:43.740
and it's very hard to
generalize across them.

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:45.740
-One of the things that
we found in our research

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:49.420
with young people is that
young people will often

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:53.424
use a multiplexity of
different apps to communicate,

01:20:53.424 --> 01:20:55.090
and they'll often
have one of those apps

01:20:55.090 --> 01:20:57.589
will act as a sort of safety
valve, which is where they feel

01:20:57.589 --> 01:20:59.900
that they can be more honest.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.520
And quite often that's
because either they're

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.740
using a pseudonym on
a site like Tumblr,

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:08.560
or they're communicating with
a smaller group of people,

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.740
like they have a group text
on WhatsApp or something

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.240
and that's where they share
their more intimate feelings.

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.730
But thing about
that is then you're

01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:17.490
not participating
in what we would

01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:19.030
think of as the "public sphere.

01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:21.488
And what we see historically
in the history of the internet

01:21:21.488 --> 01:21:24.160
is that men's speeches tended
to be more in the public sphere.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.620
That the blogs
written by men were

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.915
valued more than the online
journals written by women,

01:21:28.915 --> 01:21:30.540
and when people are
talking about who's

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.910
participating in the
kind of online punditry

01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:34.410
that we see on
sites like Medium,

01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:37.290
oftentimes it's men who are
going into those spaces.

01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:39.150
So I think that there
is certainly a value

01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:42.530
placed on where people are
participating and talking

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:43.215
about things.

01:21:43.215 --> 01:21:44.840
And I do think that
the fact that there

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.330
is this systematic
discouragement of women

01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:49.100
speaking in these sort
of internet public

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.080
spheres-- I think that's a
very significant problem.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:52.739
I really do.

01:21:52.739 --> 01:21:54.780
I think it's a devaluing
of women's contributions

01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.360
to the political sphere,
to the public sphere,

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.711
and frankly I think it's
a problem with democracy.

01:22:00.711 --> 01:22:04.790
-So since we've got
two more questions,

01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:07.370
I thought you could
ask them successively

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:12.670
and then we'll have
one or two comments.

01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:14.870
-Hello, my name is
Caitlin Hannigan.

01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:16.860
I'm a strategic
communication major

01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:21.460
at Bridgewater State University,
my first senior year.

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.819
So Alice, I actually connected
with a lot of the stuff

01:22:23.819 --> 01:22:25.610
that you were talking
about because we talk

01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:27.420
a lot about that in my classes.

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.310
And my question's more
geared towards you,

01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:32.647
but anyone is welcome to
answer if they have an opinion.

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:34.230
But I don't know if
you guys remember,

01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:37.670
but last spring, Curt
Schilling tweeted something

01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:40.950
out about his daughter
being accepted

01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:43.760
into a college on a
scholarship for softball.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.880
And immediately
responding, people

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.184
were sending her death
threats-- I'm going to rape her,

01:22:49.184 --> 01:22:51.100
I'm going to do this,
we're going to find her,

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.190
all of that stuff.

01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:57.110
So my question is pretty much
I know you've done research

01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:59.690
on age and gender
and stuff, but I

01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:03.440
don't know if there's a
difference with the celebrities

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:07.390
versus "normal people" I guess.

01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:12.170
Not, like, normal people,
but you get what I'm saying.

01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:14.670
Just because we talk
about that all the time,

01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:19.150
but we talked earlier about
how we act differently

01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:21.550
in front of different
audiences, and celebrities

01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:24.067
do act differently
probably in the media

01:23:24.067 --> 01:23:26.150
than they do at their homes
or with their families

01:23:26.150 --> 01:23:26.691
or something.

01:23:26.691 --> 01:23:28.454
So I was wondering about that.

01:23:28.454 --> 01:23:30.120
-We'll come back to
that, and let's just

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.670
hear the last question.

01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:33.674
-Hi, thanks.

01:23:33.674 --> 01:23:35.090
My name is Orrin
[? Sur ?] and I'm

01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:38.810
doing natural language
processing and big data.

01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:42.490
And I want to go back to
Rebecca's famous quotation

01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:46.214
of Anderson of big data
is the end of theory

01:23:46.214 --> 01:23:50.320
and ask for your
respective takes on that.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.710
-Schilling or end
of theory first?

01:23:56.710 --> 01:23:58.550
Or does anyone want
to pick one of those?

01:23:58.550 --> 01:24:01.135
-I'm happy to talk
about the Schilling.

01:24:01.135 --> 01:24:02.510
So I think that,
first of all, we

01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:04.834
have a culture of
criticizing celebrity women.

01:24:04.834 --> 01:24:07.250
And many of us may not see
that as a very serious problem,

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:09.000
like, who cares if
Kim Kardashian gets

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:09.830
her feelings hurt?

01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:11.690
But I think the problem is that
the distinction between who

01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:13.810
is a celebrity and
who is not is changing

01:24:13.810 --> 01:24:15.034
with the era of the internet.

01:24:15.034 --> 01:24:16.950
So if everybody who puts
their pictures online

01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:19.380
is now susceptible
to the same type

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:23.290
of severe, gendered criticism
that we put on famous women,

01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:25.790
then it becomes an issue of
who is more public than others?

01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:27.390
And if all of us are
making ourselves public,

01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:29.348
and often we're forced
to make ourselves public

01:24:29.348 --> 01:24:31.470
as a condition for young
people, for employment,

01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:34.580
or for education, then we're all
susceptible to that same type

01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:36.720
of deeply critical language.

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:37.929
And I think that's a problem.

01:24:37.929 --> 01:24:39.511
The second thing is
I think that there

01:24:39.511 --> 01:24:41.330
is a continuum of
celebrity practice

01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:43.940
by which some people
are internet celebrities

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.620
or Facebook famous or
whatever, and they actively

01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.040
are looking for
attention online.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.250
That's what my first
book was all about,

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.920
was attention has a particular
type of social currency.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.850
And so I think that when we're
talking about celebrities,

01:24:53.850 --> 01:24:55.830
it's actually quite
important because celebrity

01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:58.070
as a model of a
commodified self that

01:24:58.070 --> 01:25:00.680
uses broadcast media
to publicize itself

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.210
is something that's
getting closer

01:25:02.210 --> 01:25:04.290
to the intrinsic
subjectivity of social media

01:25:04.290 --> 01:25:06.530
than we might like to think.

01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:07.480
-Thanks.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.950
Do you want to
tackle end of theory?

01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:12.890
-Well, the limitation
of big data

01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:14.900
is commercial people
to actually go and do

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.620
something interesting and
meaningful and useful with it.

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.690
I think that's the choke point.

01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:23.890
-In speaking from the
standpoint of psychology,

01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:26.950
it has for the last
50 years been largely

01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:30.220
a theory-driven field, but
I see in the last few years

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:33.370
these big data are
pushing to be still mostly

01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:36.160
theory, but increasingly
hypothesis-driven.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.440
So the one thing that one
can do from these focus

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.920
groups of 10 million people
is go not with a theory,

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.660
but to say, hey, I
want to know what

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:46.520
people are saying about
transpeople or about cell

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.370
phones.

01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:49.140
Let me not come
in with a theory.

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:52.890
Let me first observe empirically
what's being talked about,

01:25:52.890 --> 01:25:55.290
and then tie that
back to underlying

01:25:55.290 --> 01:25:58.700
theory of personality, or
whichever theory structure you

01:25:58.700 --> 01:25:59.440
want.

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.110
So I think the ability
to generate hypotheses

01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:03.510
is unbelievably powerful.

01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:07.380
It's not just asking a
question to confirm or falsify

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.244
a hypothesis.

01:26:08.244 --> 01:26:09.660
That's a very
different style, one

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.690
that's taken over
in medicine but is

01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:14.980
fairly new to large parts
of the social sciences.

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:16.020
-Great.

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:19.580
So that's a good note to end
on, that data cannot speak

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:20.180
for itself.

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.920
And I want to thank
all these panelists

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.970
for presenting their research.
