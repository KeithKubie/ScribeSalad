You are listening to radiolab radio

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.563
from

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.510
<v 1>W N Y s t e n n p.</v>

4
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.390
R. A M. Jad Abumrad.

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.170
<v 0>I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. And today we're talking about,</v>

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.950
<v 1>I don't think they'll ever be another specimen that'll be exactly like that.</v>

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.900
<v 0>This one actually, uh, our,</v>

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.300
our next podcast is a full hour about stories that grow out of particular

9
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:33.140
things, objects. But today we have a preview. Yes. Sort of. So that's the place,

10
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:37.100
right? This is the place to story about a thing. So in this spot,

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.780
it lives inside a steel vault.

12
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.090
Inside this huge laboratory at wits university in Johannesburg,

13
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:47.840
South Africa. We asked a professor there,

14
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.780
Dr. Bernard does that fail to pull it out and show it to our reporter,

15
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.440
Patricia Hume. And this is the originals.

16
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.943
<v 2>This is it.</v>

17
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.803
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

18
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.090
<v 2>this. We have a dry in front of us here. I mean, I, I handle this a lot,</v>

19
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.640
but like it gets fresh every time I take this out.

20
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.290
The reason it gives him goose flesh goosebumps is because this object seems to

21
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:15.670
completely up. And two basic questions about, you know, human history.

22
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.020
It's amazing. Where did we begin and when we began,

23
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.210
who was trying to take us out?

24
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.340
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

25
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.870
<v 1>pretty sure Andy Mills takes this story from here, right,</v>

26
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.600
with thunder and vigor and Gusto with Gusto. Yes. I'd like to with Gusto please.

27
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.380
All right. Look,

28
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.340
it's one of those discoveries that almost didn't happen and here to help me tell

29
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:39.760
you the story. Okay. I'm professor Lee Berger is Lee.

30
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.800
I am a research professor at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and

31
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:49.180
an explorer in residence at the National Geographic Society and explore in

32
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.860
residence. That's a weird title. It seems like it should be one or the other.

33
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.750
It's almost an oxymoron, isn't it? Yeah.

34
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.520
Lee's says that our story begins back in the 1920s in South Africa at a place

35
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.050
called Tongue Tang.

36
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.550
It's t a n u g town is the proper thing in Swana,

37
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.260
the western way of saying his tongue.

38
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.270
It's a desert area on the southern edge of the Kalahari escarpment.

39
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.440
Kind of like your stereotypical picture of Africa, red rocks, Bale, Bob trees,

40
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:18.400
roaming gazelles,

41
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.460
and back in the 1920s the place was crawling with Europeans digging mines.

42
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.610
You say we're blasting away with, with with dynamite drilling,

43
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:30.970
with big steam drills and huge explosions would take places.

44
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.900
And one day these miners,

45
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.740
they're blowing their way through a bit of this hillside and

46
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.733
<v 0>yeah,</v>

47
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.710
<v 1>as the rock falls away and the smoke clears,</v>

48
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.130
they realize that they've opened up this cave, an ancient cave,

49
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.420
and inside of that cave we found dozens of these strange looking rocks,

50
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.230
almost like animal bones. One of the minors. He takes those bones,

51
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.750
give them to a geologists, geologist, box them up,

52
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.840
and sent them to this Australian guy who was living Johannesburg named Raymond

53
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.060
Dart. And that's probably the first miracle in this story.

54
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.340
Raymond Dart was a neuro anatomist, a comparative neuroanatomists,

55
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.640
one of the only ones in the world.

56
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.150
This was the guy who knew his fossils and when this box arrived,

57
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.710
he was actually wearing a three piece suit.

58
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.130
He's going to be best man at a wedding, in fact, later that afternoon.

59
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.340
But he's like, that can wait. So he reached into the box,

60
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.180
shuffled through some antelope scope. It was full of the boon skulls, monkey,

61
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.740
Scholes, until he got to this one rock. Now to you or me,

62
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.310
this would've just looked like a big chunk of limestone,

63
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.150
but Raymond ARD immediately realized that he had something special and he

64
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:37.750
started,

65
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.610
he actually went and got his wife knitting needles and started scratching away

66
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.010
at this rock, much to his wife's disgust.

67
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.080
He then spent the next several months delicately chipping away at the limestone

68
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.600
until the rock literally caught free and there he stared

69
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.220
<v 4>into a perfect little face.</v>

70
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.790
<v 1>You can see here the face is quite flat and then human life</v>

71
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.240
lot like the face of a child, a human child,

72
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.270
but humans have a larger brain according to doctors that felt this child's brain

73
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:20.050
was smaller than the human child. It was closer to the size of a chimpanzee,

74
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.040
so it had features of a human. It had a brain more like a chimpanzees stranger,

75
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:27.730
still dark, who remember study, this sort of thing.

76
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.920
He looked at the foramen magnum.

77
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:33.820
That's the hole in the base of your skull where your spine goes in.

78
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.490
He knew that for creatures that walk on four legs,

79
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.870
that hole is generally towards the back of the skull so they can look forward.

80
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.150
But here the holes on the bottom,

81
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.470
which suggested to them that this creature locked up, right?

82
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.470
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

83
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.890
<v 4>it was not a monkey. It wasn't an ape. As we know apes today,</v>

84
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.850
it was certainly not a modern human being. This was something in between.

85
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.450
If you were walking across a broken woodland where little Tom Chow might've

86
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:03.330
lived, you would've seen a a person.

87
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.210
Often the distance as you approached though,

88
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.210
you'd begin to see that something was wrong with the proportions.

89
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.540
Arms were probably a little longer legs, a little bit shorter.

90
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.880
The head was too small and as you stepped closer,

91
00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:18.450
you'd see the Little Tome child's body would have been covered in this thick

92
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.290
hair, potentially even for more like an ape than than we have,

93
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.580
but it'd be like no AP you've ever seen because it would be standing there in

94
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:29.940
very much the way you would be standing staring at it

95
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.620
<v 1>on two legs. So if, if,</v>

96
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.990
if this is a little bit human and a little bit apes sort of kind of in the

97
00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:39.830
middle it seems, did he, did he feel like this was the quote missing link?

98
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.980
We don't use that term because evolution doesn't happen that way,

99
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.090
but it's certainly dark.

100
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:47.930
Did he even fact wrote a book called adventures with the missing link and right

101
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.250
after he discovered the skull,

102
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.730
he sent a paper off an amazing speed of journal Nature.

103
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.940
It was published in February of 1925 he thought that was going to revolutionize

104
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.090
everything,

105
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.090
but he was whole heartedly rejected by the great scientific community of Europe

106
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.810
for two reasons. First, we already knew that humans didn't evolve in Africa.

107
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.610
Yeah, Africa was backward. That was the belief says Chris Stringer,

108
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.350
I'm a research leader in human origins at the Natural History Museum in London

109
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.900
and he explained that back in the early 20th century,

110
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:26.510
people of the time felt that if you look in Europe,

111
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.770
you can see all this wonderful Kayvon painted many thousands of years ago.

112
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.910
They prefer to think that you are at war Asia will more likely centers of our

113
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:38.270
origins than Africa was. Second,

114
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.510
scientists already found a skull that they believed belonged to.

115
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:44.900
The quote unquote missing link was something called Piltdown man.

116
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.050
It was this ancient man fossil thing that they found in a golf course in

117
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:53.620
England. So in their minds, that was the right place. Then also compute down,

118
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.020
man,

119
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.340
you've got this very large brain and a brain case that looks really quite like a

120
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:01.220
modern human one, which made sense to them. You know,

121
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.570
clearly European ancestors would have had big brains,

122
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.250
but because they're European. Yeah,

123
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.330
I mean the tooling individual had a small brain way too small.

124
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.510
This thing was too primitive. It didn't look right. So dark.

125
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.400
He spent the next 20 plus years arguing,

126
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.263
look, people,

127
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.390
this is our ancestor and getting nowhere until in the late 1920s other fossils

128
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:30.470
started showing up in China, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia,

129
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.340
and these other fossils.

130
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.150
They were from roughly the same era as the Piltdown man, but their brains,

131
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:38.420
their teeth, their bone structures, they were all totally different.

132
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.590
So this was very weird. I mean, you know, how do you explain that for decades?

133
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:45.650
Nothing else, not Piltdown man turns up from anywhere in the world.

134
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.770
So some forensic experts at the London Museum of natural history,

135
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:52.190
they decide maybe we ought to go take a closer look at Piltdown.

136
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:55.700
Man by started looking at the material under the microscopes and right off the

137
00:07:55.701 --> 00:08:00.701
bat they found that one of the teeth clearly showed the marks of a metal file,

138
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.680
that it had been filed down to look flat.

139
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.620
No built down was a fraud,

140
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.720
was a fake of forgery, a hoax, and the holsters were never caught.

141
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.060
They were questions in the houses of parliament about the competence of the

142
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.410
Natural History Museum.

143
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.750
That is that each experts had been fought for all this time cause this wasn't

144
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:28.130
even a very good fake. They had taken the jawbone of an orangutan.

145
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.870
They took some modern human skull pieces. They then stained that material,

146
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.450
dark brown, so it looked the same color,

147
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:40.451
no even fake stone tools and all this time right there in front of them was the

148
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:42.464
tongue child.

149
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.220
<v 6>Aw.</v>

150
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.150
<v 1>It is estimated as purely an estimate of being around 2 million,</v>

151
00:08:48.151 --> 00:08:52.260
2.2 million years old, which still today is the oldest,

152
00:08:52.261 --> 00:08:56.010
not quite yet human fossil that we this, this

153
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:01.010
<v 4>would be probably the greatest or one of the greatest discoveries ever been</v>

154
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:07.680
argued to be the most important single fossil ever discovered in the history of

155
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:08.281
humankind.

156
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:13.281
Search for ancestry because it brought to the fall that humanity originated in

157
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:17.940
Africa that every human on earth is an African,

158
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.740
we are all of African origin

159
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.760
<v 1>but but more than just where we came from,</v>

160
00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:29.150
which I think is totally cool. Yeah. Huh. Super interesting. We can,

161
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:32.300
we can look at the skull and we can see things about, you know,

162
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:37.280
what life was like for this like little version of us that lived so long ago.

163
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.320
We look at the teeth and we can see what it was eating.

164
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.300
Was it eating like what we eat?

165
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.560
It's teeth are like surprisingly similar to our teeth. So yeah, it wasn't,

166
00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:48.470
it wasn't like hugely different from what we eat.

167
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.480
But I think the most exciting thing that it can tell us is, you know,

168
00:09:53.481 --> 00:09:55.220
not just about what our life was like,

169
00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.820
but what was lurking in the shadows waiting to take us out.

170
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.870
<v 4>You can tell that from this school, I mean this, this skull is, it's,</v>

171
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:10.110
it's kind of at the center of this murder mystery. I,

172
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.120
he who killed the tongue job at the time when, when,

173
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.340
when Raymond dark made that discovery,

174
00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:20.341
he had this sort of gut feeling that this tone child was killed by one of its

175
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.600
own. You know, cause this is like 1924 we were between two wars,

176
00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:29.080
world war one had occurred with the horrible destruction.

177
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.900
Dart was actually a medic in that war and he walked away,

178
00:10:31.901 --> 00:10:33.570
convinced the humans were,

179
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.710
we're inherently evil creatures that were inherently violent and that we were

180
00:10:38.711 --> 00:10:40.900
probably a lot worse in the past. And in fact,

181
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.680
the opening of 2001 a space odyssey

182
00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:51.070
where you see the monkeys kind of like beating each other with the bones was

183
00:10:51.071 --> 00:10:52.180
based on Raymond Darts,

184
00:10:52.181 --> 00:10:55.390
theories of the violent origins on the continent of Africa.

185
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.030
So

186
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:03.010
<v 1>that was darts like pet theory that maybe Tom got clubbed down by his brother or</v>

187
00:11:03.011 --> 00:11:03.844
his neighbor.

188
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:09.150
But that ignores one big thing in that limestone mine where the tongue skull was

189
00:11:10.241 --> 00:11:14.380
found. There were also all these other skulls, baboons schools, monkey skulls.

190
00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:17.920
There was this like little collection of bones where like what you would expect

191
00:11:17.921 --> 00:11:22.560
to find in a Predator stun. So not a tongue like creature, but yeah,

192
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.570
<v 4>maybe the cat big cat,</v>

193
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.500
at least a large man alien predator. Then because that's perfectly acceptable.

194
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.360
If we're tough, they're tough.

195
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.580
It's okay to be killed by something mean and vicious.

196
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.360
<v 1>So that became the new theory because what else do humans have to fear? Right?</v>

197
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.200
Well what now here's where I think maybe you come into this story for some

198
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.680
reason, when you arrive many, many, many years later,

199
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.920
this idea that the cat did,

200
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:54.100
it seems to disturb you. I was addicted to that

201
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.180
<v 4>story. Is anyone else?</v>

202
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:58.360
I'd been brought up on it through my anthropology classes. Every,

203
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:01.980
every book I ever read said that. But one day in,

204
00:12:01.981 --> 00:12:06.010
in 1994 he bumps into a completely new idea.

205
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.780
In it in an almost Eureka moment

206
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.563
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

207
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.410
<v 4>cause they're, I was at Gladys fail an excavation site in South Africa.</v>

208
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.140
Lee and his team were doing what they do, digging for fossils.

209
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.580
I just finished excavation.

210
00:12:19.581 --> 00:12:23.960
All my team had left and I was sitting there watching the sunset and I looked up

211
00:12:23.961 --> 00:12:24.794
on the hillside

212
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.390
and there was a troop of vervet monkeys or a small gray monkey and they were

213
00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:32.990
coming down to forge down the hill and all of a sudden I heard an alarm

214
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.870
and I looked up in the sky and there came a huge eagle.

215
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.390
The monkeys scattered as this eagle swooped around the edge of the hill and as

216
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:45.100
it came down around the edge of the hill,

217
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.900
I realized it was a trap because coming around the other edge of the hill was

218
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.110
that Eagle's mate and it zoomed in and whacked one of those large muscles right

219
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.840
in front of me and everything went silent.

220
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.550
The other Eagle landed this eagle sitting on top of a now dead monkey and the

221
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.180
eagle staring at me, I'm staring at it probably with my mouth open.

222
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.590
It looks at me for a moment and then leaps off the edge of this cliff with this

223
00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:15.770
dead monkey and flies away with it down the valley.

224
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.360
And I had an idea. So I got into my car,

225
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.820
I chased the direction it went. I knew where it was going.

226
00:13:22.821 --> 00:13:25.700
I knew where these Black Eagle Nest, where they were up on a cliff face.

227
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.220
I crawled up under crossing a river,

228
00:13:28.221 --> 00:13:32.390
crawled up under the the nest and there was this pile of bones,

229
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.520
huge pile of bones, high racks, his little antelopes, a baboon skull,

230
00:13:37.521 --> 00:13:38.750
a baby baboon skull,

231
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:44.050
and almost every one of the bones there had these amazing ah marks on them.

232
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.130
Key shape cuts where the eagles have driven their talons into the skulls.

233
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.170
These big eagles can have killing talents at five, six, seven inches long.

234
00:13:55.171 --> 00:13:59.000
If you can imagine that I got in my car back to the lab and Joe Burke,

235
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:04.110
he whips open the drawer that contains those skulls and bones that were found

236
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.220
with the tone child skull and okay,

237
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.680
exact same marks, couldn't believe it.

238
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.870
There's even like a little mark on the tongue child skull itself.

239
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.450
A year later, 1995 he and a colleague, they publish a paper,

240
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.970
Bernadette blamed eagles for the death of the Tom Child and it was received like

241
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.140
a smelly, wet blanket by the field. Why? Why would, why would you,

242
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.180
why would they not say, oh, of course.

243
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.170
Because it was entrenched idea. You know,

244
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:43.510
lease says maybe subconsciously they felt like our ancestors are being demoted

245
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:45.280
again. That is that, you know,

246
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:50.310
we were not the masters of our universe because cats just feel tougher than

247
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:54.020
birds, I don't know. But according to leave, the big cat scientists were like,

248
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:54.950
you know, it's been published.

249
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:57.230
It's been published to leopard did it for 40 years.

250
00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.110
We even got into a debate in the,

251
00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:03.670
in the hallowed pages of the journal Nature One,

252
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.680
the load lifting capacity of birds of prey on whether or not birds of prey could

253
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:13.520
lift something as large as the tongue job and these debates they went on for

254
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.443
years.

255
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.770
He couldn't convince people we needed something more until one night it was

256
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:21.560
about nine o'clock at night. Years later it was at home.

257
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.790
Seeing in my little study,

258
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.410
he was reading an academic paper about eagles and how eagles sometimes when they

259
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:28.400
kill a little mammals,

260
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.290
they'll reach into their ice sockets and pluck out their eyes to get it.

261
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:35.450
The knife, juicy brain on the inside.

262
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.960
And in the paper it was this really beautiful image. Well,

263
00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:40.760
it's beautiful to people who study dead things,

264
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:42.470
but a beautiful image of a skull,

265
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:47.471
of a primate with the interior sockets of eyes with these jacket marks in it.

266
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.300
These very particular scratch marks on the underside of the ice sockets.

267
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.960
And I was staring at these images and I went, okay,

268
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.730
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

269
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.400
<v 4>oh my goodness. Or something to that effect.</v>

270
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.990
I got into my car, drove down to the lab, opened up the safe,

271
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.080
pulled out the tongue child, turn the face over.

272
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.620
And there they were

273
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.493
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

274
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:17.300
<v 4>on the base of the inside of the ice socket where these jagged rigid marks that</v>

275
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.940
that you had to have done by reaching into the orbit,

276
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.730
the exact same marks.

277
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.450
You can see little squiggle marks on the spike. Little, uh,

278
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.580
exclamation marks, a little calmers. No one had noticed that before.

279
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:37.290
And Imagine I'm sitting in the middle of this anatomy department in the middle

280
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.140
of the night in a vault containing million year old fossil.

281
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.860
It was a magic moment. It was fantastic. All right,

282
00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:47.670
so now you know a little bit about how this creature lived and how it died.

283
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.150
I mean, beyond solving the murder mystery, what does that tell you? Well,

284
00:16:51.151 --> 00:16:51.931
first to say,

285
00:16:51.931 --> 00:16:56.040
solving the murder mystery is kind of cool and that's always a neat thing and

286
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.520
there's nothing wrong with just doing that, but have you ever thought,

287
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
why when you're standing out on a playground or standing out in an open field

288
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.740
and a shadow passes over you,

289
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.230
do you know that feeling that occurred,

290
00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:13.330
whether it be from an airplane or whatever?

291
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.740
First you get that tingly feel on the back of your neck and then you yank your

292
00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:20.620
head up. You ever wondered why you do that? Yeah,

293
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:25.300
you do that because the little tongue child died two and a half million years

294
00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:28.390
ago because he didn't look up quick enough when that happened.

295
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.120
<v 0>But is there any meals? One thing we should say.</v>

296
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.220
One very important thing we should say is actually we did an experiment with the

297
00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:40.840
story.

298
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.380
We hooked up with some people at Makerbot and some very nice folks at the field

299
00:17:44.381 --> 00:17:49.381
museum in Chicago and we had a three d scans made of the tongue skull.

300
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:53.400
I'm actually holding one right now. We do. Yeah. Mine's purple. Mine's pink.

301
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.310
Why is pink? I don't know if that was the color of the plastic days.

302
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.280
These are amazing replicas of the tongue child, skull.

303
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:02.580
I mean you can see all the ridges. You can feel the scratches and the eyes.

304
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.240
Imagine if you could listen to the story you just heard while holding the tongue

305
00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:09.030
child in your head. Well that's exactly the reason we did this.

306
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.570
We have partnered with a museum called museum that's a spelled with four m's,

307
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:18.480
two in the front, two in the back, a museum.

308
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.310
It's this tiny little elevator shaft size place here in Manhattan where they

309
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.470
display all these sort of like oddities, you know,

310
00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:29.050
like little objects from Saddam Hussein's palace. Uh,

311
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.760
we have a pool toys that were banned from Saudi Arabia. Right.

312
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.860
And they will also be displaying our 3d replica of the Tang skull.

313
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.010
So if you go there, you can actually hold the skull,

314
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:42.090
you dial in a little number,

315
00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:44.250
and you can hear part of the piece while you're standing there. Yeah,

316
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.911
and I gotta tell you,

317
00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:48.270
it's a very different experience to listen to the story while holding this

318
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:49.110
thing. And not only that,

319
00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:53.220
if you have a three d printer of your own and you go to radio lab.org,

320
00:18:53.221 --> 00:18:57.270
you can download a scan, a three d scan of the tongue skull,

321
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.440
and you can print your own.

322
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.670
Thanks again to makerbot and to shoot digital for helping to make that happen.

323
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.390
Props to Lynn Levy for conceiving of the whole idea. Go to our website,

324
