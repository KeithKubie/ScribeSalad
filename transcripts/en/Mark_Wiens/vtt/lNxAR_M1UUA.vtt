Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com,
and I came to Mumbai, India to eat.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.500
In this video I'm going to share with you
ten of the best Indian street foods that you

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.710
don't want to miss eating when you're in Mumbai.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.529
So keep watching this video for some incredibly
delicious Mumbai street food.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.310
Starting off at number one is vada pav, which
you’ll also commonly hear as vada pao.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.180
It's one of the ultimate Indian street foods
in Mumbai 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.890
that you will find across the entire city.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.340
It begins with a spiced mashed potato mixture,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.640
which is lightly battered and deep fried to a crisp.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.270
The potato patty gets packed into a fluffy
white bun, and then gets doused in a variety

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.820
of extremely flavorful chutneys.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.670
I'm not sure if this is a, if you push this
one down and then just kind of pick up the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.850
whole thing, I think you do.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.120
Oh wow.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.830
That is unbelievable.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.170
The real wow factor of this vada pao are the
different chutneys that are involved.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.170
Oh wow.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.970
That's like a salty, minty, spicy, just, powerfully
flavorful, delicious vegetarian sandwich.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.250
Aw, it's really good.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.320
Bhelpuri is the perfect Mumbai beach snack,
it’s crunchy, sour, sweet, salty, and spicy,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.150
and it just makes you want to keep eating
snacking and hanging out.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.520
There are many versions of bhelpuri, but it
often contains puffed rice, sev which are

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.279
fried little crispies made from chickepea
flour, stirred up with onions, tomatoes, dhania,

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:57.279
and a balance of salty, sweet, and spicy chutneys.

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:59.080
Once you start eating bhelpuri, you can’t
stop.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.009
For this one I'm going to take the lime and
squeeze it all over.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.729
It's kind of sweet and savory and crispy.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.920
Yah, it's tastes like rice crispies just mixed
with all sorts of sweet and tangy and spicy

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.380
and onions.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.480
Oh and there's some potatoes in there on the
bottom there too I think.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.290
Mmmmm.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.320
With that squeeze of lime, that's nice because
it contrasts that sweet tangy sauce.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.720
These little spoons are kind of flimsy.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.560
This is a good beach snack.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.090
Sev puri is a type of Mumbai chaat that happens
to be one of my personal favorites.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.590
A flat crunchy puri is topped with creamy
potatoes and onions, then it’s covered in

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.480
tamarind, chili and garlic chutney, sprinkled
with diced bits of sour mango, and finally

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.920
it's topped in a heaping handful of sev, which

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.840
are thin crispy noodles made from chickpea flour.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.440
If I take out the first one, hopefully we
can all see what is inside.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.540
Oh yah, the cross section.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.460
There are onions in there, and potatoes.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.800
Mmmmmm.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.440
Oh this is one of my favorite chaats.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.840
Mmm.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.070
That potato is so creamy, that it almost reminds
me of guacamole.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.960
It's like avocado almost.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.040
It burns your throat a little bit going down
and then you can taste the sweetness from

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.040
the chutney.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.730
It's so well balanced and that is an awesome
snack.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.379
It's like crunchy and juicy.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.600
These are right at that size where they are
almost too big to take a full bite, but then

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.850
at the same time you're just not sure if you
want to bite it in half and risk collapsing

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.360
the entire, the entire snack bite.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.020
I'll go with the one bite.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:17.329
Those chutneys, and then everything just collapses
in your mouth.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.769
Pav Bhaji is one of Mumbai’s most dominant
iconic street foods.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.490
It was originally invented in the 1850’s
by street food vendors who took an assortment

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.400
of leftover vegetables, mashed them all up
with some butter and spices like cumin and

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.290
turmeric, and served it with bread.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.040
Nowadays in Mumbai, pav bhaji is often prepared
on a giant hot griddle, the potatoes, tomatoes,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.660
and spices are mashed up into a puree, swooshed
around with butter and water until they reach

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.139
a saucy consistency and it’s served with
a buttered toasted roll to mop it all up.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.740
So it's the combination of pao which is a
bun like this, and the bhaji which is this

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.220
tomato potato puree with spices.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.200
You can feel the starchiness of the potato,
but then it has a really nice like tartness

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.870
from the tomato.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.520
And then, it's a little bit spicy, you can
taste that like blend of cumin and turmeric

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.040
in there as well.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.480
And then yah, you can taste the butter in
there quite well as well.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.240
That's a very buttery fluffy roll.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.680

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.960
Grilled meat is an essential street food,
and in Mumbai you’ll find some insanely

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.800
tempting delicacies roasted over charcoal.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.810
Along with chicken tikka, seekh kebabs, and
boti kebabs, rolls, which usually consist

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.669
of meat wrapped in bread are one of the greatest
on the go, or late night street food snacks.

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.240
In Mumbai you have to try the chicken bhuna
rolls.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.650
The rumali roti, a thin circular roti that’s
cooked on what looks like an upside down wok,

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.870
is cooked fresh and then stuffed with boneless
chicken in a wonderfully flavorful tomato

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.449
based gravy.

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.930
Actually I think I should not actually unravel
it, I think you're supposed to tear it, tear

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.850
so you don't lose any juices on the bottom.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.480
That bread.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.360
That bread is amazing.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.790
It's really very similar to a tortilla.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:48.750
Then that's like shredded chicken with kind
of a tomatoey spicy kind of yah, sauce.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.150
That is a comfort roll.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.430
What I am going to attempt to do though, is
add some more sauce and some onions.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.990
And scoop that on there.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.040
Oh yah.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.560
Chai, a tea beverage that’s consumed throughout
India, is one of the greatest street side

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.580
drinks.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.590
The black tea is usually brewed strong, mixed
with a generous ratio of creamy full fat milk,

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.919
sweetened with plenty of sugar, and it’s
often flavored with cardamom, ginger, or masala

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:25.630
to give it an extra boost.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.520
And it's always piping hot.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.280
Actually like burning hot, my fingers are
on fire right now.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.790
Oh, oh I have missed you.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:43.370
You can taste just a hint of spice in there,
and maybe a little bit of cardamom in there.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:50.610
And then it's creamy, it's just fantastic.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.320
Drinking cups of hot tea on the side of the
road is just one of the great joys of being

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.320
in India.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.010
Pani puri is an absolute genius of an Indian
street food snack.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.270
Not only is it delicious, but it’s refreshing,
and fun to eat.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.700
A small hole is poked into the top of a puri,
which is a hollow circular chip.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:15.930
It’s then typically half filled with a combination
of potatoes, chickpeas, onions, and spices.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.650
The puri then get’s dunked into flavored
water to fill the other half of the puri.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.610
You eat them by the single, and you've got
to eat them fast before they go soggy on you.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.720
Mmmmm.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.320
Oh it's amazing.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.450
It just explodes with like juices.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.390
It's salty, it's a little bit spicy.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:47.620
You can taste like a little bit of like a
minty freshness, and then you have like these

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.410
starchy chickpeas in there as well, all wrapped
up by like a hollow chip.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.700
Oh it's good.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.980
And once you finish one bite you get another
one.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.600
Thank you.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.970
Although not always a street food, Bombay
duck is one of the most iconic Mumbai foods,

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.430
and it’s something that you don’t want
to miss eating when you visit.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:25.340
Despite being called duck, it’s not actually
duck at all, but it’s a locally caught lizardfish,

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.260
which can be prepared in a number of different
ways, but it's commonly rubbed in semolina

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.020
flour, and deep fried.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.570
I got the whole thali, so it comes with a
number of different side dishes, including

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.240
rice and chapati, I think these are chapatis.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.050
And then some chutneys and curries.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.880
I'm going to try the bombil fry first.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.570
And you can see these are like little curly
sides of a fish.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.990
I think it's just a fillet side of the fish,
and then it is coated in some kind of coating

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.070
and then deep fried.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.170
That is extremely tender.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.650
That just like flakes apart.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.240
Wow that's good.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.710
That is salty and really really crispy.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:12.750
Ok I'll take that piece of bombil fish, and
mix it in to that rice.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.800
That's amazing.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.680
A sandwich is probably not the first thing
that comes to mind when you think about Indian

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.270
food, but when it comes to Mumbai street food,
sandwiches of many different combinations

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.860
and styles are very popular.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:39.610
The basic recipe calls for some layers of
vegetables like masala mashed potatoes, cucumber,

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:46.180
beetroot, red onions, tomatoes, some cheese,
and a few spreads of chutney for that incredible

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.180
flavor.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.350
I think the best way to eat a Mumbai street
sandwich is to order it toasted so it gets

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.280
crispy on the edges and warm all the way through.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.560
This sandwich was topped with some sev, and
then served with chutney and chili sauce on

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.560
the side.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.610
So this is a classic Indian Mumbai street
sandwich.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.940
Oh that is beautiful.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.850
Look at all those layers of vegetables.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.430
And this a vegetarian sandwich as well.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.440
But there is some cheese.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.480
I'm going to take this first wedge of sandwich
and I think I'll go in for some of that chutney.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.840
Oh and I'm losing some ingredients, oh well.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.340
Mmmmm.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.560
I can taste a little bit of cumin in there.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.370
And what I really like is that beet root.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.370
That's really good.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:42.980
The beet root is just soft and just sort of
dissolves and then you have the crunchy cucumber,

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:50.290
the crisp onion, and then the cheese, just
is melted and just wraps it all together.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.210
And then that like minty kind of chutney in
there as well.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.410
Although dosa is originally from South India,
it’s a street food you’ll find all over

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.730
Mumbai as well.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:09.720
A dosa begins with a fermented batter made
from rice and urad beans that’s swirled

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.650
into a circular motion on a hot griddle, and
fried until golden crispy.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:20.410
A traditional masala dosa is filled with spiced
potatoes and served with sambar and chutney

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:26.490
on the side, but in Mumbai you’ll find some
serious creative and fusion dosas that can

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.110
include all sorts of different flavors and
seasonings.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.020
Oh, and it's crispy and soft at the same time.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.899
And go in for all of that beautiful, it's
almost, yah it's kind of like a curry.

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:40.649
But I love how there are so many, so many
greens in there.

00:12:40.649 --> 00:12:42.890
I think there's green onions in there as well.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.800
Oh look at that, oh that looks incredible.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.840
Oh wow.

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:03.329
That is incredible.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800
Wow.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.110
It's just packed full of flavor.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:14.410
You've got the crispy sort of like spongy
but very thin like almost like crepe like

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:21.200
dosa, and then that curry, I cannot believe
how quickly and how masterfully he whipped

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.459
up that paneer tikka.

00:13:22.459 --> 00:13:26.930
I was expecting it to be good, but that is
incredible.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.660
