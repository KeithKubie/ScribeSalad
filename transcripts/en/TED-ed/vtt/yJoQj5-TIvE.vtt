00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:10.171
Can you grow a human bone
outside the human body?

00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.439
The answer may soon be yes,

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.327
but before we can understand
how that's possible,

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:19.479
we need to look at 
how bones grow naturally inside the body.

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:24.036
Most bones start in a growing fetus
as a soft, flexible cartilage.

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:27.914
Bone-forming cells replace the cartilage
with a spongy mineral lattice

00:00:27.914 --> 00:00:30.998
made of elements like calcium
and phosphate.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.315
This lattice gets harder,
as osteoblasts,

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:35.782
which are specialized bone-forming cells,

00:00:35.782 --> 00:00:39.285
deposit more mineral,
giving bones their strength.

00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:41.852
While the lattice itself
is not made of living cells,

00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:45.194
networks of blood vessels, nerves
and other living tissues

00:00:45.194 --> 00:00:47.885
grow through special channels
and passages.

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:49.463
And over the course of development,

00:00:49.463 --> 00:00:52.417
a legion of osteoblasts
reinforce the skeleton

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:54.749
that protects our organs, 
allows us to move,

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.345
produces blood cells and more.

00:00:57.345 --> 00:00:59.598
But this initial building process alone

00:00:59.598 --> 00:01:03.158
is not enough to make bones 
strong and functional.

00:01:03.158 --> 00:01:04.774
If you took a bone built this way,

00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:06.733
attached muscles to it,

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.274
and tried to use it 
to lift a heavy weight,

00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:13.023
the bone would probably snap
under the strain.

00:01:13.023 --> 00:01:14.823
This doesn't usually happen to us

00:01:14.823 --> 00:01:17.232
because our cells 
are constantly reinforcing

00:01:17.232 --> 00:01:19.824
and building bone wherever they're used,

00:01:19.824 --> 00:01:23.235
a principle we refer to as Wolff's Law.

00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:26.284
However, bone materials 
are a limited resource

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:28.374
and this new, reinforcing bone

00:01:28.374 --> 00:01:32.545
can be formed only if 
there is enough material present.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:35.851
Fortunately, osteoblasts, the builders,

00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:40.347
have a counterpart 
called osteoclasts, the recyclers.

00:01:40.347 --> 00:01:44.619
Osteoclasts break down the unneeded
mineral lattice using acids and enzymes

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.472
so that osteoblasts can then 
add more material.

00:01:48.472 --> 00:01:52.333
One of the main reasons astronauts
must exercise constantly in orbit

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:56.847
is due to the lack of skeletal strain
in free fall.

00:01:56.847 --> 00:01:58.907
As projected by Wolff's Law,

00:01:58.907 --> 00:02:02.554
that makes osteoclasts more active
than osteoblasts,

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:06.148
resulting in a loss 
of bone mass and strength.

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:09.263
When bones do break, your body
has an amazing ability

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:13.854
to reconstruct the injured bone
as if the break had never happened.

00:02:13.854 --> 00:02:16.515
Certain situations, like cancer removal,

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:18.213
traumatic accidents,

00:02:18.213 --> 00:02:23.282
and genetic defects exceed the body's 
natural ability for repair.

00:02:23.282 --> 00:02:27.490
Historical solutions have included
filling in the resulting holes with metal,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.088
animal bones,

00:02:29.088 --> 00:02:31.630
or pieces of bone from human donors,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.028
but none of these are optimal
as they can cause infections

00:02:35.028 --> 00:02:37.633
or be rejected by the immune system,

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:41.451
and they can't carry out most 
of the functions of healthy bones.

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:46.359
An ideal solution would be to grow a bone
made from the patient's own cells

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.710
that's customized to 
the exact shape of the hole,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.978
and that's exactly what scientists 
are currently trying to do.

00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:55.873
Here's how it works.

00:02:55.873 --> 00:02:59.863
First, doctors extract stem cells from
a patient's fat tissue

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:05.178
and take CT scans to determine
the exact dimensions of the missing bone.

00:03:05.178 --> 00:03:07.603
They then model the exact 
shape of the hole,

00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:08.918
either with 3D printers,

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:12.127
or by carving decellularized cow bones.

00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:14.803
Those are the bones where all of the cells
have been stripped away,

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:18.219
leaving only the sponge-like 
mineral lattice.

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.114
They then add the patient's stem cells
to this lattice

00:03:21.114 --> 00:03:23.099
and place it in a bioreactor,

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.876
a device that will simulate all 
of the conditions found inside the body.

00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:31.017
Temperature, humidity, acidity
and nutrient composition

00:03:31.017 --> 00:03:34.558
all need to be just right for
the stem cells to differentiate

00:03:34.558 --> 00:03:36.927
into osteoblasts and other cells,

00:03:36.927 --> 00:03:38.729
colonize the mineral lattice,

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.873
and remodel it with living tissue.

00:03:41.873 --> 00:03:43.645
But there's one thing missing.

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:45.312
Remember Wolff's Law?

00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:48.140
An artificial bone needs 
to experience real stress,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.093
or else it will come out weak and brittle,

00:03:51.093 --> 00:03:54.655
so the bioreactor constantly pumps
fluids around the bone,

00:03:54.655 --> 00:03:59.496
and the pressure tells the osteoblasts
to add bone density.

00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:02.113
Put all of this together,
and within three weeks,

00:04:02.113 --> 00:04:04.990
the now living bone is ready 
to come out of the bioreactor

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.018
and to be implanted 
into the patient's body.

00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:11.580
While it isn't yet certain that 
this method will work for humans,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.462
lab grown bones have already been
successfully implanted in pigs

00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:17.126
and other animals,

00:04:17.126 --> 00:04:20.655
and human trials may begin
as early as 2016.
