1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.950
Will happen.
The Joe Rogan experience,
do you think the meek will inherit,

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.850
inherit the earth?

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.560
You think if that was a prophecy that they would be talking about technologists,

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.940
they would be talking about like the people that run Twitter and Google and

5
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:18.810
Facebook and the Internet tech people,
which is,

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.050
if you think about like the amount of money that Facebook has,

7
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:24.300
the amount of money that youtube has.
So like these,

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.490
these enormously influential tech companies.
Even Amazon,
right?
Yeah.

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.210
Like who,
who are they?
Who are they?
These are nerds.

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.480
They're nerds or super aggressive and they're very thoughtful.

11
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.720
Nerves are very competitive nerds.
So I don't consider them the meek,
I think.

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.190
I think who's the mate?
So I think the mic,
the,
the philosophy behind that,

13
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.870
and I,
and I,

14
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:49.590
and I think the United States also works on this premise in a sense is the

15
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.424
American dream.

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.150
So what keeps the masses from rising up and taking the money from people who die

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.100
the have nots from taking money from the haves and especially when the halves,

18
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.321
you know,
are,

19
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:07.800
are rather slim in number in comparison to the large proportion of the

20
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.350
population necessarily.
That's $500 in the bank.
Well,

21
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:11.640
what's great about the United States,

22
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:14.790
what's always worked about the United States we use,
we don't have these,

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the French revolution in this country is because the American dream is about

24
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.960
potential.
There is a potential,
I may not have money now,

25
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.160
but I may and I will because I know I will because I'm an optimist.

26
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.480
I will be in the 1% eventually I got an idea,
bro.

27
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.650
I'm telling you that's a great idea and people need that hope.

28
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.560
Will you take that hope away?
You take the ability,

29
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:45.561
you take the idea that there's no way I can ever isteam out of my condition.

30
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.290
You better be careful.
That's what,
that's,
that's so potential.

31
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.560
The potential to be better,
the potential to be wealthier.
That.

32
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.020
Think about how all of us,
a lot of us as we're,

33
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.050
as we get older for doing this with them equal,
inherit the earth man.

34
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.850
I think it's in that era that people that aren't creating war was probably the

35
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.310
people that were left over.
No,
I think it's a Wacky,
a pizza.
No,
I think it's,

36
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.480
I think it's a way of getting people to at least live with the fact that I'm a

37
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:16.230
surf.
I'm a peasant.
I have no way to steam out of my condition,

38
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.840
but at least I have the afterlife.

39
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.960
At least I know that if I live and I suffer well and I suffer quietly and I

40
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:27.330
suffer with dignity,
there will be a reward after this.

41
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.550
What is the conventional definition or the conventional meaning to that

42
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.350
statement?
The meek will inherit the earth.

43
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.490
Like what or how to scholars interpret that?
Well,
religious,
right,
right,
right.

44
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.250
But I mean how do they,
how do they interpret that?
Like what?
What is,

45
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.700
I think it's in the same vein as,
it's harder for a camel to pastor the,

46
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:48.060
an eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the Kingdom of heaven.
So,

47
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:51.630
so you know that the famous story where when Christ said,

48
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.430
did you want to follow me to the rich guy?
He said,

49
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.210
give up all your money in the rich guy turn hung his head and walked away and he

50
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.040
said,
poor guy,
it's so hard for,

51
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.460
for the rich to get to give up their life of privilege is very difficult.

52
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.270
Do you think Jesus was a real person?
Historically?

53
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:11.770
I think there was probably a rabbi named Jesus of Nazareth,
Nazareth.
That's what,

54
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.250
that's what that seems to be the conclusion among a lot of historians.

55
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.900
And he was a radical rabbi.

56
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.920
He was a radical man cause he's simplified Judaism is really what he was.

57
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.640
He was simplifying Judaism to say,
look,
you know,

58
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.260
you could follow the book of Leviticus and all the rituals it takes to become a

59
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:29.770
good Jew,

60
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.190
which is there's a certain way to quarter a calf and there's a certain way,

61
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:36.040
certain things you can eat and you have to bathe and you have to do all these

62
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.200
rituals,
and he said,
way too complicated.

63
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:42.070
We're never going to spread the word this way.
He said,
just make it simple.
Do it.

64
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.950
Rabbi Hillel said in the Old Testament,

65
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.840
do onto others as you'd have them do onto you and hold only one.
God is your God.

66
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:53.330
You know the father so that we're all of the idea of a model of a,

67
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.490
of a monolithic God is that there's a,
there's one father,

68
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.960
we're all brothers and sisters.

69
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.050
That way we're all have the same moral worth that way.

70
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:06.430
I can't judge you that way.
I don't know what you're worth.
Only God does.
I Dunno.

71
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.460
I Dunno where you have,
I don't know what your value is.
You're a human being.

72
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:13.990
I can't quantify that.
I think.
I think that's a beautiful thing.

73
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.440
I think we all benefit from that religious and that Judeo Christian idea whether

74
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:22.060
we know it or not.
And if you want to replace that,

75
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.110
my only issue with atheists is if you want to try to replace that irrational

76
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:30.850
idea,
that irrational idea that we're all the same moral worth.

77
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:34.180
Cause you can't prove it.
But if you mathematically or biologically,

78
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.740
but what are you gonna replace that with?
Rationality.
You want to try,

79
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.960
you want to,
you want to run a law society on rationality.
You can't do that.

80
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.840
Well if that's the most dangerous idea in the works,

81
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.320
this is still the most dangerous idea in the world because ethics have to be

82
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:52.150
predicated.
There's gotta be bedrock [inaudible] idea in the world.

83
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.500
Well cause let me give you an example.

84
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.710
It's very rational mathematically to suggest that anybody who is mentally

85
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.130
handicapped is draining resources from our gifted children.

86
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.030
And I'm telling you now in a lot of science history would have who live in

87
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:07.451
abundance.

88
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:09.520
It's around new people to take care of the people that are handicapped.

89
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.220
Cause a button says no always last and you can't predict abundance.

90
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.330
And a lot of times there is here right now.
Not really.
Not for a lot of people.

91
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.610
It'd be,
it'd be very easy to justify.

92
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.980
If you are just prayed to the god of rationality,

93
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:25.570
it'd be very easy to justify it.
And people have done this in history,

94
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:27.160
which is what I worry about.
Sure.
Hey,

95
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:29.860
let's get rid of all the people that are draining our resources because they're

96
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.620
not,
they're hopeless anyway.
People on breathing machines,

97
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.210
people who are severely retarded,
whatever,
they are severely handicapped.
Um,

98
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.460
they're draining resource.
I know you love him,
but listen,

99
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.250
we need this money for over here.
You're in a hospital,
you're taking money,

100
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.330
the very old,
the very enforced.

101
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.400
So you think we need religion to keep you from taking people off life support?

102
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.990
Well,
I,

103
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.990
I will say that I think religion and specifically the Judeo Christian ethic,

104
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:58.670
and I include Islam in that.
Um,
and by the way,
I mean Buddhism is,

105
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.300
it talks about the sacredness of the ascension being these,

106
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:06.170
these religions are there because,
and I think we benefit from it.

107
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.180
I think that all of us,
I mean where does our justice system is predicated?

108
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.780
It's predicated on the idea that all men are created equal.
We benefit from it,

109
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.790
but there's also real problems with it.
Of course,
real problems with any idea,

110
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.360
but be careful in what you,
but what do you take it away.

111
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.040
Stand is why you think you can't be replaced with logic and reason because logic

112
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.640
and reason has pitfalls,
but you're cause there's nothing logical.
Hold on.

113
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:32.930
You see,
assuming that logic and reason doesn't also have compassion.
So like you,

114
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:35.540
you wouldn't have compassion for the people that are mentally handicapped.

115
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.260
Oh it does.
It does.
It's too fickle.
What I'm trying to say is this,

116
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.880
there's something very irrational and very religious about the idea that all men

117
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:44.714
are created equal.

118
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.300
That we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal.

119
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:50.570
Right.
And Yuval Harari talks about this brilliantly in his book,

120
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.100
which is that you cannot prove mathematically or biologically that,

121
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.800
that the idea that all men are created equal because that seasons are the new

122
00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:03.140
book sapiens is,
is real.
Right?
So,
so because we're not,
again,

123
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:05.400
Lebron James,
if he's standing next to me isn't,

124
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.690
we're not equally as my chocolate avatar.
Right.
So,

125
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.670
but we inherently know that our humanness,

126
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.080
our uh,
human s you're not equal physically.

127
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:22.860
He's a super athlete.
But I'm funny or I have my own gifts to suck.

128
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.710
Yeah.
If he went on stage and murdered.

129
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.770
But there are a few things like Eddie Murphy 2.0 there are people that are

130
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:30.320
better,
but w w but I won't suck though.
Yes,

131
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.230
he was Lebron James and he was funnier than you.
Well,
he's not a bad actor.

132
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:35.660
I'll tell you that much.
Imagine if he was really funny.

133
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.370
Like if you couldn't follow him,
that's when I give them my girl.

134
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:42.400
He imagine that though I would present him with my girl.
Six foot what?

135
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.070
1186 nine six nine six foot,

136
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.690
two 65 bill.
Like a god faster than everybody in stronger than amazing.

137
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.480
And again,
orders on stage at the store

138
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.890
and when you hit the mic,
you have to go like this to get the Mike.
That's right.

139
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.040
Bring it down to you because you have to go on after him.

140
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.970
And that's when I say to him,
he's got it in the mic stand.

141
00:08:02.971 --> 00:08:06.320
It's fucking seven feet in the air.
Yeah.
And I go,
Mr Mr. James,

142
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.670
I'd like to be a traveling concubine.
I'm probably not your ties and want that.

143
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.460
I'm not your type.
No,
you're useless.
I'll take culinary.
I'll take Connor classes.

144
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.030
Let me Cook for,
you know he's got people that shut the fuck up.

145
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:19.610
They carry the bag.
Polish your shoes.
They're too annoying,
man.

146
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:21.590
What are you going to do?
You gonna Stare at his dick off connect.

147
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.340
Ask them questions about what a man he is.
This is weird.
What do you squat?

148
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.180
Leave him alone.
Okay,
I'll just be in Nicholson.
Write better jokes.
It's just,

149
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.820
sir,
I'd like to be a gimp.
That would be so embarrassing.

150
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.570
Like if a guy was that good at basketball,

151
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:41.930
but then it was like a natural at comedy there,

152
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.450
they're all started murdering in harmony.
Like,
or like a fighter like wood.

153
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:50.550
If Terrence Crawford Tyler to be the funniest fucking dude in the world.

154
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.210
American.
Imagine.
You know,

155
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.280
and he not just fucks people up in the ring,

156
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.730
but then Terrance Crawford starts doing sets the comedy store and murdering and

157
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.670
he's got a Netflix special and he's murdering and you're like,
no.
Oh,

158
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.420
give him,
he goes so good at these things.
I don't know man.
But listen,

159
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:12.090
there are people that are better at everything sometimes.
I mean there are,

160
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.420
well there's def look,
but,
but,
but we,
Ilan Musk is a good example of that.

161
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.290
How many fucking things can that guy do at once,
but at the same time,

162
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.950
what I'm saying is that you can't quantify human being because you don't know

163
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:24.720
what their potential is and you don't know where they're strong.

164
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.810
Like if Lebron James Murders on stage,

165
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.250
he's better than you following me.
He's better than you at everything.

166
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.830
Fucking Bert following you.
You've got to follow him.

167
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.980
He's gonna murder and then the king has left the building lasers.

168
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.220
You gotta drop the Mike and walk away.
Yeah,

169
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.770
they have problem and then you've got to go on.

170
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.600
It can't be that good at two things,
right?

171
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.600
I mean who says least sides or how much do you put it?

172
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.930
[inaudible] two things.
Like three times.
As much as let's listen to me.

173
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.870
What if he puts the kind of effort that he puts into getting good at basketball

174
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:02.160
and he couldn't go to at stand up different muscle.
Yeah.
One muscles.
Lazy.

175
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.060
One muscle doesn't really write and work and like for the amount of hours that

176
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:09.480
we work on our craft versus the amount of basketball player has to practice

177
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:11.420
different.
Listen.
Oh,
he's smart.

178
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.650
<v 1>This is Blake Griffin.
He's been trying to do stand up in the off season.</v>

179
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.970
Last couple of years more.
When he was living in La,
he got traded to Detroit now,

180
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:22.740
so it's a little bit harder for them probably,
but doing good.
He's good.
Yeah.

181
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.900
I mean from what I've heard from,

182
00:10:23.901 --> 00:10:27.100
I've heard people that have seen videos of it is there you go motherfucker.

183
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.670
<v 0>Correct.
Yep.
So he can look at six 10 guy doesn't care.
It's a long road.</v>

184
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.060
We'll see in 10 years.
Can work though some if he does it.

185
00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:40.061
Look what I'm saying is like you take a guy who has the kind of discipline and

186
00:10:41.121 --> 00:10:44.510
work ethic that an athlete does at the highest level of the game.
Yeah.

187
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.990
Apply that standup comic.
I bet they'll get further than a lot of us.
