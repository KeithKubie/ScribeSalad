things like makes sense but then it's
 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.610 align:start position:0%
things like makes sense but then it's

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
weird because there would be giant
 

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.469 align:start position:0%

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.580 align:start position:0%
like really fight against that if that
 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
like really fight against that if that
were<00:08:04.760><c> the</c><00:08:04.820><c> case</c><00:08:05.120><c> so</c><00:08:05.599><c> that</c><00:08:05.750><c> was</c><00:08:05.840><c> a</c><00:08:05.870><c> little</c><00:08:06.110><c> odd</c>

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:06.169 align:start position:0%

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:09.289 align:start position:0%

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
all in all I think I'm so caught up on

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.010 align:start position:0%
them I guess the extreme it is of it
 

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.219 align:start position:0%
them I guess the extreme it is of it
that<00:08:13.220><c> don't</c><00:08:13.669><c> make</c><00:08:13.970><c> sense</c><00:08:14.030><c> to</c><00:08:14.330><c> me</c><00:08:14.449><c> because</c><00:08:14.599><c> the</c>

00:08:15.219 --> 00:08:15.229 align:start position:0%
that don't make sense to me because the
 

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:17.620 align:start position:0%
that don't make sense to me because the
movie<00:08:15.500><c> itself</c><00:08:15.800><c> was</c><00:08:15.979><c> pretty</c><00:08:16.160><c> boring</c><00:08:16.630><c> there</c>

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:17.630 align:start position:0%
movie itself was pretty boring there
 

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
