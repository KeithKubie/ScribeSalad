[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:15.300
JULIEN FINLAY: So
as I said, this talk

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.310
is about body positivity.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.310
This talk is about online hate.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.060
And this talk is
also about know how

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.600
to create online, how
to absorb what you

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.150
receive when you create online.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.740
You may see three
people on stage.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.810
You were expecting
maybe a fourth one.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.640
But things happen, and
Stephen cannot join us today,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.640
unfortunately.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.789
He's supporting another, I
think, broadcasting radio show

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.830
that's happening at the
same time, which is fine.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.170
It gives us more time to
talk and meet each other.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.700
So yeah, so as we think of
the tech companies as a whole

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.380
and what they bring
to the minorities,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.150
they can be seen as a connector.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.680
They can be seen as a medium.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.620
If you think of
YouTube, how they

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.020
have videos to explain
and to show to trans kids,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.970
hey, how to do
stuff, how to prepare

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.360
your voice, and et cetera.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.650
Or how do you think about
WhatsApp as connecting

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.661
in some countries, like
Chechnya or Brazil,

00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:13.910
when you actually-- it's the
only media, social media,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.060
it would be active.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.290
Or if you think of dating
apps, like Grindr and et

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.670
cetera, where you
would put yourself out

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.100
there but not sure
how you receive

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.780
what's going to be back.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.610
So that's on my mind today.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.960
I want to talk about creation.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.780
I want to talk about the
hate and the backlash.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.470
I also want to mention this
week is Trans Awareness Week.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.150
And I'm delighted having a
diverse panel, willingly.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.430
Like we had Bella
in June, who is

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.570
a bisexual-- amazing,
fierce woman.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.167
And she is white.

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:45.250
And this is a white panel.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.570
But I also want to
have diverse voice.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.070
So then again, I'm
very happy having

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.380
this group present on here.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.880
All right.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.120
So we're here.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.910
We have time.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.840
We'll have some wine.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.440
We'll have some
non-alcoholic Prosecco.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.380
I couldn't make
this sentence gayer.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.680
And yeah, so that's that.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.509
I think I can leave you all
introduce yourselves and share

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.400
whatever you want to do
right now in your intro.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.342
Aoife, go ahead.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:15.050
AOIFE MARTIN: Hi.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.130
My name is Aoife Martin.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.830
I'm a senior software
engineer with MasterCard.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.550
And I transitioned
about two years ago.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.200
So since then, I've been
quite an outspoken advocates

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.940
for trans rights and
for trans people.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.770
And whenever I can, I sort of
volunteer my time to do talks.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.210
I write articles
about trans issues.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.160
And I'm quite active on social
media about trans issues.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.960
So yeah, I'm quite passionate
about trans rights.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.744
I think I was just speaking
to Finley in the green room,

00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:54.410
I suppose you would
call it, back there.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.970
And trans rights are now where
gay rights were 20 years ago.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.720
So I think we still
have a long way to go.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.060
I mean, we've come a
long way in this country.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.935
But there's still an
awful lot of work to do.

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:07.769
And it's a pleasure to
be here and to be talking

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.810
with you guys about this.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.270
And hopefully, we'll all
learn something together.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.895
And we'll have a
bit of fun doing so.

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:15.394
JULIEN FINLAY: Welcome.

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:16.310
How about you, Finlay?

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.460
We had to change the
chairs for reasons.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.890
FINLAY WILSON: A little bit.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.810
JULIEN FINLAY: It's true
what they say, is it?

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.160
FINLAY WILSON: Let's
not get into that.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.710
That's a very gendered question.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.626
If I ask this to the
females in the room, what

00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:34.100
do you wear underneath, I
would get in a lot of trouble.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.955
So you watch yourself, Aoife.

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:38.830
So my name is Finlay.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.200
I am a yoga teacher in Scotland.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.200
I also am on social media a lot,
more than I probably should.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.820
I create content
for BBC The Social.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.570
So I create little videos about
things that are motivating me.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.147
But more importantly,
the BBC have

00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:55.230
allowed me to have a voice
to speak about whatever

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.820
I want to speak
about, which is great,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.950
even though sometimes
they tell me to shut up--

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.160
a lot.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.930
But that's fine.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.860
I just take to my Instagram and
write the same thing anyway.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.320
And that's obviously opened up a
whole realm of social scenarios

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.760
that are incredibly anti-social.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.370
I've kind of come out of
that, of being a creative that

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.220
does things online that
is visually present online

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.070
but also who shares their
relationship openly online.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.200
That came out as if my
relationship is open.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.404
That is not true.

00:04:23.404 --> 00:04:25.320
So those of you who are
going to Instagram me,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.030
and it's like, oh,
I thought Instragram

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.450
is an open relationship.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.980
No.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.813
JULIEN FINLAY: [INAUDIBLE]
on Instagrammers.

00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:33.540
FINLAY WILSON: That always,
always, even this morning--

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.800
anyway, that's another topic.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.410
Thank goodness for the filter
folder of the DM on Instagram.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.990
Where was I going with that?

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.020
JULIEN FINLAY: You
were opening your--

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.853
FINLAY WILSON: Yeah.

00:04:44.853 --> 00:04:48.070
So I share my daily interactions
with my partner, my dogs,

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.030
and things online.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.190
And I don't think it's
anything exceptional.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.290
But it is a thing of visibility.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.100
But when people go after
that and try and attack it

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.980
for whatever their
bigoted reasons are,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.970
I will not stand for it.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.520
So maybe that's a thing.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.500
JULIEN FINLAY: Well, it's
the thing today, definitely.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.490
All right.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.190
So I come from an
academic background.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.650
And I think before talking
about all these words,

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.620
I'd like to just pause
and have some definitions.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.500
So when we talk
about cyberbullying,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.450
we talk about using
the technology

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.050
to harass, embarrass,
or target a person.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.000
Usually, we mention
cyberbullying

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.300
when it's referred to
young kids or teenagers.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.900
But we can also talk
about cyber harassment.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.010
And it is a crime.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.080
And there's legal consequences--

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.944
to which extent, we
will discuss these.

00:05:41.944 --> 00:05:46.760
Regarding online
hate, that's just--

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.930
name calls itself.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.970
You know, it's a
speech online full

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:57.110
of hate to attack based on
attributes, these attributes--

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.850
religion, ethnic
origin, sexuality,

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.170
et cetera, or gender.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.600
And finally, body
positivity, which I guess

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.160
is the one we'd
like to focus more

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.900
about at the end of the day.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.830
There's hate.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.034
There's harassment.

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:10.700
But there's also great
things out there.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.560
And there's also great support.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.310
And there's great movements.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.710
And this is something I
would like also to tackle.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.570
All right.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:26.159
I want to kick off with
a nice, relaxing video.

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.450
You can see I'm in a very
relaxing state of mind today.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.330
I don't know why.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.990
I may collapse.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.940
Haven't taken Valium
yet, but let's go.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.060
So you OK if I
show this, Finlay?

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.060
FINLAY WILSON: Aye, yes.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.200
JULIEN FINLAY: So that's what
brought Finlay here somehow.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.140
It's a domino effect.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.560
FINLAY WILSON: It will only
give me one view, though.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.820
JULIEN FINLAY: Oh, yeah.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.680
All of you, connect
your phones and give him

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.010
more like then 10 views.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.510
All right.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.196
So let's have a look.

00:06:49.196 --> 00:06:51.188
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

know [INAUDIBLE]..

JULIEN FINLAY: Nothing
levels the playing field more

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.936
than everyone in the room
having just seen your arse.

00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:43.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.900
JULIEN FINLAY: Anyway, so--

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.592
pleasure.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.550
So you saw that video--

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.650
FINLAY WILSON: That's
[INAUDIBLE] version.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.025
JULIEN FINLAY:
--which is online.

00:07:52.025 --> 00:07:56.140
But it has been seen more than
50 million times, that video.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.940
And it is jolly.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.490
It is motivating.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.600
It has good words--
connectivity, connectedness,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.820
positivity-- on it.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.950
It did link to homophobic
slurs and attack.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.020
It has driven you
out of your house.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.052
So how do you feel about this?

00:08:16.052 --> 00:08:17.510
When this beautiful
video was made,

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.390
you were not expecting such
a consequence, I assume.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.150
FINLAY WILSON: Not to
the extent that I got--

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:25.990
we were prepared.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.980
So when we launched into
creating content for BBC,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.742
it was just like
little segments.

00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:33.700
You record it yourself.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.419
You edit it yourself.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:35.200
You send it in.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.669
And they put it out there.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.864
We were told there would
be some negative stuff that

00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:40.530
would come back.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.982
There would always be trolls.

00:08:41.982 --> 00:08:43.690
And we were told,
like, oh, we can always

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.680
speak to them about it.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.840
But it actually turned out
to be 72 million views later,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.480
that's not going to be
all positive people that

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.060
are watching that, especially
the second one, which

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.940
had a little bit more
man-on-man action.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.592
That one got a lot more negative
feedback and a lot less views.

00:09:02.592 --> 00:09:05.050
Because people were suddenly
uncomfortable because they saw

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.580
us physically connecting.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.130
Now he's a straight guy.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.440
But as soon as they saw even
just my hand on his shoulder,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.430
the tone was
completely different.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.860
And actually, it
was more that one,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.440
which was released maybe about
a month and a half after.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.120
That's the one that I think
started the campaign of people

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.020
getting in touch directly and
being very abrupt, to the point

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.600
that the people who were
living in my building

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.040
took it upon themselves to
threaten to not only hurt me,

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.810
but also threatened
to kill my dog.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.190
And then it was failed to be
processed by the police, who

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.530
failed in their investigations
and didn't really look

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.030
into it, even though,
ironically, it

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.270
was Hate Crime Awareness
Week in Scotland,

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.760
that the police sanctioned.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.110
They were the ones putting
the posters everywhere.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.000
They did nothing.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.520
And I was told to shut up by
the chief of Scottish police

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.410
about the issue.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.490
So obviously, I didn't.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.600
I went public on BBC The
Social and made it very clear.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.580
I read parts of the letter out
and basically asked people--

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.960
well, it was more that
I was sick of everyone--

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.090
the police, the people I
was speaking to-- saying,

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.690
we didn't think this happened
anymore, as if that made it OK,

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.710
as if, like, no, this
doesn't happen anymore.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.340
This is an exceptional
circumstance.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.520
But when I then took
the list of, well, this

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.440
is what's being
said online, this

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.480
isn't an exceptional
circumstance.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.280
This is not a one-off scenario.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.150
This is every day.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.600
But now it's at my
actual doorstep, threats

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.220
being made against
even my animal,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.670
you know, my little
furry friend.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.320
That's not OK.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.490
That then escalated.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.290
So in the same
building, I started

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.360
dating my partner, who
is still my partner, not

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.070
an open relationship.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.880
And his tires got slashed
outside our property.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.090
And all the bays are marked.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.760
So they knew which
one was our car.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.050
So our tires got slashed.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.730
It never got investigated.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.840
They never looked into it.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.610
Nobody came round to check.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.770
We reported it, but
nothing happened.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.060
So this feeling
of oppressive hate

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.460
was strong enough
that I had to leave

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.680
home, move somewhere else.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.029
And that is very--

00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:20.070
it feels very disgusting.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.280
But it certainly hasn't
stopped me creating content.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.410
Because it wasn't the content's
fault. And it wasn't my fault,

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.560
either.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.840
It was bigotry.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.860
It was lack of education.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.620
But it was also a
lack of people's--

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.390
without using the
term mindfulness

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.122
to see the damage
that they're doing.

00:11:43.122 --> 00:11:45.110
JULIEN FINLAY: I hear you.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.050
I'm sorry it happened to you.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.716
FINLAY WILSON: Well,
the strangest thing

00:11:48.716 --> 00:11:51.120
is the strangest allies
come out of the woodwork.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.660
There's a guy who I teach at
my yoga studio who I was like,

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.630
ah, did not want to teach him--

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.530
complete prejudice.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.363
I'm just going to go
right ahead and say it.

00:11:58.363 --> 00:12:00.910
But when you see a guy
come in, muscle belt,

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.530
shaved head, like legit SS
Nazi tattoos on his arms,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.100
you would--

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.640
you know?

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.600
I'm on his kill list.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.450
I usually would step
back and be like, oh.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.880
He was the one driving
me home at night

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.540
to make sure I got home
safe, so unexpected allies.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.100
He is obviously no longer
a Nazi sympathizer.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.870
He's very much a very
changed creature.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.980
But--

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.600
JULIEN FINLAY: Let
me go back on the--

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.100
FINLAY WILSON: --he's an
interesting little social

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.140
feature, who yoga and
mindfulness actually

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.230
brought him to stand as an
ally for me, which was lovely.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.980
JULIEN FINLAY: OK.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.060
I think Nazian allyship--

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.390
FINLAY WILSON: That's
a different thing.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.015
JULIEN FINLAY: --could
be a great talk.

00:12:38.015 --> 00:12:39.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.850
But thank you for
sharing this, Finlay.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.910
And when I think of reaction
of putting yourself out there,

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.950
I know Aoife, you had
a different experience

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.520
whenever you came out at work.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.800
I'd like you, if you're OK,
sharing this story of you

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.600
coming out at work
at MasterCard,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.370
but also somehow comparing this
reaction you had when you came

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.640
out at work to when you
were maybe coming out,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.160
talking more about
your coming out online.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.400
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah, sure.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.050
So it was about two years ago.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.440
Actually, it was 2016,
where I came out as Aoife.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.539
I mean, I spoke to my HR
manager before I came out.

00:13:20.539 --> 00:13:22.080
And at that time,
I h ad been working

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.460
with MasterCard for about
four years at that stage.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.690
And so I told her
that I was transgender

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.240
and that I wanted to transition
within the workplace.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.330
And needless to say, I
think this was quite a shock

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.240
for my HR manager.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.500
And she'd be the first
person to admit that.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.990
And I think she
said at that time

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.210
that she didn't know if we
had any policies in place.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.400
She'd never encountered this
in her HR career before.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.858
She'd never
encountered anybody who

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:49.110
was transgender and didn't know
basically how to sort of handle

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.840
the situation.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.050
But the first thing she did
was she gave me a hug and says,

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:53.550
yep.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.990
OK, we'll do this.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.400
Let's get through this week.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.820
And we agreed that we
would meet every week

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.870
to sort of plan out a sort of
a roadmap, where things that--

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:09.300
who would I tell, when would
I tell them, badge changes,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.540
email address changes, all
these sort of little things

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.000
that you have to think about
if you're coming back to work

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.749
from one gender to another.

00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:19.290
And you know, I'd
love to say that it

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.780
was a difficult process,
and we had to fight battles,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.980
and we knew we were
really strong about it.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.400
But to be honest,
it was quite easy.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.240
I mean, changing my
name on the system

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.920
was just me logging into one
of our software applications

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.220
and just changing my name.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.511
And it just filtered down
through the system, you know?

00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:40.620
So it was quite easy
in that respect.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:47.330
And we agreed that I would come
back to work in January, 2016,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.680
as Aoife.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.340
And I said, well, who
do we need to tell?

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.720
What way do we want
to handle this?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.701
And we agreed that I would tell
some colleagues and some team

00:14:57.701 --> 00:14:58.200
members.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.650
I would tell my manager.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.400
But that was it.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.900
We didn't need to
tell anybody else,

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.620
because it was nobody
else's business.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.360
You know, if somebody
comes out as gay,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.290
you don't go, oh, let's announce
it to the entire company.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.790
So there was no
big announcement,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.860
that, oh, Aoife is
coming back in January.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.910
And she will be a
different person.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.690
So it was quite easy
in that respect.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.277
I mean, also word of
mouth will get around.

00:15:22.277 --> 00:15:23.610
The grapevine will do its thing.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.647
And people are going
to find out, so--

00:15:26.647 --> 00:15:28.230
JULIEN FINLAY: And
when you come back?

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.190
AOIFE MARTIN: And when I
came back in January, 2016,

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.960
I clearly remember
my first day back.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.460
I was very, very nervous.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.500
And only a handful of people
knew this was happening.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.230
And I got into the
office very early.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.737
And I sat behind my monitor,
just like I sort of just

00:15:43.737 --> 00:15:46.320
crouched down and just sort of
hoped most people wouldn't even

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.090
notice.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.490
And a friend of mine said,
well, I hope your day is just

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:51.172
weirdly normal.

00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:52.630
And I said, if it's
weirdly normal,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.510
I'll be happy with
that, you know?

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.331
And a few people come
over throughout the day

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:59.580
who had known this was
happening, just to wish me luck

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.170
and to say, well
done sort of thing.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.740
And then when I came back
from lunch on that day,

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.510
there was a big bunch of
flowers that my HR manager

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:11.620
had arranged to send, which was
such a lovely, lovely touch.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.410
I wasn't expecting it at all.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.050
And it said, from
everyone at MasterCard,

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.940
accept these flowers
to us, which was

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.260
such a lovely, sweet message.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.260
And I took a photo
of the flowers.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.940
And I put this on Twitter.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.719
And the reaction was huge.

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.760
We had an interview with
the "Irish Independent."

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.560
We spoke on a program on
Newstalk for a documentary.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.360
And it just went viral.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.630
So that's where my
activism started

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.092
to kick in and where I
thought, OK, I can actually

00:16:39.092 --> 00:16:40.050
make a difference here.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.120
I can actually try and
speak about transitions

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.690
and make people aware
of these issues.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:49.230
So their of reaction
was very, very positive.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.640
Online reaction has been
negative and positive as well.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.370
So it just varies from who's
sort of doing it, you know?

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.720
I mean, I can talk about
the negative stuff now

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.320
if you want or--

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.361
JULIEN FINLAY: Please do.

00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:02.940
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah,
so I initially,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.890
before I came out in
MasterCard, I sort of

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.540
came out on Twitter before.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.579
And that was hugely
positive for me.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.619
And a lot of people were
very, very accepting.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.240
But then, of course, there are
people who aren't as accepting.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.829
And like I remember
once, waking up one day

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.490
and just checking
my Twitter feed.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.710
And somebody had a
posted a photograph

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.619
of me, one of my pictures,
and with the word man scrolled

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.380
across it, and just had sent
that to all of her followers.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.390
You sort of go--

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.490
so I sort of took
the same photograph

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.890
with the word man
scrawled across it

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.660
and wrote W-O in front of it.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.600
And I posted that
once to all followers.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.140
And it's quite hurtful.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.180
It's something you have to
build up a thicker skin about.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.059
Because there's a
lot of negativity

00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:47.850
out there, especially
towards trans people,

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.850
especially more so in the
UK than in Ireland, I think.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.340
And there's an awful lot of
online hate about trans people

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.050
at the moment, a
lot of negativity

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.490
in the press about trans people.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.150
And I think we need
to combat that.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.360
And I get misgendered
all the time.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.350
I get called he.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.580
I get accused of
all sorts of things.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.880
But at this stage, I've
got a pretty thick skin.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.820
You don't go through
life being trans and not

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.990
getting a thick skin by
the end of it, you know?

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.500
JULIEN FINLAY: And that's, as
I say, you really speak out.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.260
And you accepted that skin.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.280
And you actually are making it--

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.130
you're hardening it
by defending others.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.080
To all of you, who
has, to some degree,

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.760
ever experienced online hate or
cyberbullying or harassment--

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.650
maybe not to their
extent, but something

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.530
you did not like reading
or seeing or receiving?

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.160
Yeah.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.330
So it happens.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.410
It doesn't have to be changing
your name or your badge

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.330
or having 50 million
views on you,

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:54.420
but to create such a backlash.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.434
You both talk about
campaigns against yourselves.

00:18:59.434 --> 00:19:01.600
And the Google part of your
campaign, it's something

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.260
you set up.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:02.800
You think.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.920
You plan.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.280
Would that be the case for
you as in a group of people

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.000
or a person who really take
their time, their money,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.530
their energy to be hateful
and use internet as a media

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.450
to develop that hate?

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.700
FINLAY WILSON: I'm not sure
it necessarily-- so campaign,

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.310
almost just describing more than
one person kind of getting in

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.643
on it, not necessarily they're
spending money behind it.

00:19:30.643 --> 00:19:34.760
But certainly, I will see
people leave incredibly damaging

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.680
comments and will
tag friends who

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.060
obviously share those views.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.470
And then the bombarding starts.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.950
And that can usually start
to really snowball things.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.533
Because you try and
block one of them.

00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:47.060
And then the accounts
start replicating.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.230
So that can be
incredibly frustrating.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.840
But there is a resilience that
you have to develop to that.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.880
I mean, I ended up
having an argument

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.130
against Piers Morgan, which
I suppose was his campaign.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.750
Because he was
trying to diminish--

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.440
he re-shared the video about
male suicide and depression

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.160
that my twin brother and I
created and told us to man up.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.149
And that was him
using his platform

00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:15.190
in a really negative way.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.620
Because we were speaking
about coming out issues.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.809
We were speaking about that
sort of identity crisis

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:22.600
but also about male
suicide and depression.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.510
And he could have used his
platform for good, sharing it.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.030
But instead, his campaign was
one of hate and derogatory.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.709
So it's not just the
little grunt trolls

00:20:32.709 --> 00:20:34.000
that you need to watch out for.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.279
There are some people who really
do have campaigns against us.

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:38.070
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.650
And there is an organization in
the UK called a Woman's Org--

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.280
awomansplace.org, I
think it's called.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.470
And they're very
much anti-trans.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.870
And the UK at the moment--

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.536
I don't know if you're
aware-- is trying

00:20:50.536 --> 00:20:52.780
to change their Gender
Recognition Act to allow

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.210
trans people to self-identify.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.430
And this is something we
brought in in Ireland in 2015.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.910
And it hasn't caused
any issues whatsoever,

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.970
whereas this year, there's
been a campaign in the UK

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.040
to push back.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.730
The UK government opened
up a consultation process.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:14.050
And this awomansplace.org has
had meetings in Parliament

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.960
and has set up meetings in
town halls around the country

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.530
to advocate against changing
the Gender Recognition Act

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.910
and to not allow trans people
in the UK to self-identify.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.490
And they tried to set up a
meeting in Dublin to actually,

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.670
to come over here and set
up a meeting in Dublin.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.055
And they were pretty much
given the short shrift.

00:21:33.055 --> 00:21:37.960
And a lot of Irish feminists
wrote an open letter,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.120
saying that TERF
says that they're--

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.790
TERF, that stands for
Trans-Exclusionary Radical

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.830
Feminist.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.460
And so they wrote a letter,
saying TERF says, and saying,

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.924
you're not welcome
in this country.

00:21:52.924 --> 00:21:53.590
This is Ireland.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.930
We support trans
people in this country.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.840
And we don't want you
guys coming over here.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.440
And it was signed by well over
1,000 cisgender feminist women

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.150
who were pro trans rights.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.762
So it's great.

00:22:06.762 --> 00:22:08.470
It was great to see
that, that these guys

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.553
weren't welcome over here.

00:22:09.553 --> 00:22:11.290
But they're quite
prominent in the UK.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.630
And they're getting a lot
of attention by the media.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.890
JULIEN FINLAY: How does it--

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.020
when we talk, when we
think of this hate,

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.474
when we think of
the slurs, and sure,

00:22:19.474 --> 00:22:20.890
you have a hard
skin, both of you.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.710
And you would also help
other people, I'm sure,

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.220
who contact you and
may not have the voice

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.320
or may not have your courage.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.410
So you are also counseling them.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.850
How does it affect yourself?

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.240
How do you cope
with that in terms--

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.630
you mentioned mindfulness.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.750
But it is a hard road
to take on when you just

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.350
want to be yourselves and
live on with your lives.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.160
How do you feel, both of you?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.840
AOIFE MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.620
FINLAY WILSON: Sure.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.757
Certainly, I think to think
that the reaction is downplayed,

00:22:58.757 --> 00:22:59.590
like, yes, I'm here.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.840
Yes, I'm sort of standing
up and doing all this stuff.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.940
But when these
things come in, there

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.440
is still that
overwhelming sensation

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.410
of not wanting to leave the
house, of feeling completely

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:13.270
slimed, and having that
really frustrating moment

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.850
of questioning yourself.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.770
And that's the worst
part, that worst part,

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.960
where actually your
self-acceptance wavers

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.550
in the face of that.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:26.150
And that, for me, is where
my yoga practice comes in.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:30.590
Because I almost need to
reset my Finlayism before

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.420
I then leave the door again.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.520
So for me, my morning
yoga practice,

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.789
my time to do that reintegration
work so that when I go out,

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:39.830
I don't just see the first
straight person I see,

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.390
think that they're going to
attack me and try and kill them

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.782
first.

00:23:42.782 --> 00:23:44.670
Whew.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.470
Yeah.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.249
Don't do that.

00:23:47.249 --> 00:23:48.040
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.860
I mean, I think that
that's a very good point

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.630
about accepting yourself.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.050
Because there is a lot
of negativity out there.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.880
And I always say the bravest
step a trans person can take

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.650
is stepping across
that threshold,

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.840
stepping outside
the door in public--

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.560
not even just the first
time, nearly every time.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.930
Because you're putting
yourself out there.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:15.160
You are possibly visibly
trans and open to negativity.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.460
I read all sorts of
crappy comments online.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.640
And while I'm quite a
thick-skinned person,

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.380
it's the sheer volume
of it that just

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.800
chips and chips and chips away.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.860
And there are days where I
just god, oh, I just can't

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:27.950
face going outside the door.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.410
And I don't want to
go outside the door.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:29.850
But I have to.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:30.670
I have to get up.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:31.734
I have to go to work.

00:24:31.734 --> 00:24:33.900
I work in an office where
everybody knows I'm trans.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.870
And everybody is cool with that.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.150
But it's still not easy.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.730
You know, it's still a
difficult thing to do.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:45.480
And I think that it's
just the sheer sort of--

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.460
as I was saying, just the
sheer volume of that hate.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.230
It's not just, I can
handle one comment.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.646
I can handle a
number of comments.

00:24:51.646 --> 00:24:53.950
But when it's just drip,
drip, drip, that drip feed,

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.990
eventually, it does chip
away at you sometimes.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.600
And I'm aware of
trans people in the UK

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.720
who haven't left their
house in months, they said,

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.150
because the negative
reaction from media,

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.950
from people on the street,
from all sorts of things.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:11.545
And it's a pretty toxic
environment at times, you know?

00:25:11.545 --> 00:25:14.041
FINLAY WILSON: We were talking
about it in the green room.

00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:16.290
I teach in some of the island
communities in Scotland.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.665
And somebody comes
to me and said

00:25:17.665 --> 00:25:20.290
they hadn't seen a single
living person in over 30 days

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.600
because they're trans
on this Scottish island.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.130
And they just say they feel like
they just can't go anywhere.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.010
And so they just choose
to not see anyone.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.789
But I think the comments
that come in almost directly

00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:35.080
to our social media, they do
that almost daily chipping

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:35.580
away.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.360
We do that small
practice of reintegration

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.890
and then go back out
the door that morning.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.980
But the more oppressive
thing is seeing the things

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:42.896
in the larger picture.

00:25:42.896 --> 00:25:44.560
And we see America,
rights getting

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.870
stripped away left, right,
and center, and thinking,

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.850
when's it going to come here?

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.770
When is this going
to happen here?

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.290
When am I going to get
discriminated against in a shop

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.980
again?

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.620
JULIEN FINLAY: Do you feel
supported sometimes by others?

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.605
Or it's you against a big
wave that you may not--

00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:05.730
FINLAY WILSON: That's where
the education comes in.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:11.640
Because even my family,
every single one of them,

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.190
straight, generations of
frustrating straight people.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.410
And that's not me saying
that if you're straight

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:21.540
that you're frustrating.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:26.022
But they live under
this shell, this bubble,

00:26:26.022 --> 00:26:28.230
where they're like, no, none
of that happens anymore.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.350
You're overreacting.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.980
And they don't get
why I get angry.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.750
They don't get why I get upset.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.360
They don't get why sometimes I
phone my mum and I'm in tears.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.193
I'm like, do you see
what is happening here?

00:26:38.193 --> 00:26:43.620
Do you see how the rainbow world
is burning around the planet?

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.770
When I go and teach in places
like Indonesia to be told,

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.460
you need to really dial
everything you do down,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.480
which see when you teach in
pink leggings, that's hard.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.180
That's hard.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.260
It's hard to do, all right?

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.130
To not feel safe--

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.670
I feel relatively
safe in Scotland.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.340
When I was teaching in Texas,
I did not feel safe, all right?

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.580
When I was teaching in
Indonesia, I didn't feel safe.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.670
But I kind of found
like a gay community who

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.380
were like the rebel faction.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.510
It was nice to kind
of hang out with them.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:20.570
But that cloud of
oppression isn't going away.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:24.490
And actually, that one saps
me more than the daily.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.627
JULIEN FINLAY: Do you want to
add something to this, Aoife?

00:27:30.627 --> 00:27:31.460
AOIFE MARTIN: Sorry.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.450
I lost my train of thought.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.616
What was the question again?

00:27:33.616 --> 00:27:34.440
[LAUGHS]

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.957
JULIEN FINLAY: Basically if
you feel supported, if you

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:40.040
have people there for you?

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.550
AOIFE MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.360
JULIEN FINLAY: If you
[INAUDIBLE] to combat?

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:42.640
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.598
That's a good question.

00:27:43.598 --> 00:27:48.440
I mean, I have a lot of friends
who are very, very supportive.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.157
Most of my friends would
be cisgender women.

00:27:51.157 --> 00:27:52.490
And they've totally accepted me.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.270
And we go for coffee.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:54.770
We meet.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.270
We go for meals, et cetera.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.330
And it's great.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.090
But I think a lot
people just aren't

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:02.300
aware of the constant sort
of drip feed of negativity

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.060
that's out there.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.170
I think, I hate to say,
but a lot of people

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.630
live in sort of heterosexual,
cisgender bubble.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.890
And while they're
sort of tangentially

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.740
aware of these issues happening,
because it's not affecting them

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.020
directly, they're not aware
of how hurtful it can be

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.760
and how difficult it
can be for trans people.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.524
And I constantly say this.

00:28:23.524 --> 00:28:25.190
Look, if you have a
friend who is trans,

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:29.180
if you have somebody in
your life who's trans,

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.100
reach out and just
say, how are you doing?

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:31.960
Is everything OK?

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.940
There's some shitty
stuff in the news.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:34.757
Are you OK?

00:28:34.757 --> 00:28:35.840
Are you feeling all right?

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.740
Do you want to talk
about anything?

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.080
Do you just want to go for
a coffee and have a natter?

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.050
So I think it's
just important just

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.600
to be there, be supportive,
and just reach out when you can

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.195
say, just let's go for coffee.

00:28:46.195 --> 00:28:47.570
JULIEN FINLAY:
That's a good one.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.280
That's valuable for
anyone, I would say, not

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.160
depending on their--

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:50.540
AOIFE MARTIN: Oops.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.665
JULIEN FINLAY: You're good.

00:28:51.665 --> 00:28:53.870
It won't fall there--

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.120
to anyone, depending on
their identification.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.790
But specifically
to some minorities,

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:02.150
I think we would have to develop
a stronger sense of empathy,

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.200
as in, oh, I'm aware Aoife may
not feel good today for X, Y,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.470
Z reasons, or Finlay either.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.770
You both mentioned
that education and also

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:16.580
the idea of a rebel
club, that where

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.950
you could have seen the
internet for a while,

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:23.072
like where the minorities
would live or develop or hide.

00:29:23.072 --> 00:29:24.530
Do you think that's
still the case?

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:25.946
Do you think the
internet is still

00:29:25.946 --> 00:29:28.130
a safe haven for minorities?

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.300
FINLAY WILSON: It's tricky.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:34.160
Because I see a lot of people
who give the guise of support

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.064
online-- so for example,
if somebody sends me hate,

00:29:37.064 --> 00:29:39.230
like it's almost becoming
one of my favorite things,

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:42.890
is just to publicly shame them.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.470
When that happens, it's always
the people in the rainbow

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.620
bubble that tell me to
not post that stuff,

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.600
to actually stay quiet.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.205
Because they have an
institutionalized oppression

00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:54.830
where they're like,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.360
Don't talk about this.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.710
And that's from people who
it's also happening to.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.180
And it's a very strange,
like, oh, they've got us good.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.799
They've really got us
good, so to actually

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:05.840
be able to speak to people
who will then actually

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.630
stand up and also be
happy to speak out

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.620
about that kind of thing.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.900
I would say that's
much rarer to find

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.360
that than to find the people
that will become apologists,

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.200
that will just say, no, no,
no, just don't think about it.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.330
Don't talk about it.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:23.800
Certainly don't share it.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.330
Certainly don't have
an opinion about it.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.382
Makes me sick.

00:30:27.382 --> 00:30:28.840
JULIEN FINLAY: But
you still share?

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.881
FINLAY WILSON: Of course.

00:30:33.692 --> 00:30:36.150
JULIEN FINLAY: Both of you,
have you ever posted something,

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.970
and then you regretted
it and deleted,

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.290
or have had double thoughts,
either because you thought

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.490
you'd be hateful
or because you felt

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.700
that was not your job to do?

00:30:46.146 --> 00:30:48.270
AOIFE MARTIN: Well, you
should see my drafts folder

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.410
in Twitter, stuff I've
wanted to say but not said.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.120
And if ever I die, I'm hoping
one of my friends will log

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.520
in and just delete
everything in there,

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.532
stuff you wouldn't-- generally,
I'm quite careful because I

00:31:00.532 --> 00:31:02.490
know how it can affect
people because I've been

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:03.365
on the receiving end.

00:31:03.365 --> 00:31:06.351
I'm quite aware of what I say.

00:31:06.351 --> 00:31:08.100
I don't always--
sometimes, I do lash out.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.140
Sometimes I do say
something I regret later

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.930
or something I
shouldn't have said.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.820
I'm also aware that
I have a platform

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.600
and that there are younger
trans people possibly reading

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.410
what I write.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.560
And I once wrote a
pretty negative article

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.500
about being trans, because
I was going through sort

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.850
of major dysphoria at the time.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:31.710
And it was sort of like why it
sucks being trans, basically.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.420
And the article was published.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.130
But I actually had to email
the editor and say, look,

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.088
could you just change
the headline on that just

00:31:37.088 --> 00:31:38.430
to make it sound less negative?

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.350
I mean, he didn't change the
content of the article, which

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.641
was fine, because that's how
I was feeling at the time.

00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:44.580
But rather than
calling the article,

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.190
it sucks being trans, let's be
a bit more positive about it

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.490
and have something, rather than
having that negativity there.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.070
Because I do try to,
as much as I can,

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:57.080
highlight the positive aspects
and just to usualize this

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.160
and to say, look, it
is OK to be trans.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.173
There's nothing to be
ashamed about, you know?

00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:04.926
JULIEN FINLAY: Finlay,
do you regret your posts?

00:32:04.926 --> 00:32:07.300
FINLAY WILSON: Well, some
images that I've put up-- well,

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.620
there was one time.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.280
I'd done this photo shoot
with my twin brother.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.200
And it was great.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:14.784
It was lovely.

00:32:14.784 --> 00:32:16.658
And I thought, I'm just
going to chuck, like,

00:32:16.658 --> 00:32:17.650
70 images on Facebook.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.108
And then I was
like, this one image

00:32:19.108 --> 00:32:20.340
has been shared 500 times.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.600
It's cause you can
see everything.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.510
I didn't know.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.170
I had no clue.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.570
I regret that.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:29.260
But as for my responses
online, not so much-- but

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.020
I have shifted my
tactics for the people

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.450
who leave hateful comments on
my Instagram in particular.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.460
Because I know there's--

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.614
for example, I teach a group
of kids with additional support

00:32:39.614 --> 00:32:41.030
needs, like multiple
disabilities.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:42.910
And I know actually
daily, they check

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.460
in to my Facebook to
see what poses I'm doing

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.960
and then see if
they can recreate it

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.530
in their classroom,
every single day.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.190
And so if they're seeing me
being really nasty to somebody

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.390
who's been really
nasty to me, it's

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:54.723
not setting a very good example.

00:32:54.723 --> 00:32:57.200
So one of my new
favorites, it's like,

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.640
oops, you're on the wrong
page, fingernail emoji.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.240
And then you
usually would direct

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.030
the followers to be like, go
and send them a message for me.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.730
And I send in the troops.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.890
So I will leave them a little
bit like, whoops-a-daisy.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:16.520
And then the troops go
in there and will usually

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.860
do the critique work
for me without--

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.220
it's not saying that I
won't go in and do the work.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.470
But it's me saying, I'm not
going to engage with you.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:28.080
But also, you're on my page.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.392
You must like what you see.

00:33:29.392 --> 00:33:31.732
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:33.700
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.580
There is an argument.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.230
I mean, I've had
this sort of argue

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.850
with people, where
they say, just

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:41.815
don't give them any limelight.

00:33:41.815 --> 00:33:42.360
And I agree.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.860
I mean, it's easy for people
to say that because they're not

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.860
the ones being attacked.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:46.920
FINLAY WILSON: Yeah.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.460
AOIFE MARTIN: And
sometimes, I will ignore.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.260
And I will just not
pass any remarks.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.710
Or I will I will do what you do.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:53.880
I will send in the troops.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.372
I will quote, tweet this.

00:33:55.372 --> 00:33:57.830
Look what this arsehole is out
there saying, sort of thing,

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:01.640
and just let everybody
else do the hard work.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.361
But I'm also aware that
since I came out at work,

00:34:04.361 --> 00:34:06.110
a lot of people from
MasterCard follow me.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.159
So I've become much
less wary on my Twitter.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:11.122
I'm much more, a little bit--

00:34:11.122 --> 00:34:12.830
I hold myself back a
little bit, I think.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.080
I probably shouldn't.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.096
But I'm much more self-conscious
than I used to be, I have say.

00:34:19.096 --> 00:34:20.929
JULIEN FINLAY: Being
self-conscious offline,

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.716
we will open the floor.

00:34:23.716 --> 00:34:24.590
So prepare questions.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.810
But I have 1,000 more
if you're OK with that.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:30.400
Feel free just raising your
hand if you have any questions.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.190
And we'll find a mic.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.510
You're talking about tactics.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.270
You're talking about
sending the troops.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.400
That's like warfare.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:45.940
Is that your day-to-day
situation, you're fighting

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.159
negativity?

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.030
FINLAY WILSON: It is day to day.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:53.960
Even today, when I was sitting
on the plane, somebody left a--

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.522
it was, as insults
go, pretty tame.

00:34:57.522 --> 00:34:59.480
They are just like, your
bum doesn't look good.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.340
And I was like, hm, OK.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.570
Sure.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.790
72 million people disagree.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:08.900
And I just wrote back.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.978
And I was just like-- again,
I was just like, whoops.

00:35:11.978 --> 00:35:14.840
I think you think I
appreciate what you think.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.700
I don't.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.520
And then they wrote back, like,
no, it's really that left one.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.670
And it was so specific, I
just found it more amusing.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.870
I was like, I'm not feeling
too self-conscious right now,

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:29.240
even though it's the
one facing everybody.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.975
But it's relentless.

00:35:31.975 --> 00:35:34.100
There's lots of these little
comments that chip in.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.650
And actually to have a tactic,
sometimes just going in

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.550
has been like, oh, oh.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.070
Give them a little something.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.710
But for the really
negative ones,

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:45.140
I've had a lot of really
terrible experiences

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.210
where the fans have gone in.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.810
And they have reported
it and then have

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.360
tried to go through the
reporting channels on Instagram

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.200
primarily.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.810
And then they
report back and say,

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.290
Instagram said they're
not going to do anything.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:02.260
Instagram said that even though
there's hate speech there,

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.400
they won't do anything about it.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.510
So the safeguards
that my troops use

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.940
will only work occasionally.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.490
And that's frustrating.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.620
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah, I
think that's a big problem

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.340
in social media.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.250
I primarily used Twitter as
my social media platform.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.430
And you report stuff on there.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.440
And they say, oh, there's
nothing to see here.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.320
Everything's fine.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.650
Or this does not
violate our rules.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:30.040
And you're [INAUDIBLE] well,
clearly it bloody well does,

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.540
you know?

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.600
And I was getting harassment
from one particular person.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.660
And it was constant.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.950
And this person talked about
me, talked about my family,

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:42.070
talked about my kids, et cetera,
and said some really, really

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:43.090
negative stuff about me.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.910
And I reported it to Twitter.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.910
And they said, no, it
doesn't violate our rules.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.620
And eventually, I got
talking to somebody

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.780
who knew somebody in Twitter.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:58.750
And I sent her a load of tweets
that this person had sent.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:02.120
And next thing I know,
this person was banned.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.490
But since then, this person
has set up another account

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:09.487
and is now on her fifth account
and is still harassing me.

00:37:09.487 --> 00:37:12.070
So it's a very, very difficult
thing to police on social media

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:12.840
and enforce anything.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.673
JULIEN FINLAY: Yeah.

00:37:13.673 --> 00:37:17.500
And that's why I wanted us
to lead to, as a new report,

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.220
but nothing is happening,
or not fast enough.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.470
We discussed that
earlier and how--

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:25.220
in the green room,
when everything happens

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.510
and you are not there--

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:32.780
and there's a code of conduct
that was launched by the EU.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.450
But it's not legally binding.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.440
It's an agreement.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.940
Do you want to
control the internet?

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.040
Or do you want to have
the internet controlled?

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.795
Do you want to let
loose, everyone?

00:37:42.795 --> 00:37:46.160
And what do you
think about that?

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.910
I'm sure you've all
reported, as you said.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:51.830
But then most of
the time, nothing

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.160
is happening in your favor.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.210
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah, I think it's
a difficult thing to police.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.050
And I think governments would
love to control the internet.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.420
And governments would love
to control social media.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.280
Because the government doesn't
like us talking to each other

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.940
and advocating together
and protesting together.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.880
I mean, it's social
media that brought

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.270
the grassroots campaigns
for abortion in this country

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:17.720
and for marriage equality like,
the Home to Vote campaign,

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.764
all social media led,
all grassroots led.

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.930
And the government wasn't
ever going to do anything.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.747
So they would love to
control us, I think.

00:38:24.747 --> 00:38:27.080
So I think, yeah, you have
to take the good with the bad

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:27.788
as well, I think.

00:38:27.788 --> 00:38:29.940
You know, it would
be nice if we were

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.790
a bit politer to each
other on social media

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:32.630
and on the internet.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.467
But I don't see that happening.

00:38:34.467 --> 00:38:36.050
JULIEN FINLAY: Do
you see it happening

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.570
on yourself, whenever
you have reporting, even

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.740
with the police, physical?

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.800
FINLAY WILSON: Well,
that's the thing.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.430
It goes much wider as
a problem for society

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:48.290
than just policing the internet.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:51.230
I mean, even the police
themselves were not

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:56.010
following through on
their basic function.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:39:00.180
So that was something
outside of that.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.620
So last week in Scotland,
Scotland said that as part

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.620
of the curriculum for primary
schools and secondary schools,

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:12.100
they would be introducing
LGBTQ+ education.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.570
And this was a huge thing.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.280
And everybody is like,
woo, this is great.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.320
And the main sticking
point-- and we

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.445
were speaking about this,
in the green room, again.

00:39:21.445 --> 00:39:24.190
If only you'd been in the green
room, everything happened.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.940
The main thing that everybody
was rallying against,

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.950
as you were saying,
that trans rights

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.920
are 20 years behind gay
rights, is everybody's beef

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.850
was with trans.

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:35.010
And they were using
the same rhetoric

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:39.277
that was used about gay
people 20 years ago.

00:39:39.277 --> 00:39:40.860
20 years ago, it
would've been, you're

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.970
trying to turn my kid gay.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:45.360
It's like, no-- born that way.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.950
Now you're starting to get it.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:49.530
But they're not
there yet with trans.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:53.295
But education has gotten
people to a certain point.

00:39:53.295 --> 00:39:54.920
But there's a lot
more education to do.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.050
So I don't know if
policing is going to do it.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:58.950
But getting people
who are more educated,

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.590
people who are actually
questioning, and as you said,

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:06.270
sort of normalizing the
situation, usualizing it.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:09.120
As that happens,
we can only hope

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.840
that that will not be there.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.200
Because we also rely on
our freedom of speech

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.550
to be able to fight back.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.519
We can't fight back against
it if we're being silenced

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:18.810
and if we're all being policed.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:22.030
JULIEN FINLAY: Yeah, and
this idea of being policed

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.620
is rising.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.710
I know like on Monday,
if I'm correct,

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.540
Emmanuel Macron,
French president,

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.850
did launch this agreement.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.160
And three main
countries have not

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.330
agreed, thus being
China, US, and Russia,

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.680
which would be major
impacts on the internet.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.160
And if we could go to--

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.270
well, yeah.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:52.940
So that's a quote from a Jewish
sociologist, who does say

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.690
basically, tech companies
are seeing themselves

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:57.400
as publishers.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.690
So now we are responsible.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:00.770
The companies will be
responsible for the content

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:01.269
online.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.360
Who's at fault, the
messenger or the medium?

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.330
Who should be policed?

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.235
Who should be responsible for
the tribune that is published?

00:41:13.235 --> 00:41:14.260
Is it the journal?

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.170
Is it the reader?

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.610
Is it the writer?

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:19.340
What are your thoughts?

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.504
AOIFE MARTIN: I think the
medium has probably more

00:41:21.504 --> 00:41:22.670
responsibility in this area.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:27.350
Certainly, I know, again,
speaking about Twitter,

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:28.730
they're quite happy to have--

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.150
if somebody has a
lot of followers.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.780
Remember Milo on Twitter?

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.340
They were happy to go along
with his stuff for ages,

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.722
all the hateful rhetoric
that he was espousing.

00:41:39.722 --> 00:41:41.930
They still haven't banned
Donald Trump for god's sake

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.427
and the stuff he comes out with.

00:41:43.427 --> 00:41:44.010
It's because--

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:45.890
JULIEN FINLAY: He was
banned for one hour.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:46.220
FINLAY WILSON: One day.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:46.760
AOIFE MARTIN: Was he?

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.680
Oh yeah, that's right,
it was accidental.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.270
But they're quite happy to allow
these people their platform

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.360
because it generates
more news from Twitter.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.830
It generates
notoriety for Twitter.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.210
It generates more income and
advertisement for Twitter,

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:00.710
you know?

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.500
And if you look at any online
publication, any newspaper

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.850
publication, all the
comments beneath the articles

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.100
themselves, a lot of
it's quite negative.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.014
And it's quite right wing.

00:42:12.014 --> 00:42:13.430
But they're happy
to go with this,

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.756
because it generates clicks.

00:42:14.756 --> 00:42:16.630
It generates people
looking at their content.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.710
And it generates
advertising revenue.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:19.800
JULIEN FINLAY: I'll go
back with you on this.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:19.980
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:42:20.056 --> 00:42:20.880
JULIEN FINLAY: And then
we have a question.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.880
So if you could just tell us
your name and your question,

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.546
please?

00:42:23.546 --> 00:42:24.920
AUDIENCE: So my
name is Roseanne.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.532
My question relates a bit to
the situation in Scotland.

00:42:27.532 --> 00:42:29.490
Because when you were
talking at the beginning,

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:31.580
I also remember that
they're introducing it

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.620
into the schools'
curriculum, which

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.740
seems to be the best idea
to educate people early on.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.010
But then there seems to
be this huge discrepancy

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:43.760
between that idea and
very public, I think,

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.981
court proceedings against what
is perceived as hate speech

00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:47.480
online.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.980
I think there was a comedian.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.840
He was convicted
for a piece that he

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.200
made that Jewish people
might feel is distasteful.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.970
And at the same time,
you say whatever

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.430
you reported that
happened to an actual life

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:03.560
outside of any online
interactions, people damaging

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.290
the tires of the
car, threatening you

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.970
with physical
violence, threatening

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:10.700
to kill your animal,
nothing was done

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.040
as far as I understood you.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.850
So what would be the best
approach to actually tackle

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.040
that real-life problem?

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.420
FINLAY WILSON: I think
one challenge would

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.390
be perhaps for the police
and the authorities

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:28.720
to perhaps look at
the fact that there

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.950
are obvious inequalities in how
crime reporting, but also crime

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.480
handling, is dealt with.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.230
So certainly when it came to
me handing over this letter,

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:40.390
I was told, oh, we'll
take your fingerprints.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:41.410
We'll do it right now.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.487
They didn't.

00:43:42.487 --> 00:43:43.820
Then they said, well, come back.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.450
We'll take your fingerprints.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.469
They still didn't.

00:43:46.469 --> 00:43:48.260
They said they would
interview my neighbors

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.218
to find out who it was.

00:43:49.218 --> 00:43:50.204
They didn't.

00:43:50.204 --> 00:43:51.620
Then it became a
high-profile case

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.828
because I took it to the BBC.

00:43:52.828 --> 00:43:55.460
And they still didn't.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.950
So the ball was dropped
on many opportunities.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.890
So that's not uncommon
in that constituency.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:04.710
They say that their budget is
so stretched that they cannot

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.710
investigate hate crime.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:08.880
So if we are encouraging people
to report more hate crime

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.120
or to be more aware of it,
and for especially people who

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.240
it's happening to, too feel
confident in reporting it,

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.580
they need a bigger budget to
be able to investigate it.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.710
Because all the other
stuff is still happening.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:21.580
They're stretched thin.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.580
So I can understand
that they may not

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.350
have the resources to follow
through with a lot of it.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:29.370
So there is that, more
resources for them to do that.

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:32.640
But then it's like, OK,
bigger police presence.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.110
Do we want that either?

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:35.430
Have they always been allies?

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:37.000
Can they be allies?

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.610
It's a tricky situation.

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:42.630
But if it comes down to
education, the person who

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:46.350
wrote the letter, everyone who
I showed the letter to, said,

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.580
this is an older
person's handwriting.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:54.290
I was like, are these views
that are going to disappear?

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:58.220
Or are they views that
are still current that

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.150
are still being passed on
generation to generation?

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.850
This is where I hope
the education part will

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:07.880
have children identifying
with people in the playground,

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.520
rather than-- it almost
seems like, certainly

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.010
when I was at school, it only
after school that I was like,

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.640
oh, my god.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.230
There's gay people.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:16.606
Oh, my god.

00:45:16.606 --> 00:45:17.480
And then I look back.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.809
And it's like, actually,
most of you were.

00:45:19.809 --> 00:45:20.600
But we didn't know.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.840
And we can identify them.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.850
So actually, to
have the education

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.183
that school is really important.

00:45:24.183 --> 00:45:26.624
I had to sit through,
in my high school,

00:45:26.624 --> 00:45:29.060
an assembly with
the whole of my year

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.120
gathered, where we were told
by a priest at the front

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.490
that it was Adam and
Eve, not Adam and Steve.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:38.700
And they battered that into us.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.260
So if school is going
to move more inclusion,

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.330
I look forward to seeing
how those children will

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:44.830
go into the world.

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.500
I see the young creators,
the young YouTubers,

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.430
putting out a very diverse
message, a very almost

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.080
sometimes gender fluid message.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:58.000
And see, that is so wonderful
to see, to see that.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.175
But that's a great thing.

00:46:00.175 --> 00:46:02.550
But we still need to focus on
there are people who really

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.650
get left out and struggle.

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:07.650
For example, somebody
who I teach yoga to,

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.380
we picked her back up
after her parents sent her

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.100
to gay conversion therapy.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.330
And so she had
needles in her fingers

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:19.900
to try and beat the gay away.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.960
This still happens in Scotland.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.190
It can still happen in Scotland.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:31.160
So I would love if they
legislated that more and then

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.020
included that in the education.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.540
This is how we used
to deal with this,

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.217
like acknowledging some
of the painful history.

00:46:38.217 --> 00:46:40.800
I think that's been a big thing
in a lot of minority movements

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.480
is you need to acknowledge some
of the wrong that's been done.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.000
Because if you don't,
how do we move forwards?

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.070
This is where LGBT History
Months are actually

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:52.010
really important
aspects as education.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.860
And I think that will be
great to see that in schools.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.693
JULIEN FINLAY: Aoife,
what are your thoughts

00:46:56.693 --> 00:46:58.820
on the next generation
of creators online?

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.940
AOIFE MARTIN: I'm very,
very hopeful, actually.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.570
I grew up in the '70s and '80s,
when there was no internet

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.530
and there was no [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.330
There was none of this.

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.550
And looking at
young people today,

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.230
and they're much more outgoing.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.390
They're much more
accepting of who they are.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:15.500
They're much more
accepting of diversity.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.500
I mean, kids aren't
born bigoted, you know?

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.039
They get bigotry
from other people.

00:47:19.039 --> 00:47:20.080
They get it from society.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.290
They get it from the media,
from what they see around them.

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:26.720
And to see young kids
coming out and young kids

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.040
being themselves,
it's just wonderful,

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.639
and long may it last.

00:47:32.639 --> 00:47:33.680
JULIEN FINLAY: All right.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.309
I have a question.

00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:37.100
But I think I'd love
to hear your thoughts.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.910
And I'd love to hear how you
experience internet, what you

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:43.940
think of the EU regulations.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.030
Because I have tackled
this a bit briefly.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.950
But we can go back again.

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:53.060
So go ahead, whoever
wants to take the mic--

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.049
so name and question, please.

00:47:55.049 --> 00:47:55.590
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:56.271
Yeah.

00:47:56.271 --> 00:47:56.770
Hi.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:58.840
My name name's Kelsey.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.207
Before I just say my question,
Finlay, I have your book.

00:48:01.207 --> 00:48:03.040
I really appreciate the
pictures at the end.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.974
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:03.974 --> 00:48:05.724
FINLAY WILSON: Don't
give away the ending.

00:48:05.724 --> 00:48:06.897
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:07.397 --> 00:48:10.030
AUDIENCE: Really, as someone
who does create content,

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.670
I wanted to ask if some of these
hateful messages that you're

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.950
getting constantly
on this content

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:17.170
is making you either
sort of second guess

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.360
putting the content out
there, or even maybe

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.030
revising what you're creating
because of your getting

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.630
this negative images and
messaging constantly?

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.922
Does that change how
you think about putting

00:48:27.922 --> 00:48:30.380
your content out there or the
things that you're producing?

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.890
FINLAY WILSON: I wish
it didn't, but it does.

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.780
So for example, I
was putting out--

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.420
sometimes if I put up a
photo of my partner and I,

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.270
sometimes I really do
question, like, OK.

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.160
Why am I putting this out here?

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.990
And sometimes I want it to
be just a simple sharing.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.270
But then it really easily
becomes politicized.

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:54.660
Really easily, it becomes almost
like an aggressive sharing

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.640
in retaliation to something
else that has happened.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.750
And so it does start to seep
into the posts in some way.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:05.910
But then sometimes, I might
then shift it and actually write

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:06.750
that.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:08.160
So the image can speak.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.200
But the text can also speak.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.140
So I had a lot of
real body shaming.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.730
That was about three
or four days ago.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:16.710
So then I posted one.

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.950
And I just wrote like
a letter to myself

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:24.810
from me now to when I
really hated my body.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:26.190
And I wrote that.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.000
And a lot of people
resonated with that.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.660
But it was reactionary.

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.150
But it also allowed me a
moment of self reflection.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:35.580
So it's frustrating in
that it does give me

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.800
grounds to create material
that is reactionary.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.930
And it does put a
voice out there.

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:42.690
But it is sometimes
tainted by the fact

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.450
that it's come in from
such a negative source.

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:48.560
So it does.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.513
And it does make
me second guess.

00:49:50.513 --> 00:49:51.459
Yeah.

00:49:51.459 --> 00:49:52.985
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:52.985 --> 00:49:54.610
JULIEN FINLAY: I'll
go to you, Antonio.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:56.272
But that's what you did as well.

00:49:56.272 --> 00:49:58.480
And I've read that on
[INAUDIBLE] blog, like a letter

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.740
to your young self.

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:02.290
Could you tell us
a bit more of this?

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:07.290
And also, maybe I'm
wrong, but I know

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.840
if you're within a smaller
community than the mainstream

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.450
world, maybe going
online could be a refuge.

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:18.779
So your younger self, would they
go online to have a safe haven?

00:50:18.779 --> 00:50:20.070
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah, I think so.

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:24.510
I mean, like for now, I wrote
a letter to my younger self.

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:28.020
And basically, other
than buy shares in Apple,

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.260
I told myself that
it was OK to be trans

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:36.570
and that you will
get through this.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.640
I think when you're
that young and you

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:39.780
know you're different
from everybody else,

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.488
and you feel different
to everybody else,

00:50:41.488 --> 00:50:43.470
and there is no
representation out there,

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:47.130
and you don't know anybody
else either in your peer group

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:50.870
or on television or
anyone who is trans,

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:52.680
and you never see
yourself represented,

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.270
you think you're
the only person,

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:58.249
and so just that, it was
just to myself, saying look,

00:50:58.249 --> 00:50:59.040
you will get there.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.960
You will come through this.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.880
And you will
eventually be happy.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.830
You will be an out trans woman.

00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:08.190
And you will speak about your
experiences of being trans.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:13.112
And I think if I'd had the
internet in those days,

00:51:13.112 --> 00:51:14.820
then I think, yeah,
I probably would have

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.480
come out a lot sooner, I think.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.830
And I know in the
early days of internet,

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.939
there was a lot of stuff
out there which we probably

00:51:21.939 --> 00:51:23.730
shouldn't be viewing
at that age, you know?

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:28.896
And certainly, I think it
was difficult initially.

00:51:28.896 --> 00:51:30.770
Even when I first started
using the internet,

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:34.770
there were very few
communities out there.

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:37.610
I think social media
has improved enormously.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:39.327
And yeah, I
definitely would have

00:51:39.327 --> 00:51:41.160
be online and definitely
would have probably

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.326
come out a lot sooner, yeah.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:43.860
JULIEN FINLAY: All right.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:44.369
Go ahead.

00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:44.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:46.390
My name is Antonio.

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:48.660
My question is more for Finlay.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.410
You kind of mentioned
that in your video,

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:55.560
the men-to-men action
started or contributed

00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:00.360
to the hate or the backlash.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.320
I don't know if you know the
Kilted Coaches or the Coaches

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.357
Kilted from Scotland.

00:52:05.357 --> 00:52:06.190
FINLAY WILSON: Yeah.

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:07.430
They live down the road.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:11.910
AUDIENCE: So I wanted
to know if you know

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:14.280
or if you know the story, if
something happened to them,

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.810
they had the same backlash.

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:17.820
I don't think they
identify themselves as gay.

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.495
But they have a lot of
men-to-men action in a kilt.

00:52:20.495 --> 00:52:21.870
FINLAY WILSON:
They have actually

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:25.620
spoken really publicly about--

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.160
if you are watching, guys,
we've spoken about this.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.810
So actually, we
spoke about it live.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:35.420
And they have addressed it
to their fans quite a lot.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.160
But obviously,
they're both straight.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.632
They have their wives.

00:52:38.632 --> 00:52:39.590
They've got their kids.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.460
They're very open about that.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:45.240
But they're also
happy to play to--

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.860
what do we call it,
like the Pink Pound--

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.840
to work that.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.930
But when I did it, people
were uncomfortable,

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:54.800
because they knew.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.125
By that point, I'd already
produced-- the hate

00:52:57.125 --> 00:52:58.250
letter had already come in.

00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:59.920
I'd already produced the video.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.810
I mean, like, this
is terrible, blah.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:03.350
I'd already being seen as that.

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:06.010
And so video number two,
the people are like, maybe

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:07.010
these are straight guys.

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.470
Maybe we'll find straight
guys in the woods.

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.680
Suddenly, it was like, no,
it's a faggot in the woods.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.860
And that was a huge
shift to see that.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.160
They knew.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.070
And they were uncomfortable.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:22.250
And it was a really
big change to see that.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:25.360
And the languaging really
changed in that regard.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:26.120
Yeah.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.226
And that's from that
piece of information.

00:53:29.226 --> 00:53:31.929
Yeah.

00:53:31.929 --> 00:53:32.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:33.190
I'm Rina.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:34.150
And I have a question.

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:38.140
If you ever talk to
the haters and ask,

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.060
what actually are you afraid of?

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.680
FINLAY WILSON: This is
almost a misunderstanding

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.640
that homophobia means
that they're scared.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.920
They're not usually
scared of us at all.

00:53:56.644 --> 00:53:58.810
I think everybody in this
room has had conversations

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.850
with people where you
have had disagreements.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:03.220
And you're never going
to meet eye to eye.

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.830
I've never had one of
those celebrity turnaround

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:08.380
moments, where when you've
like spoken to a hater,

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.310
and they've been
like, oh, actually

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:10.180
I'm just really hurting.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.471
And let me tell you this thing.

00:54:11.471 --> 00:54:13.069
That doesn't happen
to me, all right?

00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:14.110
That hasn't happen to me.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:16.390
They just spew their venom.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:17.950
And at some point,
I have to say,

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:21.490
I cannot attend
this arena anymore.

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:22.440
I'm done here.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.880
I gave you a moment.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.290
I tried.

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:26.839
But I can't.

00:54:26.839 --> 00:54:29.130
I've never had one of those
breakthrough moments, where

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:30.360
it's like, we're going
to have a crowdfunder

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.840
campaign for their surgery.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:35.217
I've not had that
at all, you know?

00:54:35.217 --> 00:54:36.550
You know kind of the one I mean?

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:39.490
Like was it Sarah Silverman
did that against her hater?

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:42.210
And it was lovely, lovely thing.

00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:45.582
That's a very romanticized thing
about online hate, I think.

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:47.790
JULIEN FINLAY: Would that
be the same for you, Aoife,

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:49.470
like you would not--

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:50.100
I don't know.

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.850
The potential of hate
would prevent you

00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:56.520
of engaging online with
your haters or your least

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.690
appreciated fans?

00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.523
AOIFE MARTIN: So somewhat
similar to Finlay,

00:54:59.523 --> 00:55:03.020
I think I'm generally-- when
I first started coming out

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:06.500
and was quite outspoken about
being trans, I was very open

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.430
and would answer
people's questions.

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.770
You know, because you want
to sort of educate people.

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:11.380
FINLAY WILSON:
Yeah, information.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.870
AOIFE MARTIN: It's information.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:16.920
But the older I get, the
more cynical I get about it.

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:23.490
And I think I'm very quick
now at spotting when somebody

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.410
is being genuine and
somebody is just asking,

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:26.868
trying to catch me
out on something

00:55:26.868 --> 00:55:28.380
and use it against me.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.260
And I'm very, very quick
to sort of just block

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.350
people on Twitter.

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:35.850
My life is not a debate.

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:40.650
You can't sit there and demand
why I should get rights.

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.650
I should have the rights.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:44.842
That's the basic
bottom line here.

00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:45.800
FINLAY WILSON: Exactly.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.591
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:55:46.591 --> 00:55:48.594
And so I just don't
engage with it anymore.

00:55:48.594 --> 00:55:50.760
Because like you say, you
cannot change their minds.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.800
There is no wonderful
moment where

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.030
people go, oh, you're right.

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:55.411
And I'm going to change my ways.

00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:56.160
It doesn't happen.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:56.820
FINLAY WILSON: I
think a lot of people

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.690
also think that trolls are
looking for engagement,

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:01.470
that not necessarily.

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:04.290
I mean, when I did the
video about mental health,

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:06.702
one of the first
five comments was,

00:56:06.702 --> 00:56:08.910
you should have followed
through on killing yourself.

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:14.900
What do you do with that?

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.400
What do you do with
how you interact

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.899
with that person who's, in a
sentence, wished death on you?

00:56:19.899 --> 00:56:21.190
AOIFE MARTIN: That's the thing.

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.900
I mean, 48% of young trans
kids have attempted suicide.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.040
And when this stat is
ever sort of produced

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.380
and when I've mentioned
this online, people say,

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.140
well, they're obviously
not trying hard enough.

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.335
I mean, how do you deal
with that sort of hate?

00:56:35.335 --> 00:56:35.960
You just don't.

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.250
You just go, sorry.

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:38.080
JULIEN FINLAY: 48%?

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:38.450
AOIFE MARTIN: Sorry?

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:39.658
JULIEN FINLAY: 48%, you said?

00:56:39.658 --> 00:56:42.350
AOIFE MARTIN: 48%, yes, so
you just don't deal with.

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:43.850
You cannot engage
with these people.

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:45.660
There's just no point, you know?

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.890
FINLAY WILSON: Yeah, like
the LGBT suicide rate

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:54.850
is high, very high, much
higher in trans communities.

00:56:54.850 --> 00:57:01.470
And to see people writing
and wishing death on you

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:03.120
is damaging.

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.850
You can't help but question
not only their actions,

00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:09.330
but you begin to
question yourself.

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:12.390
And remember, we were saying
earlier about that time

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.960
to reflect.

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:17.620
If somebody is questioning
your existence,

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.380
has the troll had that?

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:22.600
Has the troll genuinely
sat there and then

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.480
reflected themselves on what
they have written and said,

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.220
should I die?

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.320
No, of course they haven't.

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.850
But they will do it to us.

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:31.720
JULIEN FINLAY: And
that's why it's sneaky.

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.845
Because you would only see
the hate or the comments

00:57:33.845 --> 00:57:38.530
or the meme as something
online, not something

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:43.140
that, well, boomerangs
physically in your face--

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.640
to use another boomerang thing.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:49.300
But online hate does kill.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.330
You have young people
taking off their lives.

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:53.530
You have people hiding
themselves, like you say,

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:54.150
in house.

00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:59.080
And there's a lack of education.

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.680
There's a lack of prevention.

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.470
There's a lack of repression.

00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:04.930
But there's also beautiful
things, as you mentioned.

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:06.810
There's also
creating a community.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:10.300
And there's also initiatives,
like an app called ReThink

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.010
that I shared with you.

00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:14.690
So that app, which you
can download online--

00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:19.000
it's called ReThink-- it scans
your words that you're typing.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.880
And it allows you to post before
posting, basically telling you,

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:23.380
hm.

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.350
Are you sure you
want to do that now?

00:58:25.350 --> 00:58:29.230
And 93% of the 50,000
users have decided

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:30.970
not to post the
message they were

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:34.720
writing in the first place.

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.580
To what extent do you think
technology can educate them,

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:39.550
educate those haters?

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:43.649
Or is it just a battle
we will never fight?

00:58:43.649 --> 00:58:45.440
It will have been black
people in the past.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.398
It will have been gays.

00:58:46.398 --> 00:58:47.170
And it is trans.

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:49.000
It will be something
else I'm against.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
I have a lot of hate.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.400
But what do you feel about that?

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.191
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:58:53.191 --> 00:58:56.420
I mean, see, I think when
people write hateful stuff,

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.830
they're not seeing the person
on the other side of the screen.

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:03.010
So there is no sort of concept
of a human being there.

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:04.960
And so it's easy to write stuff.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.240
It's easy to write stuff
that you wouldn't say face

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.220
to face to somebody.

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:14.800
And I would never tweet
in anger or would never

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.407
write an email in
anger, because you

00:59:16.407 --> 00:59:18.240
know you're going to
regret it the next day.

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.706
FINLAY WILSON: You a
better person than me.

00:59:20.706 --> 00:59:21.532
[LAUGHS]

00:59:21.532 --> 00:59:23.990
AOIFE MARTIN: You just know
you're going to regret someday.

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:31.180
And I think that having an
app that sort of captures

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.330
that, I don't know
if it works or not.

00:59:34.330 --> 00:59:36.190
I mean, I would
hope people would

00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:39.250
have enough
self-perception to realize

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:41.440
to know what they're doing.

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.980
But obviously, that
isn't the case.

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:44.800
JULIEN FINLAY: Finlay, before
I conclude and really open

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.690
the conversation
and before you tell

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:50.170
us more about your full hatred
emails that you regret--

00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:52.170
FINLAY WILSON: It mostly
involved my ex-husband.

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:53.609
But that's a different thing.

00:59:53.609 --> 00:59:54.650
JULIEN FINLAY: Oh, juicy.

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.350
Same topic-- would you be aware?

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.345
Or would you know any ways
technology can somehow--

01:00:03.345 --> 01:00:04.970
FINLAY WILSON: I find
that interesting.

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.220
Obviously, the user would
have to consent to its use.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.136
This is the thing about
policing the internet.

01:00:09.136 --> 01:00:12.620
We can't have that
going out for everybody.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.300
But to give people
that moment of pause,

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.795
where the perhaps
taught hateful impulse

01:00:17.795 --> 01:00:20.390
is the first thing
that is there.

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:23.060
Maybe that small pause is
enough of a window for empathy

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.410
to come in.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:30.990
But empathy is that big part.

01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:35.040
You almost cannot exist now
and not know somebody-- well,

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.180
maybe--

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:39.480
not know somebody
that is gay, trans.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.820
You will know someone.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.810
There will be someone
in your family

01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:47.230
that you can look at and
acknowledge their humanity, so

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:51.350
much so, to the point that when
we teach our yoga teachers,

01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:52.150
it's like, OK.

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.010
You need to remember you're
working with humans, not just

01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:55.640
machines and make
them do X, Y, and Z.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.030
So we make them sit and look
each other, uninterrupted,

01:00:58.030 --> 01:01:01.390
in their eyes for like minutes.

01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:03.070
It's really uncomfortable.

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:12.430
But they usually end up seeing
mirrored what they are seeing.

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:14.930
So they will soften.

01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:16.430
And so even though
they may have had

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:17.888
some animosity
towards that person,

01:01:17.888 --> 01:01:19.340
they will see a kinship.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:22.200
They can't get
that from a screen.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.010
They see something.

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:25.200
There might be some
other insidious thing,

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.004
like a jealousy.

01:01:26.004 --> 01:01:27.170
There might be a bitterness.

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.269
There might be some other
story that comes in.

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:30.810
And they forget that
the other person

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:34.610
has just as unique and valid
a story as anybody else.

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:37.810
And the screen is the barrier.

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:39.760
In person, it's
very unusual for me

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.160
to have somebody spout
venom to my face.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.730
It's more it will always be
hating behind the screen.

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:51.470
JULIEN FINLAY: Let's have
all your questions heard.

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:54.815
Oh, thanks, [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:54.815 --> 01:01:55.315
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:55.315 --> 01:01:57.231
FINLAY WILSON: You
have to do the work.

01:01:57.231 --> 01:01:59.626
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:02.050
AUDIENCE: Is this on?

01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:03.244
This is on.

01:02:03.244 --> 01:02:04.910
Thank you so much for
talking so openly.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:06.630
I wanted to ask about--

01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:11.090
you spoke a little about how
harassment online and hate

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:17.210
online will lead you to police
or regulate your online posts

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:19.640
and self-expression online.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.140
You spoke a little about
how you set your self

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.460
doubt even before you
step out the door, even.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.190
I guess I just wanted to
ask more broadly about how

01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:31.640
being online in general and
being influential online

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.414
has maybe caused you to regulate
or police or expression.

01:02:34.414 --> 01:02:36.080
You mentioned a little
bit earlier about

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.240
how there's a studio you're
aware of who replicate

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.706
your poses on a frequent basis.

01:02:40.706 --> 01:02:42.080
And so you're
mindful of how they

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.220
might perceive you responding
negatively to online hate.

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.630
And so I wonder in general how--

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:50.450
not cyberbullying, but
I guess cyber-validation

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:52.970
or cyber-fandom has
maybe caused you

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:58.530
to regulate or police or alter
your online self-expression,

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.440
or even offline?

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.660
JULIEN FINLAY: Aoife, do
you want to take that first?

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.451
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:11.120
So I don't think it's affected
me too much in that sense.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.389
I'm quite outspoken
about what I talk about.

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:14.930
I'm quite outspoken
about, obviously,

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:16.829
about trans rights
is probably primarily

01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:17.870
what I talk about online.

01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:19.460
And I'm sure people
are going, oh, god.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.050
There she goes again,
off on one of her rants

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:22.000
in one of her threads.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.110
And so I'm more sort of
self-conscious sometimes

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:25.610
about it.

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:26.780
I'm going, oh, do
people actually

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:27.860
want to listen to this again?

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.540
Do people want to hear
this sort of stuff again?

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:31.040
Because I know I
tweet about it a lot.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.150
And I talk about it a lot.

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:33.816
And I'm going, are
people going to think

01:03:33.816 --> 01:03:35.420
I'm being a little
bit narcissistic

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:37.117
about this and with that?

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:39.450
So I think that's more of how
I sort of regulate myself.

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:43.250
I don't do as many long posts
or threads as I used to do.

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:46.670
Because I think I have the
same bunch of followers.

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:48.420
And they're obviously
aware of my politics

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.836
and aware of where
I'm coming from

01:03:49.836 --> 01:03:52.490
and aware of what I talk about.

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:56.270
And so yeah, I think it's
more I'm much more self-aware

01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:57.020
than I used to be.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:01.264
I'm much more afraid that
I'm actually boring people

01:04:01.264 --> 01:04:02.430
with my stuff now, you know?

01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:07.710
So generally, I hold back
a little because of that.

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:10.516
But I had a thread
this week, because it's

01:04:10.516 --> 01:04:11.390
Trans Awareness Week.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.870
And sometimes if the muse
just strikes, I'll just go.

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:16.100
And I'll write away.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.294
And I'll just post what
I'm thinking, so post first

01:04:18.294 --> 01:04:20.210
and then regret later
sort of thing, you know?

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:24.800
FINLAY WILSON: I mean,
certainly for me,

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.330
Instagram is my main platform.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:29.540
It's been where it's
always been a journal

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.460
of my practice, my yoga practice
and kind of what's going on,

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.650
day to day.

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:38.340
So that part continues.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.520
I use it to catalog some of
the work breakthroughs I have.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.400
But those things
that happen there,

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.040
they don't make it into
my classroom environment.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.120
I'm just more aware--

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.970
that example of there's
a class that looks at it.

01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:55.400
They are probably
looking at the poses,

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.900
because they are six,
six or seven years old.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.940
So they're unlikely to
be reading the politics

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.400
or me rambling on at somebody.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.494
But it still is a thought
that they are looking at it.

01:05:08.494 --> 01:05:13.670
But I still stand by and have
always stood by, in person,

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:17.000
if I see somebody going after me
or going after somebody that I

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.007
care about, I'm going
to speak up about it.

01:05:19.007 --> 01:05:20.840
If that's happening,
I'll speak up about it.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.214
Even when I was
at high school, I

01:05:22.214 --> 01:05:25.700
set up this anti-bullying
network in my school.

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:29.180
So that bit has been there.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:34.850
As for the online, the
online stuff for me,

01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:35.840
that's not fabricated.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.677
That's my every day.

01:05:36.677 --> 01:05:39.260
That's why the floor looks dirty
and the windows aren't clean.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.760
Yesterday, I
accidentally showed you

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.710
a video of the toilet
because I forgot

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:44.090
to shut the bathroom door.

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:45.620
So I like to think
that I'm being

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.640
as transparent as possible.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.700
And even though some of
my posts are generated

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:55.220
in a reactionary way,
it's still my genuine take

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:56.150
on the situation.

01:05:56.150 --> 01:06:00.420
So I'm still able
to, even though--

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:04.220
has it become a
validation anymore?

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:07.780
I think it's more like I
feel more appreciated when

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.060
the voice feels heard,
and especially when

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.550
I hear the rally cry go
out, when people are like,

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:14.350
this has happened to me as well.

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:15.940
And that's powerful.

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.440
Because the young
me didn't have that.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.270
The young me was so
isolated, even when

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.610
I was starting to
come out, there

01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:27.445
were events and things happening
there that were so destructive.

01:06:27.445 --> 01:06:30.040
There were things that happened
when I was way young that

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:30.920
were so destructive.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.330
Actually, I've even tried to
speak to my partner about it

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:34.930
face-to-face.

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:38.650
He said, I can never understand
what you went through.

01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:39.550
And that's it.

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:42.040
And even though he may not
mean to put a wall there,

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.709
there's a solid wall there.

01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:46.000
So for example, you speak to
someone about child abuse.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.940
And their hackles are up.

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:52.810
But if I write about that,
it's like a pebble in a pond.

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:54.102
And the ripples will reach out.

01:06:54.102 --> 01:06:56.601
And some of the other people
that have been affected by that

01:06:56.601 --> 01:06:58.920
will actually gather together
and feel heartened by it.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.990
And actually, I
feel like that's--

01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:05.290
I would never think putting
a sexual abuse story online

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:07.720
is looking for validation.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:13.066
But it is looking for an outlet
to put the emotion to paper,

01:07:13.066 --> 01:07:14.190
usually for the first time.

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:15.170
So usually when I'm
writing, I'm not

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:17.360
writing there on my
computer, or being like,

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.530
let's see how long--

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:19.640
let's edit this.

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.610
It's just coming out of my head.

01:07:22.610 --> 01:07:24.650
And very rarely do
I edit unless I've

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:27.170
had like an absolute
autocorrect error.

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:31.020
But it's as direct
as I can make it.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.270
Some of it may be reactionary.

01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:34.520
But I'm not policing it too
much, if that makes sense.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.987
I'm trying to be as
genuine as possible.

01:07:36.987 --> 01:07:38.070
And I try to dumb it down.

01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:41.580
Because my yoga classes, I am--

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.524
well, it's a show.

01:07:42.524 --> 01:07:43.440
Let's put it that way.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.400
It's a show.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.441
JULIEN FINLAY: All right.

01:07:45.441 --> 01:07:46.820
We're all going at 4:00 PM.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.028
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah, I think
that's a very good point.

01:07:49.028 --> 01:07:50.824
I mean, there are
some subjects I'm

01:07:50.824 --> 01:07:51.990
uncomfortable talking about.

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:53.890
Because I don't know
how to express myself.

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:56.319
And it's certainly
around gender dysphoria,

01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:58.360
but the feelings of
dysphoria and what it's like.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.943
Because it's very
hard to explain that

01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:02.100
to somebody who isn't trans.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:06.250
And I do write bits and pieces
about it when I can or when--

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:09.150
and it does, as you said,
those ripples, they go out.

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.880
People see it.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.730
People who are going
through the same thing

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:13.630
will take some sort of
validation from that.

01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:16.410
And they go, well, I'm not the
only one who feels like that.

01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:17.920
And it's nice to get that.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.679
And when I see people
writing about dysphoria,

01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:23.880
well, yeah, I see that
describes perfectly how I feel.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.080
You get it.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.439
Whereas, a lot of people
just don't understand it.

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:31.260
And it's very hard for somebody
who hasn't experienced it

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.702
to understand what it's like.

01:08:32.702 --> 01:08:34.410
FINLAY WILSON: I think
that was the power

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:36.810
behind the Me Too movement.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:38.882
There are lots of
those movements that

01:08:38.882 --> 01:08:40.590
happened that didn't
get as much traction

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:42.090
as the Me Too movement.

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:44.899
But on the back of
that, actually, there

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:49.660
were a lot of men, for example,
that also used the same tag

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.790
and said, actually,
it's us as well.

01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:54.080
It's all of us.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.600
And so sometimes,
these social movements

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.840
can be so positive, so powerful.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.580
But it does take
people to do it,

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:07.180
to have that unaltered voice.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:07.786
Yeah.

01:09:07.786 --> 01:09:09.910
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah, just
to know you're not alone--

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:11.000
that's the main thing.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:11.985
You know you're not
the only person who

01:09:11.985 --> 01:09:12.901
have experienced this.

01:09:12.901 --> 01:09:13.939
You are not on your own.

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:15.351
FINLAY WILSON: Yeah.

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.850
JULIEN FINLAY: We
have two questions

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:18.870
posted online internally.

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:21.410
So it's policed and controlled.

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:23.779
But then we can have more
questions from you all.

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:24.830
FINLAY WILSON: Hopefully,
they took a minute

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:26.080
to reflect on what they wrote.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.149
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:29.569
JULIEN FINLAY: There's
one [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:29.569 --> 01:09:32.390
The first one I have is--

01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:33.390
will be for both of you.

01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:36.680
So body positivity is
impacted by negativity

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.130
from those around you.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:41.470
Like bullying, those
with weight issues

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:45.550
are excluded and
treated, assumed lazy.

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:48.069
Those who experience
this feel isolated

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:50.529
and driving depression.

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:53.609
How can, at Google--
but I would say,

01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:56.220
how can any tech companies--

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.780
can we be truly inclusive?

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:01.030
And can we see everyone
as a worthy person?

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.550
That's a very good question.

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:04.133
AOIFE MARTIN: That's
a great question.

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:06.642
And I'm not sure
I can answer it.

01:10:06.642 --> 01:10:09.360
Body positivity, yeah,
that's a huge thing for me.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.610
It's something I
struggle with myself.

01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:16.440
And I, yeah, I'm a
middle-aged, fat, trans woman.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.040
And the word fat is something I
find it very difficult to say.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.042
I find it very
difficult to actually--

01:10:22.042 --> 01:10:24.417
that was probably the first
time I've used this publicly,

01:10:24.417 --> 01:10:27.630
to say that word, the
F word, as I call it.

01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:30.810
And yeah, it's something
I struggle with.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:32.350
I hate photographs of myself.

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:34.890
I hate seeing pictures
of myself online.

01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:38.310
I do it because I'm trying
to be more positive about,

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:39.130
this is me.

01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:40.860
This is what I look like.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.740
Accept it or walk away.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.470
But I still find it
very, very difficult.

01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:47.340
I've done a couple
of portrait sessions

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.660
for some trans projects
that I'm involved in.

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:53.310
And again, I'm
doing it because I'm

01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:56.850
trying to be more open about
who I am and be more positive

01:10:56.850 --> 01:10:58.142
and be more body positive.

01:10:58.142 --> 01:10:59.850
But I still find it
very, very difficult.

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:02.391
And it's something I find very,
very difficult to talk about.

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.950
And someday, I
probably will, I'll

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:09.270
write a lot about
this when I get there.

01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:13.140
And I think it's
only by sort of--

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.420
again, it's representation.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:19.020
It's showing different bodies,
different people, people

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:22.710
of different color, gender,
sexualities, body shapes,

01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:25.110
body types.

01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:27.250
We are inundated with
images all the time

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:30.810
of thin, white, blonde
people generally.

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:33.920
And we need to get away
from that sort of thing.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.000
People's bodies are--
everybody's different.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.240
Not everybody is thin.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.676
Not everybody is tall.

01:11:38.676 --> 01:11:40.050
Not everybody is
white or blonde.

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:41.880
So we need to--

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.727
I think, yeah, we should
be promoting that.

01:11:45.727 --> 01:11:46.560
JULIEN FINLAY: Yeah.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.380
And we all have F words,
I guess, as demons.

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.630
But thank you for saying this.

01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:52.950
And I'm sorry I asked
you for the picture now.

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:53.490
I feel like--

01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:54.531
AOIFE MARTIN: Oh, no, no.

01:11:54.531 --> 01:11:57.930
That's actually-- that was done
in a photo booth at MasterCard.

01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:01.900
And that one's fine, because
it's only from chest up,

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.970
which is grand.

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:04.844
JULIEN FINLAY: Finlay,
I know body positivity

01:12:04.844 --> 01:12:09.990
is one of your main, well,
energy that is driving you.

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.700
Tell us more.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.450
FINLAY WILSON: For me,
I don't necessarily

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:15.720
see that as something that
someone else has responsibility

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.470
for.

01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:19.140
When I have people coming
in, and they're coming in,

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.360
and they have this
negative self-image,

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.040
then my drive is to get
them to do the work.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.240
And that's the
work of acceptance.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.760
So part of yoga is
this shift of being

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.760
more conscious about your
actions, how you move,

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.897
but also practicing
acceptance of what is going on

01:12:37.897 --> 01:12:40.230
or what your current reality
is and what your powers are

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.390
to change and affect things.

01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:45.360
So that process and
one of journaling

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.490
and of introspection,
that begins

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:52.900
the work of beginning to
care for the organism.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:56.110
And if you are willing to
do the work of the care,

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:57.750
it doesn't matter how it looks.

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:00.090
It doesn't matter
how the post looks.

01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:02.055
I work with people with
multiple disabilities.

01:13:02.055 --> 01:13:03.930
They're not looking on
the Instagram channels

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:05.513
and being like, well,
I can't do that.

01:13:05.513 --> 01:13:07.980
They are interested in
creating a shape that

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.920
will work for them.

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.420
And they feel something
and feel steady in it.

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:15.360
So yoga is great in this
adaptable way of teaching

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.100
people the skills
to begin to practice

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.900
acceptance of themselves.

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:21.151
I and I think that's
where it needs to start.

01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:22.650
If it doesn't start
from there, then

01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:24.990
it is that external validation
from another to say,

01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:26.290
I need you to be OK with me.

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:26.790
No.

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:28.560
You need to be OK with you.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.060
If you're not OK
with you, then this

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.809
is where it's all
going to go wrong.

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.350
And this is where
the haters come in.

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:36.750
And they make that
process harder.

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:39.500
But on a daily basis, it
can be incredibly helpful.

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.070
Now this is where
I'm going to get

01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:44.430
killed by the yoga community,
because not all yoga is created

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:45.660
equal.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:49.260
My first yoga teacher
drove me to bulimia.

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:51.000
Because she said,
you look this way.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.070
You've got this fat back here.

01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:56.880
I had like a 38-inch waist,
which I don't have now.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.160
And she was like, this bit
here, that pose, this twist,

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.267
is not going to work.

01:14:01.267 --> 01:14:03.600
Let me teach you this ancient
cleansing technique, which

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.160
was basically sticking your
finger down your throat

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.920
and vomiting in a bucket, so
that I could lose the weight.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.460
And, oh, I lost the weight.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.630
I lost a lot of weight.

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:12.430
I lost all my self-respect.

01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.490
I then started torturing
myself with food.

01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:16.170
Then I kind of
got into cleanses,

01:14:16.170 --> 01:14:17.760
where I would say,
oh, I'm detoxing,

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.176
which basically was code for
I'm just drinking water today

01:14:20.176 --> 01:14:21.960
because I don't deserve to eat.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.021
And it really actually drove
me into this very dark place.

01:14:25.021 --> 01:14:26.520
And then actually,
the style of yoga

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.430
that I teach now, the first
class of that that I went to,

01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:31.950
it was the very first moment.

01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:34.770
And I had already been teaching
yoga for about three years.

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:37.220
I was still struggling
with an eating disorder.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:42.270
I was so part bulimic but was
also skipping meals and making

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:45.450
it a health choice,
was skipping meals,

01:14:45.450 --> 01:14:49.020
was not in great
shape health-wise.

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.270
And I went onto to this class.

01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:52.360
It was the first time
ever in a yoga class

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:57.600
that an instructor had
asked me to feel how I felt.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.590
And it was just like,
take a deep breath.

01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:02.722
Feel somewhere in your body that
is sore and needs attention.

01:15:02.722 --> 01:15:03.930
I had never done that before.

01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:05.670
I was like, what
the fuck is this?

01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:08.200
Who is this hippy?

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.490
And--

01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:12.400
JULIEN FINLAY: Says the guy
wearing a kilt with a beard.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.680
FINLAY WILSON: Do not
call me a hipster, sir,

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.090
despite all of this.

01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:19.996
So by the end of that class--

01:15:19.996 --> 01:15:22.120
it was a two-hour class--
by the end of that class,

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.350
I was sitting there,
shell-shocked.

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:25.474
Because I had invested a
lot of my energy and stuff

01:15:25.474 --> 01:15:26.090
in my career.

01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:27.756
And I was like, I'm
a good yoga teacher.

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.660
I am totally at top of my game.

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:32.320
And after that class,
I felt that everything

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.290
I had learned-- this is after
one class-- everything was

01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:39.180
a deception and that I had
to face up to in that moment

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:42.690
that I had been damaging
myself and calling it healing.

01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:45.431
And that was a real gear shift.

01:15:45.431 --> 01:15:46.930
And so that was
when I started doing

01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:48.520
the work of introspection.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.240
Because the work I'd been doing
before had been a distraction,

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.740
which isn't the same.

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.790
So I was doing the yoga.

01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:56.860
I was doing the
physical exercises.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.810
But I was using it
to punish my body.

01:15:58.810 --> 01:16:01.110
I wasn't using it to heal it.

01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:02.810
And it was only when
I made that shift

01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:04.870
and I really changed
styles of yoga

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:07.810
that I was actually able
to really feel for that.

01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:09.509
And that was powerful.

01:16:09.509 --> 01:16:10.300
I did this process.

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.597
It's called the shamanic death--

01:16:12.597 --> 01:16:13.180
very dramatic.

01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:14.680
I love drama.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:19.860
And you're led through this
visualization ceremony, where

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.820
your last day on
earth is simulated,

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:24.520
where you're made to write down
essentially a letter to all

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.710
of your loved ones.

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:28.240
You're made to look
at all the ways

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.270
that you have wasted your
life, the things you've

01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:32.530
done to yourself.

01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:34.420
And then ceremonially, you die.

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:36.640
You obviously don't die--

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.630
spoiler.

01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:38.800
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.530
You obviously don't die.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:44.380
But when you are
brought back, you

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.352
are made to make these
affirmations of things

01:16:47.352 --> 01:16:48.560
that you will never do again.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.059
And from that moment,
the first time

01:16:50.059 --> 01:16:51.980
I did that process, that was it.

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:54.960
The eating disorder stopped,
because I was able to identify.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.820
I was like, this is
ruining your life.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.080
This is making you
less than who you are.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:00.790
And that was it.

01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:02.084
It stopped.

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.500
And it was at that
moment as well,

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.060
where I was like,
there's a fight in you.

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.140
And you need to bring it.

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.514
And that's actually-- from
that moment was when I started

01:17:08.514 --> 01:17:09.850
thinking, I need to teach kids.

01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:11.951
I need to create a safe
space for children.

01:17:11.951 --> 01:17:14.450
I need to create a safe space
for children with disabilities

01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:15.080
and teach them.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.750
And when I teach them,
I am unashamedly me.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:19.292
They know me.

01:17:19.292 --> 01:17:21.250
They know that I'm going
to come in in the most

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:22.200
outrageous leggings.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.270
And so will they.

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:26.260
And I love that.

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.300
JULIEN FINLAY: Accepting
yourself, and you said.

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:28.880
All right.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.860
More questions, please.

01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:33.110
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:34.810
I love the sound
of my own voice.

01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:36.060
JULIEN FINLAY: I love it, too.

01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.280
AUDIENCE: And this is
not even a question.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.540
It's just a comment.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.250
It's just about body positivity.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.679
We had a speaker
here from ShoutOut,

01:17:44.679 --> 01:17:46.220
this very important
Irish charity who

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.930
do LGBT workshops in schools.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:50.150
And she had this very
interesting comment a year ago,

01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:52.370
where she said she came out
as bi when she was nine.

01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:54.620
But she came out
as fat in her 30s,

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:59.870
and to realize that she's not
a thin woman in a fat woman's

01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:02.030
body, that this is who she is.

01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:04.790
And I think it was a very
important point about that body

01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:07.109
positivity often tends to
be about, oh, come here.

01:18:07.109 --> 01:18:08.150
You'll get there one day.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:11.720
We accept all body sizes
that diverge from the norm,

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.000
implying there is a norm.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.230
And you know, we tolerate.

01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:17.188
But ideally, you should
work with someone else.

01:18:17.188 --> 01:18:19.700
And we all, many of us-- god
knows I did-- replicate this

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.980
when we congratulate someone
when they lose weight,

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.480
like, hey, well done.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.140
Good job.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:26.400
You're one step closer
to being normal.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.140
And so I guess I just wanted
to echoed that sentiment,

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:31.280
that it's in all these--

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.988
I don't want to call
it microaggressions.

01:18:32.988 --> 01:18:35.810
But I guess it's all in
these tiny, little steps we

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:37.959
can take with each other
to just be more inclusive.

01:18:37.959 --> 01:18:38.750
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:39.450
I think that's great a point.

01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:41.324
I mean, actually, I met
with Bella this week.

01:18:41.324 --> 01:18:43.490
I actually had dinner
with her on Tuesday night.

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:47.540
And she did mention
that to me as well,

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.260
that of her sort of coming
out moment, not just

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:52.370
as bi, but as a fat person.

01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:54.470
And I thought it was
wonderfully inspiring.

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:57.470
So it's given me
food for thought--

01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:58.750
food being the operative word.

01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:03.210
And yeah, so I'm going
to certainly try and be

01:19:03.210 --> 01:19:05.150
a bit more body
positive about myself.

01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:06.800
Because this is who I am.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.794
And I don't see why I
should change just to--

01:19:10.794 --> 01:19:12.460
being trans is one
thing, because you're

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:16.585
changing your body anyway,
with hormones and blockers.

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:17.960
You can put on
two to three stone

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:21.470
just by taking
estrogen, which isn't

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:22.967
helping me get any thinner.

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:24.800
So I just need to accept
who I am, you know,

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.167
and just love
myself for how I am.

01:19:27.167 --> 01:19:29.000
JULIEN FINLAY: And you
beautiful as you are.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.215
And we are delighted
having beautiful panels.

01:19:31.215 --> 01:19:33.090
Do you want to add
something to that, Finlay,

01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:33.890
on body positivity?

01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:36.940
Have you already discussed?

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:37.970
You don't have to.

01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:40.230
FINLAY WILSON: I
mean, certainly--

01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:46.317
I mean, in the yoga world, I
tell all of my students that

01:19:46.317 --> 01:19:48.650
buy yoga magazines-- this is
me not going to get my yoga

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.829
magazine subscription
or paid from them--

01:19:50.829 --> 01:19:53.120
I say to them, it's like,
please stop buying this trash

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.953
and actually donate
your money to a charity.

01:19:54.953 --> 01:19:56.790
That would be lovely.

01:19:56.790 --> 01:20:01.440
Because it is just
adverts of thin women

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.535
selling yoga leggings.

01:20:02.535 --> 01:20:03.810
And that's all it is.

01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:04.960
It's all that it is.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.480
And those of you are like,
oh, no, it's more than that.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.740
It's women selling crystals.

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:08.240
Yeah.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:10.890
And the woman
selling the crystals

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.900
is also thin and
blonde and perfect.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:15.240
So it's like, bah.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.550
But what I love is the
yoga studio that I teach

01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:21.800
at that I helped set
up, when the people,

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.740
when everybody comes to
our studio, everybody

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:27.350
who is anybody, they
come to the studio

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:30.590
because they can do
the class regardless.

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:32.300
It's not like, a, oh, come in.

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.877
We'll help you lose the weight.

01:20:34.877 --> 01:20:36.960
That isn't the message
they get when they come in.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.010
It's like, come on in.

01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:40.930
We'll see what happens.

01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:43.180
JULIEN FINLAY: All right.

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:46.270
Do you have any other questions,
anything that's on your mind?

01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:47.470
When is the next class?

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:50.631
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:20:50.631 --> 01:20:51.130
I'm Laura.

01:20:51.130 --> 01:20:56.775
And I have a question, because
I was active for animal rights

01:20:56.775 --> 01:20:57.400
some years ago.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:01.401
And I got a lot of hate from
online and from my friends

01:21:01.401 --> 01:21:01.900
as well.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.360
And especially, I
think if you get

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.540
this hate from people
you like or your friends,

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:09.700
it's a lot more hurtful.

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.380
And I just wanted to know if
you dealt with this as well,

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.230
and if you dealt with
it in a different way

01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:19.900
than with those
anonymous people online?

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:21.760
FINLAY WILSON: Yeah, totally--

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.000
I remember sharing,
I think it was

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.910
when I shared about Scotland
getting same-sex marriage.

01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:28.570
I shared that.

01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:31.270
And one of our friends were
like, this is a travesty.

01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:32.590
And I wrote a letter to them.

01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:35.600
And I said, look, I
need you to acknowledge

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.509
that by saying this, you are
invalidating me as a person.

01:21:39.509 --> 01:21:42.050
You're saying I don't deserve
to have the same rights as you.

01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:44.450
But you still think
that we can be friends.

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:48.050
I cannot be friends with you if
this is how you're going to be.

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:49.100
I cannot.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.220
I'm not going to whore
myself out so that you

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.436
feel more comfortable.

01:21:53.436 --> 01:21:56.820
I'm not going to downplay
myself so that you feel better

01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:57.480
about yourself.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.940
I'm not doing it, no way.

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:01.669
So get back on there.

01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:02.460
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.918
I mean, that's something I'm
struggling with at the moment.

01:22:04.918 --> 01:22:06.540
And I have family
members who don't

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:09.390
accept who I am and expect--

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:11.700
they still call me
by my birth name

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:17.510
and won't meet me unless
I'm my former self.

01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:19.190
And I've just said, no.

01:22:19.190 --> 01:22:20.000
I'm not doing that.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.189
This is who I am.

01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:22.730
I've struggled with
this for so long.

01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:23.690
And I've come out.

01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:25.530
And I'm not going to
go back into that role.

01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:28.940
And if you can't
accept that, then we'll

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:30.720
just have to not see each other.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.684
And it's hurtful.

01:22:32.684 --> 01:22:34.850
FINLAY WILSON: I would for
you to be part of my life

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:36.420
and accept me for who I am.

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.110
And if you cannot do that, then
I'm not going to change for you

01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:41.190
to be in part of my life.

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:42.549
It's legit.

01:22:42.549 --> 01:22:44.090
I mean, I had some
family members not

01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:45.006
show up to my wedding.

01:22:45.006 --> 01:22:46.599
And it was like, I hear you.

01:22:46.599 --> 01:22:47.390
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:48.098
This is who I am.

01:22:48.098 --> 01:22:48.740
And that's it.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:50.315
I can't change it.

01:22:50.315 --> 01:22:51.320
Or sorry, I can.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.220
But I'm not going to.

01:22:55.496 --> 01:22:56.870
FINLAY WILSON:
You are being you.

01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:58.610
They are the ones
exerting the choice

01:22:58.610 --> 01:23:01.480
to be the bigoted asshole.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.910
JULIEN FINLAY: They
identify as assholes.

01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:05.156
That's [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:05.156 --> 01:23:06.280
You had a question as well?

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.230
Raising hands?

01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:12.010
Nodding heads?

01:23:15.269 --> 01:23:17.310
AUDIENCE: I, too, love
the sound of my own voice.

01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:21.540
No, really quickly, it's
mostly to do with the amount

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.370
of attention we give hate.

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:25.200
So I know that
we've spoken a lot,

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.170
and the panel has said a
lot, about the comments

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.480
they remember, these
hateful, spiteful comments.

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:33.030
But we haven't once
mentioned those good comments

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:35.070
that we do get on those posts.

01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:37.987
And is it that really-- and this
is directed to both of you--

01:23:37.987 --> 01:23:39.570
that we are giving
too much attention?

01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:40.861
We are remembering these posts.

01:23:40.861 --> 01:23:42.720
And therefore, we're
glorifying them.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.780
I mean, even with the media,
we have celebrities reading out

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:46.590
mean tweets.

01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:48.840
They don't read out the ones
that are nice about them.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.209
So is it that we are
creating this cycle?

01:23:51.209 --> 01:23:53.250
Because we are giving too
much attention to those

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:53.850
hateful posts.

01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:57.450
And therefore, we're just
encouraging that kind

01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:59.010
of negative attention.

01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:00.930
FINLAY WILSON: I feel
like the positive--

01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:03.090
I aim to acknowledge
the positive as much

01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:05.400
as the negative when it
comes in as comments.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.340
Obviously, I will respond to
the positive with a lot more

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.050
empathy and kindness.

01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:14.020
But the negative, it's that what
we were speaking about earlier.

01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.060
If we don't address the fact
that the negative is happening,

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.600
it's not going to
make it go away.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.730
And if we pretend that
it isn't happening,

01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:23.690
then we are complicit.

01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:26.650
And I think that's the danger.

01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:30.270
Certainly, when people
message me and I ask,

01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:33.322
can I share your comment
because it was really lovely,

01:24:33.322 --> 01:24:34.780
some [INAUDIBLE]
the right to say--

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:35.720
some say no.

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.040
And so I don't get to
share some of that stuff.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.330
So I can't share or
repost a lot of stuff.

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:42.670
But when I can, I do.

01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:45.440
But it is that thing of like,
if the negative comes in

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.580
and we don't actually address
it, then it does start--

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.800
it normalizes that.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.670
And that's, I think, both
of us standing up and being

01:24:55.670 --> 01:24:58.150
these voices that
speak out like that.

01:24:58.150 --> 01:25:00.170
I want the young kids
that I would teach

01:25:00.170 --> 01:25:01.730
to know that that's not OK.

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.313
If somebody says
that to them, they're

01:25:03.313 --> 01:25:06.140
just going to quietly put it
to bed and then just go home.

01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:12.410
It might raise in them
that same fire to resist.

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:13.729
Does that make sense?

01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:14.520
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.310
I think just being nice is
sort of the default position.

01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:19.890
I mean, it shouldn't be.

01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:22.680
It's not a hard line
to achieve, I think.

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.670
And 90% of the
stuff I get online

01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:28.630
is positive and is
very, very kind.

01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:30.240
And people are very,
very supportive.

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:36.150
It's that 10% of negativity,
where you want to address that.

01:25:36.150 --> 01:25:39.100
And you want to say,
look, this is out there.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.210
And if we don't talk about
it or if we don't address it,

01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:43.950
it's just going to spread.

01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:48.270
And there is the thing
about, again, not

01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:52.290
conforming people, not
conforming Nazis and giving

01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:54.870
them voices on the
media, and not performing

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:57.810
certain viewpoints is,
I think there is a lot

01:25:57.810 --> 01:26:00.940
to be said for that as well,
in that certain things aren't

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:01.440
a debate.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.640
My life is not a debate.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.230
But I think this week on
one of the BBC channels,

01:26:07.230 --> 01:26:12.560
there was a guy on who said he
identified as 20 years younger.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.820
And so they had a trans
woman on, debating with him.

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:16.330
I'm going, why are
you doing this?

01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:18.480
Why are you equating
this with somebody

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.830
who has gender dysphoria?

01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:21.520
It's a completely
different issue.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.090
But in the minds of the popular,
they're going, oh, yeah.

01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:26.631
If that guy is silly, obviously,
trans people are silly, too.

01:26:26.631 --> 01:26:28.860
Because how can you identify
as something you're not?

01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:30.943
FINLAY WILSON: I mean, I
identify as a helicopter.

01:26:30.943 --> 01:26:34.774
And it's just like, this
is not what is being said,

01:26:34.774 --> 01:26:35.940
it's not what is being said.

01:26:36.187 --> 01:26:38.520
AOIFE MARTIN: There was an
article in the "Sunday Times"

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.470
this week, where Rod
Liddle said, oh, I

01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:42.995
want to identify as a
black trans chihuahua.

01:26:42.995 --> 01:26:45.314
I was like, all
you're doing is just

01:26:45.314 --> 01:26:46.980
saying hurtful things
about trans people

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.480
by putting that as an article.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.310
FINLAY WILSON: Acknowledging
that there is--

01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:50.925
AOIFE MARTIN: You're
negating our experience.

01:26:50.925 --> 01:26:52.549
FINLAY WILSON: --but
also acknowledging

01:26:52.549 --> 01:26:54.480
marginalized hurt and
then making fun of it.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.750
AOIFE MARTIN: Yeah.

01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:58.920
FINLAY WILSON:
That's really not OK.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.490
So almost thinking about
the negativity, what

01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:04.740
was happening in the airport
first thing this morning,

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:07.239
admittedly, it was an ungodly
hour that I was in the airport

01:27:07.239 --> 01:27:08.010
this morning.

01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:14.070
But a simple act of
speaking out can do wonders.

01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:17.970
The simple act of picking
up the trays at security

01:27:17.970 --> 01:27:20.130
and putting them back,
because it was backing up

01:27:20.130 --> 01:27:22.410
because nobody had
the basic courtesy

01:27:22.410 --> 01:27:23.737
to pick up their own damn tray.

01:27:23.737 --> 01:27:25.320
So I picked up five
and put them away.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.000
And suddenly, everything
was easy again.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.240
So in the face of an
onslaught of negativity,

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:33.690
if we don't speak out
about it, it mounts up.

01:27:33.690 --> 01:27:37.800
And without sounding
militant, they

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:42.100
begin to win because they
don't meet any resistance.

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.190
And they expect us to
just quietly resist.

01:27:45.190 --> 01:27:47.287
And it's not the time for that.

01:27:47.287 --> 01:27:49.370
I mean, rights have been
stripped away in America.

01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:52.720
Now if I go into a restaurant
in America with my partner,

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.400
they can refuse
service on the basis

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:57.290
that we are a same-sex couple.

01:27:57.290 --> 01:27:59.780
That's disgusting.

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:03.980
And what happens in the
States could happen in the UK

01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.770
just as easily.

01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:09.200
These opinions aren't small.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.840
These aren't being said
by insignificant people.

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.850
Some of the trolls run
countries, you know?

01:28:15.850 --> 01:28:17.269
That's frightening.

01:28:17.269 --> 01:28:18.060
That's frightening.

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.397
And trans rights as well--

01:28:19.397 --> 01:28:21.230
there was something
that went out just about

01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:23.480
two weeks ago in the States,
where they're saying, actually,

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:25.550
trans people now need
to have a genetic test

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:29.850
to say what their
actual birth gender is

01:28:29.850 --> 01:28:31.314
through genetic testing.

01:28:31.314 --> 01:28:33.730
JULIEN FINLAY: Focusing on the
right and the good comments

01:28:33.730 --> 01:28:34.870
instead of the wrong.

01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:36.040
All right.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.220
On this note, so
we come to the end.

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:42.100
We have some bubbles
and non-bubbles

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:43.334
and biscuits and whatever.

01:28:43.334 --> 01:28:44.500
They're just waiting for us.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:47.260
They made a big bang
when I started talking.

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:51.710
Do you have any other questions,
or shall I close this?

01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:52.530
Good.

01:28:52.530 --> 01:28:56.070
So I'll leave the floor to you
to just give your final words.

01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:58.200
You're not going to die
again in shamanic way,

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.136
but just to say goodbye.

01:29:00.136 --> 01:29:02.260
FINLAY WILSON: You've all
gone through it together.

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:03.650
JULIEN FINLAY: Let's do it.

01:29:03.650 --> 01:29:05.608
But anyway, it was a real
pleasure hosting you,

01:29:05.608 --> 01:29:06.900
a real pleasure having you.

01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:10.200
We discussed education and
how can somehow we prevent

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.930
hate before it's already there?

01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:16.380
And once it's there, how can
we cope by resisting it and not

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:20.490
just focusing on itself,
not giving it a platform,

01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:23.430
but really seeing the other
alternative, like other apps,

01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:25.530
or thinking how we
actually all play a role,

01:29:25.530 --> 01:29:28.680
like in the airports, lifting
and helping other people?

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.090
So thank you again.

01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:31.380
We're going to clap once.

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.770
We're going to talk and hear
you say your last words.

01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:34.620
And we clap again.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:39.090
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:40.520
Final words, Aoife?

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.410
AOIFE MARTIN: Final
words words of wisdom--

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:44.050
just first of all,
thank you very much.

01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:47.350
It's been an absolute privilege
and an honor to be here.

01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:51.930
And it's just about
getting voices out there.

01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:55.770
And I think I do what
I do because I grew up

01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:57.460
with no representation.

01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:00.720
And if by what I say
and by what I do,

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.490
I can help one young
trans person out

01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:03.660
there feel better
about themselves

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:05.326
or feel more accepting
about themselves,

01:30:05.326 --> 01:30:06.490
then it's worthwhile.

01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:07.800
And that's the only
reason I do what I do.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.008
It's the only reason I speak.

01:30:09.008 --> 01:30:10.710
And it's the only reason I talk.

01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:11.665
Thank you very much.

01:30:11.665 --> 01:30:14.040
FINLAY WILSON: So one of the
motivators behind my actions

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.360
on a daily basis,
one of the things

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.040
that we instill in the
kids that we teach,

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.415
one of the things we instill
in the adults that we teach,

01:30:19.415 --> 01:30:22.020
and especially in how they act
when they leave the yoga room,

01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.820
is to ask the
question, does what

01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:29.170
I'm about to do, say, write,
brighten or dim my spirit?

01:30:29.170 --> 01:30:30.960
And if you can answer
it, saying that it

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:34.410
is going to bolster you, do it.

01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:36.570
If you are swearing
that you're going

01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:40.822
to end up like a toxic slime
ball, why are you doing that?

01:30:40.822 --> 01:30:42.280
So if you can be
comfortable enough

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.196
with yourself to know
that what you are doing,

01:30:44.196 --> 01:30:46.660
what your actions are,
are building your energy,

01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:50.230
building your life force,
do that thing, creativity,

01:30:50.230 --> 01:30:52.990
make things, help people.

01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:56.440
But if you start doing something
else, you are damaging.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.185
And be aware of it, because
we're going to get you.

01:30:59.185 --> 01:30:59.872
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:59.872 --> 01:31:02.330
JULIEN FINLAY: Well, I'm sure
you both brighten up our day.

01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:06.070
So thank you and goodbye.

01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:08.820
[APPLAUSE]
