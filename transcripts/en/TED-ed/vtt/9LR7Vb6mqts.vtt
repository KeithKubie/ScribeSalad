00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.771
You know what the greatest secret of history is?

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:21.688
It's that history can be changed.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:22.501
And, yeah, yeah, I know,

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.239
everyone says history can't be changed,

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.605
but it can.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:27.059
And today we're going to talk about

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.176
how history isn't just something that goes backwards,

00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:31.826
history goes forward too.

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:34.204
And all those great things that haven't happened yet,

00:00:34.204 --> 00:00:37.516
that's history that's just waiting to be written.

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:39.002
So how do you change history?

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.698
I'm going to tell you by sharing with you

00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:43.988
the three things that I tell my kids every night

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.705
when I tuck them into bed.

00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:46.071
It's true.

00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:47.534
I stole the idea from a friend of mine

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:49.892
who told me what his father used to share with him.

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:51.925
Every single night, when I tuck my kids into bed,

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:53.529
I tell them these three things:

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:54.627
dream big,

00:00:54.627 --> 00:00:55.688
work hard,

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.549
and stay humble.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:58.390
So let's look at them all.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.436
First, dream big.

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:03.033
You know who has the biggest, best dreams of all?

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.271
You, young people.

00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:07.523
You know how old Martin Luther King, Jr. was

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:08.927
when he became the leader

00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:11.881
of the most famous bus boycott in history?

00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:13.528
He was 26.

00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:14.965
You know how old Amelia Earhart was

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:17.096
when she broke her first world record?

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:18.344
25

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:20.171
You know how old Steve Jobs was

00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:22.581
when he co-founded Apple Computer?

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:23.999
21

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.833
And you know how old Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:30.891
when they came up with their idea for the greatest superhero of all time,

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.743
the first one, that they named "Superman"?

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:36.592
These guys were 17 years old!

00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:40.295
Two 17-year-old kids created Superman.

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:41.456
They weren't good looking.

00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:43.565
(Look at the picture, right?)

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:45.449
They weren't popular.

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:46.973
They had no money,

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.774
but they were two best friends with one dream.

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:51.310
And with just their imaginations,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.742
they gave the world Superman.

00:01:53.742 --> 00:01:57.892
And I know, creating Superman is a once-in-a-lifetime big dream,

00:01:57.892 --> 00:02:00.906
so I want to tell you about Alexandra Scott.

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:02.778
She goes by Alex.

00:02:02.778 --> 00:02:05.385
Alex was diagnosed with cancer

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:07.396
before she was even a year old,

00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:09.623
and that was the only life she knew:

00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:13.141
sickness, chemotherapy, and surgery.

00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:15.024
When she was four, Alex asked her parents

00:02:15.024 --> 00:02:18.234
could she put a lemonade stand in the front yard?

00:02:18.234 --> 00:02:19.570
She didn't want to buy anything for herself,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.774
she wanted to use the money

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:24.941
to give it to doctors to help other kids with cancer.

00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:30.328
OK, in a single day, Alex's lemonade stand raised $2,000!

00:02:30.328 --> 00:02:31.759
But, here's what I love:

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.111
soon after that, other lemonade stands started popping up,

00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:36.977
all with Alex's name on it.

00:02:36.977 --> 00:02:40.351
Eventually, they raised $200,000.

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:42.173
And then Alex had a new goal.

00:02:42.173 --> 00:02:44.083
She said let's raise $1,000,000.

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.870
On June 12, 2004,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.344
hundreds of lemonade stands started opening up

00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:52.022
in every state in the country.

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:55.603
Ordinary people selling water and sugar and lemons

00:02:55.603 --> 00:02:57.981
to help kids with cancer.

00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:59.327
Nearly two months later,

00:02:59.327 --> 00:03:02.685
Alex died while her parents were holding her hands.

00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:04.569
She was 8 years old.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.499
But before she died, Alex said that next year's goal

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.509
should be $5,000,000.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:14.081
Today, her dream has raised over $45,000,000

00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:15.965
and it is still going strong!

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:20.678
One idea, one girl, one big dream.

00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:21.390
And you know what she said?

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.899
This is a direct quote before she died.

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:24.846
She said, "Oh, we can do it!

00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:27.726
If other people will help me, I think we can do it.

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:29.753
I know we can do it!"

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:30.593
You dream big,

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:32.740
I don't care how old you are,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.858
and don't let anyone tell you otherwise,

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:37.153
you will change history.

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:38.977
And that leads me to the second thing I tell my kids:

00:03:38.977 --> 00:03:40.314
work hard.

00:03:40.314 --> 00:03:41.933
Such a simple one, everyone knows this one.

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:42.931
Work hard.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.736
I saw this one for my father

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:47.074
and my father died a few months ago.

00:03:47.074 --> 00:03:48.704
When I was growing up in Brooklyn,

00:03:48.704 --> 00:03:51.711
ok, my father, he worked hard.

00:03:51.711 --> 00:03:53.259
He had no money, we had, no money growing up.

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:54.986
He worked every Saturday, every Sunday.

00:03:54.986 --> 00:03:57.775
I watched first-hand every weekend what hard work was.

00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:00.166
And I saw that the hardest work of all

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:03.766
is being resilient when you're facing failure.

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:05.941
When I started writing my first book,

00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:09.138
my first book got me 24 rejection letters.

00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:11.883
To be clear, there are only 20 publishers,

00:04:11.883 --> 00:04:15.188
I got 24 rejection letters, OK?

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.006
That means that some people were writing me twice

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:19.325
to make sure I got the point.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:22.272
But it wasn't until I was writing my ninth book,

00:04:22.272 --> 00:04:23.856
a book of heroes for my son,

00:04:23.856 --> 00:04:28.412
that I found my favorite story of working hard through failure.

00:04:28.412 --> 00:04:30.735
It was a story that a friend told me about the Wright brothers.

00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:33.807
That every time the Wright brothers went out to fly their plane,

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:38.129
they would bring enough extra materials for multiple crashes.

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.510
That means for every time they went out,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.559
they knew they would fail.

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.023
And they would crash and rebuild,

00:04:43.023 --> 00:04:44.307
and crash and rebuild,

00:04:44.307 --> 00:04:46.513
and that's why they took off.

00:04:46.513 --> 00:04:47.846
I love that story.

00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:48.855
I wanted my son to hear that story,

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:49.945
I wanted my daughter to hear that story,

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:52.142
I wanted everyone to know that if you dream big

00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:54.648
and you work hard and you fight failure,

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:56.415
you will change history

00:04:56.415 --> 00:05:00.186
and do what no one on this planet has ever done before.

00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:02.566
And that leads me to the final thing I tell them:

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:03.941
stay humble.

00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:04.573
Here's the thing:

00:05:04.573 --> 00:05:06.292
if you invent the world's first airplane,

00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:07.079
or Superman,

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:09.114
or a multi-million dollar lemonade stand,

00:05:09.114 --> 00:05:10.149
you don't need to be humble.

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:12.845
You can get a tattoo on your face that says, "I'm the best!"

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:13.407
Right?

00:05:13.407 --> 00:05:14.830
But pay attention here:

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.760
no one likes a jerk.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.361
In fact, the world needs fewer loudmouths,

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.616
so stay humble!

00:05:21.616 --> 00:05:24.409
When Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence,

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.549
you know he never took credit for writing it while he was alive?

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:31.065
It wasn't until he died and it was in his obituary

00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:34.745
that the average American found out that he was the author.

00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:37.060
That's humble.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.491
So there's the big secret:

00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:39.253
dream big,

00:05:39.253 --> 00:05:40.111
work hard,

00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:41.409
stay humble.

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.333
"Wait," you're saying, "that's it?"

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:44.876
"What, you tell me a bunch of stories and what?

00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:46.267
How do I change history?"

00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:48.021
Here's the answer:

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:49.494
all history ever is

00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:51.497
is a bunch of stories,

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:52.768
conflicting stories,

00:05:52.768 --> 00:05:53.489
big stories,

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:54.167
little stories,

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:55.872
our stories.

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:57.153
So how do you change history?

00:05:57.153 --> 00:06:00.180
All you got to do is write your story.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.627
OK? No, I'm serious, this is it.

00:06:02.627 --> 00:06:05.243
If people think history is a bunch of facts and dates you got to memorize,

00:06:05.243 --> 00:06:06.878
that's not what history is at all.

00:06:06.878 --> 00:06:08.580
History is a selection process,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.934
and it chooses every single one of us every single day.

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:13.795
The only question is, do you hear the call?

00:06:13.795 --> 00:06:17.369
And that leads me to the most important thing I'm going to tell you here:

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:20.522
you will change history.

00:06:20.522 --> 00:06:22.357
Some of you will change it in big ways,

00:06:22.357 --> 00:06:24.426
affecting millions of people.

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.413
Others of you will do it in more personal ways,

00:06:26.413 --> 00:06:29.112
helping a family member or someone who needs it.

00:06:29.112 --> 00:06:30.655
But let me tell you right now,

00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:33.621
one is not more important than the other.

00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:35.534
If you help people in mass or one-by-one,

00:06:35.534 --> 00:06:37.479
that's how history gets changed,

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:38.964
when you take action.

00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:41.363
But when you start writing your story

00:06:41.363 --> 00:06:43.496
and you get scared, as we all inevitably do,

00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:44.958
I want you to know one thing:

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.472
no one is born a hero.

00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:50.844
Every single person that we talked about today,

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:52.897
whether they were a 26 year old preacher,

00:06:52.897 --> 00:06:54.650
or two 17 year old nerds,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.501
or little girl who had cancer,

00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.005
every single one of them had moments

00:06:58.005 --> 00:06:59.287
where they doubted themselves,

00:06:59.287 --> 00:07:01.267
like you, like me.

00:07:01.267 --> 00:07:03.066
They had moments where they worried about school

00:07:03.066 --> 00:07:04.037
and friendships

00:07:04.037 --> 00:07:05.918
and would they be accepted by others,

00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:08.034
like you, like me.

00:07:08.034 --> 00:07:10.358
They had moments where they worried about loneliness and failure

00:07:10.358 --> 00:07:11.817
and would they ever succeed,

00:07:11.817 --> 00:07:14.188
like you, like me.

00:07:14.188 --> 00:07:16.951
But the best part is, you don't have to start

00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:19.981
a multi-million dollar lemonade stand to change the world,

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.549
all you got to do is help one person,

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:25.417
be kind to one person, that's the answer.

00:07:25.417 --> 00:07:26.751
It's my core belief,

00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:29.205
it is in every story I just told you.

00:07:29.205 --> 00:07:31.999
I believe ordinary people change the world.

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:33.281
I don't care how much money you have,

00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:34.157
I don't care where you go to school,

00:07:34.157 --> 00:07:35.847
that is all nonsense to me.

00:07:35.847 --> 00:07:39.411
I believe in regular people and their ability to affect change in this world.

00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:40.553
I believe in my father,

00:07:40.553 --> 00:07:43.065
and a 25 year old daredevil named Amelia,

00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:46.400
and a little girl who sells lemonade like nobody's business.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.289
And it's why I believe in that very first hero we were talking about today, Superman.

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:54.437
To me, the most important part of the story isn't Superman.

00:07:54.437 --> 00:07:57.694
The most important part of the story is Clark Kent.

00:07:57.694 --> 00:07:58.854
And you want to know why?

00:07:58.854 --> 00:08:00.546
Because we're all Clark Kent.

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:02.683
We all know what it's like to be boring and ordinary

00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:05.267
and wish we could do something incredibly beyond ourselves.

00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:06.409
But here's the real news:

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:09.158
we all can do something incredibly beyond ourselves.

00:08:09.158 --> 00:08:11.896
I got 24 rejection letters on my first book,

00:08:11.896 --> 00:08:13.838
24 people who told me to give it up,

00:08:13.838 --> 00:08:15.675
and I don't look back on the experience and say,

00:08:15.675 --> 00:08:18.129
"I was right, and they were wrong, and haha on them."

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:21.956
What I look back and realize is that every single one of those rejection letters

00:08:21.956 --> 00:08:24.281
told me to work harder, to dream bigger,

00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:25.351
and you better believe it,

00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:26.852
made me more humble,

00:08:26.852 --> 00:08:30.147
but it also made me want it more than anything.

00:08:30.147 --> 00:08:32.030
So whatever it is you dream big about,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.239
whatever it is you work hard for,

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:35.491
don't let anyone tell you,

00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:36.525
you're too young

00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:39.567
and don't let anyone tell you no.

00:08:39.567 --> 00:08:41.824
Every life makes history.

00:08:41.824 --> 00:08:44.080
And every life is a story.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.231
Thank you.
