NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Hello.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.900
My name is Natalie
Villalobos, and I'm so

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.220
excited today to bring out
Amy Schumer and Aidy Bryant.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.950
They are two incredible
women that I am so incredibly

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.110
inspired by and empowered by.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.996
So let's go ahead and
bring them on out.

00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:24.476
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:34.500
AMY SCHUMER: The Google plants.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.964
Hi, guys.

00:00:35.964 --> 00:00:36.880
AIDY BRYANT: Oh, cool.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.650
A music room.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.180
AMY SCHUMER: This will be fun.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.230
This is where the
Counting Crows counted.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.749
Thank you for having us, guys.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:49.449
[CHEERS]

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:49.949
Blessed.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.760
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: All right.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.130
So to kick us off, you two
are in a new film together

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.780
called "I Feel Pretty."

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.480
Tell us what interested you
in signing on to this project.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.563
AMY SCHUMER: Money, honey.

00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:02.727
Money, money, money, money.

00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:03.268
I don't care.

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:04.922
Money.

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:05.630
AIDY BRYANT: Wow.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.588
AMY SCHUMER: Oh, you guys
hate money at Google?

00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:08.790
I'm sorry.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.260
Ker-ching, ker-ching,
ker-ching, ker-ching, ker-ching.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.556
No, I was supposed to do this
other movie where I would've

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:20.180
gotten like a lot a
lot a lot of money,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.763
but it wasn't going
to really work out

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:24.680
because-- but this is the exact
message that I've been wanting

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.010
to say, like I didn't want this
to just be part of the movie.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.940
I was like, I really want to
hammer this exact message home.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.200
And so I'm kind
of like a [BLEEP]

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.300
when it comes to if my
manager sends me a script,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.350
I'll go do you
want me to do this?

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.880
Do you want me to
play a reindeer?

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.007
You know, and--

00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:46.590
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Has that happened?

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.290
AMY SCHUMER: Like ish.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.780
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.090
AMY SCHUMER: And so
they were like, hey, we

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.470
think this is worth mentioning.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.120
And they told me the premise,
and I was like that's awesome.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.752
And then I read the script.

00:01:55.752 --> 00:01:56.960
I was like, this is so funny.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.790
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: She's
giving you lovey eyes.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.623
AMY SCHUMER: I know.

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:02.727
She wants it.

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:03.310
Are you lower?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.592
AIDY BRYANT: I'm just
feeling like I'm lower.

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:05.978
AMY SCHUMER: You're lower.

00:02:05.978 --> 00:02:07.083
Well, we just had this.

00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:08.292
AIDY BRYANT: I'm sorry.

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:08.979
AMY SCHUMER: Why am I so high?

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.687
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
You're in the middle.

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:13.430
AMY SCHUMER: We did one
this morning at either,

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.456
like one of you, and--

00:02:16.456 --> 00:02:18.830
AIDY BRYANT: And we got there,
and they kept saying to me

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.630
like, Aidy, you'll be
in the middle chair.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.900
OK, just remember, Aidy,
go in the middle chair.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.770
AMY SCHUMER: And you're
in the middle chair.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.250
AIDY BRYANT: Go to
the middle chair.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.900
AMY SCHUMER: Because
at these things,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.270
they really over-explain.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.490
AIDY BRYANT: And I'm like, OK.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.494
AMY SCHUMER: They're like
breathe, and you'll sit

00:02:26.494 --> 00:02:27.930
and you bend your knees to sit.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.270
AIDY BRYANT: OK.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.270
And then we got out
there, and we sat down

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.970
and mine was like
a little toadstool.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.720
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.010
It was like--

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.510
AIDY BRYANT: I was literally
on the ground like in a basket.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.750
And Amy and the moderator
were like seated high.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.330
It was very humbling.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.160
And I'm proud to be lower now.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.030
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.510
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
If you want, we

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.570
could switch roles
at some point,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.000
and you can be the moderator.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.375
AMY SCHUMER:
There's nothing that

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:55.550
could get me to get into
one of these seats again.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.591
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:02:56.591 --> 00:02:57.550
Sorry about that.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.633
That's why I'm like kind
of doing the one leg off.

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:02.630
AMY SCHUMER: No, this is great.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.670
AIDY BRYANT: I'm
so scared that I'm

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.320
going to show my full coochie--

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.070
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.912
AIDY BRYANT: --to
like all y'all.

00:03:09.912 --> 00:03:11.870
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So
we'll just strategically

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.790
place the plants.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.260
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.341
AIDY BRYANT: I'm going to hold
one of those little plants

00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:14.840
right here.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.360
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.309
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So with the film,

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.600
did you have any creative
control over your characters?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.210
Sounds like the
script was there,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.960
you signed on, and at
any point did you ad lib

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.370
or change the original
direction of a character?

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.950
AMY SCHUMER: You're naughty.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.450
Yeah.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.292
I'm a producer of this
movie, and it's cool.

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:38.500
I've gotten myself into a
position where I don't have

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.590
to say [BLEEP] I don't want to.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.230
And so I helped rewrite it, and
we were super collaborative.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.950
Yeah, and we ad
libbed a little bit.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.700
AIDY BRYANT: Yeah.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.220
Unfortunately, I only had to
say things I didn't want to.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.350
This was a bad experience for
me, and it sucks to be here.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.180
AMY SCHUMER: I'm sorry.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.580
And I know we're all supposed
to be like lifting up

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.910
other women in this business.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.487
But I just wanted
to push her down.

00:04:07.487 --> 00:04:09.695
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So you
wrote it into her contract

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:11.470
to only give her bad lines.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.770
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.660
AIDY BRYANT: No, we
improvised a lot.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.100
AMY SCHUMER: Because we always--

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.209
we have like one brain.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.985
Like all the time we'll
always say the same words.

00:04:21.985 --> 00:04:22.985
AIDY BRYANT: Same words.

00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:28.960
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So in the film-- so

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.519
I got a chance to sneak peek
watch it on Friday night,

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:32.310
and it was awesome.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.650
AMY SCHUMER: Thank you.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.233
Yeah, it's like hold
for a compliment.

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:37.760
People are like, I saw the show
this week, and then you go mmm?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.685
AIDY BRYANT: And?

00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:40.860
AMY SCHUMER: Do, do,
do, do, do, you know.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.721
OK.

00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:43.470
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
No, I really loved it.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.470
So one of my favorite
parts was actually

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.680
when your character, Renee,
was taking some web traffic

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.240
reports to her company.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.650
There was a mantra.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.629
She had to say I am brave,
I am blond, and I got this.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:56.420
AMY SCHUMER: Mm-hm.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.660
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So
what body-positive mantra

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.494
would you give to
women of the world?

00:05:00.494 --> 00:05:01.160
AMY SCHUMER: OK.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.760
Well, first of all,
Adrian Martinez,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.220
who I've worked with a bunch,
he improvised that line.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.411
And he just kind of went nuts
and was giving me his pep talk.

00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:09.660
And it made it into the movie.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.090
So God bless him.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.610
Don't be fooled by the
illusion of equality

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.774
we've all been sold.

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:18.740
AIDY BRYANT: And yeah.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.694
AMY SCHUMER: I don't
have to tell you, Google.

00:05:20.694 --> 00:05:22.610
AIDY BRYANT: That's why
she's on a high stool.

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.170
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
That was perfect.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.430
AMY SCHUMER: I mean, we
gotta still work for it.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.100
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: She did
not hear this question at all.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.070
AMY SCHUMER: They're
like, yeah, well

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.736
we weren't impressed
with what she said.

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:33.927
So that makes sense.

00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:35.343
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
How about you?

00:05:35.343 --> 00:05:38.260
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah, what's
your mantra, bitch?

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.702
AIDY BRYANT: Currently, it's
like just stay on the stool.

00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:43.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.760
Just use the chair.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.898
You can grab onto Amy.

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:49.398
Just--

00:05:49.398 --> 00:05:50.231
AMY SCHUMER: Oh, OK.

00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:52.870
AIDY BRYANT: --stay
on the stool.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.680
AMY SCHUMER: Honey.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.290
Honey.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.790
AIDY BRYANT: I'm
in a bad situation.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.206
AMY SCHUMER: We
had an interview--

00:06:00.206 --> 00:06:02.060
AIDY BRYANT: And I'm
legitimately scared.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.140
AMY SCHUMER: We had an
interview this morning

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.556
kind of with a
question like that,

00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:08.812
where they were like,
I'm not afraid so I--

00:06:08.812 --> 00:06:10.520
and like, you know,
it was looking for us

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.900
to say something inspirational.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.110
And Aidy was just like,
I'm scared of birds.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.670
And we're like, no that's not--

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.772
AIDY BRYANT: I am though.

00:06:19.772 --> 00:06:21.730
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I'm
scared of deviled eggs.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:22.396
AMY SCHUMER: Eh.

00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:23.865
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, I know.

00:06:23.865 --> 00:06:28.010
AMY SCHUMER: I'm scared
of crazy bitches.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.030
You guys.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.990
You guys.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.890
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Deviled eggs, birds.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.400
AMY SCHUMER: They're so good.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.650
I almost just got
those at lunch.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.042
AIDY BRYANT: OK, I'm now--

00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:34.375
I'm going to try something else.

00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:36.610
AMY SCHUMER: Lean in.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.434
AIDY BRYANT: No,
that's Facebook.

00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:40.600
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It's OK.

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:45.450
AMY SCHUMER: It is?

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.500
AIDY BRYANT: OK.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.320
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So speaking
of leaning in a little bit,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.660
I feel like there's some
shamelessness in the movie.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.580
What would you say
in one word, what is

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.649
that confidence that she had?

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:58.940
AMY SCHUMER: Like, you know,
we got this backlash which

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.100
was really funny, because
first of all, very flattering.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.870
People were like, you're
not disgusting enough

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.590
to be in that.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.990
And I was like, oh.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.740
Am I supposed to--

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.730
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: What,
she said not disgusting--

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.396
AMY SCHUMER: No.

00:07:07.396 --> 00:07:09.890
Yeah, they were like,
you don't have any right

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.020
to feel bad about yourself.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.206
And it's not a story of a
very homely, awful woman

00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:15.080
who finds confidence.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.163
It's just somebody who
struggles with self-esteem,

00:07:17.163 --> 00:07:18.890
which everyone does, you know?

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.760
And she feels very invisible
and then goes through

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.240
this whole experience
where she realizes

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.850
where your confidence
really should come from

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:34.220
and what's actually sustainable,
which is not your looks.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.872
So we got this crazy backlash,
and it was funny, you know?

00:07:39.872 --> 00:07:40.580
I don't remember.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.410
I don't remember like at
all what I'm talking about.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.076
AIDY BRYANT: No.

00:07:43.076 --> 00:07:47.480
I was just thinking too, like
I was also getting messages

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.220
that were like, come on.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.190
How could they have Amy Schumer
do this role when they have

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.180
a plus-sized woman right there?

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.870
She could have done the role.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.340
And it's like, OK.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.500
So you're saying
I'm out of the norm

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.360
enough that I should
play the troll

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.920
or like what are we
fighting about this for?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.620
I feel like it really
muddles the issue that

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:15.440
is like, you know, Amy and
I both, whether you like it

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.830
or not, are not the norm
in movies, you know?

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:25.380
Like 99% of movies, nobody looks
like me or Amy, and we [BLEEP]

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.240
good.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.160
AMY SCHUMER: Yes, we do queen.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.040
Say yes, queen.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.960
AIDY BRYANT: No but--

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.809
I guess, to me, it's
almost like a snake

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:39.120
eating its own tail where
it's like, well, how--

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.049
what do I have to
be or what does Amy

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:43.970
have to be to like--
this is a story that

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.230
is about self-confidence, which
truly is like it's all in here.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.610
It's not out here.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.775
And that is what
it's all damn about.

00:08:51.775 --> 00:08:53.150
AMY SCHUMER: It's
all damn about,

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.880
and we have talked about
this, where we both feel good

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.422
in our skin and--

00:08:57.422 --> 00:08:58.880
AIDY BRYANT: On
the stool [BLEEP]..

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.310
AMY SCHUMER: I mean, this
is a special scenario.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.870
AIDY BRYANT: It's literally
bringing me back down

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.730
to like I'm 13 years old.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:03.950
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.590
No.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.990
This is a bad moment for you.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.050
This is your bottom.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.850
But we realized like
you really-- it's

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.227
not about us feeling
good about ourselves.

00:09:13.227 --> 00:09:14.810
It's like we have
to literally comfort

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.340
other people about our bodies.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.326
They're like, so you just go
out to the store in the morning

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:23.450
and you're just in your
body, and you're like yeah,

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.320
and I'm happy.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.690
And they're like, can
you walk me through that?

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.430
And you're like, no,
I don't think I can.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.910
So it's literally us
explaining to other people,

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.040
making them comfortable.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.020
But you know, there's
nothing scarier

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.840
or more upsetting to
people than a woman who

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.280
feels good about herself.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.571
People really hate that.

00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.070
Yeah.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.270
So they're like,
OK, well how can I

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.059
find an angle where
you're unhappy so I

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:49.850
can sleep at night?

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.240
And you're like,
yeah, of course.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.220
Like we have struggles
like everyone else.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.780
And also, we want to say if I
were a person of color hearing

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.930
this conversation, I'd be
like is it hard for you guys?

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.920
You know?

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.570
And I hear you.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.940
And we both really
want to do our part

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.220
and make sure that our work is
super inclusive and not just

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.029
for people of color
but trans people,

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:13.070
people with disabilities.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.690
You know, because
what we're learning

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.230
is that the leaders being
all white men for so long

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:24.237
is not actually that great for
everybody, and we need women.

00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:26.570
If you think about it, women
aren't even on many boards.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.640
Like to get like
one woman, two women

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.140
in there-- and by the way,
you have to see the Ruth Bader

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:30.860
Ginsburg movie.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.450
Can we just [MUMBLING].

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:38.141
But you know, it's-- because the
things I gravitate toward are

00:10:38.141 --> 00:10:38.640
women.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.723
People are getting-- so
if I was the person making

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.920
the decisions-- and Samantha
Bee did that awesome piece

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.670
this week about how 1 in 10
women have endometriosis,

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.500
but there's very
little research,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.800
but there's like
1,000 dick pills.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.320
You know?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.910
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: No, I've
actually recently started

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.580
telling people in my meetings
when I'm having intense cramps.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.954
So it's like I'm just going
to be very real with the fact

00:10:58.954 --> 00:11:00.305
that I'm just like in pain.

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:00.610
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:00.830
I'm--

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:01.765
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I'm not
going to hide that anymore.

00:11:01.765 --> 00:11:02.047
AMY SCHUMER: No.

00:11:02.047 --> 00:11:02.490
I know.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.989
But we do.

00:11:02.989 --> 00:11:04.660
AIDY BRYANT: And
[BLEEP] got a problem.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.220
Deal with it.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:06.970
AMY SCHUMER: Whoa.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.080
AIDY BRYANT: That's
what I'm saying.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:08.517
I love that.

00:11:08.517 --> 00:11:09.391
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
[INAUDIBLE] this time.

00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:09.830
Yeah.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.260
Yeah.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.340
That's exactly what I said.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.200
AIDY BRYANT: And I do
have a problem right now.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.760
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah, you do.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.410
You're in it.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.820
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So you had mentioned--

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.385
we can sit with it
a little bit more.

00:11:21.385 --> 00:11:23.010
AIDY BRYANT: I'm
tempted to just stand.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.218
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: You can--

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:29.547
this will be like--

00:11:29.547 --> 00:11:30.505
AMY SCHUMER: Yes, girl.

00:11:30.505 --> 00:11:33.080
AIDY BRYANT: I can't tell you
the relief I feel right now.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.650
And so I--

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.700
AMY SCHUMER: I'm still
up here like an asshole.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.380
AIDY BRYANT: No, no, no.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:35.650
Look.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.986
I'm going to just stand in
the spot where my stool was.

00:11:37.986 --> 00:11:38.986
AMY SCHUMER: Just stand.

00:11:38.986 --> 00:11:41.376
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So--

00:11:41.376 --> 00:11:42.490
AIDY BRYANT: I'm going to.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.140
I'm sorry.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.380
AMY SCHUMER: Do it.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.280
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
We can all stand.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.830
AIDY BRYANT: No, no.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.496
AMY SCHUMER: No.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.090
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So when I was 14,

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.270
my mom would tell me,
oh, Natalie, don't worry.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.080
Your boobs will grow in,
which I'm still waiting for.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.459
But you know, I used
to wear a water bra,

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:04.250
and so it was like a
bra-- for those of you

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.320
that don't know-- water
bra is a bra with two

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.090
big sacks of water.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.300
And it basically made me go
from like a double A to a C.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.150
And I would walk around really
confidently as a sophomore.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.700
And I was really
just like moved.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.650
I was like, OK, so I have to
change how I present myself

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.710
based on how my mom or how
other women perceive me.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.940
And so I'm curious, how have
other people's perceptions

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.550
shaped who you are today
or perceptions of yourself?

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.300
AMY SCHUMER: Well,
first of all, thank you

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.440
for trusting us with
the water bra story.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:31.594
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:12:31.594 --> 00:12:32.094
Yeah.

00:12:32.094 --> 00:12:34.690
You're welcome.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.530
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.640
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It
was a vulnerable moment.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.681
AMY SCHUMER: No, totally.

00:12:37.681 --> 00:12:41.620
I mean, I used to wear like very
padded bras, like to a point

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.069
where it was just like it was--
somebody should have just sued

00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:46.360
me when they hooked up with me.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.250
Like, this is not--

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.166
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
That's where I was headed.

00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:51.810
AMY SCHUMER: --at all what
I entered the contract for.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:52.170
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I got--

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:52.830
I got-- yeah.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:56.850
AMY SCHUMER: But
you know, that--

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.550
but that company got to your
mom, and they like, you know,

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.457
all the marketing and you've got
to look like this one person.

00:13:03.457 --> 00:13:05.290
And if you cover all
the heads in the gossip

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.780
magazines across the row,
everyone has the same body.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.220
And you're told if you don't
look like this one thing,

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.470
then you're wrong.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.330
And then you realize like, no.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.940
And what is it about?

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.060
It really is about how
you feel about yourself.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.370
And we know that.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.660
That's easy to say.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.381
But the way that you want your
friends to see themselves,

00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:24.130
like your best friends,
who are like, meh.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.546
And you're like,
you're so pretty.

00:13:25.546 --> 00:13:27.272
[BLEEP] you know.

00:13:27.272 --> 00:13:29.230
Sometimes you can cover
their head in a picture

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.270
and be like, what if you
saw this girl walk by?

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.186
Wouldn't you be like,
that's a beautiful girl?

00:13:33.186 --> 00:13:34.810
And they're like, oh, yeah.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.720
But I think other
than the media,

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.986
it's like I think mothers need
to know how much their message

00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:44.110
goes through to their kids.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.234
Yeah, because if they're
going, oh, I'm disgusting.

00:13:46.234 --> 00:13:48.670
Like their daughter is
going to be like, I'm gross.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.030
My mom did the
opposite and just made

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.840
me think I was actually
Beyonce as a child.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.537
And then you know, you get
older and like stuff chips away

00:13:59.537 --> 00:14:01.120
at your confidence,
and kids are mean,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.920
and you kind of
are like, oh, OK.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.850
Oh, I'm gross.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:04.480
I'm disgusting.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.980
OK.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.500
And this movie is about
trying to get back

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.770
to that childlike version of
yourself where you feel good,

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.429
and you're not thinking
you need a water bra.

00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:15.470
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.260
Well, and I think
part of the sisterhood

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.093
that you were able to
offer her in the movie

00:14:19.093 --> 00:14:20.876
was like group
friendship, right,

00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:22.750
and supporting someone,
both through the good

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.230
and the bad of their body
image and those perceptions.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.320
So can you tell me a little bit
about how important sisterhood

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.099
is as we kind of
look at ourselves

00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:32.140
and reflect on ourselves?

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.550
AMY SCHUMER: Tell her
about our traveling pants.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.216
AIDY BRYANT: Oh.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.780
No, I mean, honestly for me--

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.160
and this is maybe going to
sound corny, but like for me,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.820
my friends and my
female colleagues

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.770
who have encouraged me have
been my only way to success.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.930
At least for myself, and like I
was so encouraged by performers

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.200
who I admired early on in
Chicago or wherever were like,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.360
I would have never
continued going

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.530
without their encouragement.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.920
And even like now,
I'm navigating

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.810
this whole other
thing, which is how

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:16.840
do I exist as a fat
woman on TV that's

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:22.220
not a mom character who's
in her 40s, like whatever.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.400
You know, that is like
that's where people

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.850
are comfortable
seeing my body type,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.650
but I got hired to
"SNL" when I was 24.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.080
So those aren't--
those are like--

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:39.670
so I'm trying to find my
own place in this system

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.910
where there hasn't really been
a place for me previously.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.990
And I could not do it
without people like Amy

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.840
or my friends who are
encouraging me and helping

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.157
me navigate all the
fricking bull [BLEEP]..

00:15:52.157 --> 00:15:54.490
AMY SCHUMER: Which is funny,
because people look like us

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.647
all over the country.

00:15:55.647 --> 00:15:56.480
Like we're the norm.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.938
AIDY BRYANT: Actually, everyone
in the world looks like me.

00:15:58.938 --> 00:15:59.900
AMY SCHUMER: Yes.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.400
Yes.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.080
AIDY BRYANT: Like
70% of American women

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.619
actually have my body type.

00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:04.410
AMY SCHUMER: Right.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.170
AIDY BRYANT: But they're
not reflected on screen,

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.780
and that's just
not [BLEEP] fair.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.821
AMY SCHUMER: And we're
not skinny shaming either,

00:16:09.821 --> 00:16:14.220
like everybody feels like
[BLEEP] if you're a woman--

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.570
and not that men don't feel like
insecure, especially this time.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.820
You're like, what's our place?

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.450
Like, can we go to
a Times Up meeting?

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.240
And you're like, oh, you
guys all hate us now?

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.140
But it's not about--

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.255
I mean, yes, like yes.

00:16:26.255 --> 00:16:28.345
And thank you, but--

00:16:28.345 --> 00:16:30.220
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
What's the weirdest thing

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.900
you've done for beauty?

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.900
AMY SCHUMER: For
most of my life,

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.600
like wore heels and those
kind of bras and Spanx

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.970
and still felt really mediocre.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.310
That's the weirdest
thing I did for beauty.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.610
Just like my whole
life, every day, until

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.230
like pretty recently.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.360
The guys in here look like
the guys in the movie,

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.830
like that's my romantic lead.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.050
So you guys will like this.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.117
You guys are definitely
the sweet, like--

00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:58.450
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Intelligent.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.500
AMY SCHUMER: You
don't look like--

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.333
well, you know, don't
put words in my mouth.

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:08.824
But um-- it's like a
very gentle, gentle man.

00:17:08.824 --> 00:17:09.990
AIDY BRYANT: I'm trying to--

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.210
I don't know if I have
like a weirdest thing I've

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.259
done for beauty.

00:17:13.259 --> 00:17:13.800
I don't know.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.930
I feel just like buying
jeans, I'm like that's a hell,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.755
and every time I do it, I'm
like, what is happening?

00:17:21.755 --> 00:17:23.130
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Last question

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.640
before we jump to Q&amp;A, when
that voice inside yourself

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.760
says you can't do it, what
do you say to that voice?

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.890
AMY SCHUMER: I think
personally I learned along--

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.110
I learned like
maybe 10 years ago,

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.210
I don't even have
that voice anymore.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.200
I'm like, it's other people
telling you you can't do it.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.261
And you just go like,
I'm going to do it.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:42.760
You know?

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.740
I mean, seriously.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.009
It's like, no.

00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:47.550
I'm not giving energy
to any of that.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.133
Just like, no, I'm going to take
the steps I need to to do it.

00:17:50.133 --> 00:17:53.100
AIDY BRYANT: I definitely
still have that voice.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.260
But I also feel now like I
have always been like very bad

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.600
at rules or if someone tells
me I have to do something,

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.030
I immediately am like, I
guess I'm [BLEEP] not doing

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.949
that [BLEEP],, which
includes this stool.

00:18:08.949 --> 00:18:09.990
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.690
You could not have
done that on a stool.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:12.353
AIDY BRYANT: No, like--

00:18:12.353 --> 00:18:13.140
AUDIENCE: Do you want a--

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.670
AIDY BRYANT: No, I don't.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:14.680
AMY SCHUMER: It's
too late in the game.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.540
AIDY BRYANT: It's done.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.060
Thank you.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.919
This is so nice.

00:18:16.919 --> 00:18:17.960
AMY SCHUMER: That's nice.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.990
AIDY BRYANT: Oh, that's OK.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.050
AMY SCHUMER: Oh, cool.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.380
A man is saving you.

00:18:23.139 --> 00:18:23.680
Just kidding.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.140
Isn't that funny?

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.931
We're still like, can
you open my car door?

00:18:25.931 --> 00:18:26.440
Thank you.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.130
AIDY BRYANT: No,
that was very nice.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.000
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
You can just hold it.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.833
AIDY BRYANT: I will.

00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:29.970
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.470
AMY SCHUMER: I hope they bring
out three more chairs for you

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.910
to just--

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.790
AIDY BRYANT: They put
me in a little box.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.410
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.570
Just go in your little sandbox.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.330
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So I think
we're going to go to Q&amp;A.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.121
AMY SCHUMER: Great.

00:18:38.121 --> 00:18:39.580
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
First question.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.579
AUDIENCE: Hello, ladies.

00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:41.710
I'm very happy you're here.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.490
And I absolutely love your
honest raunchy feminism.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.020
I have an 8-year-old
daughter, who

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.600
got invited to her
first dress-up party,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.300
where they're going to
give her makeup and hair.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.010
She has to wear a dress and get
in a long pink stretch limo.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.330
I'm a hardcore feminist.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.710
My daughter knows this.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.900
I look like this.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.340
How do I wrap my
head around that?

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.640
What advice can I give her
so she still knows she's her

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.682
but can go because all
the other girls are going?

00:19:08.682 --> 00:19:10.140
AMY SCHUMER: It's
a great question.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.160
Well, I would assume
mothers love getting advice

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.510
from people without
children about how

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.698
to raise their daughters.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.820
My instincts, as someone
who's been fiercely

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:31.360
on birth control for a long
time, if she likes that stuff,

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.170
then cool.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.656
But if it's not her jam, like--

00:19:34.656 --> 00:19:36.230
[SNEEZE]

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.845
bless you-- then like peace out.

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:39.720
AIDY BRYANT: Totally.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.189
I mean, I keep thinking like--

00:19:41.189 --> 00:19:41.730
I don't know.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.310
I feel like, especially
for what we do,

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.770
we have to get
dressed and cinched

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.810
and painted up all the time.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.050
And there is like a part of
it that's like [BLEEP] guys

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.289
show up 10 minutes
before and they whatever.

00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:56.455
But like, you know, there's
also like a part of that

00:19:56.455 --> 00:19:58.260
that's self-expression
that I think,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.060
at least for me back
in my childhood--

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:00.580
AMY SCHUMER: We like
our outfits today.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.420
AIDY BRYANT: --like it was
fun to learn about that stuff

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.920
and see how I wanted to be.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.690
So I think there's
like, you know,

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.990
there's good in a
little bit of all of it

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.570
but in moderation, right?

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.470
AMY SCHUMER: And don't
get the limo, though.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.420
AIDY BRYANT: No.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.700
But honestly, could we come?

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.227
AUDIENCE: They got the limo.

00:20:16.227 --> 00:20:17.181
It's Noe Valley.

00:20:17.181 --> 00:20:18.367
They got the limo.

00:20:18.367 --> 00:20:19.700
AIDY BRYANT: Where and kind of--

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.720
AMY SCHUMER: What corner, like--

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.960
AIDY BRYANT: Do they
have room for two more?

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.293
AMY SCHUMER: Yeah, I don't know.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:25.960
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Thank you.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.190
AMY SCHUMER: Thank you.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.305
AUDIENCE: So first of all,
you both are beautiful.

00:20:28.305 --> 00:20:30.480
Aidy, I love your
short squeeze video.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.880
I remember the first time
I saw that, I was like, yo,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.040
this girl's got to be in
"SNL," and then you were.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.795
So holy [BLEEP].

00:20:35.795 --> 00:20:37.560
AIDY BRYANT: I have to tell
you-- can I just tell you

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.020
briefly that that video was
something I was paid to do.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.770
It was an advertisement.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:46.371
And I believe I was paid $25.

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.690
AUDIENCE: My question
is, so my younger sister

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.190
is trying to be a stand-up
comedian in Chicago.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.370
She's actually sort
of trying to follow

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.290
in both of your footsteps.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.280
She's a huge fan
of both of yours.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.090
I'm not that funny.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.300
So I don't really have
any advice to give her.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.720
But every time she
calls me on the phone,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.330
she's giving me this whole
thing about how hard it

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.610
is to be a woman in comedy.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.640
And you know, I was shocked when
I saw on "Saturday Night Live"

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.360
too that Tiffany
Haddish was, I think,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.180
the first female
stand-up comic--

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.244
or black female stand-up
comic-- ever to host the show.

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:19.660
And I was like,
it's [BLEEP] 2018.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.340
What the hell is happening?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.540
So what is it going
to take to get comedy

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.770
to a place of more gender
and race diversity?

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.460
You know, just like
a small question.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.600
AMY SCHUMER: Well, first of
all, for her, just any comedian

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.670
I say just get as much
stage time as possible.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.320
AIDY BRYANT: Same.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.090
AMY SCHUMER: And in terms of
it being harder for a woman,

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.590
I just think it's
harder for a woman

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.430
to leave the house
in the morning,

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.905
like it's just all harder.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.560
And I think, you know,
"Saturday Night Live"

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.900
is an example of a very
fun, great show that

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:04.750
is run by white men.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.350
And so that's why
we need more leaders

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:12.030
to look all different to make
sure that things like that

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.680
are more diverse.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.800
And there's more equal
number of sort of female or--

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.200
people of color, like--

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.747
honestly, whatever it is.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.310
And that's me.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.851
AIDY BRYANT: And I
guess I would just

00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:37.000
say that I also think like
when those moments come along

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.850
when like, you know, Tiffany
Haddish is hosting "SNL" to be

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:40.990
like calling it out.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.270
I mean, like damn,
this is the first time

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.760
a black female stand-up
has ever hosted the show.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.980
Something to think about.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.260
I feel like for a
long time nobody

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.640
was talking about it openly,
and I think that's part of--

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.240
oh, I'm sorry.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.780
I just--

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.740
AMY SCHUMER: Oh.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.474
I'm so sorry.

00:23:00.474 --> 00:23:01.140
AIDY BRYANT: No.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.710
It's OK.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.835
AMY SCHUMER: I fell asleep.

00:23:02.835 --> 00:23:04.510
AIDY BRYANT: Oh.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.102
Oh.

00:23:06.102 --> 00:23:07.060
AMY SCHUMER: Time's up.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.370
No.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.800
Thank you for calling that out.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.280
AIDY BRYANT: Yes.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.480
AMY SCHUMER: Don't
be afraid to--

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.030
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So to
add to that a little bit,

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.970
so it's like you have
people who are on stage

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.629
but also writers too, right?

00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:19.420
We need more women
writers, people of color

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.620
who are writing.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.930
It's like the other roles
too that might not be visible

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:24.910
but that are critical.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.368
AIDY BRYANT: And
I also think a lot

00:23:26.368 --> 00:23:32.500
of that is on some of these
comedy clubs and stand-up

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.606
places and like the theaters
in Chicago where you learn

00:23:36.606 --> 00:23:37.480
and start to do that.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.640
It's like they need to be
reaching out and getting

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.530
these people in positions where
they can also be seen by people

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.530
who are coming to scout.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.670
So it's sort of like--
it's like everybody

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:47.920
should be putting in the work.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.990
You know?

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.930
I'm in a comedy sketch group,
all Asian-American women

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:53.560
here in town.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.190
So I wanted to ask about your
sketch-writing process, when

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.660
you have an idea,
then how do you

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:03.810
get it to a tight place where,
you know, I got this winner?

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.910
AIDY BRYANT: Well, you had
a full sketch show that

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.620
won Peabody's and is a thing.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.390
Don't look at me.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.144
AMY SCHUMER: It's
not about that Emmy.

00:24:11.144 --> 00:24:15.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.560
No.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.550
She's asking you.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.364
You are currently in
the sketch universe.

00:24:19.364 --> 00:24:20.780
AIDY BRYANT: Gosh,
tough question.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.926
I think it's also like
different for every person.

00:24:22.926 --> 00:24:24.050
And there's different ways.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.290
For me, at "SNL," I
try to just like really

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.630
go off of what is on
my mind that week,

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.000
because we really do only
start writing on Tuesday,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.200
and the show is on Saturday.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.850
So you know, the
turnaround is quick.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.970
And if you have something that
you're kind of just like slowly

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:41.100
dumping out, it's going to
be a really long, hard week,

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.600
you know?

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.282
Like you kind of have
to have something

00:24:43.282 --> 00:24:44.990
that you're a little
bit passionate about

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.560
and feels either fun
or topical or whatever

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.510
that feels important to you.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.700
And then-- because
the whole week

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.350
is a little bit of a battle to
try and keep it in the show.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.850
So you want to feel like,
oh, I believe in this.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.180
And then as far as getting
it tight, I think, to me,

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.530
it's just like listening to
audiences and being like,

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.620
wow, I really love
this part in the middle

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.716
but it played to dead silence.

00:25:09.716 --> 00:25:11.090
And so we're going
to cut it out.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.510
And even though it makes our
sketch that was five minutes,

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.640
now it's three minutes
and 30 seconds,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.740
it's better for it,
because it has more impact

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.490
and it's tighter.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.554
So you know?

00:25:20.554 --> 00:25:22.220
AMY SCHUMER: The
audience lets you know.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.960
Like, we tested--
you test the movie,

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.960
and you're like, OK, my
favorite joke coming up.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.298
And the audience is just like--

00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:28.154
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:28.154 --> 00:25:30.260
--and you can't be
like, no, you're wrong.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.340
Like, let me just get
up and really quickly

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.750
explain why that's funny to you.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.007
Like you have to pay
attention to that and edit.

00:25:35.007 --> 00:25:35.757
AIDY BRYANT: Yeah.

00:25:35.757 --> 00:25:36.627
Cool.

00:25:36.627 --> 00:25:37.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.043
AMY SCHUMER: What's
your group called?

00:25:39.043 --> 00:25:40.571
AUDIENCE: Granny Cart Gangstas.

00:25:40.571 --> 00:25:45.481
[CHEERS]

00:25:45.481 --> 00:25:48.290
AUDIENCE: So in the movie,
your character hits her head

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.510
and gains all this
self-confidence.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.660
Given that most of us aren't
going to get to hit our heads

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.760
and get that self-confidence,
is there anything

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.840
that you would suggest as like
a real-world way to get that?

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.340
AMY SCHUMER: Well,
see, this movie--

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.400
yeah.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.100
Like it just-- it takes--

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.524
it's been a process, you know?

00:26:08.524 --> 00:26:10.190
It's these little
false starts are like,

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.023
I feel good about myself,
maybe forever now.

00:26:12.023 --> 00:26:14.380
And then, you
know, again-- woo--

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.141
and you eh.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:17.390
That was me getting my period.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.347
And I know you guys aren't
allowed to get that at Google.

00:26:23.347 --> 00:26:24.555
They're like little gymnasts.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:35.550
But I think paying attention
to when you feel the best.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.490
And it's like when
you're with your friends,

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.064
you're just laughing
and you're not

00:26:41.064 --> 00:26:42.480
thinking about
what you look like,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.440
and that's when you're happy.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.023
When you're not looking in the
mirror and you're not fixating,

00:26:46.023 --> 00:26:47.850
it's like you find
what you really

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.620
get your confidence from.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.524
And then just hanging onto that
and just reminding yourself,

00:26:52.524 --> 00:26:53.440
I feel good right now.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.464
I'm going to remind myself when
I don't that, first of all,

00:26:56.464 --> 00:26:58.130
I will feel good
again, and this is just

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.671
a feeling I have
right now, and it'll

00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:03.310
be replaced by another feeling.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.070
Yeah.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.510
Hashtag yeah.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.840
AIDY BRYANT: No, I agree.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.760
I feel like, at least for me,
like so often what I go back to

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.410
is like what is my value?

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.170
And it's not my body.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.220
It's like my comedy, my writing,
my mind, my performance,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.470
my timing, like
all those things.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.310
And it's easy to
stop hating yourself

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.060
when you start going
through your list of,

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.420
wait, why am I
valuable to this world?

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:33.830
And you know, I don't think it's
because of my thigh, you know?

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.530
Like I never have, really.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.010
And so even though the world
is telling you like your thigh

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.220
matters, it kind
of [BLEEP] doesn't.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:48.180
So once you can start to think
about that, it is easier.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.830
Do you guys want
to see my thigh?

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.496
AMY SCHUMER: No.

00:27:53.496 --> 00:27:56.596
Leave them alone.

00:27:56.596 --> 00:27:59.970
AIDY BRYANT: Oh, you
already did actually.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.220
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Thank you.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.220
I wanted to end on
a quote I actually

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.799
saw on Twitter to wrap us up.

00:28:05.799 --> 00:28:07.340
AMY SCHUMER: You
guys are fat whores.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.280
AIDY BRYANT: I'm a fat bitch.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.064
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:11.064 --> 00:28:13.490
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
It is not that at all.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.838
AIDY BRYANT: Those are the main
quote we've seen on Twitter.

00:28:19.929 --> 00:28:22.595
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: This is that
one mind thing happening again.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:26.830
No.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.579
AMY SCHUMER: Jump off
the bridge, ya hogs.

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:35.070
AIDY BRYANT: I'm sorry.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.180
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: No.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.959
No, don't worry about it.

00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:39.500
I was actually going
to say something

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.740
like some days you eat
salads and go to the gym,

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.660
and some days you eat
cupcakes and refuse

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.120
to put on your pants.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.770
And it's called balance.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:54.360
AMY SCHUMER: I like
the hogs bridge one.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.430
Thank you so much, guys.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.730
AIDY BRYANT: Thank you.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.896
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Thank
you so much, Amy and Aidy.

00:28:57.896 --> 00:28:59.980
[APPLAUSE]
