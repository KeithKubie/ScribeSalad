00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.290
Welcome to this presentation
of Google Play Services 6.1.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.790
In this video, we will look
at all the new features

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.750
we've added and that you can
use to build better apps.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.650
That's right.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.560
That's what Google Play
Services is all about,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.350
building better apps.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.650
To give you some perspective,
take this chair for example.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.610
This chair on Google
Play has given me

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.810
a completely new perspective
of what a chair can be like.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.040
And it's exactly the same thing
with Google Play Services.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.880
When you look at
all of the APIs,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.480
such as Games, Location Context,
Maps, Drive, Wallet, Ads,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.680
and all the new APIs
we add all the time,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.150
it will give you new perspective
of Google Play Services.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.950
But for now, let's check
out Google Play Services

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.730
6.1 and all the new
features we've added.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.050
So starting off with the
Google Drive Android API.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.410
This release includes
Completion Events,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.080
which allows your app to
get notified when actions

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.780
are committed to the server.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.160
And this also makes it possible
to respond to conflict, in case

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.840
there are parallel updates.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.510
And DriveResource now has
the method Set Parent,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.200
and although it doesn't
sound like much,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.430
this is quite a
big deal since it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.490
allows you to programmatically
organize files and folders.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.010
And finally, there is a class
called Drive Content that

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.112
simplifies working with
file, that's right, content.

00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:24.070
So if you haven't already,
let's stop and think

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.510
about this for a second.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.090
Google Drive is like a
hard drive in the cloud,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.570
always available and
accessible from any device.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.920
With this in mind, wouldn't
you be building a better app

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.555
if you used Google Drive?

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:38.055
Hmm?

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.860
Oh yeah!

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.120
Of course, you would.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.270
Moving on to Google Tag Manager.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.660
Hopefully you're
already a devoted user

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.800
of Google Analytics
Enhanced Ecommerce, which

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.190
allows you to get analytics
data on an activity flow,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.500
for example, a purchasing flow.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.890
That's right.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.860
Data is the key word
here, and as you know,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.980
you can have a lot
of fun with data.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.449
You can, for example, slice
it, dice it, and massage it.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.750
But apart from just
doing those operations,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.110
data is actually
very useful since it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.830
can represent things
happening in our world.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.410
Take a shopping
site for example,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.000
where it's pretty
important to know

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970
what makes it easy
and compelling

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.920
for customers to buy things.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.540
Well Enhanced Ecommerce can
provide you with all this data.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.790
Let's look at this example.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.360
In the first step
here, you can see

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.550
that there were almost
19,500 recorded sessions,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.130
but almost 14,000
of those did not

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.590
result in any shopping activity.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.240
But there were almost 5,500
product specification views,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.680
but 4,700 of those
did not result

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.980
in shopping cart activity.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.520
But there were 560 checkouts,
But 500 of those were canceled.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.960
So you can see out
of those 19,500

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.460
or so sessions we started
off with, only 64 became

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.330
actual shopping transactions.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.570
And this is the power
of Enhanced Ecommerce.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.650
It will give you the end
to end view of what works

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.000
and what doesn't work, so you
can improve and become better.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.160
And in this release, we're happy
to announce that the Google Tag

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.900
Manager also supports Enhanced
Ecommerce through the Universal

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.740
Analytics Tag.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.940
So make sure to check Enhanced
Ecommerce and Google Tag

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.320
Manager out because what
you don't know about,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.860
you can't improve.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.635
That's why data is so great.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.010
That's it for this release
of Google Play Services,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.870
but remember to check out
all the APIs of Google Play

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.400
Services, because there's
so much stuff in there

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.930
that you can use to
create better apps.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.620
And check out these
resources as well.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.330
Now it's your turn to go out
there and build better apps,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.100
and don't forget to
tell us all about it.
