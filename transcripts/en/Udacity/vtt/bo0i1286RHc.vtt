00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In fact this equation doesn't just describe the work required to move bucket of mass m of a height 8 h.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is the potential energy that a bucket has once it's at the site.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For potential energy we use the letter u and since there's many type of potential energy,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to use this subscript g to remind us we're dealing with gravitational potential energy.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now one thing I should point out is that this height in this equation seems to be really special.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
How did the bucket know it's potential energy should be

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
related to its height above this water level?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Why it could have been that high or why can the height have been negative?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
As when the bucket is below somewhere at this point.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In fact all of this choices for our reference zero point potential of energy

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
whether it's here or down here or even up here are totally valid.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Where we choose our zero point is completely arbitrary, but once we choose our zero point

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we have to consistent while we're solving a problem and you'll see what I mean by all this

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
when we keep solving more problems and now of course the question is, "Why is this idea useful?"

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
"Why do I care about potential energy?"

00:01:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Well, why don't we solve the problem that you could not have solved 10 minutes ago.
