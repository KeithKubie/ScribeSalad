00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:08.734
Thinking of getting a tattoo?

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.588
Decorating your birthday suit would add
another personal story

00:00:11.588 --> 00:00:16.677
to a history of tattoos stretching back
at least 8000 years.

00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:19.836
Tattooed mummies from around the world
attest to the universality

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:22.792
of body modification
across the millennia,

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:25.558
and to the fact that you really were
stuck with it forever

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:29.873
if your civilization never got around
to inventing laser removal.

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:32.560
A mummy from the Chinchorro culture
in pre-Incan Peru

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.594
has a mustache tattooed
on his upper lip.

00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:40.132
Ã–tzi, mummified iceman of the Alps, has
patterned charcoal tats along his spine,

00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:42.618
behind his knee 
and around his ankles,

00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:46.046
which might be from an early
sort of acupuncture.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.103
The mummy of Amunet, a priestess 
in Middle Kingdom Egypt,

00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:53.274
features tattoos thought to symbolize
sexuality and fertility.

00:00:53.274 --> 00:00:54.633
Even older than the mummies,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.715
figurines of seemingly tattooed
people,

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:02.091
and tools possibly used for tattooing
date back tens of thousands of years.

00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:05.820
Tattoos don't have one historical
origin point that we know of,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.239
but why do we English speakers
call them all tattoos?

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.592
The word is an anglophonic modification
of "tatao,"

00:01:12.592 --> 00:01:14.771
a Polynesian word used in Tahiti,

00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:18.388
where English captain James Cook
landed in 1769

00:01:18.388 --> 00:01:21.443
and encountered heavily tattooed
men and women.

00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:24.652
Stories of Cook's findings
and the tattoos his crew acquired

00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:27.745
cemented our usage of "tattoo" 
over previous words like

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:30.145
"scarring," "painting," and "staining,"

00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:33.521
and sparked a craze in Victorian
English high society.

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:36.966
We might think of Victorians
having Victorian attitudes

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.174
about such a risque thing,

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:43.653
and you can find such sentiments, and even
bans, on tattooing throughout history.

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:46.886
But while publicly some Brits looked down
their noses at tattoos,

00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:49.468
behind closed doors 
and away from their noses,

00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:51.794
lots of people had them.

00:01:51.794 --> 00:01:55.228
Reputedly, Queen Victoria had a tiger
fighting a python,

00:01:55.228 --> 00:01:59.492
and tattoos became very popular
among Cook's fellow soldiers,

00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:01.430
who used them to note their travels.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.707
You crossed the Atlantic? Get an anchor.

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:07.431
Been south of the Equator?
Time for your turtle tat.

00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.840
But Westerners sported tattoos 
long before meeting

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.883
the Samoans and Maori 
of the South Pacific.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:15.868
Crusaders got the Jerusalem Cross
so if they died in battle,

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:18.238
they'd get a Christian burial.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:21.066
Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall
had military tattoos

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:26.052
and called the Picts beyond it "Picts,"
for the pictures painted on them.

00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:30.492
There's also a long tradition
of people being tattooed unwillingly.

00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:33.352
Greeks and Romans tattooed slaves
and mercenaries to discourage

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.659
escape and desertion.

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.410
Criminals in Japan were tattooed as such
as far back as the 7th century.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.792
Most infamously, the Nazis tattooed
numbers on the chest or arms

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:47.558
of Jews and other prisoners
at the Auschwitz concentration camp

00:02:47.558 --> 00:02:50.555
in order to identify stripped corpses.

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:53.721
But tattoos forced on prisoners
and outcasts can be redefined

00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:57.101
as people take ownership
of that status or history.

00:02:57.101 --> 00:03:01.532
Primo Levi survived Auschwitz and wore
short sleeves to Germany after the war

00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:05.078
to remind people of the crime
his number represented.

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:07.230
Today, some Holocaust 
survivors' descendants

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.530
have their relatives numbers'
tattooed on their arms.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.713
The Torah has rules against tattoos,

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:17.226
but what if you want to make indelible
what you feel should never be forgotten?

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:21.156
And those criminals and outcasts of Japan,
where tattooing was eventually outlawed

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:24.806
from the mid-19th century to 
just after World War II,

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:27.194
added decoration to their penal tattoos,

00:03:27.194 --> 00:03:30.331
with designs borrowed from
woodblock prints, popular literature

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:33.837
and mythical spirtual iconography.

00:03:33.837 --> 00:03:38.998
Yakuza gangs viewed their outsider tattoos
as signs of lifelong loyalty and courage.

00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:42.997
After all, they lasted forever
and it really hurt to get them.

00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:47.394
For the Maori, those tattoos were an
accepted mainstream tradition.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:51.504
If you shied away from the excruciating
chiseling in of your moko design,

00:03:51.504 --> 00:03:54.682
your unfinished tattoo marked
your cowardice.

00:03:54.682 --> 00:03:56.899
Today, unless you go the traditional route,

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.898
your tattoo artist will probably use
a tattoo machine

00:03:59.898 --> 00:04:04.304
based on the one patented by
Samuel O'Reilly in 1891,

00:04:04.304 --> 00:04:09.786
itself based on Thomas Edison's
stencil machine from 1876.

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:14.049
But with the incredibly broad history
of tattoos giving you so many options,

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.952
what are you going to get?

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:18.297
This is a bold-lined expression of
who you are,

00:04:18.297 --> 00:04:20.694
or you want to appear to be.

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:24.744
As the naturalist aboard Cook's ship
said of the tataoed Tahitians,

00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:27.323
"Everyone is marked, thus in different
parts of his body,

00:04:27.323 --> 00:04:31.833
according maybe to his humor
or different circumstances of his life."

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:34.679
Maybe your particular humor
and circumstances

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:37.238
suggest getting a symbol
of cultural heritage,

00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:40.255
a sign of spirituality,
sexual energy,

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:43.370
or good old-fashioned
avant-garde defiance.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.054
A reminder of a great accomplishment,

00:04:45.054 --> 00:04:49.011
or of how you think it would look
cool if Hulk Hogan rode a Rhino.

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:52.806
It's your expression, your body, 
so it's your call.

00:04:52.806 --> 00:04:54.120
Just two rules:

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.797
you have to find a tattooist who
won't be ashamed to draw your idea,

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:01.023
and when in doubt, 
you can never go wrong with "Mom."
