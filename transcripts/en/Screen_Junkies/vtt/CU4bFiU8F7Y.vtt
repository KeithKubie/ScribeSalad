00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.800
We asked you to vote for the 2017 movies you wanted us to make an Honest Trailer for.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.720
And now, your #1 choice.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.040
Wow, you guys clearly hate us.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.160
After every Transformers movie, there is hope.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.560
Hope that they won't make another one.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.060
Now, the Bay bots are back for his final chapter.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.860
Until they return up to 14 more times.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.380
NO!

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.100
Strap in for another Shakespearean tale,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.920
in the sense that it's a tale told by an idiot,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.340
full of sound and fury

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.040
signifying nothing.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.280
But you can bet your life there'll be some big ass explosions,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.200
mild-to-moderate racism,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.200
"Hey, Chief!"

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.320
"My name is Sherman."

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.080
"It's OK to be a kid, Little Jay-lo."

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.000
"Aw, yeah! Decepticons is in da street!"

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.160
and action that looks like 2 Radio Shacks doing Kama Sutra in a hurricane.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.860
How are we doing? Are we done yet?

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.600
Nope, still going, huh?

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.860
UGH!

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.860
Forget everything you knew about the Transformers,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.460
because so did Micheal Bay,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.060
who in the third one said Cybertron was destroyed

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.380
and then this one said "Actually, it's back.",

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.960
in the fourth one said Megatron is now Galvatron

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.660
and then this one said "Uh, never mind, he's Megatron again.",

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.080
and in the first one said the Transformers came to Earth to find the Allspark

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.660
and learned English from the Internet

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.900
but then this one said "You know what? F*ck it!

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.640
They were allies with King Arthur, and one of them killed Hitler!"

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100
"That's the watch that killed Hitler."

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.840
See?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.060
We're not the only ones insulting the intelligence of Transformers movie fans,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.220
so is he.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840
Because we live in the darkest timeline,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.880
prepare for another Transformers movie that's mostly about the humans.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.600
Cade Yeager is back,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.000
and he's still an inventor.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.300
"I'm an inventor."

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.120
That's still from Texas?

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.700
"They have the support of the entire world."

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.340
Now, he'll team up with Vivian Wembly,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.280
a brilliant British uterus,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.300
"Have you found a man yet, Vivian?"

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.600
"It's the reason you're always single."

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.500
"What?"

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.060
generic military guys

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.360
yelling generic military things,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.120
"New target!"

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.240
"3 o'clock high!"

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.020
"Move, move, move!"

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.380
"Blaze it, blaze it, blaze it!"

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.000
a random street urchin so awkwardly crammed in,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.700
even she doesn't know why she's here,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.660
"What are you doing here?"

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.180
"I don't know."

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.860
and Anthony Hopkins,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.540
who delivers a brilliant portrayal...

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.620
of a man who won an Oscar then realized he's doing a Transformers movie.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.300
"My own family had some...

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.940
small parts in all this."

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.120
It's OK, Sir Anthony.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.100
At least you didn't get peed on by Bumblebee.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.860
"HEY, HEY!"

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.400
The rage-fueled, violent Decepticons are back

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.780
and the only things that can stop them

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.040
are the rage-fueled, violent Autobots

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.000
"I will kill you!"

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.360
"I will kill you!"

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.040
"I'll burn you so bad, you'll wish you died as a child."

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.720
and their rage-fueled, violent human allies.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.320
"OFF THE SUB, NOW!"

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.680
"You wanna get punched in the face really hard?"

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.960
"No."

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.460
Caught in the middle is Optimus Prime.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.640
"I am Optimus Prime."

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.140
"I am Optimus Prime."

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.060
We get it.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.100
"I am Optimus Prime."

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.840
Shut up!

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.680
"SHUT UP!"

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.800
He's been forced by a lady with dreads to turn against his family.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.060
And if you said that's the exact plot of Fate of the Furious,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.400
congratulations,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.240
you saw some really bad movies in 2017!

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.920
Wonder across a 2-and-a-half hour runtime,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.160
"Is Optimus good?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.180
Is he bad?

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.200
Do I care?

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.860
Where does he go for half the movie?!

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.060
Why is there a kung-fu robot butler?!

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.000
Am I high?!

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.980
What do words even mean anymore?!"

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.620
"Hurry, man, the dissolving scrotum!"

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.200
So roll out with a franchise Micheal Bay is so bored with,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.520
he's literally making characters out of garbage,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.760
builds up the importance of Bumblebee's voice

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.120
only to leave in the temp audio from his sound engineer,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.380
"Sting like a bee!"

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.460
and films the whole thing on 3 different aspect ratios that he rapidly shifts between for the entire movie.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.880
Gah, I cannot unsee that now!

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.740
"Logic has left the building."

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.060
"Big personalities just sort of clashing and lord, bloody!"

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.720
"From you, it sounds...

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.440
I don't know, vaguely racist."

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.360
"BLOW IT UP!"

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.960
"Has my life been wasted?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.940
Have you ever felt like that?"

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.760
You know what's almost as awkward as that long scene about having sex with Mark Wahlberg's underage daughter in the last movie?

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.980
An ever longer scene about how long it's been since Mark Wahlberg's had sex.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.780
"No whoopee, Mr. Cade?"

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.840
"It's been a while."

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.660
"Well, how long's a while, a week, a month, a year?"

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.400
MAKE IT STOP!
