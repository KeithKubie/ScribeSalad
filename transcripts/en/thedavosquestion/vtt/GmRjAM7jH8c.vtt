Hi I'm Cindy Ehnes and I am the Director of

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:11.959
the Department of Managed Healthcare in California
working on managed healthcare issues. But

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.599
when I look at what I think are the most important
things that people can come together around,

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.950
it would be recognizing the inherent dignity
and worth of each individual. Of all the things

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.031
that I think ultimately really get in the
way of solving problems, it is the fact that

00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:35.101
we are able to de-humanize other people and
to put them in a position where their sorrows,

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:42.550
their fears, their concerns and their suffering
really don't impact us because in many ways

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.590
it gets too hard to care. But that, in that
resistance or distance from caring really

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.960
leads us in many ways to de-humanize people
and inherently strip them of their dignities

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.969
and self worth. So, of all the things that
I would hope to see happen in 2008 it would

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.320
be a global recognition that every mother
cares about her children as much as I do,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.371
as much as we do. That every father trying
to earn a living and cares deeply about the

00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:22.479
ability to feed their family and that these
things don't differ. And that we must be helping

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.560
people to affirm their dignity and humanity.
