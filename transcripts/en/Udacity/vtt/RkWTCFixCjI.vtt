00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.460
Now let's implement
the startOver method.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.470
How should we implement this method?

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.590
Which class should be responsible for
navigating back to the root of the app?

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.130
In this case, the answer is
the UINavigationController class.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.200
Each ViewController has
a navigation controller property.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.640
It's an optional that references
the navigation controller that a given

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.650
ViewController is embedded in.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.800
When a ViewController receives
the indication to start over,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.400
it can communicate with
the navigation controller.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.960
And here you can see the careful
unwrapping of the optional.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.990
We could just pop off the current
view controller like this, but

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.180
we want to go all the way
back to the beginning.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.060
So we call popToRootView controller.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.090
Here's a recap of the two
properties we just learned about.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.022
The navigation item property
specifies features of the nav bar.

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:50.420
The navigationController property
provides a reference back to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.940
the navigation controller for

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.810
programmatic control of
view controller popping.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.270
Now take some time to get to
know these properties and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.360
get that start-over button working for
all the endpoints in your story.
