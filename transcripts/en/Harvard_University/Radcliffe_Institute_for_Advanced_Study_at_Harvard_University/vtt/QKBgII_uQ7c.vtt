00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.360
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.910
This is how we greet people
in my part of the world.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.450
And it means peace
be upon you all.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.630
Two days ago, Judy
invited us for dinner

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.020
at her home, us and all
the rest of the Fellows.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.080
And she shared with
us photos and memories

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.200
from her grandparents' and her
husband's grandparents' exodus

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.860
from Europe after World War II.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.149
The stories that she
shared reminded me--

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.940
the stories of displacement
that she shared

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.610
reminded me-- of my own
father's displacement

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.230
and his own stories.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.660
We actually-- the
Dajani family--

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.170
comes from Jerusalem
and Palestine.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.700
We've been there for
at least 500 years.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.100
And this is the tombstone
of one of my ancestors,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.320
who was born in 1459.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.570
And that's a shield of
armor for our family.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.350
And that's a group photo of the
extended family back in 1940s.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.540
And this is our compound,
the Dajani compound.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.190
We were the ancient--

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.450
we're the caretakers of one of
the ancient gates of Jerusalem

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.100
from the ancient city.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.700
But unfortunately,
in 1948, Zionists

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.620
took over my family home.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.246
And my father and his family had
to flee to Lebanon at that time

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:22.620
and haven't been
able to go back.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.734
They carry with them the photos,
the keys for their homes.

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:26.650
And they're not alone.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.160
There were only 700,000
people who flee then.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.840
So I felt so much compatibility
with Judy's story.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.780
And it made me reflect
on displacement

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.980
and what does it mean to us.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.160
And I think that
feeling of displacement,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.220
it pushes me to explore,
what does belonging mean?

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.610
And I think through a
different series of events,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.190
it's what ended with me
here today in front of you,

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.730
to share my journey
and my story.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.100
And not to spare you
anything from Jerusalem,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.910
I brought with me
today some sweets.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.280
So this is a shop, a sweet
shop that was established

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.960
in Jerusalem in the 1860s.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.310
It's called Zalatimo.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.250
Luckily, they opened a shop
in Jordan, so I was in Jordan

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.610
and I brought them with me.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.880
So I hope you'll enjoy
them after the talk.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.960
So my talk is
entitled Five Scarves.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.330
And I say five scarves,
what I mean is five hats.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.660
You know, the metaphor, you wear
a hat, you wear multiple hats.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.720
You have different
careers or different roles

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.759
you play in life.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.300
So I don't wear
hats, I wear a scarf.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.580
So that's why I'm going to
tell you the five scarves I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.890
wear as I go through my talk.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.880
My talk is divided
into three parts.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.450
Part one will be how the
starred story started.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.490
Part two, the main
theme of the book.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.680
And then part three,
the unanswered questions

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.000
that I hope you will help
me answer during our Q&amp;A.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.600
As human beings,
we enjoy stories.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.060
We love to listen to stories.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.400
And I think this is
part of our evolution.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.220
So through ancient
history, as humans evolved,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.360
probably there were
two groups of people.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.540
A group of people
that sat around

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.000
the fire and read
stories, and another

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.822
did not sit around
telling stories.

00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:07.780
They were more serious.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.990
And they frowned upon those
who sat around reading stories.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.110
And you can imagine which one
of those groups survived today.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.380
It's the storytellers.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.340
So apparently, storytelling
is essential for our survival

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.260
as a species to cope
with this world.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.660
So in the spirit
of evolution, I'm

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.470
going to share with you my
story and how it brought me here

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.270
to Radcliffe.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.470
So my journey starts
four decades ago.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.610
I come from a family of eight
girls and I'm the eldest.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.940
And we had a boy in the end,
but there's a 20 year difference

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.460
between him and I. So I
don't consider he's part

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.700
of the family at this point.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.060
We grew up, there
was no TV by choice.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.020
And so, we read a lot.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.120
We read different
stories and novels.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.880
And we read National Geographic
and Scientific American.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.365
And we actually did a
lot of play rolling--

00:03:57.365 --> 00:03:59.980
role playing, to the
extent that sometimes we

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.600
mistook the book for real life.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.530
Many, many times.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.560
We're eight girls,
different ages, sizes.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.200
So we could do that.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.740
And we also had many
debates and discussions

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.620
at home, between us-- the
girls-- and with my parents,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.000
both my mother and father.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.779
And this is what fostered in
us curiosity, asking questions,

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.360
and not letting ourselves to
be comfortable with anything

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.609
that was not less than logical
in the way we approach things.

00:04:22.609 --> 00:04:24.400
I also learned three
lessons in that period

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.460
of my life, which stemmed from
my upbringing, my culture,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.540
and my religion.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.600
And those were one, that
you have a responsibility

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.617
towards your community.

00:04:32.617 --> 00:04:34.450
You have to do something
for your community.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.150
You can't just enjoy
life by yourself.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.317
And the second lesson
is that we have to-- we

00:04:40.317 --> 00:04:42.400
are responsible for our
time, to do something good

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.983
with our time.

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:45.010
And not to spend
it without meaning.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.110
The third lesson was, it
doesn't matter if you succeed.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.050
What matters is that you try.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.370
That's the important thing.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.220
So those lessons are what I
carried along with me in life

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.550
and helped me in what
I did eventually.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.070
Now, in Jordan, if your
father is a physician,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.210
you go and study medicine.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.200
It's expected of you.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.180
And I think, to a certain
extent, it is in many cultures.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.330
So my father was a
physician, and therefore, I

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.310
was going to study medicine.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.430
After I went into my
first year at college,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.220
I decided I don't want to do
medicine, because I was scared.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.887
I was scared of making a mistake
and killing someone by mistake.

00:05:18.887 --> 00:05:20.261
And so, I thought,
you know what?

00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:22.125
I'm going to be a
biologist, a scientist.

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:26.230
And if I make a mistake it will
be with mice or worms or flies.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.780
And I could sleep if I
made a mistake with them.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.850
And even as a
scientist, I could still

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.690
serve humanity
through my research,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.900
through discovering the
reasons behind disease,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.410
how proteins communicate,
how cells talk to each other.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.650
So I studied biology and I
wanted to be a scientist.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.710
Now, when you choose to study
something because you love it,

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.680
you excel in it, and
work becomes play.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.170
Einstein said, choose
the easiest path.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.170
That way you enjoy every day
and every day is a play day.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.030
And actually I chose
biology because to me,

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.900
it was the easiest.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.890
And I love it.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.600
And to me, everyday
is a play day.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.140
I don't consider
my work as work.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.980
I also graduated from college
and then I went and did

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.610
my master's.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.330
But in Jordan, there's no PhD
programs back in the 1980s.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.180
And so, there was
no internet, either.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.830
So if you wanted
to study abroad,

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.480
you'd have to send a letter
and wait for three weeks

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.521
and send another letter
and wait for three weeks.

00:06:18.521 --> 00:06:21.010
And you didn't know what were
the ranges of scholarships

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.750
available.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.102
So I was not able to go, because
I didn't get a scholarship.

00:06:26.102 --> 00:06:28.060
I actually got accepted
at Cambridge University

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.390
eventually, but I didn't
have the financial money

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.920
to actually go there.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.020
And by then, I was married
and I had one child.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.750
And my advisor then at
Cambridge University told me,

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.050
you can't come and do
your PhD with one child.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.560
Later on, I did it with
four, but he doesn't know.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.160
So the first scarf that I
like to say proudly I wear

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.520
is the one that I am a
mother of four children.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.210
And so, I like to
wear my scarf that I'm

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.590
the mother of four children.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.131
Now, they're all
grown up, of course.

00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:57.120
This is a picture
a long time ago.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.160
Now, meanwhile, since I
couldn't become a scientist,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.120
I became a teacher.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.680
So everybody who studies
science in Jordan,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.500
if you're not academic,
you become a teacher.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.833
So I was a teacher for 10 years.

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:08.710
And I taught elementary school,
high school, from grade 1

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.620
to grade 12, I taught biology,
science in English and Arabic.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.260
All different types of programs.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.234
And I think that
period of my life

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:17.650
helped me understand what are
the challenges that children

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.229
face in their everyday lives.

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:20.770
What are the challenges
that teachers

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.360
face in their everyday life.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.240
And how important the
job of the teacher.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.930
And how we, as a community,
don't give enough importance

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.890
for the teacher.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.281
And I always say if I ever
become a minister of education,

00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:34.780
the first thing I
will do is to make

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.090
it compulsory for every college
graduate to teach for one year.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.260
It's like military obligation.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.290
You have to do that.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.831
And the reason is
if they do it, they

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:45.830
realize how difficult
and important

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.780
is the job and the
role of the teacher,

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.150
because he or she are bringing
up the next generation.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.930
Well, as I was
teaching, my husband

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.480
saw an ad in the newspaper
that the Fulbright

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.241
was offering PhD programs.

00:07:58.241 --> 00:07:59.990
And so he said, Rana,
there's your chance.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.060
Because my dream is
still to be a scientist.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.920
So I actually, at the age of
30, took my exams all over again

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.730
and wrote essays all over again.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.610
And I was called for
an interview the day

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.850
before my last daughter was due.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.040
And I told them, but
tomorrow's my due date.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.500
And they said, oh,
if you have the baby,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.102
you can call us from
your hospital bed.

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:23.060
I didn't have the baby.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.018
And the baby is actually
sitting here in front,

00:08:25.018 --> 00:08:27.080
[? Zara, ?] she's my last one.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.790
And I went to the interview.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.940
I made the interview,
I got a scholarship.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.740
And now, the decision
was, what do we do?

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.240
This is a family, a full
family of four kids from zero

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.401
to 10 years old.

00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:41.900
And we were thinking,
what do we do?

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.070
Do I take the kids and go?

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.560
Does my husband keep the kids
in Jordan, I go by myself?

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.080
This is a PhD in
molecular biology,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.910
it's a five year commitment.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.380
And at that point
my husband, who

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.717
was a Lieutenant Colonel in
the Air Force, he said, Rana,

00:08:54.717 --> 00:08:55.550
I'm going to resign.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.220
So he resigned so that we could
keep the whole family together.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.207
And we went as one
unit to the US,

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:01.790
so that we could
take care of the kids

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.230
together, make
sure that they had

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.600
a healthy home with both parents
there to take care of them.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.440
So my husband has been
my mentor and my friend

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.400
and supporting me in
everything I do all along.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.270
So I moved to the states.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.580
First of all, I made it
very clear to my advisor

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.370
that my family is as
important as my research.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.830
And if push comes to
shove, my kids come first.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.430
So I always left at five, I
never came in on weekends.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.160
And yet, I graduated
similar to my peers who

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.750
didn't have kids,
who were single,

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.280
who stayed all night in
the lab and on weekends.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.670
So it's about time
management, knowing

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.650
how to do things
in the right way,

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.570
and setting your
priorities right.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.035
And at home, actually my kids--

00:09:41.035 --> 00:09:41.660
I trained them.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.190
They did all the chores.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.020
They did all the dinners.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.090
Many times, if I had an
exam, I would come home

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.900
to find a six course dinner done
by my son, not my daughters.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.110
Or a pie coming out of the
oven, very hot because I

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.820
had an exam or something.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.560
And not just that, I actually
involved them in my work.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.500
So every time I'd
go home and share

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.390
my experiments and my
results, and they'd

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.020
come up with hypotheses.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.260
So when Mama was late, she
was testing their hypotheses.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.600
So they were really excited.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.510
And they made friends
with all my mice.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.090
And of course, I was not allowed
to kill them until after--

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.059
I had to beg them that I had to
do it and I would explain why.

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:19.850
And actually, they all
have acknowledgments

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.120
in my publications for
being part of my research.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.850
But that led to them being
immune to anything scientific.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.687
So none of them went
to science at all.

00:10:28.687 --> 00:10:30.020
They're all into the humanities.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.870
They've had enough growing
up with being a scientist.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.270
And this is them
celebrating with me.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.250
They put me this
big card that I just

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.080
won a PhD, as if you win it.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.200
You know, it's not
that we worked hard.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.900
So then, after that we,
went back to Jordan.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.310
And in Jordan, I started
at the University my work.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.720
At the same time,
when you change

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.845
from one country to one
country or from one culture

00:10:52.845 --> 00:10:56.690
to another culture, you
realize that there's

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.200
something different.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.210
Things that you didn't notice
before you notice again,

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.450
either bad or good.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.180
And that's when I noticed that
children in Jordan don't read,

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.320
don't read for pleasure.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.300
So they read for education, they
read for religious purposes.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.570
But when you speak about
reading for pleasure--

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.090
under the covers, you can't
wait to finish the story--

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.139
that kind of reading.

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:17.180
And that kind of reading
is very, very important,

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.830
because when you
read for pleasure,

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.330
this boosts your
imagination, your creativity.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.740
You gain vocabulary.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.960
And this vocabulary helps
you express yourself better

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.254
and you become less violent.

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.670
You'll learn about
other cultures.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.240
So this develops your empathy
to understand others, listen

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.610
to others, and communicate
better with others.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.792
And you become more
confident, because you

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:38.750
draw from the heroes you
read about the courage

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.490
to make a difference
in your own life.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.930
So reading for pleasure
is very, very important.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.770
And I was looking in--
especially like in Jordan

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.660
and Arab countries--

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.540
Islam is the majority religion.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.730
And the first word
of the Quran is read.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.610
So to me, the question is, why
don't we read for pleasure?

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.380
And I did some research
and I found out

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.610
that the reason we
don't read for pleasure

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:59.984
is because we
don't love to read.

00:11:59.984 --> 00:12:00.840
There's no passion.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.300
There's no-- this burning need
and desire that I want to read.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.330
And also I did some research
to try to understand, how do we

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.660
plant that love of reading?

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.376
How do we make
people love to read?

00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:13.250
And I found out, although
many people thought

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.650
it was because they
don't have enough books,

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.670
I found out that was
not the main reason.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.670
The main reason that
children don't love to read

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.380
is because their parents
don't read aloud to them

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.550
when they're very young.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.140
You should read to
your child as early

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.973
as when the mother is
pregnant, because what

00:12:25.973 --> 00:12:27.684
happens in the
brain of the child,

00:12:27.684 --> 00:12:29.600
there becomes a connection
between the feeling

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.450
of security, happiness,
and comfort with reading.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.200
So you grow up, you want to be
a reader because it gives you

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.540
this good sense, the sense
of happiness, security

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.890
that you don't know
where it comes from.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:46.450
So I found the solution to
make children love to read.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.860
So what did I do at that time?

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.600
I mean, I could--

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.194
it's impossible to go around
and tell every parent,

00:12:51.194 --> 00:12:52.860
you have to read aloud
to your children.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.951
That's too much.

00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:55.950
And even if I told the
government to pass a law,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.440
that doesn't mean they're
going to follow the law.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.300
So I felt this huge
responsibility.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.508
And I thought, you know what?

00:13:01.508 --> 00:13:04.260
I'm going to collect together
the children in my neighborhood

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.462
and read aloud to them.

00:13:05.462 --> 00:13:06.420
And that's what we did.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.190
It was a family project.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.840
My husband and
children were involved.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.381
And we started
reading in the mosque,

00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:12.880
because it's in
every neighborhood.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.890
And we thought, why not?

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:14.430
It's clean.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.270
It's got a carpet.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.557
It's got a bathroom.

00:13:16.557 --> 00:13:18.390
And the first time we
announced that there's

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.524
going to be a read aloud, the
parents dragged their children

00:13:21.524 --> 00:13:23.940
to come and attend, because
they heard in the announcement

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.850
reading, education,
mosque, religion.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:27.690
This is great.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.640
The children didn't
want to come of course,

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.190
but because we're very
obedient, they all came.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.620
But when they come, I dress--

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.690
I bring funny stories
from their culture,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.464
from their everyday life
in their native tongue.

00:13:39.464 --> 00:13:41.630
And the children just fell
in love with the stories.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.606
And then they line up
and take the books home.

00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:45.230
And they started
becoming the champions

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.760
of reading within
their own homes,

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.440
begging their parents
to read to them

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.500
or themselves reading to
their peers or their siblings.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.690
And so, a culture of
reading for pleasure

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.640
started to grow in
my neighborhood.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.490
And the program, we
called it We Love Reading.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.840
And it began to grow.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.720
So we created a training program
for women, and then later men

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.620
as well.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.810
And we started developing
our own stories

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.280
for children in Arabic.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.190
And the program flourished
and spread, as Judy

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.490
said, now it's actually
35 countries and counting.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.740
And we base all our
programming on research,

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.210
because I'm a scientist.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.490
So we involved Yale
University, Harvard University,

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.960
Chicago University, and Brown.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.890
And we did studies on different
aspects of the program

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.750
to make sure that what
we're doing is right

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.060
and how we can develop
it even better.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.550
And I'm going to show you a
short video of We Love Reading

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.460
and how it has spread and has
been so effective, specifically

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.840
in refugee contexts.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.600
Where the children are
in need of an education

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.750
program that they can engage
in, even if there is no school.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.810
And where adults need a purpose
and agency in their lives.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.270
Because in We Love Reading,
adults are all volunteers.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.320
We don't pay them.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.150
And they only do it
not because they do it

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.860
for me or for the
program, they actually

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.041
read aloud to the children
for their own good,

00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:55.040
for their own community.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.480
So it's sustainable
in that sense

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.990
and gives them
agency and ownership.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.729
So enjoy.

00:18:04.361 --> 00:18:06.090
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.130
- So this actual
video, the music for it

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.720
was made by a
Syrian composer who

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.300
used to be one of my students
when I was a teacher.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.930
And so, the second scarf
is I was a teacher.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.170
And that's my role.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.628
And the third one, because I
forgot to talk about that one,

00:18:18.628 --> 00:18:20.419
is that I'm a social
entrepreneur because

00:18:20.419 --> 00:18:21.210
of We Love Reading.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.450
So those are my third.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.710
Now, meanwhile, I was actually--

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.250
I had a lab that I
was taking care of.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.790
And I had research.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.480
So what I did, I
established my lab.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.140
And coming back to
Jordan from doing a PhD

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.020
and conducting research in
a high tech environment,

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.820
I had to find my own question.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.760
And find my own research that
I could compete internationally

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.470
and produce good science
within the constraints,

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.470
whether it's funding
or bureaucracy that

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.120
existed in my country.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:51.870
And I'm not alone.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.740
This is in all
developing countries.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.750
So I had to look around.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.030
What is it that I could
give that's not found

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.520
in any other part of the world?

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.440
And at that time, the Human
HapMap project was coming out.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.870
And deCODE, if people
aren't familiar with it,

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.080
it's an Icelandic company
that was coming out

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.850
doing genome-wide
association studies.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.090
Discovering one gene after
another as novel risk

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.510
factors for diabetes, for
schizophrenia, for cancer

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.800
and so on.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.340
So that started-- got me
thinking that in Jordan,

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.090
we actually have two ethnic
populations that emigrated from

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.420
southern Russia--

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.580
they are the Chechens
and the Circassians--

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.070
150 years ago, when they were
persecuted for their religion.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:36.630
And they either fled or died
or were deported to Siberia.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.880
So these two populations
actually came to Jordan

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.870
and settled in Jordan.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.180
And they maintained
their isolation

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.250
by marrying only
within each other.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.060
So I thought, I have a gold
treasure in my backyard.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.700
So I started
collecting and doing

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.220
sweeps, studies
with anthropology,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.040
epidemiology, and genetics
on these two populations.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.227
And we created a DNA data bank.

00:19:58.227 --> 00:20:00.810
And we became experts with those
two populations in the world,

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.500
because nobody else had
studied them so extensively.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.700
And just because they've
been in Jordan for 150 years

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.090
is not enough to
change any genetics.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.560
So the gene pool with them
is pretty homogeneous.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.130
And last year, we got
a call from Berkeley,

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.750
from Rasmus Nielsen's lab--

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.940
who studies human
migration out of Africa--

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.340
asking us to contribute
and collaborate

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.170
with him with our
DNA, so that he

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.170
could add it to the pool of
DNA of humans migrating out

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.070
of Africa.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.470
And we actually submitted
our work to nature.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.692
We got the second round
review of reviewers,

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:34.650
which is very positive.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.025
So we're excited
that we're going

00:20:36.025 --> 00:20:38.490
to be publishing in
nature, although we're just

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.960
a small lab in Jordan with
the minimum resources.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.150
But this is about asking
the right question

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.710
at the right time.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.750
And then, because we
have this DNA data bank,

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.760
we started saying, what
other complex diseases

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.780
we could study in
these two populations?

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.960
So I chose to study
diabetes, because it

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.720
doesn't have a stigma
for an ethnic population.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.830
And we actually discovered novel
genetic risk factors and copy

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.550
number variances in
these populations

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.000
that we just published
earlier this year.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.510
And this led us that we wanted
to identify those genetic risk

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.010
factors in those populations.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.050
We wanted to express them
in cells, in stem cells,

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.050
so that we can understand
what is their function

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.630
and how that contributes to
the mechanism of development

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:19.574
of diabetes.

00:21:19.574 --> 00:21:21.740
However, to do that, we had
to deal with stem cells.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.060
And that's when I
came back to Jordan,

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.220
after getting that
training on how

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.450
to do induced
pluripotent stem cells,

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.810
that I wanted to make sure
ethically that it's OK for me

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:31.620
to do that.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.240
Or if I wanted to use
human embryonic stem cells.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.780
And that's when we created
a committee in Jordan--

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.130
from theologians, scientists,
physicians lawyers--

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.720
to explore what is
allowed and what

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.190
is not allowed for research
and later, for therapy.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.250
And we passed a law,
which was the first law

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.270
in the region that allowed us
to use human embryonic stem

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.340
cells up to the age
of five days, which

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.880
is enough to actually make a
human embryonic stem cell line.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.990
So this was very
progressive for us,

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.250
considering the environment
that was going around.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.833
Where in the states,
it wasn't allowed

00:22:03.833 --> 00:22:07.020
for a certain period of
time or in other countries.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.480
And lastly, because
as a scientist

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.790
we hold a responsibility
to our communities

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.870
and to our societies, with the
Syrian crisis spilling over

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.180
to Jordan and other
countries, I started thinking,

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:24.160
what can I do as a scientist
to help the people around us?

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.940
And so, I started
looking on, how

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.000
does the trauma affect
the children, the youth,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.800
and the adults?

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.021
Does that affect only
physiological and mental

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:35.520
health?

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.710
And can it be transmitted
to other generations?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.990
Which brought me into
the field of epigenetics.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.240
And just to give you
briefly, epigenetics

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.020
is like something that happens
to you in your environment.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.550
In this picture, it's
the mother smoking.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.760
But you can imagine the trauma
of war compared to smoking.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.530
And how that trauma
not just only

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.580
affects the body of
the individual who

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.880
is being exposed to
the trauma directly,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.960
but it also affects
the fetus inside her.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.820
And if that fetus is
a female, it actually

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.310
affects the reproductive
cells inside the fetus

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.450
inside the mother.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.614
So the effects are
intergenerational.

00:23:08.614 --> 00:23:10.280
And like my daughter
likes to remind me,

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.860
it's the immortal
kiss of grandparents

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.180
that affects us in the end.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.360
So we hope that this research,
which is very new, where we're

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.120
comparing multiple
generations and looking

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.480
at the genetics and the
signature of the trauma

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.870
to help maybe develop programs
to help the children exposed

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.720
or their grandparents exposed.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.060
So this, of course, this
is my fourth scarf, right?

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.890
I'm the scientist.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.830
Now, the problems I faced
as a scientist in Jordan

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.480
were not specific
to me as a woman.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.180
There was challenges that
affected everybody, male

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.340
and female.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.150
And this is not just for Jordan,
for all developing countries.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.490
Whether it's bureaucracy or
lack of funding, and so on.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.260
So I actually I wrote
an article in Nature

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.650
two weeks ago as
an essay describing

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.040
the challenges that we
face in giving solutions.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.140
That it's not about just the
resources inside our country,

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.800
many times it's also the
nations that actually

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.200
fund us or send us money.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.450
Sometimes they send us the
money without understanding

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.290
what are the dynamics
inside the country.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.290
And the solution is that
we need to sit together

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.620
on a table for us to describe
to them what our problems.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.890
And for them to come up with
solutions or conditions,

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:24.910
as donors, to make things
happen more efficiently.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.490
However, as a woman scientist,
I do experience challenges.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.730
And these are not
unique to me in Jordan.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.410
They are similar
to other challenges

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.320
that women face across
the world, even in the US.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.870
And across careers,
not just as scientists.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.600
As lawyers, as bankers,
as business people.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.150
And I did two things
to address that.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.110
One is I think that there are
many successful women that we

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.610
don't know about, we don't read
about, we don't learn about.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.950
And if we brought those
to the forefront more,

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.070
by writing their stories, I
think more people will be aware

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.230
and more girls will be
encouraged to do science.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.260
And more boys will respect
woman scientists or women

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.550
in other careers.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.740
The second thing I did is I
developed a mentoring network.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.670
And the reason I did it is
because as mothers, we do

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.180
our work because we enjoy it.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.720
I enjoy my science very much.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.590
But at the same time,
I enjoy my children.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.671
So I don't have time for the
side talks, the coffee talk

00:25:14.671 --> 00:25:15.670
to know what's going on.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.884
What's the next
conference and so on.

00:25:17.884 --> 00:25:19.300
So through this
mentoring network,

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.060
we paired females
together in a way

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.760
they would help each other
in a holistic approach,

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.110
both professionally
and personally.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.920
And then we called it the
Three Circles of Alemat,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.610
as you can see.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.820
And alemat means female
scientist in Arabic.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.790
So that speaks to the
history of the presence

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.940
of female scientists
throughout the years.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.680
And we envisioned it as in this
cartoon, where seeds of pairs

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.170
actually help each other
to grow shoots and roots.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.910
And then these shoots
and roots grow up

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.910
to be trees that produce new
seeds, and so on and so forth.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.210
So it's like a cycle.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.700
And this mentoring tool
kit that we developed

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.340
is already free online
for anybody to use it.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.960
And it's not just for females.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.240
Actually males can use it.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.430
It's not just for scientists, it
could be for any walk of life.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.590
And you could be a member
of any organization.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.384
You could go take the
mentoring tool kit,

00:26:10.384 --> 00:26:11.800
apply it within
your organization.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.450
It's a step by step guide.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.230
And because we wanted to
promote this all over the world,

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.020
we produced this video
as an inspiration

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.910
for female scientists
and mentoring.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.820
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.250
- The world needs
us because we are

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.750
scientists, teachers, artists.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.400
We are in all walks of life.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:50.710
We are also the daughters,
the wives, the mothers.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.270
And above all, we are humans.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.380
Humans need to question
and be questioned,

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:05.090
to think, to share thoughts and
emotions, to spread knowledge.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.927
We create networks to
experience moments,

00:27:07.927 --> 00:27:11.663
a sense of
togetherness, and joy.

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:16.970
Three Circles of Alemat exists
because humans are determined

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.050
to make it into this world.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.454
So shall we start?

00:27:22.454 --> 00:27:25.448
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:32.434 --> 00:27:34.450
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.430
- Which brings me
to the second part

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.560
of my talk, which is the
main theme of the book

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.290
that I'm writing while
I'm here at Radcliffe.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.710
And this actually starts
with another story, which

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.580
is a few years ago, I got an
email from an organization

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.830
based in Britain
called Muslim Science.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.490
Where they had chosen 20 female
scientists from the Islamic

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.770
world-- which is
about 1.6 billion--

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:01.660
as female scientists who have
had an impact on the world.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.774
And I was one of them.

00:28:02.774 --> 00:28:04.440
And that was great,
thank you very much.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.900
And I was scrolling down to
read the rest of the email

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.000
and they had given a
title for each one of us.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.150
So the mathematician, the
cardiologist, the change-maker,

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.110
and things like that.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:17.170
And as I was scrolling down
to find out what was my title,

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.562
I found out that my title
was the Islamic feminist.

00:28:20.562 --> 00:28:22.770
And when they told me that,
when I read that, I said,

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.220
that's impossible.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.620
Because when you say Islamic,
all the Western world

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.500
looks at you with suspicion.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.080
And when you say feminist,
all the Eastern world

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.250
looks at you as suspicious.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.010
And so, I lost on both accounts.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:38.290
I emailed them, I
explained that to them.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.000
They said, no, when you write--

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.930
I write a lot--

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.610
this is what you are.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.880
And since then, I've been
trying to own the term,

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.540
own the identity, own
the title, redefine it.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.250
Give it a new meaning
that fits with what I am.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.670
And that's what made
me want to write a book

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.610
to explore what this is.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.694
So that's actually the
fifth scarf, right?

00:28:59.694 --> 00:29:01.110
They call me the
Islamic feminist.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.170
I didn't want this.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.130
I didn't work for it.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:04.240
It was given to me.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.930
So that's the way of life.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.160
So I wanted to explore.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.170
So the first thing that
I realized around me

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.930
as I was exploring, the
rhetoric around the world,

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.930
is that there are not enough
women in the workforce,

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.510
that half the population
is not being utilized,

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.969
that the economy
is being affected.

00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:22.718
And if we had more
women in the workforce,

00:29:22.718 --> 00:29:23.920
the economy would increased.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.600
And we have all these
statistics showing

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.330
the different percentages
of females around the world.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:32.350
But then I was reading a book.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.122
And in this book,
I read an expert

00:29:34.122 --> 00:29:35.830
who was very, very
interesting and moving

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.210
that I want to share with you.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.810
And it's a very
nice story that I

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.790
hope you'll enjoy
as I read it to you.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.330
Tomorrow, I will
do the unthinkable.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.960
Once again, I will
pass over a newborn.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.150
My heart will break.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.500
I'm told to toughen up.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:02.410
I'm reminded that I should be
thankful that I have a job.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.960
Tomorrow morning, I will
race around the house

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.440
to ensure that I can do as much
as possible for my children

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.510
before leaving for work.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.490
And despite the fact
that I am just one

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.980
of hundreds of thousands
of working mothers

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.680
who must do what they have
to do for their family,

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.670
my heart breaks as I know they
too are suffering and aching

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.110
for their baby.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.260
Hard work?

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.020
I'm not afraid of that.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.870
We are your typical
middle class family.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.510
My husband and I
both have good jobs.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.560
We work hard and we provide a
roof over our children's heads,

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:40.120
warm beds to sleep, and
full tummies every night.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.100
Our children have
everything they need.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:49.630
But if you ask what our children
want most, they'll tell you us.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.550
They want their mommy.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:55.180
Tomorrow, I will wipe away
tears, pull toddlers off

00:30:55.180 --> 00:31:00.310
of my legs, unclench tiny little
fingers from around my neck,

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.800
and pass over a very new baby.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.780
I will not be able
to kiss boo-boos that

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.610
happen throughout the day.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.730
I will not be able to lay
babies down for their naps.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.330
I will not be able to feed my
newborn when she cries for me.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.830
Once again, I will have to try
to pretend mommy isn't hurting

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.960
or an emotional wreck inside.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.090
And make my best attempt
to put on a brave

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.640
face for the sake of my babies.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.240
But knowing myself, no matter
how courageous I strive to be,

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.030
undoubtfully tears will
stream down my face.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.840
I have such trouble wrapping
my head around the thought

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.560
and accepting the fact
that my role as a mother

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.950
is not valued by society.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.320
That I don't have the freedom
to decide what is important

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.410
and what is valued.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.360
After I finished
reading that story,

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.810
I was reminded by a paragraph
from John Green's The Fault

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:55.500
in Our Stars.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.150
I don't know if
you've read the book.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.350
But in his book, he says,
sometimes you read a book

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.620
and it fills you with this
weird, evangelical zeal.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.770
And you become convinced that
the shattered world will never

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:12.270
be put back again together
unless and until all living

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.890
humans read the book.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.840
That's how I felt when
I read that excerpt.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.060
And that's why I wanted
to share it with you.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.390
And as John Green also said,
I'm on a roller coaster that

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.940
only goes up going from there.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.840
So from there, I
started exploring.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.710
And the first thing
I did is I wanted

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.534
to try to understand the
dilemma, where on one hand,

00:32:31.534 --> 00:32:33.950
people were telling me there's
not enough room in the work

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:35.602
force, we need to
get more women in.

00:32:35.602 --> 00:32:37.560
And on the other hand,
I read about this woman,

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.940
how she feels.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.010
So what's right
and what's wrong?

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.500
And what should we
do as a society?

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.110
So that was my question
that I wanted to answer.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.589
And at that point, I got
an Eisenhower fellowship.

00:32:48.589 --> 00:32:50.130
And I used the
fellowship to actually

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.069
interview hundreds of women
from different cultures,

00:32:53.069 --> 00:32:55.110
different backgrounds,
and different career paths

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.810
to try to understand,
unpack that question.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.810
And I asked them a series of
questions, amongst which were,

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.086
what does success mean to you?

00:33:03.086 --> 00:33:05.460
If you were a man, would you
choose the same career path?

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.000
And things like that.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.700
And these will be the
essence of my book

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.170
that I'm writing
now at Radcliffe.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.170
And so I'm going to give
you some of my results.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.520
And I'm going to
focus on the science--

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.950
women in science more,
because that's my background.

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.830
But I think the results
and the findings

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:23.430
will be applicable to all
fields and all careers.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.040
So if we look at women
in science similarly,

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.600
we have very low
numbers compared to men.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.980
And this is all over the
world, as this data shows us.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.710
Of course, it's gray for the US,
you don't have data for the US.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:35.400
I wonder why.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.570
I don't know.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.130
So if you look at
the trajectory,

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.310
and this is reporting
for the Western world,

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.350
you see that the
percentages of males--

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.820
which is in blue as you go
through the education stage,

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.920
high school,
bachelor's degree, PhD,

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.570
and then research careers--

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.760
are the percentages of
males are also pretty high.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.740
And then when you
go to the females,

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.750
the percentages
start going down.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.240
And to me, the first thing
that comes to my mind

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.210
to explain this, which is
the first hypothesis-- so I

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.210
tried to address this issue
as a scientific problem,

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:06.925
as a scientist.

00:34:06.925 --> 00:34:08.550
So I just want to
put a disclaimer here

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.170
that I'm not a
social scientist, I'm

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.060
not an education specialist.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.520
I'm just coming at
this as a scientist,

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.580
thinking that this
really matters and I

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.920
have to do something about it.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.880
I think as scientists,
we play sometimes roles

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.150
outside of our science, outside
of our labs and classrooms

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.290
that we owe to society.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.330
Because I think society
is kind of already

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:31.170
bored from civic society
and from religious leaders

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:32.010
preaching.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:35.129
And they're thirsty for a
different kind of role model

00:34:35.129 --> 00:34:36.420
to look up to and to listen to.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.794
And we know that our students
listen to us as scientists.

00:34:38.794 --> 00:34:41.060
So we have something
that we can give.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.489
So my first hypothesis
was, maybe we

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.889
don't have enough
women in the workforce

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.600
because women are
not educated enough.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.030
And this is a lot of
rhetoric going around.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:53.870
And in this graph here, it seems
that women are not educated

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.370
enough, as you can see.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.400
Because the percentages
are like 32% and then

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.660
25% in a PhD level.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.830
But when I look in
Jordan, I found out

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:04.790
that the statistics
are very different.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.670
In Jordan, we have 64%
female in bachelor's degree.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.870
And actually, in biology,
my class has 90% females.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.870
Pharmacy, it's almost
90% females as well.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.400
And if we go to the
master's degrees, 57%.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.990
PhD, it's 56%.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.600
So apparently it's
not about education

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.210
if in Jordan, where we even have
less women in the workforce,

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.760
we have more educated women.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.390
So I crossed out that hypothesis
applying the scientific method.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.090
And I drew my line, which is
the red line, where, no, we're

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.890
highly educated as females.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.230
And that could not be the
reason or the prime reason

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.420
that we have less
women in the workforce.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.260
So the second hypothesis
is, oh, maybe the workforce

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:47.665
is not comfortable and
flexible for women.

00:35:47.665 --> 00:35:49.427
I don't know if
I'm ruining this.

00:35:49.427 --> 00:35:50.885
I'm going to take
these off, sorry.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.500
And yes, we have less women in
the workforce also in Jordan.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.100
And this is some data showing
that we have 23% female

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.530
in research careers in Jordan.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.990
But this hypothesis
didn't hold up either.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.320
Because McKinsey has been
producing report after report

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.800
showing that even after
you introduce measures

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.260
in the workplace to make it more
easier and flexible for women,

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.630
such as nurseries or flexible
hours or a little bit more

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.510
extended maternity leave--
not much in the US--

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:26.180
still the percentages
of women remain low.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.287
So that crossed out
my second hypothesis.

00:36:28.287 --> 00:36:29.870
And I started thinking,
wait a minute.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.610
As a scientist,
you ask yourself,

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.470
you keep questioning yourself.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.200
Maybe I'm asking the
wrong question, right?

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.860
Maybe it's not, how can we get
more women in the workforce?

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.110
And what I came up with
is a paradigm shift.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:45.150
Rather than asking how to get
more women into the workforce,

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.050
we should be asking, what
do women really want?

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.670
How do women define success?

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:51.260
Did anybody ask
us what we really

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.940
wanted before
going around saying

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.340
we have to have more
women in the workforce?

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.279
So I think this is an
innovative approach.

00:36:57.279 --> 00:36:58.820
And I started trying
to find evidence

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.480
for that approach, again
as a third hypothesis.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.819
So I start from looking at
men and women in the West.

00:37:05.819 --> 00:37:07.610
So there's a fight for
equality in the West

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:11.630
that we all are familiar with,
which started with feminism

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.280
in the last century.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.859
It was always about women
wanting to be equal to men.

00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:17.900
If a man drives a truck,
I want to drive a truck.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.890
If a man carries a bag of
flour that's very heavy,

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:23.000
I'm going to do that.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.080
We're equal.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.440
And we were trying to fit
into one mold of success,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.490
into one definition.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.580
Which is this framework,
this very crude,

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:34.050
vulgar framework of
what success means

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.540
that was defined by
men in the workforce.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.240
So we were trying
to fit into that.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.440
And there was only one.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.570
To the extent that we were
denying ourselves who we

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.340
are as females, biologically.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.160
And I'm sure many of you heard
how Facebook and Google offered

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.340
to freeze eggs for women till
they were over the age of 40.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.700
To me, that's making me
more fit into that mold,

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.300
into that definition.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.790
And the consequences
of such actions

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.220
were, well, you still had
less females in the workforce.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.080
That didn't improve.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.330
And those who were
were struggling always,

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.410
similar to the story
I just read you.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:09.200
And many just didn't get
married or didn't have children,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.940
because we only had
one framework, which

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.340
was made by men for men.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.730
And also, if a woman
stayed at home or chose to,

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:17.720
she was frowned upon.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.370
And if you acted
as a mom at work,

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.640
you were not serious enough.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.880
Now that's fine, if it
stayed in one country.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.330
The problem is it was being
exported all over the world.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.370
And that's when I felt
the problem, right?

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.620
There's something going wrong
when my students started

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.310
talking about such things.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.860
Especially when
we look at my part

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.220
of the world in our rich
civilization and history,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.920
where actually we had
Fatima al-Fihri, who

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.250
built the first university
in 1859, which is still

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.960
existing today in Morocco.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.615
While in 1821, we know
that females in Britain--

00:38:47.615 --> 00:38:49.490
I mean, people questioned
if they had a soul.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.150
They were not allowed
to be educated.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:53.150
They weren't allowed to
have their own ownership

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.830
and their own
property, when we had

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.440
those luxuries and privileges
1,000 years before.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.830
So with this importation
to other countries,

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.160
this was oppression
at a grand scale.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.660
Not to say that we
have our problems

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.100
in my part of the world.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.950
I mean, people have forgotten
what Islam really means

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.870
and we see the
consequences around us.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.270
But we were getting a double
oppression, the oppression

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.520
from not understanding our
religion properly and being

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.997
oppressed because of tribalism.

00:39:17.997 --> 00:39:19.580
And then oppression
by importing ideas

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.320
from the West that didn't
quite fit who we are.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.240
So I wanted to approach
this as a biologist.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.270
So I said, look, let's look at
the evolution of the species.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.720
We evolved as a species
to have male and female.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.570
And each one, I mean, we're
both the same species.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.850
We're all human, homo sapiens.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.560
But we evolved to have slightly
different roles, right?

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.372
So as a female, I evolved
to, I have a womb.

00:39:43.372 --> 00:39:44.580
I'm going to carry the fetus.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.700
I'm going to nurse,
breastfeed this child.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.850
The man doesn't do that.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.480
The male part of my
species doesn't do that.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.850
So I envisioned if
we have differences

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:57.810
physiologically, I'm assuming
we should have some differences

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.420
in how we define success.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.270
And I envision this that
our definition of success

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.800
will be as diverse and as
colorful as the ceiling.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.190
Anybody knows what
the ceiling is?

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.690
Yes, the Familia in Barcelona,
as beautiful as that

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.810
and as diverse as that
and as diverse as our DNA.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.790
And so, we may come
up with a range

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.270
of definitions of success,
what it means to us as females.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.780
Whether it's how senior we are
and how much money we earn,

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.320
which is more similar to
what men define as success,

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.130
or success to us could be
just enjoying having a child

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.290
and bringing up the
next generation.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.794
And anything in between.

00:40:36.794 --> 00:40:38.210
And we don't have
to stick to one.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:39.582
It could be a zigzag.

00:40:39.582 --> 00:40:40.290
We go in and out.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:40.800
We change.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.307
Our priorities change with
different times in our lives,

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:45.390
with different environments,
with different needs.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:47.610
So we could have our
definition of success

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.122
is having a child at one stage.

00:40:49.122 --> 00:40:50.580
And then in another
stage, it's no,

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.990
I want to be the best scientist
in my field, and so on.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:56.730
Actually, this graph
comes from a study

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.630
that was done by MIT, where
they compared male graduates

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:01.980
to female graduates.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.925
And they followed them
in their career paths.

00:41:03.925 --> 00:41:06.300
And I don't know if you can
guess which ones is the male.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.520
The male are the ones
that went up on a tangent,

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.190
but then they
plateaued at age 40.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.980
That was it.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.190
But for females, it was
zigzag and they kept going up.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.700
And so, this speaks
to the skills

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.230
that a woman gains
through her life

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.180
by taking care of
her family, that she

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.640
keeps on going if she
trusts herself enough

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.970
and community does.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:27.480
And also, there's an added
component of social compassion

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.470
that females have, that
pushes them to do more

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.470
and to choose those fields where
she feels she has an impact.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.040
Not to say that this
will not benefit men.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.250
Not every man wants to be the
highest earner and the leader.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.440
Many men also want to have
new definitions of success.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.320
So this is not just for
females, by the way.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.200
This will benefit
all humans, for them

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.700
to identify what they want and
what they consider successful.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.190
Now, this becomes
very important when

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:59.190
I'm talking about valuing
other than just leadership

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.696
positions and career paths.

00:42:00.696 --> 00:42:02.070
When I say that,
we need to value

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:05.400
our children and the upbringing
of our children as a role

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.680
that females and
males should play

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.250
in the lives of their children.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.070
Especially in the
first five years.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.810
So there's a lot
of data coming out

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.540
showing that the child's
brain as it develops,

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:19.860
those neurons, they create
connections with each other.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.927
And these connections,
if you don't use them,

00:42:21.927 --> 00:42:23.010
you're going to lose them.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.010
And how do you use them?

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.504
It's by interacting with
the environment around you.

00:42:26.504 --> 00:42:28.920
And when a child interacts
with the environment around him

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:34.170
or her, it's not just about food
and shelter and cleanliness.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.090
It's about the
social interaction.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.754
And what's better a
social interaction

00:42:37.754 --> 00:42:40.170
than with the mother and the
father, the biological mother

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:41.880
and father who actually
brought them up,

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.220
who is going to give
them the full attention?

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.000
And any neglect,
however slight, will

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.770
have an effect on our children.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:53.070
And this is an example
of two brains, where

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.980
one is a normal one with parents
who are around and taking

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.820
care of the child.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.790
And another one, the second
one, is of extreme neglect.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.920
And we have examples from
the Romanian orphanage--

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.378
I don't know if you've heard
about it-- where children were

00:43:04.378 --> 00:43:07.710
given everything they need
in terms of shelter and food

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.860
and cleanliness, but there
was no social interaction

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.400
whatsoever.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.730
And these children grew up to
have extreme social problems,

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:16.740
even mental problems as well.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.409
So what is more important than
to spend those important years

00:43:21.409 --> 00:43:23.700
of our children's lives where
the mother and the father

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.320
are there with them?

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.000
And nobody can
substitute a parent,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.310
but anybody can
substitute you at work.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.100
And work can wait until you
bring up the next generation.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.910
So how do we solve this?

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:36.180
So all the people I've
interviewed tell me, yeah,

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.200
we agree with you.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.350
But what do we do?

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.877
Well, I mean, first is that
we need to know ourselves.

00:43:42.877 --> 00:43:44.710
We need to feel comfortable
with who we are.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.080
We need to know our identities.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.745
And then we need to educate
ourselves and read and learn,

00:43:50.745 --> 00:43:52.870
so that we know what are
the options in front of us

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:56.050
when we give the decision
to our young generation

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:58.520
to decide what
success means to them.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.280
We need them to
find their passion.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.520
And then, after they find
their passion, to pursue it.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.380
To teach them the
entrepreneurial skills so

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.012
that they can
pursue that passion.

00:44:07.012 --> 00:44:08.470
And this becomes
even more relevant

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:10.150
in a world of underemployment.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.920
I mean, whether in
the US or in Jordan

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.620
or in many parts of the world,
unemployment is on the rise.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.950
And there's not enough jobs.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.080
So when you become
an entrepreneur,

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.530
you're actually
creating new jobs.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.590
So this is something
that's very much needed

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:23.980
and gives you the opportunity
to explore that new field.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.860
But most importantly--
after you know who you are,

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.840
you educate yourself,
you find your passion,

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.030
and you have the
skills to pursue it--

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.950
most importantly,
society should give us

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:34.910
the freedom to choose
what we want to be,

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.580
whether it's men or women.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.760
And I think it's
oppression if I tell women,

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.990
you have to go to work.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.490
And it's oppression
if I tell women,

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:43.790
you have to stay at home.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.990
It's about trusting her
to choose what she wants,

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.940
because she knows better.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.330
And of course, here I
am talking about what

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:57.280
women should choose as success
from a platform of privilege.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.780
All of us are privileged here.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:03.040
Because I speak and think of
all the women refugees around

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.770
the world-- whether it's in
Syria or Palestine or Myanmar

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.690
or Yemen--

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.670
who don't have the
opportunities we have.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:10.820
And don't have the choices.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.101
They're not grappling with
these choices that we are.

00:45:13.101 --> 00:45:15.100
But in order to help them,
we have to help start

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.300
helping ourselves.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.770
And change takes a long time.

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.400
The road of a million
miles starts with a small--

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.570
or the first step.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:25.224
And we should
always start small.

00:45:25.224 --> 00:45:26.890
Because a lot of
people don't do things,

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.370
they think they have to
change the world first

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:29.860
or it has to be huge or big.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.080
No, you can start from
your own neighborhood,

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.260
from your own community,
your own family, yourself.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.780
And I like to compare this to
the physics theory, the chaos

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:38.440
theory.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.690
When a butterfly flutters
its wings in China,

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.310
there's a hurricane
in the Atlantic.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:45.520
So whatever good you do or
whatever effort you try,

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.910
it will have an impact
sometime, someplace.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:48.910
And everybody's waiting.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:51.520
Everybody's thirsty for
change and innovation.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:55.191
And I always like to end with
Dr. Seuss, Oh, the Places

00:45:55.191 --> 00:45:55.690
You'll Go.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.398
I'm sure you've read
the book many times.

00:45:57.398 --> 00:46:01.210
And in the last page, he
says, and will you succeed?

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:03.400
Yes, he answers,
you will indeed.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.870
98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed,
kid, you'll move mountains.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.510
And I'm going to end with
this one minute video.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.579
You know, they tell
you words are better--

00:46:12.579 --> 00:46:13.870
pictures are better than words.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.530
And movies are
better than pictures.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:17.514

00:46:54.714 --> 00:46:56.250
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:57.030
So don't wait.

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:58.680
Yeah, just jump
in, be innovative.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.460
Don't care what other people
tell you or comment on you.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.580
So that's the end of my story.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.620
And I urge you
during the reception

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.240
to draw what success
means to you.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.400
So we have some crayons
and some paper out there.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.080
And if you could add on-- you
don't have to put your name.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.670
But if you tell us
where you're from,

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.292
your age range, roughly,
and your career, so we

00:47:17.292 --> 00:47:18.750
can maybe make an
exhibit next year

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.460
at Radcliffe of
what success means

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.724
from different perspectives.

00:47:22.724 --> 00:47:25.140
And that leads me to part
three, the unanswered questions.

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.810
Which would be your
role, to ask questions

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.760
and to challenge me,
because I'm here to learn

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.297
and to listen and together
to make a difference.

00:47:33.297 --> 00:47:34.130
Thank you very much.
