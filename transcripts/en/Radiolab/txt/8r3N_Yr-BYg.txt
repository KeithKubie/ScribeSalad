Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. The podcast. Yes, and today on the podcast we're going to present a story that a whole thing is an accident, really. The category podcast, we were on tour a few months ago doing this symmetry thing in San Francisco and right as we were there, we got an email from a woman who lives there telling us this new nutty story. Something odd had happened to her and she wanted to share it with us, so he met her in the lobby. I missed, I didn't hit the record button fast enough. Could you just tell me your name again? And My name is lysis Schonfeld and I'm a research technician at the Gladstone institute at the University of California San Francisco. Now Lysa is just getting started with her scientific career, finishing my undergraduate degree about a year and a half ago, and this story takes place as she was about to take that next step after college and apply to Grad schools.

Speaker 1:          00:47          The Star of our story other than of course, Lizer herself, is a little mischievous part of her brain. Well, everyone's brain, your brain called the Basal Ganglia, the Basal Ganglia, which is a time she'd been studying just so we understand basil and Ganglia, so Bazell is not the a thing from which Pesto is made. In your case, what does Bazell mean about that? Okay, let's go to go on to Ganglia. You know, collections of neurons, big collections. So basically Langley has a fairly large part of your brain. It's actually this big hunk deep in the center and it's responsible for controlling and coordinating movement. When I move my neck back and forth, am I using my Basal Ganglia? Yeah. When I wink can by using my basal Ganglia. When I make an expression in my face, I'm using my Bazell testimony. What about if I'm reading a, the New Yorker, I don't think so.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Apologies to the New Yorker and its employees, but is this part of your brain is really basic and at the lab where she was working, they had figured out this particular Basal Ganglia trick using this really cool technology called optogenetics. Maybe trick isn't quite the right word. What they'd done is they'd found a way to take a mouse thread, a little fiber optic cable through its skull deep into its brain, into its base with ganglion so that when you shine a blue laser, literally we just shine lasers and a mouse brains. They could actually turn it's basal Ganglia or parts of it on or off. When this is in a live mouse, this isn't a live mouse. So we have these really cool videos showing a mouse running around having a great mouse time.

Speaker 1:          02:12          You turn the light on, we can get them to free in mid-stride. Yeah, so you hit the laser and boom, the mouse stop out just like this. So use those lights. They're like puppet ties the mouse. If you're this mouse, no matter how hard you try, feet move, as long as that light is on, come on fool. You can't do it. Lysa is holding the strings. Not Exactly. It turns out she doesn't get to play with the laser that much. I'm kind of like, I'm the bottom of the totem pole, so I do a lot of pipe heading. It's like where you squirt liquid from one tube to another. I'm working at my pipe padding, we're getting the thumb muscles. Oh, I could beat anyone in that wrestling competition right now. So at a certain point she was like, enough of this time for me to apply to Grad school.

Speaker 1:          02:56          I applied to five, university of California, San Diego, University of Washington and Seattle U CSF, Rockefeller University and Harvard. Cause you're going big. Yeah, go bigger. Go home. Right. So she hits off to her first interview. University of Washington went great. I loved it. Okay. I went to Penn, university of Pennsylvania, went down to UCFC in San Diego. It's a beautiful place, great scientists. It's actually the largest neuroscience community in the world. So far so good. Did you ever go back to San Francisco where we are now? This is where things get strange. Yes. So my last interview, my very last interview was at UCF and she says about a week before that interview I got really sick. So I think it was some kind of stomach flu, but it was pretty severe nausea. I wasn't really able to eat or do anything and throwing up. Yeah, I'll all sorts of, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          03:44          I had some bad dim some the weekend before that could have been. She goes to the doctor, he gives her some pills to fight the nausea and then the next day was my interview. Friday was my interview. So I went, you know, there's a nice introduction. They give you a breakfast. This point. She's pretty familiar with the whole routine. Generally the way these interviews are structured is that we talk a little bit about my research and dopamine and the Basal Ganglia and these mice, they tell her about their work. I have to think of a couple of woody questions. I asked my questions. What's a really question? What are the science questions? What are you saying? Nevermind. Anyhow, she's raring to go and she heads into meet her first Basal Ganglia Titian of the day and he studies, um, one of the things he studies is dopamine in the Basal Ganglia. He study stuff that's a little bit more molecular than what I, what I know.

Speaker 1:          04:29          But we had a good conversation about dopamine and at this point in the day I was feeling okay. Then I went to my second interview, which is this woman that I was so excited to talk to. Her name is Alison Dope and she's pretty well known. Alison Dope. Alison Dope. Wow. She studies dopamine, she studies songbirds, which is what lies I've really wanted to study. So birds have basic English too. So she's pretty fired up and kind of in the beginning of that interview, my, my face started to feel a little bit strange and I was wearing glasses that day. So what I felt was happening was that my glasses were, you know, your glasses get loose and they kind of start to slip down your nose and you have to kind of tighten the muscles around your ears to try and keep your glasses on. So we were talking and I just kept on feeling like, God, why can't I stop tightening that?

Speaker 1:          05:13          It was Kinda got to the point where it started to distract me, but I felt okay. Then we went to lunch and this was a lunch with all the current students and a lot of the current faculty and all the prospective students. And at lunch I remember on the walk to lunch, my head just started spontaneously turning to the right, like, like I like I would be trying to sit here and face you and I would just turn over here and face Robert t. It was such a funny thing. And you're like, no, no, don't do that. Exactly what was happening? I was trying to send signals to my neck being like, all right, sitting here having lunch with an important professor. Why don't you just face him, talk to him and instead I'm just turning over here, turning over here, turning over here. Oh, you're turning a fairly wide art.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Yeah. You're turning away. Yeah. Professor. Oh, I remember, I remember at one point in lunch turning my chair like this so I could see a sign. A permanent side. Long Glance. Yeah, but you figured it's not that painful, so it must just be a cramp or something. I'm kind of thinking. Oh, okay. So I slept funny last night. I must've slept on a weird angle on my pillow. Now I'm having a net cramp. My glasses are loose. I just gotta tighten the glasses, everything under control. So, so then I, after lunch was going to go to my third interview was with Alison dopes husband who also studies songbirds. So he's familiar with the Basal Ganglia too. They meet up to walk over to his office together. And so I explained to him on the walk over, I think I'm having neck cramps. Would it be possible maybe to try and get a hot pad?

Speaker 1:          06:40          He's so sure I may track one down, but on the walk, not only now just my neck start turning to the right, but it's snapping itself back in voluntarily. My head snapping back light. Suddenly your eyes are pointing up at the sky. And then as I'm talking to him, I'm realizing that I can't control my eyebrows from, from raising pretty tightly. So I look like you're doing right now. Like I'm doing like deep surprise, constant deeps. I can't stop it. I look surprised at everything I'm saying and I can't stop it. So after the eyebrows start and I can't pull them back down then, then the mouth, then all this area starts to go lower to face. Yes. What is it doing? It turns into this really twisted, painful, grimacing smile.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Would you mind? I'll demo it. Okay. So I've got the neck, it's like this crane back eyebrows wrote like this total surprise, like this crazy Frankenstein face demeanor for graduate interview. No, it's not going well and I'm noticing that something is be, I think at that point he thought I was just really excited to be talking about neuroscience and I'm just trying to think, okay. Mouth, like try, try and just calm down a little bit. And it was pretty painful too. I mean it was like, imagine like a Charlie horse in your face. Oh yeah. But she gets through the interview and I actually do okay. You know, he asked me tough questions about science and I can answer him I think. And I leave the interview and then I met by the woman who's the head of the admissions weekend and she took one look at Lysa and she said, hi.

Speaker 1:          08:14          You know, I don't know if you should do the rest of the interviews and with her as my student host decides, alright, let me just call my dad, just saying, Hey dad, I'm in the middle of an interview and someone kind of funny is happening with my face. I can't control it. And while I'm talking to him I lose control of my mouth and my tongue so I can't, I can kind of talk, but it's, it's pretty bad. Yeah. Is Your Dad a doctor? No. Imagine your kid calling you being like, I'm losing control of my face. And as they're telling you that I started to think something's really wrong. And then my student host comes rushing back in running and he looks at me and he tries to put on a calm face and he says, so now we need to go to the emergency room. So they throw into a taxi and in the taxi it went from, I can't control my mouth to a complete, I mean a complete the all seat of a torque. I did not look good.

Speaker 1:          09:09          As we're pulling up to the emergency room is when my throat started tightening. They rushed her inside and they have me in a Gurney, in a room in the back of the Er, surrounded by six people. Within two minutes, doctors swarming all around her oxygen mask. EKG leads all over my chest. They do an ivy and then she's lying there on the table and she's thinking like, what's wrong with me? Why can't I control my throat? Why can't I control my body? And I just, I couldn't. I remember frantically sending messages like, you got to cut this out now, but she wasn't in control and it turned out okay.

Speaker 2:          09:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:41          the wild. She was going from interview to interview to interview, talking about how her lab had taken these little Macy's and seize control of their Basal Ganglia. The composition that I took, that nausea drug was actually affecting the dopamine systems and my basal Ganglia. In other words, that drug had been doing to her pretty much with what she'd been doing to those mice. One to 2% of people who take composition. They can have what's called an acute dystonia, which is what happened to me during all those interviews. And the crazy thing is the guy that I talked to first in the morning was the molecular dopamine guy. You know, how does dopamine get packed in the vesicles? How does it get released? And it wasn't until I started talking with a more systems level people who studied the behavioral output of the Basal Ganglia that I started to have behavioral deficits in my Basal Ganglia.

Speaker 1:          10:26          So your Basal Ganglia are testing the San Francisco docs and they are failing [inaudible] yeah, you can get into San Francisco state. I just CSF CSF. No, no. Oh Hm. Damn it. Basal Ganglia, we should probably tell everybody that lies is obviously doing okay. Back in the Er when the doctors finally figured out what was going on, they just gave her some Benadryl of all things and actually within 20 minutes I was feeling a lot better. She could breathe her face it unclenched and we asked her, how has this little adventure changed you? Uh, she said, well, I'm still working with those mice cause when we talk to her Grad school hadn't started yet. And now when I go into that room with a little laser, I go in now and I just really, I empathize with them. Come a little catch. This would just be for a couple of minutes. You can do it. Yeah. I'm thinking a lot about that.
