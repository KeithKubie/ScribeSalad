00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280
difference they're both great movies but
 

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.610
difference they're both great movies but
I felt like rogue one drew me in a

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620
I felt like rogue one drew me in a
 

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.260
I felt like rogue one drew me in a
little bit and maybe it's because there

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.270
little bit and maybe it's because there
 

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.640
little bit and maybe it's because there
was a certain element to rogue one where

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:25.650
was a certain element to rogue one where
 

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.690
was a certain element to rogue one where
I felt like it was geared more towards a

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:28.700
I felt like it was geared more towards a
 

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.140
I felt like it was geared more towards a
adult audience which isn't a bad thing

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.150
adult audience which isn't a bad thing
 

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.079
adult audience which isn't a bad thing
that of the force awakens is more geared

00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:36.089
that of the force awakens is more geared
 

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:39.500
that of the force awakens is more geared
towards a family child's movie so to

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:39.510
towards a family child's movie so to
 

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.959
towards a family child's movie so to
speak even though it's pg-13 but that's

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:41.969
speak even though it's pg-13 but that's
 

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:44.960
speak even though it's pg-13 but that's
a whole nother discussion but I still

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:44.970
a whole nother discussion but I still
 

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.900
a whole nother discussion but I still
felt very drawn into rogue one I would

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:47.910
felt very drawn into rogue one I would
 

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.360
felt very drawn into rogue one I would
live in that world if I could of rogue

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.370
live in that world if I could of rogue
 

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.870
live in that world if I could of rogue
one everything was the sets and the

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880
one everything was the sets and the
 

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.050
one everything was the sets and the
visuals and the feel of it made me just

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060
visuals and the feel of it made me just
 

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.700
visuals and the feel of it made me just
want to stay there and live there and I

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:58.710
want to stay there and live there and I
 

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.430
want to stay there and live there and I
did really really really love the ending

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440
did really really really love the ending
 

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.160
did really really really love the ending
of rogue one I loved that they all died

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:04.170
of rogue one I loved that they all died
 

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.980
of rogue one I loved that they all died
mm-hmm that's just war that's just life

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:06.990
mm-hmm that's just war that's just life
 

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.820
mm-hmm that's just war that's just life
right and even though I do feel as

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:10.830
right and even though I do feel as
 

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.040
right and even though I do feel as
though the force awakens has stronger

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.050
though the force awakens has stronger
 

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.130
though the force awakens has stronger
characters but I didn't feel like that

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140
characters but I didn't feel like that
 

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.030
characters but I didn't feel like that
was necessary

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040
was necessary
 

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.540
was necessary
for rogue one because it wasn't about

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:20.550
for rogue one because it wasn't about
 

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.480
for rogue one because it wasn't about
the characters it was about the mission

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:23.490
the characters it was about the mission
 

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.040
the characters it was about the mission
right so whether or not the characters

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.050
right so whether or not the characters
 

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.470
right so whether or not the characters
were strong didn't have that big of an

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480
were strong didn't have that big of an
 

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.180
were strong didn't have that big of an
impact for me I was super sucked into

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:29.190
impact for me I was super sucked into
 

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.740
impact for me I was super sucked into
the story even though I wasn't sucked

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:30.750
the story even though I wasn't sucked
 

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.600
the story even though I wasn't sucked
into the characters does that make sense

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:32.610
into the characters does that make sense
 

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.059
into the characters does that make sense
I got so that made me prefer wrote one

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:35.069
I got so that made me prefer wrote one
 

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:43.360
I got so that made me prefer wrote one
okay we disagree

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:43.370
 
 

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.890
 
I like barely man these these two are so

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:47.900
I like barely man these these two are so
 

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.990
I like barely man these these two are so
close in my book but again we must

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000
close in my book but again we must
 

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.360
close in my book but again we must
decide and just by the slimmest of

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.370
decide and just by the slimmest of
 

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.080
decide and just by the slimmest of
margins

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.090
margins
 

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.380
margins

get to go see the originals in theaters

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.050
get to go see the originals in theaters
 

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.170
get to go see the originals in theaters
but I feel like by seeing this I almost

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:35.180
but I feel like by seeing this I almost
 

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.060
but I feel like by seeing this I almost
feel like I was a part of it and it was

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.070
feel like I was a part of it and it was
 

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.040
feel like I was a part of it and it was
a really cool feeling that the other

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.050
a really cool feeling that the other
 

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.500
a really cool feeling that the other
ones didn't give me but the rest of it

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:41.510
ones didn't give me but the rest of it
 

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.750
ones didn't give me but the rest of it
not as much like the character

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760
not as much like the character
 

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.010
not as much like the character
development like I was saying before the

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:45.020
development like I was saying before the
 

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.530
development like I was saying before the
story arcs aren't all there some of the

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:47.540
story arcs aren't all there some of the
 

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.410
story arcs aren't all there some of the
characters were there just and didn't

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:50.420
characters were there just and didn't
 

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.030
characters were there just and didn't
have their intentions clear and then

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040
have their intentions clear and then
 

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.200
have their intentions clear and then
when they made them clear I was like

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:53.210
when they made them clear I was like
 

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.790
when they made them clear I was like
well maybe like show and don't tell

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800
well maybe like show and don't tell
 

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.260
well maybe like show and don't tell
whereas I felt like with force awakens

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:58.270
whereas I felt like with force awakens
 

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.550
whereas I felt like with force awakens
even though there's a lot left in the

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560
even though there's a lot left in the
 

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.920
even though there's a lot left in the
air still with Ray and we weren't told

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:02.930
air still with Ray and we weren't told
 

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.440
air still with Ray and we weren't told
her whole story it was it felt like an

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:05.450
her whole story it was it felt like an
 

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.140
her whole story it was it felt like an
origin story for Ray and some of the

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:08.150
origin story for Ray and some of the
 

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.570
origin story for Ray and some of the
things like I would I would say almost a

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:10.580
things like I would I would say almost a
 

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.250
things like I would I would say almost a
New Hope made he gave us as much

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:12.260
New Hope made he gave us as much
 

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.080
New Hope made he gave us as much
information about Luke when that one

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.090
information about Luke when that one
 

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.580
information about Luke when that one
started maybe they flushed him out a

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:15.590
started maybe they flushed him out a
 

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.470
started maybe they flushed him out a
little bit more about his parents but I

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480
little bit more about his parents but I
 

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.660
little bit more about his parents but I
think because force awakens sort of

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:19.670
think because force awakens sort of
 

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.180
think because force awakens sort of
started this and then now we're gonna

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.190
started this and then now we're gonna
 

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.510
started this and then now we're gonna
see more where as rogue one they started

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:25.520
see more where as rogue one they started
 

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.520
see more where as rogue one they started
this and we're done with it and I have

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:27.530
this and we're done with it and I have
 

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.430
this and we're done with it and I have
so many questions it left a lot

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440
so many questions it left a lot
 

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.410
so many questions it left a lot
open-ended and not necessarily in a good

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:35.420
open-ended and not necessarily in a good
 

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.920
open-ended and not necessarily in a good
way the idea mind having questions on

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:38.930
way the idea mind having questions on
 

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.350
way the idea mind having questions on
answers I didn't mind that I felt like

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360
answers I didn't mind that I felt like
 

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.750
answers I didn't mind that I felt like
it didn't attract so many things like

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760
it didn't attract so many things like
 

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.580
it didn't attract so many things like
wasn't about the character you don't

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:45.590
wasn't about the character you don't
 

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.320
wasn't about the character you don't
feel like it was making you ask the

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:47.330
feel like it was making you ask the
 

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.420
feel like it was making you ask the
questions like oh what about this it was

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:49.430
questions like oh what about this it was
 

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.799
questions like oh what about this it was
like wait no

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:53.809
 
 

00:11:53.809 --> 00:12:28.819
 
so I Star Wars story this is something

00:12:28.819 --> 00:12:28.829
so I Star Wars story this is something
 

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:29.960
so I Star Wars story this is something
that has a beginning middle and end

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:29.970
that has a beginning middle and end
 

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.929
that has a beginning middle and end
whereas the you know the rest of the

00:12:32.929 --> 00:12:32.939
whereas the you know the rest of the
 

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:35.419
whereas the you know the rest of the
star wars are always these epochs three

00:12:35.419 --> 00:12:35.429
star wars are always these epochs three
 

00:12:35.429 --> 00:12:37.219
star wars are always these epochs three
parts you know trilogy is definitely and

00:12:37.219 --> 00:12:37.229
parts you know trilogy is definitely and
 

00:12:37.229 --> 00:12:39.559
parts you know trilogy is definitely and
so like this one felt more contained it

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:39.569
so like this one felt more contained it
 

00:12:39.569 --> 00:12:41.449
