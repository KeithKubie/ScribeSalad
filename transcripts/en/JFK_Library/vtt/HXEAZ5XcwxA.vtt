THE PAST AND INSPIRE FUTURE 
GENERATIONS OF PUBLIC SERVANTS 

00:27:02.008 --> 00:27:05.273
IN PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S NAME. 
TONIGHT WE'RE CELEBRATING THE 

00:27:05.274 --> 00:27:07.493
TIMELESS VALUES THAT PRESIDENT 
KENNEDY LIVED BY AND THAT HAVE 

00:27:07.494 --> 00:27:11.772
MADE AMERICA THE INDISPENSABLE 
NATION -- COURAGE, PATRIOTISM, 

00:27:11.773 --> 00:27:15.747
JUSTICE, INNOVATION, SERVICE, 
AND THE COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A

00:27:16.228 --> 00:27:21.595
 MORE PEACEFUL WORLD. AS HIS 
FAMILY, WE'RE PROUD OF WHAT HE 

00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:24.332
STOOD FOR AND ITS CONTINUING 
POWER. TONIGHT WE'RE HONORED BY 

00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:31.193
THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY PUBLIC 
SERVANTS WHO LIVE THESE VALUES 

00:27:31.194 --> 00:27:35.954
EVERY DAY. THIS AWARD CELEBRATES
 THE INDISPENSABLE QUALITY OF 

00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:39.154
PUBLIC LIFE MY FATHER MOST 
ADMIRED -- THE COURAGE TO RISK 

00:27:39.155 --> 00:27:42.358
YOUR CAREER TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. 
THAT MAY MEAN STANDING FOR THE 

00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:44.737
NATIONAL INTEREST WHEN OTHERS 
ARE WILLING TO TRADE IT AWAY FOR

00:27:45.202 --> 00:27:49.183
 PERSONAL OR LOCAL BENEFIT. IT 
MAY MEAN REACHING OUT TO WORK 

00:27:49.184 --> 00:27:52.020
WITH OTHERS TO BENEFIT THE 
COMMON GOOD WHEN YOU COULD SCORE

00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:57.047
 POINTS BY CRITICIZING THEM 
INSTEAD. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE 

00:27:57.048 --> 00:28:00.019
HONORED ELECTED OFFICIALS AT ALL
 LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT FROM BOTH 

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.217
SIDES OF THE AISLE. THEY HAVE 
REAFFIRMED OUR FAITH IN 

00:28:04.342 --> 00:28:09.298
PRINCIPLED PUBLIC SERVICE AND 
SET A STANDARD BY WHICH FUTURE 

00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:12.159
LEADERS CAN BE MEASURED. OUR 
WINNERS HAVE SHOWN US THAT WE 

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.090
NEED TO REWARD COURAGE IN OUR 
LEADERS AND REQUIRE IT IN 

00:28:16.091 --> 00:28:21.609
OURSELVES. TODAY WHEN MANY DOUBT
 THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTED 

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.613
OFFICIALS, THIS IS MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN EVER. IN ADDITION

00:28:23.924 --> 00:28:27.542
 TO OUR HONOREE, THERE ARE TWO 
AMERICAN HEROES HERE TONIGHT 

00:28:27.543 --> 00:28:32.213
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SALUTE. 
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, A 

00:28:32.214 --> 00:28:37.853
FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE TO MY UNCLE
 TEDDY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:28:48.545 --> 00:28:54.602
 A CHAMPION FOR JUSTICE, WORKING
 FAMILIES, WOMEN AND AN 

00:28:54.603 --> 00:28:56.547
INSPIRATION TO ALL THOSE 
SUFFERING FROM LOSS. THANK YOU 

00:28:56.548 --> 00:29:00.189
FOR VISITING JAPAN AND FOR 
TELLING THE JAPANESE THAT I WAS 

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:04.210
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SUCCESS. 
[LAUGHTER] SO THEY TOO SHOULD DO

00:29:04.505 --> 00:29:06.505
 EVERYTHING I SAID.

00:29:08.768 --> 00:29:13.005
 SECRETARY JOHN KERRY, OUR 
PLANET HAS NO GREATER ADVOCATE. 

00:29:13.006 --> 00:29:17.450
OUR CHILDREN NO MORE FAR-SIGHTED
 WARRIOR FOR PEACE AND 

00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:20.607
DIPLOMACY. YOU'VE PURSUED A 
STRATEGY OF PEACE THAT PRESIDENT

00:29:20.715 --> 00:29:23.942
 KENNEDY LAID OUT, AND WE ARE 
ALL SAFER, HEALTHIER AND MORE 

00:29:23.943 --> 00:29:27.046
PROWS BECAUSE OF YOUR 
INDEFATIGABLE COMMITMENT AND 

00:29:27.047 --> 00:29:29.047
OPTIMISM.

00:29:30.695 --> 00:29:32.695
 [APPLAUSE]

00:29:34.225 --> 00:29:37.164
 THANK YOU FOR TRUSTING ME 
ENOUGH TO VISIT JAPAN ONLY ONCE 

00:29:37.165 --> 00:29:43.005
WHEN YOU HAD TO CHECK ON PARIS 
38 TIMES. [LAUGHTER]

00:29:47.878 --> 00:29:51.940
 THIS IS A NIGHT TO CELEBRATE 
POLITICS AND FAMILY. AS MY 

00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:55.824
FATHER AND UNCLES THOUGHT US, 
POLITICS IS A FAMILY ENDEAVOR, 

00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:59.514
SO I WOULD LIKE IF WE COULD 
OFFER A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR 

00:29:59.515 --> 00:30:02.788
FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA, AND 
FOR ALL THE POLITICAL SPOUSES 

00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:06.209
HERE TONIGHT. [CHEERING AND 
APPLAUSE]

00:30:30.398 --> 00:30:33.194
 MANY OF YOU HERE IN THIS ROOM 
CAST YOUR FIRST VOTE FOR 

00:30:33.195 --> 00:30:36.135
PRESIDENT KENNEDY. YOU TOLD ME 
HOW HE CHANGED YOUR LIVES AND 

00:30:36.136 --> 00:30:39.688
TOGETHER YOU CHANGED THIS 
COUNTRY. TONIGHT WE PRESENT THE 

00:30:39.689 --> 00:30:42.977
PROFILE IN COURAGE AWARD TO 
PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO HAD THE 

00:30:42.978 --> 00:30:46.908
SAME IMPACT ON ANOTHER 
GENERATION, INSPIRING US, OUR 

00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:51.261
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, TO 
CHANGE THE WORLD. ON A PERSONAL 

00:30:51.262 --> 00:30:55.397
NOTE, I WANT THE THANK YOU FOR 
GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO SERVE. 

00:30:55.398 --> 00:30:59.241
IN JAPAN I SAW FIRSTHAND WHAT 
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP MEANS TO THE

00:30:59.728 --> 00:31:06.225
 WORLD. I SAW THE POWER OF OUR 
COMMITMENT TO INTERNATIONAL 

00:31:06.226 --> 00:31:09.508
ORDER AND LIFTING PEOPLE OUT OF 
POVERTY. I SAW THE HOPE AND 

00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:12.926
IDEALISM OF YOUNG PEOPLE 
INSPIRED BY AMERICAN INNOVATION 

00:31:12.927 --> 00:31:16.683
AND POSSIBILITY. MOST 
PROFOUNDLY, I SAW THE EMOTIONAL 

00:31:16.684 --> 00:31:21.704
OUTPOURING AFTER PRESIDENT 
OBAMA'S VISIT TO HIROSHIMA 

00:31:21.705 --> 00:31:23.972
SHOWED PEOPLE AND NATIONS THAT 
THEY COULD OVERCOME THE WOUNDS 

00:31:23.973 --> 00:31:28.987
OF THE PAST TO BUILD A MORE 
PEACEFUL WORLD. AS I STOOD IN 

00:31:28.988 --> 00:31:32.983
THE PEACE PARK IN FRONT OF ITS 
ETERNAL FLAME, I COULDN'T HELP 

00:31:32.984 --> 00:31:37.566
BUT THINK OF MY FATHER'S OWN 
WORK ON THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN 

00:31:37.567 --> 00:31:40.921
TREATY AND HOW HONORED I WAS TO 
KNOW THESE TWO GREAT MEN. PEOPLE

00:31:40.922 --> 00:31:44.054
 SAY IT'S HARD TO COME HOME 
AFTER BEING AN AMBASSADOR. IT'S 

00:31:44.055 --> 00:31:48.072
LIKE MOVING BACK FROM COLLEGE 
INTO YOUR OLD ROOM. I HAVE 

00:31:48.073 --> 00:31:51.282
CHANGED. I HAVE MADE NEW 
FRIENDS. I HAVE GROWN UP. BUT 

00:31:51.283 --> 00:31:55.819
EVERYONE TREATS ME JUST THE 
SAME. IN MY CASE, IT MEANS THAT 

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.003
I GET TO RESUME ONE OF MY MOST 
DEMANDING RESPONSIBILITIES, 

00:31:59.004 --> 00:32:03.390
WHICH IS INTRODUCING OTHER 
MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY. [LAUGHTER]

00:32:03.739 --> 00:32:07.664
 IT USED TO BE TEDDY HERE AT 
THIS DINNER. NOW IT'S SOMEONE 

00:32:07.665 --> 00:32:11.870
WHO ADORED HIM AND WHO I ADORE, 
SOMEONE WHO HAS PITCHED IN TO 

00:32:11.871 --> 00:32:17.495
HELP ME HERE AND IN JAPAN, THE 
YOUNGEST, BUT NOT THE QUIETEST 

00:32:17.496 --> 00:32:23.850
MEMBER OF THE PROFILE IN COURAGE
 COMMITTEE, JACK SCHLOSSBERG. 

00:32:23.851 --> 00:32:25.851
THANK YOU.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.760
 [APPLAUSE] 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MOTHER, FOR THAT 

00:32:33.761 --> 00:32:37.588
KIND INTRODUCTION, AND ONCE 
AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME 

00:32:37.589 --> 00:32:40.679
INTO THIS WORLD. [LAUGHTER] 
YOU'RE AN AMAZING MOTHER AND 

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.381
FRIEND AND ROLE MODEL FOR ME. I 
KNOW EVERYONE HERE IS GRATEFUL 

00:32:43.382 --> 00:32:46.896
TO YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, FOR 
YOUR EXAMPLE. THANK YOU ALL FOR 

00:32:46.897 --> 00:32:50.053
BEING HERE TONIGHT. THIS LIBRARY
 IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE FOR ME 

00:32:50.054 --> 00:32:53.661
AND MY SISTERS IN THE SAME WAY 
THAT IT IS SPECIAL FOR ANYONE 

00:32:53.662 --> 00:32:57.424
WHO VISIT IT. IT ALLOWS US TO 
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN WE 

00:32:57.425 --> 00:33:00.560
NEVER KNEW BUT WHO HOLDS SUCH A 
SPECIAL PLACE IN OUR HEARTS. WE 

00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:05.952
CAN COME HERE TO HEAR HIS VOICE,
 READ HIS WORDS, LOOK THROUGH 

00:33:05.953 --> 00:33:09.681
HIS OLD NOTEBOOKS AND TIES AND 
FIND STRENGTH AND GUIDANCE AND 

00:33:09.682 --> 00:33:13.363
LAUGHTER FROM THE SPIRIT THAT 
LIVES ON HERE. COURAGE WAS A 

00:33:13.364 --> 00:33:17.016
QUALITY THAT MY GRANDFATHER MOST
 ADMIRED. AS A YOUNG MAN, A 

00:33:17.017 --> 00:33:21.543
SOLDIER AND A PRESIDENT, HE 
DISPLAYED IT THROUGHOUT HIS OWN 

00:33:21.544 --> 00:33:24.257
LIFE AND ENCOURAGED OTHER 
LEADERS TO DO THE SAME. AS WE 

00:33:24.258 --> 00:33:27.774
MARK 100 YEARS SINCE PRESIDENT 
KENNEDY WAS BORN, WE CELEBRATE 

00:33:27.775 --> 00:33:31.050
HIS LIFE AND ALL THAT HE 
ACHIEVED IN IT, AND WE REMEMBER 

00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:34.288
THAT HE HIMSELF REPRESENTS WHAT 
IS POSSIBLE IN AMERICA AND ALL 

00:33:34.289 --> 00:33:38.761
THE WORK LEFT UNDONE. THROUGHOUT
 HIS PRESIDENCY, MY GRANDFATHER 

00:33:38.762 --> 00:33:41.831
MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE ALONE 
COULD FIX NOTHING, THAT HE ALONE

00:33:42.002 --> 00:33:45.983
 HAD NO ANSWERS. HE HAD THE 
COURAGE TO REPUBLICANLY ADMIT 

00:33:45.984 --> 00:33:49.163
AMERICA'S OWN SHORTCOMINGS, TO 
THEN LAY OUT BOLD PLANS THE 

00:33:49.164 --> 00:33:52.099
ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS, AND TO 
ASK HIS FELLOW AMERICANS FOR 

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:59.372
HELP IN SOLVING THEM. AND IN 
DOING, SO HE INSPIRED A 

00:33:59.373 --> 00:34:02.381
GENERATION TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND
 TO ASK WHAT THEY COULD DO FOR 

00:34:02.382 --> 00:34:05.339
THEIR COUNTRY. PRESIDENT BARACK 
OBAMA INSPIRED ME THE SAME WAY. 

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.236
MY LIFE CHANGED IN 2008 BECAUSE 
A YOUNG CANDIDATE WAS FIRED UP 

00:34:09.237 --> 00:34:12.049
AND READY TO GO AND SAID, YES, 
WE CAN. WITHOUT BARACK OBAMA, I 

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:15.216
MIGHT STILL BE SITTING ON MY 
COACH EATING DORITOS AND 

00:34:15.217 --> 00:34:18.572
WATCHING SPORTS. [LAUGHTER] 
PRESIDENT OBAMA EMBODIES THE 

00:34:18.573 --> 00:34:21.458
DEFINITION OF COURAGE OFFERED BY
 ERNEST HEMINGWAY AND A FAVORITE

00:34:22.402 --> 00:34:26.902
 OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S "GRACE 
UNDER PRESSURE." FROM HIS FIRST 

00:34:26.903 --> 00:34:29.625
DAYS IN OFFICE UNTIL THE LAST, 
THE PRESIDENT CONSISTENTLY PUT 

00:34:29.626 --> 00:34:32.467
THE NATIONAL INTEREST ABOVE HIS 
OWN POLITICAL INTEREST WHILE 

00:34:32.468 --> 00:34:34.907
RESISTING THE POLITICS OF 
CYNICISM IN A SYSTEM THAT ALL 

00:34:34.908 --> 00:34:38.701
TOO OFTEN ENCOURAGES IT. HE HAD 
THE COURAGE TO PURSUE 

00:34:38.702 --> 00:34:41.588
COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE REFORM 
AS HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, 

00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:44.407
KNOWING THE ISSUE WOULD COST HIM
 AND THE PARTY POLITICALLY. HE 

00:34:44.408 --> 00:34:47.626
CONTINUED A FIGHT THAT WAS WAGED
 DURING THE KENNEDY 

00:34:47.627 --> 00:34:49.718
ADMINISTRATION, THAT MY UNCLE 
TEDDY FOUGHT FOR FOR 50 YEARS IN

00:34:50.215 --> 00:34:53.107
 THE SENATE AND DID WHAT NO 
PRESIDENT HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO IN

00:34:53.506 --> 00:34:55.872
 70 YEARS IN PASSING THE 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. [CHEERING 

00:34:55.873 --> 00:34:57.873
AND APPLAUSE]

00:35:03.432 --> 00:35:08.354
 WE SAW THIS WEEK THAT IT'S A 
LOT EASIER TO CRITICIZE AND 

00:35:08.355 --> 00:35:11.525
DISMANTLE. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD 
THE COURAGE TO GOVERN 

00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:14.456
RESPONSIBLY. HE HAD THE COURAGE 
TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF 

00:35:14.457 --> 00:35:17.052
CLIMATE CHANGE AGGRESSIVELY, 
FIGHTING FOR RESPONSIBLE ENERGY 

00:35:17.053 --> 00:35:20.819
POLICIES AND CHALLENGING 
CONGRESS TO SUPPORT THE CLEAN 

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.766
POWER PLAN, AND HE BROUGHT THE 
WORLD TOGETHER IN PARIS TO SET A

00:35:23.922 --> 00:35:25.922
 LIMIT ON GREENHOUSE GAS 
EMISSIONS.

00:35:29.944 --> 00:35:33.157
 JUST AS PRESIDENT KENNEDY DID 
WITH THE SPACE PROGRAM, 

00:35:33.158 --> 00:35:36.485
PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE SCIENTIFIC 
TECHNOLOGY THE HIGHEST NATIONAL 

00:35:36.486 --> 00:35:40.180
PRIORITY UNDER HIS CLIMATE PLAN 
ON AN ISSUE THAT WILL SHAPE LIFE

00:35:40.583 --> 00:35:43.635
 ON EARTH FOR MY GENERATIONS AND
 GENERATIONS TO COME, THE 

00:35:43.636 --> 00:35:47.505
PRESIDENT WAS BOLD AN UNAFRAID. 
HE PURSUED NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT 

00:35:47.506 --> 00:35:50.064
THROUGHOUT HIS PRESIDENCY AND 
HAD THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT 

00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:54.896
AMERICA'S OWN HISTORY WHEN 
FITSING HIROSHIMA. HE REPEATEDLY

00:35:55.105 --> 00:35:59.374
 CALLED FOR SENSIBLE ACTION ON 
GUN CONTROL TRAGEDY AFTER 

00:35:59.375 --> 00:36:07.142
TRAGEDY. [APPLAUSE] HE SHOWED ME
 AND MY GENERATION WHAT IS 

00:36:07.143 --> 00:36:10.322
POSSIBLE FROM POLITICS AND GAVE 
US A NEW STANDARD OF POLITICAL 

00:36:10.323 --> 00:36:13.646
COURAGE TO GUIDE US GOING 
FORWARD. HE CONNECTED US TO ONE 

00:36:13.647 --> 00:36:17.324
ANOTHER WITH HIS HOPES AND HIS 
DETERMINATION. WE ALL, 

00:36:17.325 --> 00:36:20.911
ESPECIALLY YOUNG AMERICANS, OWE 
A GREAT DEBT TO THIS COURAGEOUS 

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:24.868
PRESIDENT. WE CAN LIVE IN THE 
JUST, INCLUSIVE, COMPASSIONATE 

00:36:24.869 --> 00:36:28.465
AND STRONG NATION THAT PRESIDENT
 KENNEDY IMAGINED AND FOUGHT FOR

00:36:28.943 --> 00:36:31.963
 IF WE CHOOSE THE TYPE OF 
LEADERSHIP THAT DEFINED 

00:36:31.964 --> 00:36:35.210
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LAST EIGHT 
YEARS IN OFFICE. THAT IS OUR 

00:36:35.211 --> 00:36:38.617
RESPONSIBILITY AS CITIZENS AND 
IS AS IMPORTANT TODAY AS IT EVER

00:36:38.618 --> 00:36:41.528
 HAS BEEN. TONIGHT THE KENNEDY 
LIBRARY AND MY FAMILY ARE PROUD 

00:36:41.529 --> 00:36:43.988
TO HONOR THIS COURAGEOUS 
PRESIDENT, AND NOW I WOULD LIKE 

00:36:43.989 --> 00:36:46.617
TO ASK THE PRESIDENT, MRS. 
OBAMA, MY PARENTS AND SISTERS TO

00:36:46.747 --> 00:36:53.086
 COME ON STAGE TO PRESENT THE 
2017 PROFILE IN COURAGE AWARD TO

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.340
 BARACK OBAMA. THANK YOU.

00:36:59.754 --> 00:37:01.754
 [APPLAUSE]

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.900
 [APPLAUSE]

00:38:11.966 --> 00:38:13.966
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:23.121 --> 00:38:27.736
 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
&gt;&gt; HI THERE, EVERYBODY. THANK 

00:38:27.737 --> 00:38:32.192
YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. THANK YOU. PLEASE, 

00:38:32.193 --> 00:38:36.232
EVERYBODY, HAVE A SEAT. THANK 
YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIRST 

00:38:36.233 --> 00:38:42.685
OF ALL, THANK YOU SO MUCH, JACK,
 FOR THAT REALLY KIND 

00:38:42.686 --> 00:38:44.686
INTRODUCTION. AND I LIKE THE 
SOCKS.

00:38:47.054 --> 00:38:55.247
 I ALSO WANT THE THANK YOU AND 
ROSE AND TATIANA AND YOUR DAD 

00:38:55.248 --> 00:38:58.353
FOR SHARING CAROLINE WITH US 
THESE PAST FEW YEARS AS 

00:38:58.354 --> 00:39:03.535
AMERICA'S AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN. 
CAROLINE, TRUE TO FORM, YOU DID 

00:39:03.536 --> 00:39:07.208
YOUR COUNTRY PROUD, AND I'M SURE
 YOUR FATHER AND MOM WOULD HAVE 

00:39:07.209 --> 00:39:13.261
BEEN PROUDEST OF ALL. I SURE WAS
 PROUD. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR 

00:39:13.262 --> 00:39:17.316
YOUR FRIENDSHIP. I WANT THE 
THANK KEN FEINBERG FOR HIS 

00:39:17.317 --> 00:39:22.951
SERVICE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE JOHN 
F. KENNEDY LIBRARY FOUNDATION. 

00:39:22.952 --> 00:39:27.887
THESE PAST 12 YEARS HE ALSO 
RENDERED OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO 

00:39:27.888 --> 00:39:34.060
MY ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE WERE 
DEALING WITH THE B.P. OIL SPILL,

00:39:34.483 --> 00:39:37.301
 9/11. HE HAS RENDERED PUBLIC 
SERVICE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND 

00:39:37.302 --> 00:39:44.522
AGAIN. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR 
HIM. IT IS WONDERFUL... 

00:39:44.523 --> 00:39:46.523
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:51.976 --> 00:39:55.665
 IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE SENATORS
 MARKEY AND SENATOR WARREN, MY 

00:39:55.666 --> 00:40:00.088
DEAR FRIEND AND FORMER GOVERNOR 
DEVAL PATRICK AND HIS LOVELY 

00:40:00.089 --> 00:40:05.468
WIFE DIANE, GOVERNORS AND 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, CARDINAL 

00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:11.044
O'MALLEY, ONE OF THE FINEST 
SECRETARIES OF STATE EVER TO 

00:40:11.045 --> 00:40:15.641
REPRESENT AMERICA AROUND THE 
WORLD, JOHN KERRY. [APPLAUSE]

00:40:18.719 --> 00:40:24.015
 AND THERESA. AND THE BEST VICE 
PRESIDENT THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER 

00:40:24.016 --> 00:40:27.920
KNOWN, MR. JOE BIDEN. [CHEERING 
AND APPLAUSE]

00:40:36.564 --> 00:40:45.171
 I ALSO WANT TO THANK MICHELLE 
OBAMA FOR AFTER THE PRESIDENCY 

00:40:45.172 --> 00:40:50.708
STICKING WITH ME. [LAUGHTER] 
BECAUSE I THINK SHE FELT AN 

00:40:50.709 --> 00:40:56.345
OBLIGATION TO THE COUNTRY TO 
STAY ON, BUT ONCE HER OFFICIAL 

00:40:56.346 --> 00:40:59.786
DUTIES WERE OVER, IT WASN'T 
CLEAR.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:13.119
 I LOVE MY WIFE. AND I'M 
GRATEFUL FOR HER. AND I DO 

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.699
BELIEVE THAT IT WAS AMERICA'S 
VERY GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE HER AS

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.879
 FIRST LADY. [CHEERING AND 
APPLAUSE]

00:41:24.923 --> 00:41:28.918
 SO I'M HUMBLED BY THIS EVENING 
AND TO BE HONORED GAMELY THAT 

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:33.036
HAS GIVEN THIS COUNTRY SO MUCH, 
A FAMILY THAT'S CHALLENGED US TO

00:41:33.507 --> 00:41:41.039
 ASK WHAT WE CAN DO FOR OUR 
COUNTRY, TO DREAM AND SAY WHY 

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.168
NOT, TO SEEK A CAUSE THAT 
ENDURES, TO SAIL AGAINST THE 

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:50.228
WIND IN ITS PURSUIT. THAT'S WHAT
 THIS FAMILY HAS DONE FOR 

00:41:50.229 --> 00:41:53.032
AMERICA. AND TO ALL THE MEMBERS 
OF THE KENNEDY FAMILY THAT ARE 

00:41:53.033 --> 00:42:01.899
HERE TONIGHT, THANK YOU. I COULD
 NOT BE MORE GRATEFUL TO THE 

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.451
PROFILE IN COURAGE AWARD 
COMMITTEE FOR THIS HONOR. I'M 

00:42:04.452 --> 00:42:07.812
ALSO GRATEFUL THAT UNLIKE THE 
NOBEL PRIZE COMMITTEE, YOU 

00:42:07.813 --> 00:42:10.299
WAITED UNTIL I WAS OUT OF 
OFFICE.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.390
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:18.874 --> 00:42:23.651
 HOW FITTING THAT WE GATHER HERE
 THIS MONTH, THE 100th 

00:42:23.652 --> 00:42:26.671
ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT 
KENNEDY'S BIRTH. I WAS BORN THE 

00:42:26.672 --> 00:42:32.503
YEAR HE TOOK OFFICE, WHICH MAKES
 ME 55 YEARS OLD. HAD HE LIVED 

00:42:32.504 --> 00:42:38.147
TO FINISH TWO TERMS, HE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN JUST 51, AND 

00:42:38.148 --> 00:42:42.581
REREMARKED ON THAT POSSIBILITY 
ONCE. "IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED," 

00:42:42.582 --> 00:42:47.315
HE SAID, "THAT WHETHER I SERVE 
ONE OR TWO TERMS IN THE 

00:42:47.316 --> 00:42:49.791
PRESIDENCY, I WILL FIND MYSELF 
AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD AT 

00:42:49.792 --> 00:42:54.480
WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED THE AWKWARD
 AGE -- TOO OLD TO BEGIN A 

00:42:54.481 --> 00:43:02.042
CAREER AND TOO YOUNG TO WRITE MY
 MEMOIRS." NOW, I HADN'T SEEN 

00:43:02.043 --> 00:43:09.731
THIS QUOTE WHEN I WROTE MY FIRST
 MEMOIR AT 33. [LAUGHTER] I'M 

00:43:09.732 --> 00:43:15.277
NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SECOND. 
MOREOVER, I EXPECT TO BE BUSY IF

00:43:15.764 --> 00:43:20.706
 NOT WITH A SECOND CAREER THAN 
AT LEAST A SECOND ACT. BUT IT IS

00:43:20.851 --> 00:43:25.272
 TRUE THAT I'M AT THE AGE, AT 
THAT TURN IN THE ROAD WHERE ONE 

00:43:25.273 --> 00:43:32.221
LOOKS BACK AS WELL AS FORWARD TO
 REMEMBER WHERE ONE HAS BEEN SO 

00:43:32.222 --> 00:43:39.787
AS BETTER TO CHART WHERE ONE IS 
GOING. AND ONE THING I'M CERTAIN

00:43:40.564 --> 00:43:48.635
 IS THAT I WAS LUCKY TO BE BORN 
INTO THAT NEW FRONTIER, A NEW 

00:43:48.636 --> 00:43:51.572
WORLD, AND A NEW GENERATION OF

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:56.990
 AMERICANS.

00:43:58.069 --> 00:44:01.528
 MY LIFE IN MANY WAYS WOULD NOT 
HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE 

00:44:01.529 --> 00:44:08.994
VISION THAT J.F.K. ETCHED INTO 
THE CHARACTER AND HEART OF 

00:44:08.995 --> 00:44:10.995
AMERICA.

00:44:13.042 --> 00:44:16.947
 FOR THOSE OF US OF A CERTAIN 
AGE, THE KENNEDYS SYMBOLIZE A 

00:44:16.948 --> 00:44:22.298
SET OF VALUES AND ATTITUDES 
ABOUT CIVIC LIFE THAT MADE IT 

00:44:22.299 --> 00:44:27.055
SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE CALLING, THE 
IDEA THAT POLITICS, IN FACT, 

00:44:27.056 --> 00:44:31.872
COULD BE A NOBLE AND WORTHWHILE 
PURSUIT, THE NOTION THAT OUR 

00:44:31.873 --> 00:44:36.668
PROBLEMS WHILE SIGNIFICANT ARE 
NEVER INSURMOUNTABLE, THE BELIEF

00:44:37.347 --> 00:44:43.201
 THAT AMERICA'S PROMISE MIGHT 
EMBRACE THOSE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN 

00:44:43.202 --> 00:44:48.393
LOCKED OUT OR LEFT BEHIND, AND 
THAT OPPORTUNITY AND DIGNITY 

00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:55.725
WOULD NO LONGER BE RESTRICTED TO
 THE FEW BUT EXTENDED TO THE 

00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:58.469
MANY, THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT 
EACH OF US HAS THE PLAY A PART 

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:05.649
IN OUR NATION'S DESTINY, AND BY 
VIRTUE OF BEING AMERICAN, PLAY A

00:45:06.019 --> 00:45:10.829
 PART IN THE DESTINY OF THE 
WORLD. I CAN SAY TRUTHFULLY THAT

00:45:11.097 --> 00:45:19.285
 THE EXAMPLE OF JACK AND BOBBY 
KENNEDY HELPED GUIDE ME IN THE 

00:45:19.286 --> 00:45:22.798
POLITICS AND THE GUIDANCE OF 
TEDDY KENNEDY MADE ME A BETTER 

00:45:22.799 --> 00:45:29.171
PUBLIC SERVANT ONCE I ARRIVED IN
 WASHINGTON. I HAVE TO IMAGINE 

00:45:29.172 --> 00:45:32.705
IT WOULD GIVE THEM GREAT PRIDE 
TO SEE A NEW GENERATION OF 

00:45:32.706 --> 00:45:37.206
KENNEDYS LIKE JOE CARVING THEIR 
OWN PROUD PATH IN PUBLIC 

00:45:37.207 --> 00:45:39.711
SERVICE. [APPLAUSE]

00:45:44.152 --> 00:45:49.552
 FOR WHATEVER REASON I RECEIVE 
THIS AWARD, FOR WHATEVER THE 

00:45:49.553 --> 00:45:52.833
SCALE, THE CHALLENGES THAT WE 
OVERCAME AND THE SCOPE OF 

00:45:52.834 --> 00:45:56.150
PROGRESS WE MADE OVER MY 
PRESIDENCY, IT IS WORTH POINTING

00:45:56.968 --> 00:46:01.286
 OUT THAT IN MANY WAYS THE TIME 
THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY 

00:46:01.287 --> 00:46:05.222
CONFRONTED WERE FAR MORE 
PERILOUS THAN THE ONES THAT WE 

00:46:05.223 --> 00:46:10.644
CONFRONT TODAY. HE ENTERED THE 
OVAL OFFICE AT JUST 43, ONLY A 

00:46:10.645 --> 00:46:16.404
FEW YEARS AFTER KHRUSHCHEV HAD 
THREATENED TO BURY AMERICA. WARS

00:46:16.872 --> 00:46:23.615
 WAGED AROUND THE WORLD. LARGE 
SWATHS OF THE COUNTRY KNEW 

00:46:23.616 --> 00:46:27.959
POVERTY FAR DEEPER AND MORE 
WIDESPREAD THAN WE SEE TODAY. A 

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.734
YOUNG PREACHER'S CAUSE WAS JUST 
GAINING TRACTION ACROSS A LAND 

00:46:32.735 --> 00:46:40.050
SEGREGATED BY CUSTOM BUT BY LAW,
 AND YET WHEN THAT VOLATILE 

00:46:40.051 --> 00:46:45.289
TINDERBOX OF A TIME, PRESIDENT 
KENNEDY LED WITH A STEADY HAND, 

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:47.837
DIFFUSING THE MOST PERILOUS 
MOMENTS OF THE COLD WAR WITHOUT 

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:52.647
FIRING A SINGLE SHOT, ENFORCING 
THE RIGHTS OF YOUNG BLACK MEN 

00:46:52.648 --> 00:46:56.503
AND WOMEN TO STUDY AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF THEIR CHOICE, 

00:46:56.504 --> 00:47:00.862
UNLEASHING A CORE OF YOUNG 
VOLUNTEERS AS AMBASSADORS FOR 

00:47:00.863 --> 00:47:05.678
PEACE IN DISTANT CORNERS OF THE 
GLOBE, SETTING AMERICA'S SIGHTS 

00:47:05.679 --> 00:47:10.424
ON THE MOON PRECISELY BECAUSE IT
 WAS HARD, AND WILLING TO 

00:47:10.425 --> 00:47:13.383
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE
 MIGHT NOT WIN THIS SPACE RACE 

00:47:13.384 --> 00:47:17.075
BECAUSE HE HAD AN UNWAVERING 
FAITH IN THE CHARACTER OF THE 

00:47:17.076 --> 00:47:26.038
PEOPLE THAT HE LED -- RESILIENT,
 OPTIMISTIC, INNOVATIVE, AND 

00:47:26.039 --> 00:47:28.039
COURAGEOUS.

00:47:29.395 --> 00:47:35.240
 IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THIS: 
THE TIMES IN WHICH PRESIDENT 

00:47:35.241 --> 00:47:39.800
KENNEDY LED US BECAUSE FOR MANY 
AMERICANS I KNOW THAT THIS FEELS

00:47:40.398 --> 00:47:46.511
 LIKE AN UNCERTAIN AND EVEN 
PERILOUS TIME. THE FORCES OF 

00:47:46.512 --> 00:47:50.623
GLOBALIZATION AND TECHNOLOGY HAS
 UPENDED MANY OF OUR ESTABLISHED

00:47:51.133 --> 00:47:54.843
 ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMY 
AND HAS PROVIDED GREAT 

00:47:54.844 --> 00:47:59.744
OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO GREAT 
INEQUALITY AND UNCERTAINTY FOR 

00:47:59.745 --> 00:48:05.643
FAR TOO MANY. OUR POLITICS 
REMAIN FILLED WITH VISION AND 

00:48:05.644 --> 00:48:08.634
DISCORD AND EVERYWHERE WE SEE 
THE RISK OF FALLING INTO THE 

00:48:08.635 --> 00:48:18.031
REFUGE OF TRIBE AND CLAN AND 
ANGER AT THOSE THAT DON'T LOOK 

00:48:18.032 --> 00:48:22.756
LIKE US OR HAVE THE SAME 
SURNAMES OR PRAY THE WAY WE 

00:48:22.757 --> 00:48:29.023
THIS. -- WE DO. AT SUCH MOMENTS 
COURAGE IS NECESSARY, AT SUCH 

00:48:29.024 --> 00:48:35.517
MOMENTS WE NEED COURAGE TO STAND
 UP TO HATE, NOT JUST IN OTHERS 

00:48:35.518 --> 00:48:42.388
BUT IN OURSELVES. AT SUCH 
MOMENTS WE NEED THE COURAGE TO 

00:48:42.389 --> 00:48:50.318
STAND UP TO DOGMA, NOT JUST IN 
OTHERS, BUT IN OURSELVES. AT 

00:48:50.319 --> 00:48:53.894
SUCH MOMENTS WE NEED COURAGE TO 
BELIEVE THAT TOGETHER WE CAN 

00:48:53.895 --> 00:49:00.917
TACKLE BIG CHALLENGES LIKE 
INEQUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE. 

00:49:00.918 --> 00:49:04.008
AT SUCH MOMENTS IT'S NECESSARY 
FOR US TO SHOW COURAGE IN 

00:49:04.009 --> 00:49:09.427
CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO AND 
IN FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT, BUT 

00:49:09.428 --> 00:49:14.466
ALSO SHOW THE COURAGE TO LISTEN 
TO ONE ANOTHER AND SEEK COMMON 

00:49:14.467 --> 00:49:23.034
GROUND AND EMBRACE PRINCIPLED 
COMPROMISE, COURAGE PRESIDENT 

00:49:23.035 --> 00:49:28.811
KENNEDY KNEW REQUIRES SOMETHING 
MORE THAN JUST THE ABSENCE OF 

00:49:28.812 --> 00:49:36.469
FEAR. ANY FOOL CAN BE FEARLESS. 
COURAGE, TRUE COURAGE, DERIVES 

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:44.268
FROM THAT SENSE OF WHO WE ARE. 
WHAT ARE OUR BEST SELVES? WHAT 

00:49:44.269 --> 00:49:48.931
ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT 
COMMITMENTS? AND THE BELIEF THAT

00:49:50.103 --> 00:49:52.375
 WE CAN DIG

00:49:55.963 --> 00:49:58.844
 DEEP AND DO HARD THINGS FOR THE
 ENDURING BENEFIT FOR OTHERS. 

00:49:58.845 --> 00:50:03.318
THAT'S WHY J.F.K.'S FIRST 
INAUGURAL STILL RINGS TRUE. 

00:50:03.319 --> 00:50:09.587
THAT'S WHY BOBBY'S CAMPAIGN 
STILL MEANS SO MUCH. THAT'S WHY 

00:50:09.588 --> 00:50:11.588
THE END YEAH'S CAUSE

00:50:13.893 --> 00:50:17.385
 CAUSE -- TEDDY'S CAUSE ENDURES 
AND WE STILL LOVE HIM SO MUCH. 

00:50:17.386 --> 00:50:21.670
BECAUSE OF THE TRAGEDIES THAT 
BEFELL EACH OF THEM, SOMETIMES 

00:50:21.671 --> 00:50:26.192
WE FORGET HOW FUNDAMENTALLY THE 
STORY THEY TOLD US ABOUT 

00:50:26.193 --> 00:50:31.353
OURSELVES CHANGED THE TRAJECTORY
 OF AMERICA, AND THAT'S OFTEN 

00:50:31.354 --> 00:50:36.591
WHERE COURAGE BEGINS, WITH THE 
STORY WE TELL OURSELVES ABOUT 

00:50:36.592 --> 00:50:40.743
WHO WE ARE AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT 
AND ABOUT OUR OWN CAPACITY TO 

00:50:40.744 --> 00:50:42.744
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:50:44.604 --> 00:50:50.313
 WE LIVE IN A TIME OF GREAT 
CYNICISM ABOUT OUR INSTITUTIONS.

00:50:50.875 --> 00:50:53.938
 THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS 
THAT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS 

00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:55.939
CAN AGREE ON.

00:50:57.611 --> 00:51:02.239
 IT'S A CYNICISM THAT IS MOST 
CORROSIVE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR 

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.240
SYSTEM OF

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.160
 SELF-GOVERNMENT,

00:51:10.057 --> 00:51:15.598
 THAT THERE IS JAGGED BUT 
ULTIMATELY FORWARD PROGRESS THAT

00:51:16.004 --> 00:51:20.215
 IMPEDES OUR CHILDREN'S ABILITY 
TO SEE IN THE NOISY AND OFTEN 

00:51:20.216 --> 00:51:22.639
TOO TRIVIAL PURR SUITS OF 
POLITICS THE POSSIBILITY OF OUR 

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:27.950
DEMOCRACY DOING BIG THINGS. OF 
COURSE, THE SAME FOR ELECTED 

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:34.916
OFFICIALS IS NOT NEW, AS MANY OF
 YOU IN THE ROOM CAN TELL 

00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:38.768
OTHERS. SIX YEARS AGO PRESIDENT 
KENNEDY QUOTED A COLUMNIST IN 

00:51:38.769 --> 00:51:42.545
PROFILES IN COURAGE WHO HAD 
WRITTEN "PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A 

00:51:42.546 --> 00:51:45.229
DAMN WHAT THE AVERAGE SENATOR OR
 CONGRESSMAN SAYS. THE REASON 

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.999
THEY DON'T CARE IS THAT THEY 
KNOW WHAT YOU HEAR IN CONGRESS 

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.647
IS 99% TRITE, IGNORANCE, AND 
TEMPERATURE GOINGRY AND NOT TO 

00:51:54.648 --> 00:52:01.167
BE RELIED UPON," WHICH IS 
PERHAPS A LITTLE HARSH. 99% 

00:52:01.168 --> 00:52:04.285
SEEMS HIGH. [LAUGHTER]

00:52:08.229 --> 00:52:16.365
 85%. [LAUGHTER] BUT PRESIDENT 
KENNEDY ALSO WROTE THAT THE 

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:19.751
COMPLICATION OF PUBLIC BUSINESS 
AND THE COMPETITION FOR THE 

00:52:19.752 --> 00:52:25.403
PUBLIC'S ATTENTION HAVE OBSCURED
 INNUMERABLE ACTS OF POLITICAL 

00:52:25.404 --> 00:52:32.370
COURAGE, LARGE AND SMALL, 
PERFORMED ALMOST DAILY -- 

00:52:32.371 --> 00:52:34.898
INNUMERABLE ACTS OF POLITICAL

00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:42.691
 COURAGE, LARGE AND SMALL, 
PERFORMED ALMOST DAILY. AND THAT

00:52:42.823 --> 00:52:46.357
 IS TRUE. I HAVE SEEN IT, I HAVE
 WITNESSED IT. I'VE BEEN 

00:52:46.358 --> 00:52:48.925
THINKING ON THIS NOTION OF 
COURAGE THIS WEEKEND, IN 

00:52:48.926 --> 00:52:52.281
PARTICULAR ABOUT SOME OF THE MEN
 AND WOMEN ELECTED TO CONGRESS 

00:52:52.282 --> 00:52:55.957
THE SAME YEAR I WAS ELECTED TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE. MANY OF THEM 

00:52:55.958 --> 00:53:02.796
WERE NEW TO WASHINGTON. THEIR 
ENTIRE CAREERS AHEAD OF THEM. 

00:53:02.797 --> 00:53:08.202
AND IN THAT VERY FIRST TERM, 
THEY HAD TO TAKE TOUGH VOTE 

00:53:08.203 --> 00:53:13.216
AFTER TOUGH VOTE, BECAUSE WE 
WERE IN CRISIS. THEY TOOK VOTES 

00:53:13.217 --> 00:53:17.200
TO SAVE THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND
 THE ECONOMY EVEN WHEN IT WAS 

00:53:17.201 --> 00:53:22.648
HIGHLY UNPOPULAR. THEY TOOK 
VOTES TO SAVE THE AUTOINDUSTRY 

00:53:22.649 --> 00:53:27.196
WHEN EVEN IN MICHIGAN PEOPLE 
DIDN'T WANT TO SEE BAILOUTS. 

00:53:27.197 --> 00:53:30.636
THEY TOOK VOTES THE CRACK DOWN 
ON ABUSES ON WALL STREET DESPITE

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:37.103
 PRESSURE FROM LOBBYISTS AND 
SOMETIMES THEIR DONORS. AND THEY

00:53:37.231 --> 00:53:42.683
 FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE MIDST 
OF A GREAT DEBATE. A DEBATE THAT

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:47.579
 HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES, 
A DEBATE THAT THE KENNEDY FAMILY

00:53:47.904 --> 00:53:53.596
 HAD PARTICIPATED IN AND HELPED 
LEAD, A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER A 

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:58.519
NATION AS WEALTHY AS THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA WOULD FINALLY 

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.430
MAKE HEALTHCARE NOT A PRIVILEGE 
BY A RIGHT FOR ALL AMERICANS.

00:54:05.326 --> 00:54:07.326
 [APPLAUSE]

00:54:08.703 --> 00:54:12.728
 AND THERE WAS A REASON WHY 
HEALTHCARE REFORM HAD NOT BEEN 

00:54:12.729 --> 00:54:20.727
ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE. IT WAS 
HARD. IT INVOLVED ONE-SIXTH OF 

00:54:20.728 --> 00:54:27.189
THE ECONOMY AND ALL MANNER OF 
STAKEHOLDERS AND INTERESTS. IT 

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:32.812
WAS EASILY SUBJECT TO 
MISINFORMATION AND FEAR 

00:54:32.813 --> 00:54:38.069
MONGERING. AND SO BY THE TIME 
THE VOTE CAME UP TO PASS THE 

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:41.926
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THESE 
FRESHMAN CONGRESSMEN AND WOMEN 

00:54:41.927 --> 00:54:47.227
KNEW THAT THEY HAD THE MAKE A 
CHOICE, THAT THEY HAD A CHANCE 

00:54:47.228 --> 00:54:54.033
TO ENSURE MILLIONS AND PREVENT 
UNTOLD WORRY AND SUFFERING AND 

00:54:54.034 --> 00:55:01.711
BANKRUPTCY AND EVEN DEATH, BUT 
THIS SAME VOTE WOULD LIKELY COST

00:55:02.191 --> 00:55:06.451
 THEM THEIR NEW SEATS, PERHAPS 
END THEIR POLITICAL CAREERS.

00:55:10.426 --> 00:55:14.834
 AND THESE MEN AND WOMEN DID THE
 RIGHT THING. THEY DID THE HARD 

00:55:14.835 --> 00:55:16.835
THING.

00:55:18.361 --> 00:55:21.531
 THEIRS WAS A PROFILE IN 
COURAGE, BECAUSE OF THAT VOTE, 

00:55:21.532 --> 00:55:24.594
20 MILLION PEOPLE GOT HEALTH 
INSURANCE WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT 

00:55:24.595 --> 00:55:34.555
BEFORE. AND MOST OF THEM... 
[APPLAUSE] MOST OF THEM DID LOSE

00:55:36.574 --> 00:55:39.677
 THEIR SEATS, BUT THEY WERE TRUE
 TO WHAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY 

00:55:39.678 --> 00:55:44.351
DEFINED IN HIS BOOK AS A 
CONGRESSIONAL PROFILE IN 

00:55:44.352 --> 00:55:48.479
COURAGE, THE DESIRE TO MAINTAIN 
A REPUTATION FOR INTEGRITY THAT 

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:56.106
IS STRONGER THAN A DESIRE TO 
MAINTAIN OFFICE. THE DEZAIRE TO 

00:55:56.107 --> 00:55:59.899
MAINTAIN A REPUTATION FOR 
INTEGRITY THAT IS STRONGER THAN 

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:09.508
THE DESIRE TO MAINTAIN OFFICE. A
 CONSCIENCE, PERSONAL STANDARD 

00:56:09.509 --> 00:56:15.611
OF ETHICS, INTEGRITY, MORALITY 
THAT IS STRONGER THAN THE 

00:56:15.612 --> 00:56:22.546
PRESSURES OF PUBLIC DISAPPROVAL 
OR PARTY DISAPPROVAL, A FAITH 

00:56:22.547 --> 00:56:29.848
THAT THE RIGHT COURSE WOULD 
ULTIMATELY BE VINDICATEED, A 

00:56:29.849 --> 00:56:35.411
FAITH THAT OVERCAME FEAR OF 
PUBLIC REPRISAL. IT WAS A 

00:56:35.412 --> 00:56:41.019
PERSONAL SACRIFICE, BUT I KNOW 
BECAUSE I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY OF 

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:44.175
THEM THAT THEY THOUGHT AND STILL
 THINK IT WAS WORTH IT.

00:56:49.113 --> 00:56:53.334
 AS EVERYONE HERE NOW KNOWS, 
THIS GREAT DEBATE IS NOT SETTLED

00:56:53.809 --> 00:57:03.016
 BUT CONTINUES. AND IT IS MY 
FERVENT HOPE AND THE HOPE OF 

00:57:03.017 --> 00:57:10.138
MILLIONS THAT REGARDLESS OF 
PARTY, SUCH COURAGE IS STILL 

00:57:10.139 --> 00:57:14.597
POSSIBLE, THAT TODAY'S MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS, REGARDLESS OF 

00:57:14.598 --> 00:57:21.968
PARTY, ARE WILLING THE LOOK AT 
THE FACTS AND SPEAK THE TRUTH 

00:57:21.969 --> 00:57:28.569
EVEN WHEN IT CONTRADICTS PARTY 
POSITIONS. I HOPE THAT CURRENT 

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:34.139
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS RECALL THAT 
IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T TAKE A LOT 

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:41.265
OF COURAGE TO AID THOSE WHO ARE 
ALREADY POWERFUL, ALREADY 

00:57:41.266 --> 00:57:45.311
COMFORTABLE, ALREADY 
INFLUENTIAL, BUT IT DOES REQUIRE

00:57:45.312 --> 00:57:50.347
 SOME COURAGE TO CHAMPION THE 
VULNERABLE AND THE SICK,

00:57:53.421 --> 00:57:58.124
 AND THE INFIRM, THOSE WHO OFTEN
 HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE CORRIDORS

00:57:59.247 --> 00:58:02.739
 OF POWER. I HOPE THEY 
UNDERSTAND THAT COURAGE MEANS 

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:07.450
NOT SIMPLY DOING WHAT IS 
POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT BUT DOING 

00:58:07.451 --> 00:58:16.496
WHAT THEY BELIEVE DEEP IN THEIR 
HEARTS IS RIGHT. AND THIS KIND 

00:58:16.497 --> 00:58:25.957
OF COURAGE IS REQUIRED FROM ALL 
OF US. THOSE OF US WHO CONSIDER 

00:58:25.958 --> 00:58:29.689
OURSELVES PROGRESSIVE, THOSE OF 
US WHO ARE DEMOCRATS, WE'VE GOT 

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:32.278
SOME SOUL SEARCHING TO DO TO SEE
 WHAT KIND OF COURAGE WE SHOW. 

00:58:32.279 --> 00:58:34.730
WE HAVE OUR OWN DOGMAS.

00:58:39.936 --> 00:58:46.153
 THOSE OF US NOT IN ELECTED 
OFFICE HAVE THE SHOW SOME 

00:58:46.154 --> 00:58:51.405
COURAGE. WE'RE PRONE TO BESTOW 
THE MANTLE OF COURAGE TOO EASILY

00:58:51.406 --> 00:58:53.974
 ON THE PROMINENT AND POWERFUL 
AND TOO EAGER THE WRAP OURSELVES

00:58:54.132 --> 00:59:01.104
 IN CYNICISM WHEN THEY LET US 
DOWN BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T 

00:59:01.105 --> 00:59:06.772
PERFECT. WE LOSE SIGHT SOMETIMES
 OF OUR OWN OBLIGATIONS, EACH OF

00:59:07.418 --> 00:59:10.866
 OURS, ALL THE QUIET ACTS OF 
COURAGE THAT UNFOLD AROUND US 

00:59:10.867 --> 00:59:14.845
EVERY SINGLE DAY, ORDINARY 
AMERICANS, WHO GIVE SOMETHING OF

00:59:15.287 --> 00:59:18.329
 THEMSELVES NOT FOR PERSONAL 
GAIN BUT FOR THE ENDURING 

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:22.887
BENEFIT OF ANOTHER, THE COURAGE 
OF A SINGLE MOM WHO IS WORKING 

00:59:22.888 --> 00:59:27.965
TWO JOBS TO MAKE SURE HER KIDS 
CAN GO TO COLLEGE, THE COURAGE 

00:59:27.966 --> 00:59:33.788
OF A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO IS
 KEEPING FOLKS ON THE PAYROLL 

00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:38.655
BECAUSE HE KNOWS A FAMILY 
RELEASE ON IT, EVEN IF IT'S NOT 

00:59:38.656 --> 00:59:43.796
ALWAYS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR
 HIS BOTTOM LINE, THE COURAGE OF

00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:53.892
 SOMEBODY WHO VOLUNTEERS TO HELP
 SOME KIDS WHO NEED HELP. WHEN 

00:59:53.893 --> 00:59:57.693
WE RECOGNIZE THESE ACTS OF 
COURAGE, WE THEN NECESSARILY 

00:59:57.694 --> 01:00:00.425
RECOGNIZE OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY
 AS CITIZENS AND AS PART OF THE 

01:00:00.426 --> 01:00:05.719
HUMAN FAMILY TO GET INVOLVED AND
 THE GET ENGAGED AND TO TAKE A 

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:12.283
STAND, TO VOTE, TO PAY 
ATTENTION. I'M REMINDED OF A 

01:00:12.284 --> 01:00:15.517
STORY TEDDY ONCE TOLD ME ABOUT 
HIS EXPERIENCE MANY YEARS AGO 

01:00:15.518 --> 01:00:21.992
WHEN TEDDY, JR.,, NOW STATE 
SENATOR TED KENNEDY, JR., WAS 

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:25.565
SLEEPING AFTER ONE OF HIS CANCER
 TREATMENTS. AND TED WOULD 

01:00:25.566 --> 01:00:30.532
WANDER THE HALLS OF THE HOSPITAL
 AND TALK WITH OTHER PARENTS, 

01:00:30.533 --> 01:00:33.950
KEEPING VIGIL OVER THEIR OWN 
CHILDREN, AND THESE PARENTS 

01:00:33.951 --> 01:00:37.436
LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR OF WHAT 
MIGHT HAPPEN IF THEY COULDN'T 

01:00:37.437 --> 01:00:42.064
AFFORD THE NEXT TREATMENT. SOME 
CALCULATING IN THEIR OWN MINDS 

01:00:42.065 --> 01:00:45.716
WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO SELL OR 
BORROW JUST TO MAKE IT FOR A FEW

01:00:46.673 --> 01:00:50.916
 MORE MONTHS, SOME BARGAINING 
WITH GOD FOR WHATEVER THEY COULD

01:00:51.285 --> 01:00:55.656
 GET, AND RIGHT THERE IN THE 
QUIET OF NIGHT, WORKING PEOPLE 

01:00:55.657 --> 01:01:00.362
OF MODEST MEANS AND ONE OF THE 
MOST POWERFUL MEN IN AMERICA 

01:01:00.363 --> 01:01:06.146
SHARED THE SAME INTIMATE AND 
IMMEDIATE SENSE OF HELPLESS 

01:01:06.147 --> 01:01:10.855
NESS. AND TED COULD, OF COURSE, 
AFFORD HIS SON'S TREATMENT, BUT 

01:01:10.856 --> 01:01:15.363
IT WAS THAT QUIET, DIGNIFIED 
COURAGE OF OTHERS TO ENDURE THE 

01:01:15.364 --> 01:01:18.664
MOST FRIGHTENING THING 
IMAGINABLE AND TO DO WHAT IT 

01:01:18.665 --> 01:01:25.646
TAKES ON BEHALF OF THEIR LOVED 
ONES THAT HAD COMPELLED TEDDY TO

01:01:27.061 --> 01:01:34.368
 MAKE THOSE PARENTS HIS CAUSE, 
NOT OUT OF SELF-INTEREST, BUT 

01:01:34.369 --> 01:01:42.343
OUT OF A SELFLESS CONCERN FOR 
THOSE WHO SUFFER. THAT'S WHERE 

01:01:42.344 --> 01:01:46.861
THE ORDINARY COURAGE OF EVERYDAY
 PEOPLE CAN INSPIRE WHEN YOU'RE 

01:01:46.862 --> 01:01:50.284
PAYING ATTENTION, THE QUIET 
COURAGE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE DOING

01:01:50.285 --> 01:01:52.969
 THE RIGHT THING DAY IN AND KAY 
OUT. THEY DON'T GET ATTENTION 

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:56.479
FOR IT. THEY DON'T SEEK IT. THEY
 DON'T GET AWARDS FOR IT, BUT 

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.255
THAT'S WHAT DEFINED AMERICA. I 
THINK OF WOMEN LIKE MY 

01:02:01.256 --> 01:02:05.950
GRANDMOTHER AND SO MANY LIKE HER
 WHO WORKED THEIR WAY UP FROM A 

01:02:05.951 --> 01:02:09.098
SECRETARIAL POOL TO MANAGEMENT 
AND IN THE PROCESS PUSHED THE 

01:02:09.099 --> 01:02:11.801
GLASS CEILING JUST A LITTLE BIT 
HIGHER. I THINK ABOUT PEOPLE 

01:02:11.802 --> 01:02:16.825
LIKE MICHELLE'S DAD, WHO DESPITE
 M.S. GOT UP EVERY SINGLE 

01:02:16.826 --> 01:02:20.381
MORNING, HAD THE WAKE UP AN HOUR
 EARLY TO BUTTON HIS SHIRT UP 

01:02:20.382 --> 01:02:24.045
AND PUT ON HIS CLOTHES AND TAKE 
THOSE TWO CANES HE USED AND GO 

01:02:24.046 --> 01:02:29.838
TO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY TO MAKE
 SURE THAT HE WAS SUPPORTING HIS

01:02:31.863 --> 01:02:35.448
 FAMILY, NOT MISSING A DANCE 
RECITAL OR A BASKETBALL GAME. I 

01:02:35.449 --> 01:02:39.411
THINK OF THE TROOPS AND THE COPS
 AND THE FIRST RESPONDERS THAT 

01:02:39.412 --> 01:02:44.500
I'VE MET WHO PUT THEMSELVES AT 
RISK FOR STRANGERS THEY WILL 

01:02:44.501 --> 01:02:47.125
NEVER KNOW AND BUSINESS OWNERS 
WHO MAKE EVERY KIND OF SACRIFICE

01:02:47.579 --> 01:02:52.874
 THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THEIR 
WORKERS HAVE A SHOT AND WORKERS 

01:02:52.875 --> 01:03:01.954
WHO TAKE A RISK OF STARTING A 
NEW CAREER, RETRAINING AT MY 

01:03:01.955 --> 01:03:06.053
AGE, KIDS IN THE PEACE CORPS 
WORKING TO BUILD BRIDGES OF 

01:03:06.054 --> 01:03:09.663
UNDERSTANDING IN OTHER NATIONS 
TO SPREAD THE SAME VALUES THAT 

01:03:09.664 --> 01:03:15.300
HELPED BRING DOWN AN IRON 
CURTAIN, BANISH THE SCOURGE OF 

01:03:15.301 --> 01:03:20.621
APARTHEID, EXPAND THE BOUNDARIES
 OF HUMAN FREEDOM. I THINK OF 

01:03:20.622 --> 01:03:25.322
DREAMERS WHO SUPPRESSED THEIR 
FEARS TO KEEP WORKING AND 

01:03:25.323 --> 01:03:30.648
STRIVING IN THE ONLY COUNTRY 
THEY'VE EVER CALLED HOME, AND 

01:03:30.649 --> 01:03:35.919
EVERY AMERICAN WHO STANDS UP FOR
 IMMIGRANTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW 

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.590
THAT THEIR PARENTS, THEIR 
GRANDPARENTS, THEIR GREAT 

01:03:38.591 --> 01:03:42.162
GRANDPARENTS WERE IMMIGRANTS, 
TOO, AND THEY KNOW THAT AMERICA 

01:03:42.163 --> 01:03:47.304
IS AN IDEA THAT ONLY GROWS 
STRONGER WITH EACH NEW PERSON 

01:03:47.305 --> 01:03:49.990
WHO ADOPTS OUR COMMON CREED.

01:03:54.556 --> 01:03:56.556
 [APPLAUSE]

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:06.804
ACTIVIST WHO THINKS OF THE 
INJUSTICES IN OR CRIMINAL 

01:04:06.805 --> 01:04:09.748
JUSTICE SYSTEM, NOT WITH 
VIOLENCE, NO WITH DESPAIR, BUT 

01:04:09.749 --> 01:04:12.010
WITH PEACEFUL PROTEST ANALYSIS 
AND CONSTRUCTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:04:12.413 --> 01:04:17.579
 FOR CHANGE. I THINK OF THE 
POWERLESS WHO CROSSED A BRIDGE 

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:25.211
IN SELMA AND DISCOVERED THEY HAD
 POWER, THOSE WHO GATHERED TO 

01:04:25.212 --> 01:04:28.586
STONEWALL AND DISCOVERED THEY 
HAD A VOICE, THOSE WHO MARCHED 

01:04:28.587 --> 01:04:35.637
ON WASHINGTON BECAUSE THEY 
BELIEVED THAT THEY, WITHOUT AN 

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:39.623
ARMY, WITHOUT GREAT WEALTH, 
COULD SOMEHOW CHANGE THE VERY 

01:04:39.624 --> 01:04:45.389
FABRIC OF THE GREATEST POWER ON 
EARTH AND KEPT ON UNTIL THEY 

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:52.657
STRETCHED THE LOFTY IDEALS OF 
OUR FOUNDING TO ENCIRCLE 

01:04:52.658 --> 01:05:00.015
EVERYONE. EVERY CITIZEN INSPIRED
 BY THAT HISTORY WHO DIPS THEIR 

01:05:00.016 --> 01:05:05.040
TOES IN THE WATER OF ACTIVE 
DEMOCRACY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND

01:05:05.442 --> 01:05:11.253
 MUSTERS UP THE DETERMINATION 
THE TRY AND FAIL AND TRY AGAIN 

01:05:11.254 --> 01:05:16.427
AND SOMETIMES FAIL AGAIN AND 
STILL TRY AGAIN KNOWING THEIR 

01:05:16.428 --> 01:05:21.535
EFFORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS REWARDED 
RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE 

01:05:21.536 --> 01:05:27.950
IN THAT UPWARD TRAJECTORY OF THE
 AMERICAN STORY, THE STORY THAT 

01:05:27.951 --> 01:05:32.858
NOBODY TOLD BETTER THAN JOHN F. 
KENNEDY.

01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:40.732
 THAT VERY KENNEDYESQUE IDEA 
THAT AMERICA IS NOT THE PROJECT 

01:05:40.733 --> 01:05:45.960
OF ANY ONE PERSON AND THAT EACH 
OF US CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND 

01:05:45.961 --> 01:05:52.069
ALL OF US OUGHT TO TRY. THAT 
QUIET STURDY CITIZENSHIP THAT I 

01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:56.478
SEE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND 
THAT I ESPECIALLY SEE IN YOUNG 

01:05:56.479 --> 01:06:04.664
PEOPLE LIKE JACK AND ROSE AND 
TATYANA, MALIA AND SASHA AND

01:06:06.702 --> 01:06:11.763
 YOUR KIDS. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
 PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S AIDE AND 

01:06:11.764 --> 01:06:14.592
FRIEND, HISTORIAN ARTHUR 
SCHLESINGER, JR., WAS RIGHT WHEN

01:06:14.798 --> 01:06:20.433
 HE WROTE THAT HISTORY UNFOLDS 
IN CYCLES, BUT I THIS KNOW THAT 

01:06:20.434 --> 01:06:24.564
IT DOESN'T MOVE IN A STRAIGHT 
LINE. I KNOW THAT THE VALUES AND

01:06:24.695 --> 01:06:33.567
 THE PROGRESS THAT WE CHERISH 
ARE NOT INEVITABLE. THEY ARE 

01:06:33.568 --> 01:06:40.425
FRAGILE AND NEED A CONSTANT 
RENEWAL. I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT I

01:06:40.744 --> 01:06:46.142
 BELIEVE WHAT DR. KING SAID, 
THAT THE ARC OF THE UNIVERSE IS 

01:06:46.143 --> 01:06:49.376
LONG BUT IT BENDS TOWARD 
JUSTICE, BUT I'VE ALSO SAID IT 

01:06:49.377 --> 01:06:53.083
DOES NOT BEND ON ITS OWN. IT 
BENDS BECAUSE WE BEND IT, 

01:06:53.084 --> 01:06:56.430
BECAUSE WE PUT OUR HANDS ON THAT
 ARC AND WE MOVE IT IN THE 

01:06:56.431 --> 01:07:06.096
DIRECTION OF JUSTICE AND FREEDOM
 AND EQUALITY AND KINDNESS AND

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:12.994
 GENEROSITY. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
ON ITS OWN. AND SO WE'RE 

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:19.092
CONSTANTLY HAVING TO MAKE A 
CHOICE, BECAUSE PROGRESS IS 

01:07:19.093 --> 01:07:25.010
FRAGILE, AND IT'S PRECISELY THAT
 PRA JILL -- FRAGILITY THAT IS A

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:32.085
 PRECONDITION OF THE QUALITY OF 
CHARACTER THAT WE CELEBRATE 

01:07:32.086 --> 01:07:35.401
TONIGHT. IT'S THE VITALITY OF 
OUR DEMOCRACY, IT'S THE GAINS OF

01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:40.277
 OUR LONG JOURNEY TO FREEDOM 
WERE ASSURED, NONE OF US WOULD 

01:07:40.278 --> 01:07:43.691
EVER HAVE TO BE COURAGEOUS. NONE
 OF US WOULD EVER HAVE TO RISK 

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:53.266
