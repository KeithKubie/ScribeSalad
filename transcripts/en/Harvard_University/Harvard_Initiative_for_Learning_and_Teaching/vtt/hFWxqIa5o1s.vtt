00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.390
Welcome everyone.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.940
Thank you all for being here.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.810
This is our seventh
year in HILT.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.300
And just for those
of you who don't

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.310
know about our
organization, we're

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.500
a university-wide organization
designed to seed innovation

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.530
in teaching and learning
and to convene people

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.960
across our schools to share
best practices about teaching

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.240
and learning with one another.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.020
And the speaker series
is one mechanism

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
that we use to do the
convening part of our work.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.490
We have designed this
particular mechanism

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.550
with the notion of
having scholars--

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.940
often in our community, but
sometimes from the outside--

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.340
come in and talk
about their work

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.820
and how it can improve
teaching and learning.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.200
This is our ninth one
of our speaker series.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.050
And it's my great
pleasure to introduce

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.430
Kathy to do this talk today.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.270
I think it might be the perfect
alignment of all of the things

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.420
that we've been thinking
about with your background

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.080
and what you're working on.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.940
So Kathy is faculty co-director
of the Learning and Teaching

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.690
Program at the Harvard
Graduate School of Education,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.420
and she directs the
Data Wise Project.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.920
She works with individuals
and organizations

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.590
to try to get them
to work together

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.280
to improve teaching
and learning,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.600
especially using
data and evidence.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.010
And that is exactly what
we're trying to do too.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.740
And just by way
of background, she

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.060
did her undergraduate in
economics at Yale and PhD

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.274
in public policy here.

00:01:55.274 --> 00:01:56.940
I think it's very
interesting to imagine

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.000
that particular
educational trajectory,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.440
and then getting you to the kind
of work that you're doing now.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.940
I also wanted to
mention that she's

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.832
going to be featured in next
Monday's Into Practice issue.

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:13.540
Many of you will have
seen Into Practice.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.340
If not.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.840
Sign up for this
electronic newsletter.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.860
We started meeting with
Kathy over the summer--

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.450
we being Melissa,
Melissa and I--

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.120
when we were initially
thinking, OK, we

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.680
want to feature Kathy
in Into Practice.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.420
What are some of the ideas she
might have about low investment

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.200
ways to improve
teaching and learning?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.460
And so she threw out a number
of them and then she said,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.560
well, I also do this
MOOC thing, but I'd

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.420
be lying if I said that
was low investment.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.082
[LAUGHING]

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.180
And then she proceeded to say,
but it was really worth it.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.720
And maybe it's going to be one
of those investments in time

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.520
that will save time
later, and certainly has

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.350
changed the way I
think you've thought

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.540
about your residential
teaching and the way

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.280
you do your
residential teaching.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.880
And so that is how we ended
up with the talk today.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.540
Interestingly, this brings
together residential teaching

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.560
and online teaching.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.950
And so we've been thinking
of this speaker series

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.970
as a partnership
between us and HarvardX,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.780
and that we're doing this,
we're offering this talk

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.520
to our community together.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.320
And so I wanted to
quickly introduce

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.840
Sarah Grafman from HarvardX.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.960
She is the manager of
instructional development

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.280
at HarvardX, and worked closely
with Kathy on this project.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.540
So very quickly,
because I really

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.010
want to get to the good stuff,
more than 40 on campus courses

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.420
are currently using or have
used HarvardX materials.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.840
That includes Architectural
Imagination at the Graduate

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.590
School of Design.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.600
You can ask my colleague
Andrew over there

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.040
if you have any
questions about that.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.420
Causal diagrams at the Chan
School of Public Health.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.940
Poetry is now a gen ed course.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.038
And of course,
there's Data Wise.

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:19.829
If anyone has any
questions about HarvardX,

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.940
feel free to see me afterwards,
or Mike Kahn in the back.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.240
And I actually just got
back from three days--

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.354
Erin mentioned I
worked on Data Wise,

00:04:28.354 --> 00:04:30.270
I'm actually still working
on it a little bit.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.910
Oh, ongoing!

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.480
Ongoing I just got
back from three days

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.880
in Prince George's
County, Maryland where

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.040
I was filming for Data
Wise, so this is just

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.806
a wonderful capstone to my week.

00:04:40.806 --> 00:04:43.460
And without any further ado,
Kathy, please come on up

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.250
and talk to us.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.750
Thank you, Erin, for that
very wonderful introduction.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.050
I'd literally remembered
the day HILT was announced,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.630
because I was like, at last!

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.190
Those are my people!

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.040
And I appreciate that you
have brought us together

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.540
in so many different
ways over the--

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.650
I can't believe
it's seven years.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.650
But it's just--
it's an honor to be

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.470
able to talk to you about
some work that grew out

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.840
of the efforts that
I feel like HILT

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.810
is bringing to this school.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.870
And thank you, Sarah Sarah has
really been my right-hand woman

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.500
for taking this bold step
into online learning, which

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.160
is something I had not
done anything with prior.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.010
And also I just have to think
R.T. and Bill from the Teaching

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.880
and Learning Lab at
Harvard, because this

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.880
is what you're going to
hear about today is very

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.800
much the work of
many, a collaboration,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.380
because as Erin said, that's
the way I like to work.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.070
And also to recognize Christina
from the Harvard Education

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.580
Press, because this
whole-- all of this content

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.200
wouldn't have come
to be if we didn't

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.040
have a book that we felt
we wanted to get more

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.770
widely spread.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.370
So thank you, Christina
for being here.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.730
So our agenda for
today is that we're

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.920
going to start with
some introductions,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.470
and then I'm going to
just hit on a few things.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.710
Our goals, why we
even did what we did;

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.650
what it was that we did
when we did what we did;

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.720
some surprises that
came along the way;

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.650
and a chance for some
reflections and these

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.880
are your insights, your
worries, and your questions.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.980
So first I just want to get
a sense of who is in the room

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:26.690
right now?

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.090
So I know several of you, but
could you just raise a hand

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.010
if you're a faculty member?

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.500
Wonderful.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.927
And if you just call
out what departments

00:06:36.927 --> 00:06:38.010
or what schools you're at?

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.880
Medical school.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.420
Medical?

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.350
Sociology.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.220
Sociology?

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.650
Romance languages
and anthropology.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.720
What a great thing.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.682
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:48.390
OK, so we've got quite
a diversity there.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.020
What about students?

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.930
Wonderful And the people
who actually work on online

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.640
learning sort of in a
staff capacity in some way?

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.190
[LAUGHS] Trying to decide
if you wear two hats?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.270
And let me hear from the folks
who haven't raised their hands.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.960
Raise your hand so
I know who you are.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.310
And just tell me about--

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.760
well, I know who you
are-- yeah, I know you.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.910
What are you involved with?

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.820
I'm in the library.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.343
Library, OK.

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:23.770
SLATE at the Kennedy School--

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.270
Yes.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.944
My Alma mater.

00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:27.150
I'm at the Bok Center.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.821
Bok Center, of course.

00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:31.910
I'm in basic planning
of the school resources.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.710
Wow!

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.770
That's really cool.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.262
I really care about that.

00:07:36.262 --> 00:07:40.060
[LAUGHS] And then over
here, who do we have?

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.320
I'm from the library.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.020
Library.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.800
We have a library in
the back as well, right?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.420
No.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.628
Yeah, right there in the red.

00:07:46.628 --> 00:07:47.720
Yeah.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.230
OK.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.320
All right, anyway, great
to have you all here.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.660
So I would like
for you right now--

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.960
we're going to be using these
sticky notes in a few ways.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.250
One is just write down on
one the word "why," and then

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.460
your why for why you
came here at 11 o'clock

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.790
in mid-December on
a beautiful day.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.391
Let's start with that.

00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:13.890
OK.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.680
And then as you sort of
finish your sentence,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.490
if you could just turn to
one other person and share

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.990
your why's with one
another, and I'm

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.720
going to come around
and eavesdrop.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.430
So I thought I would start
with my why, which is actually

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.730
the why about me
doing the work I do,

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.130
because the things we're
going to be talking

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.970
about today in
terms of how to have

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.610
online and residential courses.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.890
That's just sort of
how you make it happen,

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.152
but I'm animated
by the reason why

00:08:44.152 --> 00:08:45.610
I get into this in
the first place,

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.790
and I'm going to be dropping
on the golden circle

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.690
that Simon Sinek put
out in his TED talk.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.780
Anybody familiar with
Sinek's Start With Why?

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.720
I recommend it if you've
got an extra 15 minutes.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.020
So the idea is people
want to know why first,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.960
after that you
can tell them how,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.460
and then you tell them what.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.830
So that's the order in
which I approach my work.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.380
So this guy's face kind
of captures my why.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.720
So I believe that every single
kid in the US and in the world

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.140
deserves to be held to
really high expectations

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.160
for their learning.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.910
No matter what their
background/demography is,

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.430
every single kid
is worthy of that,

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.000
and in terms of from an
educational standpoint,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.810
that means every kid
should be able to have

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.230
a really rich learning
environment that allows them

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.520
to sort of grow and develop.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.040
So that's my why.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.280
My how, I actually don't get
to hang out with this guy.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.770
Looking at Sarah, because
she was down filming him

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:56.950
when we first made the movie
in Delaware several years ago,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.010
but we spent a lot more
time talking to the folks

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.780
that sort of underlie this
kid's learning and all kids'

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.280
learning.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.650
What we have here is
the fourth grade team

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.850
at Leasure Elementary School.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.540
Is Principal Deirdra,
assistant principal at the end,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.370
and these are the
four grade teachers,

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.500
and they're working together.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.800
Deirdra just sets aside her
Thursday and boom, boom, boom,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.680
meets with each grade level
team to talk about the data

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.600
from that grade
level and how they're

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.030
going to use it to
improve instruction.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.120
And I believe that each
one of those people

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.660
also deserves to be held
to really high expectations

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.967
for what they can learn.

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:35.050
Just because they became
a teacher or a principal,

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.420
doesn't mean there's lots
of room for improvement.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.970
And in particular,
high expectations

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.680
for how much they
can learn about how

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.820
to work with one another.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.730
And so that's sort of where
a lot of my effort is spent.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.390
And then the how is Data Wise,
which is the word we give

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:57.730
for the eight-step improvement
model that was developed with

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.190
faculty members, teachers,
principals from the Boston

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.370
Public Schools all got together
right in the wake of No Child

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.270
Left Behind, which was a piece
of legislation that made it

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.785
very imperative for
people to test kids a lot,

00:11:09.785 --> 00:11:11.660
and we got people together
to say, all right,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.660
if we're going to be
doing all this testing,

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.822
what would be the
high road of taking--

00:11:15.822 --> 00:11:18.280
that you could take to use that
data to improve instruction

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.250
without just trying to game
the system or, you know,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.160
bump a couple of kids up so that
your school got out of trouble?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.090
So Data Wise is our what.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.340
And if I had to sum
it up in six words,

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.750
it's about educators
collaborating so ALL--

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.330
very big, there, it's
not just for some--

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.520
ALL students thrive.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.640
And that's not all students
get great test scores.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.500
We're talking about
thriving as we

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.080
would want for any of our kids.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.240
So I'm not going to spend
much time on the what

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.760
because you guys are here
to hear more about the how,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.970
but I feel like in order
to understand what we did,

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.310
it's at least important
to know that when we got

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.740
that group of principals,
faculty, teachers

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.890
together, after two
years, we figured out

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.800
that what excellent
teachers did was

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.890
they went through a
very deliberate process

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.500
where they organized for
collaborative work, made sure

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.380
they had time and norms for
really effective working

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.250
together.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.680
They built literacy around
the kinds of assessments

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.471
that they were going
to be using and didn't

00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:22.350
assume everybody knew how to
interpret those tests just

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.100
because they were
working in the building.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.200
They created a
data overview that

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.360
sort of created a
sense of urgency

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.350
and showed people visually why
there was a need to improve.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.880
And then, instead of going--

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.160
typically, what a
lot of schools were

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.710
doing was going straight from
that overview data to boom,

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.670
we better reteach the
items people did poorly

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.560
on and get straight to action.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.200
But the schools didn't do
that, they went deeper.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.840
They didn't use the
high stakes test data

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.750
to figure out what was--

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.360
to answer the question of
where kids were struggling,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.830
they used it as a
jumping off point

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.190
to really dig into student
data, lots of different things--

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.092
conversations with
students, understand

00:13:02.092 --> 00:13:03.550
what was the student
learning issue

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.290
that needed to be
addressed, then they

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.270
turned the mirror on themselves,
examined their own practice,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.910
and then they went to action.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:12.370
And so that slowing
down of the process

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.250
allows, first of all, to really
pay attention to all kids.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.700
It also means bringing
in all voices of faculty

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.130
in the room to sort of
be deliberately going

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.095
through this process.

00:13:22.095 --> 00:13:23.470
Then you have an
action plan, you

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.470
plan how you're going to assess
it, act and assess and perhaps

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.100
go around.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.920
So that's the thing that
I'm trying to teach people.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.570
Does that makes sense?

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.190
All right.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.750
And the way that we share this,
first of all, was our book.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:43.510
So as Christina knows well,
this book came out in 2005,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.800
and it has been the--

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.600
starting then, it
became something

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.030
that I was actually surprised at
how quickly it gained traction,

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.300
but it showed you how
to go through each

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.020
of those steps, a
chapter per step.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.740
All right.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.437
So your task as we go from
here on is to keep track--

00:14:03.437 --> 00:14:05.770
and I recommend you sort of
take three stickies in front

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.370
of yourselves and put
a header on each one.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.910
So one sticky for insights
that might come up

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.490
as we're talking today.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:19.090
One for worries, because kind
of some of the stuff we did

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.929
was a little bit risky, and if
you try to think about your why

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:24.970
and what you're trying to
get out of coming here,

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.420
what I'm saying kind
of makes you nervous.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.000
And then your last sticky
can be your questions,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.670
and we're going to have a
chance to sort of share these

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.180
in a little while.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.730
OK, so at the time
that I first dipped

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.450
my toes into online
learning, it was only 2014--

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.550
I feel like it's been a
way of life for a while,

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.600
but in 2014, what we had
was this wonderful book,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.630
and we had a way
to teach people how

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.670
to launch that
process that I just

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.216
described in their settings.

00:14:56.216 --> 00:14:57.340
And we did it in two ways--

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.890
I had a degree
program course, which

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.080
was sort of a J-term module.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.910
Intensive, I get
a bunch of people

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.480
into a big room at the
Ed School and figure out

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.280
over the course of
a week how to get

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.860
them ready to bring this
process to someone else.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.100
And then I had a Professional
Ed course in June

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.900
where we brought
teachers and principals

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.000
from around the world,
they came together

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.590
and they learned
how to launch it.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.690
And we were actually
quite satisfied

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.170
with this particular world,
except there were a couple

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.840
of things that we wanted to do.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:35.650
So our one goal was we wanted to
really deepen the way that Data

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.160
Wise was being taught.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.080
And so that week felt so short
that I had people's attention

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.450
for, and I thought, what if we
could do more during that week?

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.830
What if we could make sure
that people really understood

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.310
Data Wise before they
went out in the world

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.640
and started to share it?

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.380
And then the other thing
I wanted to do was to--

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.630
oh, and so as part
of that, I wanted

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.730
to be able to start those
weeks with like hitting

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.600
the ground running.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.600
I wanted to have
students be invested

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.790
and I've done some
pre-thinking about how--

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.280
what I was going to
teach affected them.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.310
And I wanted to have free time,
the class time for the deeper

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.876
work.

00:16:13.876 --> 00:16:15.250
The other thing
I wanted to do is

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.860
I wanted to spread things
out, because I did the math

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.530
and I realized that
if I had about 50,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.920
60 people in my
January term class,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.100
and then 100-plus
in my summer class,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.780
that was going to be 160 people
a year that I was reaching.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.530
And I thought, what if I
empowered those 160 people

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.330
after they had been in my care?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.460
What if they could
then have something

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.990
to share back in their setting?

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.150
So that was my sense of spread.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.610
And also, just the folks
that can't come to Harvard

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.550
or that we didn't have access,
how can we create something

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.920
that got them interested too?

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.980
So the hope there was that
I could equip my students

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.950
to freely, because I didn't
really want to be a big

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.920
marketer for having them like,
you've got to come to Harvard

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.040
to take this class,
easily and then really--

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.359
important is this one--

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.200
faithfully shared.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.260
Because I was getting a little
afraid of a potential game

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.510
of telephone that might
be happening in the world

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.030
where I would describe
what Data Wise was,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.160
and then when somebody else
want to describe it elsewhere,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.720
that maybe something
would be lost,

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.170
and I was really worried that
the thing that would be lost

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.880
was my why.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.550
Because it would be just
an easy thing for people

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.369
to say, oh, here's a way
to do data because it's

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.005
important to do data.

00:17:29.005 --> 00:17:31.690
And that is not
compelling, right?

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.180
I wanted to make sure
people heard from me

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.100
that the reason why we
were looking at data

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.040
is because it was going to let
us shine a light on what kids

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.950
were learning and not learning
and figure out how to work

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.760
together to address that.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:50.170
So I decided to jump in and
make a MOOC with HarvardX

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.110
So here's a little
screenshot from the MOOC.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.540
It was pretty quickly
we decided that it

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.020
was so obvious we needed one
module for each of those steps,

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.780
so that was kind of like
the organizing feature.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.470
And then I realized I really
wanted it to be self-paced.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.780
At the time that
we made our MOOC,

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.390
it was a little bit less common
to have a self-paced MOOC,

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.950
but I thought,
this is going to be

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.960
busy teachers and
grad students, I

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.780
don't want to presume that I
knew exactly the pacing they

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.860
want this content.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.160
And I knew I wanted it to
be no more than eight hours,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.500
because I wanted them to
get through the whole thing

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.680
and not get kind of
bogged down anywhere.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.320
So I was like, eight hours?

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.290
That's one crazy day, one
Sunday in your pajamas!

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.540
Just take the MOOC and
get it under your belt.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.140
Or that's, you know, a couple
of months of every Monday

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.290
maybe watching it with
your faculty meeting group.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.990
Just an hour together
to get through it,

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.010
it seemed like that
was the right size.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.830
And so that was one of our
first thoughts was like, when

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.010
we're talking about going
online, what do we mean

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.760
and what scale?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.060
And it was so liberating to
realize, that was my call.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.400
And I have never
looked back from having

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.670
it be a rather small piece.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.930
And sort of another piece
of that was the book

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.350
has such richness.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.880
It's like 250 pages, all
these details about how you

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.590
would actually implement this.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:13.610
And I didn't want this to
just be sort of something that

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.380
could substitute for the book.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.100
I wanted it to be something that
brought people in and made them

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.400
just on fire to
read all 250 pages,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.830
and I thought it would be
super clear, if this is just

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.740
an eight-hour experience,
that those aren't substitutes

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.570
for one another, so
it's kind of like a reel

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.210
them in kind of thing.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.030
So the structure of
our eight modules

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.170
were, we would give people
content about the step--

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.400
whoops-- then we would have
them do a self-assessment,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.410
and then we would have
them do some practice.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.220
From a content standpoint,
they got to see sort of me

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.700
and my animated swoosh, which
is what we call that arrow,

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.930
and I would explain what
are all the key tasks

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.650
at this particular step and
I would try to do so in as,

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.870
you know, compelling
way as I could,

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.800
making the sort of humdrum
stuff seem excited.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.770
But what helped was
right after that,

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.610
they got into seeing an
actual school doing the work.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.106
And so because we had
filmed down at a school,

00:20:13.106 --> 00:20:14.480
they could sort
of pair that, oh,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.730
what is the step about
with how does that

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.560
look in a school setting?

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.699
And then they would
have self-assessments

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:22.490
that they would do
after watching those two

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.020
videos to kind of test
their understanding.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.110
Here's a picture of the
latter inference, which

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.570
is one of the mental models
that's been enormously

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.060
important in Data Wise.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.410
And this kind of
assessment I really

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.540
like, because what they needed
to do was take these statements

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.290
and then say, which rung
of the ladder they were on,

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.810
it was kind of like a
drag-and-drop sort of thing,

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.170
just to try to get people
to have one of our most

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.710
important mental models be
something they already knew

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:50.270
when I first met them in class.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.780
The other thing that they needed
to do is a self-assessment.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.300
And so the self-assessment
was actually

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.110
based on an activity that had
been what I thought wildly

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.270
successful in my
in-person courses,

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.130
where I would pass out a
handout that looks like this,

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.870
and I would give everybody
all these colored dots.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.690
And in sort of great
detail, I would

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.490
go through each of
the Data Wise steps.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.100
It only took like 50
minutes, and people

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.670
were putting stickers to say
whether it was happening or not

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.920
happening in their setting,
then they would get up,

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.680
they'd go talk to other
people, share their dots,

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.650
and it kind of got
people to realize, wow,

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.670
some of this stuff we
were already doing,

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.800
so we've got strengths
we can build on.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.470
And now I understand
why we're not

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.534
making progress, because there
are spots along this arrow--

00:21:39.534 --> 00:21:41.450
it was always different
for different people--

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.033
where we're kind of
dead in the water.

00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:45.380
So that in-person
activity I wanted

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.950
to have to somehow mimic
that in the online space.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.670
So what we ended up doing with
enormous help from our teaching

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.060
and learning lab
and HarvardX folks

00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.470
was to give a self-assessment
that in the end ended up

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.090
sort of when you finished
your eight-hour course,

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.110
you had this lit up
swoosh that showed you

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.510
where you were with the steps.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.940
And what was nice--
and I hadn't expected--

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.760
with the MOOC is, I
didn't make people

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.450
put 32 different stickers
down, because that seemed

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.400
like overkill, so
we did one per step,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.680
but within, say,
step one, there's

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.720
a lot of things you
need to do, and they

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.300
were able to be very specific
about which of those they're

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.160
doing and not
doing, which allowed

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.470
us to have orange and
things that didn't

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.890
exist in my in-person piece.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.110
But what was fabulous
about this is

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.860
I required the eight-hour course
for my residential students.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.510
Like, get it done, show up
with a printout of your arrow--

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:44.885
or some of them,
you know, had it

00:22:44.885 --> 00:22:48.170
on their phones or whatever--
and be ready to go,

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.230
which meant that the whole
morning of my first class

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.050
was sort of done for
me when we showed up.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.200
And they were walking around
looking at each other's arrows,

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.080
which were much more nuanced
than the paper ones I had used,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.600
and before we even
hit lunchtime,

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.790
people were talking
about how what we

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.730
were about to learn that
week connected to them,

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.460
and I feel like that got
a level of investment

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.810
in our group that was
particularly powerful.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.320
From a practice standpoint,
there's a lot of things

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.580
that we do in Data Wise that
get people to really hold

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.020
themselves back from
making inferences that

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.700
aren't supported by evidence.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.650
And so one of the
things we do is

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:32.430
try to get people used to saying
some incredibly obvious things

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:37.050
about what they see in a piece
of student work or in a chart,

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:41.820
and that took a lot of
class time in my-- the way

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.960
I used to teach.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.906
What we did in the MOOC
was we gave people--

00:23:46.906 --> 00:23:48.780
for each of the steps
we gave them something.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.930
So an essay about an
elephant, perhaps,

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.080
was we what we did at step
four, dig into student data,

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.930
and the people needed
to read it, come up

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.910
with what they noticed
and then wondered,

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.570
and then they got to watch our
team doing a protocol where

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.480
we were noticing and
wondering about the same data,

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.320
and then had sort of an
online discussion about how

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.680
did what they saw
differ from what we saw,

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.900
and what did they
notice about the way

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.280
that our team interacted
with one another?

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.670
And so again, that was another
thing that I actually had--

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.210
I had people practice
doing that in my setting,

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.360
but I had never
like had a fishbowl

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.239
and showed people
what a sort of-- we

00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:32.280
kind of call it like a
low inference conversation

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.870
would look like, and
this meant people

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.910
got to show up in my
class already knowing

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.270
what I meant about that.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.500
So that was very
much around trying

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.410
to deepen so that the
people who came to my class

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:52.080
would have a really good
sense of what the process was

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.720
and why it mattered to them
before we even got started.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.420
What's been wonderful
is I freed up hours

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.460
that now I can use
for whatever I want,

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.550
and one of the biggest
important pieces that we're

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.370
using that time for
is helping people

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:10.140
to understand their why
behind why they do this work,

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.390
and understand
how to communicate

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.750
to others the importance
of pursuing equity

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.400
in the educational context.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.440
And that had been
kind of a nice-to-have

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.570
that I wished I could
have done more of,

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.270
and instead, that much
more nuanced conversation

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:28.710
can happen in-person with all
the folks that are with us.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.530
But in terms of spread, I
want to talk a little bit

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.990
about what happened
with equipping students.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:40.380
So this is-- what happened is
that people did end up sharing

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.270
this with their settings.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.400
Of course, HarvardX
did an amazing job

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.170
of trumpeting that
the course existed,

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.530
so very quickly I realized
that we were going way

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:52.180
beyond my residential numbers.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.030
So that's around the US.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.400
Around the world we've
had 20,000 enrolled,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:03.310
so the spread is way beyond what
my 160 times however many years

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:04.710
it was going to be.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.720
And you know, lots of
different countries

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.360
represented, I would say outside
of English-speaking countries,

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.400
we've got a lot of
Spanish-speaking countries

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.370
as well and Brazil.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.420
And so that's sort of
giving me a sense of,

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.350
wow, this content
is now out there.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.850
And we've also
been able to think

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.240
about how does the
MOOC sort of fit

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.990
into what used to be sort
of the Data Wise world

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.000
here of, like, we've
got these two courses

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.050
and we've got a book.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:38.010
So what we're able to do is
to back up from our launching

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.720
and have an
opportunity for people

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.020
to explore what Data Wise
is about and to self-assess,

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.780
and that sort of-- the MOOC
sort of gave this pre thing,

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.970
but it also enabled me to
go beyond where I had been.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:55.200
So we also have a course
now in my professional ed

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.652
for integrating Data Wise,
which is because I now

00:26:58.652 --> 00:27:00.360
feel comfortable that
when people go back

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.300
to their settings, they've
got sort of like, you know,

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.640
from the horse's mouth
what Data Wise is about.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.830
And they can share it, we
have a four-month course

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.510
where we have virtual
coaches to help

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.960
people to actually integrate
Data Wise in their setting.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.780
And then in order to
do that, we needed

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.360
to develop coaching
cadre, so we now

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.630
have certified Data Wise
coaches that definitely spend

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.640
some time with me
on campus, but they

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.927
become people who
are either coaching

00:27:25.927 --> 00:27:27.510
Data Wise in their
settings or they're

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:33.250
helping with the online
coaching that happens.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.640
And so we have a coach module
for degree program students

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.700
who want to become coaches
or certification people,

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.800
and now we've got a network.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.910
And so we have a research
practicum course that basically

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.790
reaches back out to the people
who are doing this in the field

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.190
and has our doctoral
students sort of studying

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.357
them and figuring out,
how do we feed back?

00:27:52.357 --> 00:27:54.690
How this is being received
in the world, into what we're

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.690
doing, and then
the people can be

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.430
in a Data Wise coach
network who take

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.230
our more elaborate courses.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.960
So I don't want to-- it's
not actually the case

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.150
that if you make a MOOC,
all of this will happen.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.600
So I don't want you
to think that that's

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.670
what I'm trying to say, but it
made the possibility so real,

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:17.490
because we knew there
was a way to get this

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.584
in the hands of lots of people.

00:28:21.584 --> 00:28:23.750
So I'm going to tell you
about a couple of surprises

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.260
and then let you
guys sort of think

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.450
how this is landing for you.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.050
One thing was, there was this
word that HarvardX was saying

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.180
a lot, and I think
HILT was talking a lot

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.650
about repurposing of assets.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.500
I know TLL was talking
about it at school,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.690
but it's been really
interesting to me

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:42.010
how I can use this
in different places.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.240
So I built it as eight hours
before they even show up.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.670
But now in other classes
that I'm teaching,

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.760
or if I'm teaching say a
three-hour workshop either here

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.195
or somewhere else, I can click
into any one of these videos.

00:28:54.195 --> 00:28:57.840
So I just made a kind of
a cheat sheet for myself,

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.400
and if I wanted
to show, what does

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.060
looking at-- examining your own
practice at the Delaware School

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.950
look like, I can click
into that and I've

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.680
got a five-minute video that I
can share with a large audience

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.360
and explain what I mean.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.900
So that's been really useful
to have those little pieces.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.800
The version 3.0, I didn't
know that we were going

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.510
to be able to
continuously improve,

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.990
of course, on continuous
improvement, but we have.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:25.217
And as Sarah mentioned,
I was all excited

00:29:25.217 --> 00:29:27.300
that we were able to show
what it looked like when

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.340
this was happening in a school.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.050
Sarah was down for
finding out, what

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.430
does it look like
if this happens

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.040
in a district of 208 schools?

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.320
And so now we've got
that added to the MOOC

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.760
as for people who have more
of a system level hat on.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.340
Discussion forum blues.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:49.950
I want to say that I pictured
there would be more rich

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.880
back-and-forth conversations
among people on the platform

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.540
than there were, and
I think that there--

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.870
I would say that the actual
platform hasn't caught up

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:04.950
with our imaginations about how
we could get people to interact

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:07.860
in a self-paced course
across space and time,

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.360
but I'm hoping
there'll be a version

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.310
4.0 where that can happen.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:16.110
And then I also was sort
of surprised in some way,

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:20.880
pleasantly in some way not
about the book-MOOC trade-off.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.390
So the pleasant thing is just
checked in with Christina,

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:27.210
and she says that, this has not
cannibalize sales of our book.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.010
Book sales are
still super strong.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.600
The less pleasant thing
is in my course emails,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.774
I sometimes have
students saying,

00:30:37.774 --> 00:30:39.690
it seemed like you made
us take the whole MOOC

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.898
and then you made us read
the whole book and that was

00:30:41.898 --> 00:30:42.640
sort of a lot.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.026
And I worry because
they say, you

00:30:46.026 --> 00:30:48.150
know, I think just the MOOC
would have been enough,

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:51.270
And that was my
fear, was that this

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.310
would turn into some
watered-down Data

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.019
Wise, where in
eight hours people

00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:56.310
could think they were doing it.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.650
So that's kind of a thing
that I've got to think about

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.560
and I wonder if that's a
concern for some of you

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.260
about when you put your
information out there,

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.710
are people going to want sort
of like this 21st century

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.710
Twitter-sized version
of what you're doing?

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:16.380
But mercifully the book sales
are still holding strong.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.030
So I don't know
if people have had

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.770
a chance-- yes,
nicely done, I see

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.650
there's been some writing
of insights, worries,

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:23.670
and questions.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.310
I'm going to give you sort
of just two minutes of silent

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:29.340
think time to sort of look
through your worries and stuff

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.640
and then give you a
chance to sort of get up

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.600
at the boards in small groups
and kind of talk about that.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.000
So two minutes to
just figure out

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.830
what you're going
to want to hash out

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.220
about what you just heard.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:44.720
--activity.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.892
These very Data Wise
people sort of up and them

00:31:48.892 --> 00:31:50.725
and adding to conversation
around materials,

00:31:50.725 --> 00:31:53.340
so I appreciate you
testing that out.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.180
What it does it it
guarantees that I

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.010
know there's questions
from the room now, right?

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:01.544
So I would love to hear from--

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.125
what is on your mind?

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.850
I just have a fairly basic
question about Data Wise

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.840
and less about MOOC-book course.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.070
To what extent is your Data
Wise model used and focused

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.800
primarily on K-12
versus higher ed?

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.680
And if there are higher
ed uses, what are they?

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.570
That may be off-topic for
this particular session, so--

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.245
OK, I'll give a
short answer to that

00:32:35.245 --> 00:32:36.370
and we can talk more after.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.490
So yes, so higher ed is also--

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.220
there's nothing about
those eight steps

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.860
that makes it have to be K-12.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.830
We started it with K-12 but
the take-up we're having is

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:51.280
among especially teacher
preparation programs

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.750
that want to know
how to get better

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.290
at teaching their educators
because they're sort

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.090
of in this particular world.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:01.810
But even within the Harvard
Graduate School of Education,

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:03.250
there's certain
pockets of things

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.710
where we're kind of taking
this eight-step approach

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:06.820
to our work.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.700
So let let's talk more about
what you might have in mind.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.754
The process is very
generic, as you can see,

00:33:11.754 --> 00:33:12.670
so it's easy to apply.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.260
The microphone please.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.150
I'm just curious about
it, because your project

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.460
seems to be about
assessment, so how do you

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.310
assess the people who
take the book course?

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.860
Whether they actually
faithfully implement

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.100
the principles or the
approach that you advocate?

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.820
So whether they implemented
it in their own schools

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.450
and settings?

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:40.950
Right.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.990
So for example, do they need to
submit something to you so you

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.400
can interpret or--

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.780
basically I'm just
wondering, how

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.550
do you make sure that your
message or-- yeah, the approach

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.560
got implemented faithfully?

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.700
I don't.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.872
I don't, and I just--

00:33:55.872 --> 00:33:57.580
I feel like I have to
put that out there.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.790
If you're going to do an
eight-hour introduction course,

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.940
the thing I can assess
for, which I do, is,

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.750
do you understand--

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.320
are people understanding
the importance

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.360
of making low
inference observations,

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.359
and are they capable
of distinguishing

00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:14.650
between a low inference and
a high inference statement?

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.120
That I can assess for.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.500
I can assess for, are
they able to see a team

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.780
and understand the
particular moves that people

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.810
within that group are making to
make sure all voices get heard?

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.550
Those kinds of things
I can assess for,

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:31.480
but I have no idea how people
are doing in the world.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.429
And the thing that makes
me feel OK about that

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.980
is, when I was
only selling books,

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.190
I had no idea what people were
doing with the books either.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.900
So you do have to be at
peace that it's like--

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:47.110
that it's part of what you do,
but that sort of elaborate set

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.500
of courses, when we're at the
level of when I'm certifying

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:55.570
a coach, oh yeah, they submit
a 30-page report that explains

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.750
how did they do it in their
setting, what did they do?

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.220
But for a MOOC, it's like--

00:35:03.088 --> 00:35:04.050
Yes?

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:07.210
Back, just grab the
microphone yeah.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:11.770
My question is about how long
it took you to create this?

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:14.350
The videos?

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.860
You have the equipment, what
was the process for that?

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.290
I mean, I just have to
take a moment to just say,

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.260
HarvardX was extraordinary
to work with.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.790
Like something like equipment?

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.800
I don't know.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.290
Something like, you know,
what's the filming schedule

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:30.790
that's happening in Delaware?

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.210
Like, I went down and did a
scouting to sort of figure

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.860
out what's the story
we needed to tell,

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.290
and then Sarah and her team
went down and actually made

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.080
it happen on-site.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.470
So Sarah, from the very
beginning that we started,

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:49.840
we had a few ideas
I think in, like--

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.130
was it 12 months total
to get the first one out?

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.310
That sounds about right.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:58.090
Maybe 18 if we start with ideas.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.690
Mm, yeah, 12-to-18, depending
on when we first met.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:05.272
Early 2014 and we launched
in spring of 2015.

00:36:05.272 --> 00:36:06.538
No.

00:36:06.538 --> 00:36:08.441
Is that right?

00:36:08.441 --> 00:36:08.940
Yeah.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.020
Yeah.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.310
So I think--

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:11.890
Yeah.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:12.390
It was.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.970
Yeah, It was a little
bit over a year.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.470
And there were
moments where it took

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.170
an unbelievable
amount of my time,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.120
so I'm just going
to tell you that.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.700
Like, when I had to-- so
for a five-minute video,

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.260
I would be in the studio for
like two hours getting the five

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.120
minutes that I had to say.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.850
And just because of
the way I'm oriented,

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.210
I wanted to see like the
rough cut of the video

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.670
and have something to say
about how things were done.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.590
I wanted to talk
about, like, what

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.140
were going to be the racial
backgrounds of the people

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.395
that the artist drew to
have-- doing Data Wise when

00:36:46.395 --> 00:36:48.270
I was talking about it,
you know what I mean?

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.220
So a part of it
has to do with how

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.010
involved you want
to be in the work,

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:57.090
but there are moments where
it felt like it was a lot.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.360
This is very inspiring.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.700
I'm in the process of
preparing a new course, which

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.720
is a service learning
course here at Harvard.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.700
I'm working on a short
pre-recording lectures,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.220
which I'm doing very simply
over campus just to have--

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.290
just to save some time,

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:16.930
Yes.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.200
As you do as well.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.020
My question to you
is, if you were

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.170
in my role, what would you--

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:26.770
is it anything that you could
advise me to think about

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.080
as I'm running my course
for the first time

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:33.130
if I would in the future like
to prepare it into the MOOC?

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:36.010
So I am thinking about
the prerecorded lectures.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:38.650
I'm hoping that maybe
part of the class activity

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.420
could be recorded as
well, because it's

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.970
going to be very engaging
students with their own roles

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.042
and presentations.

00:37:45.042 --> 00:37:46.750
So that I could create
something like you

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:47.833
did with the case studies.

00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:48.470
Yes!

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.500
So I'm just asking you,
is there anything else

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.980
that you think that I should
have in mind if in the future

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.910
I would like to turn
this course into a MOOC?

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.925
As I'm for the first
time running the course,

00:37:58.925 --> 00:38:00.850
if there are other
things that I can already

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:02.890
set the wheels in motion
that would help me

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.660
later on in the way?

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.510
Yeah, I would say that the
two things that leap to mind

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:11.500
are sort of paying
attention to what

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:17.050
are the deep understandings
that you want people to have,

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:20.440
and being clear
about what you think

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.890
could be conveyed not
necessarily through experience.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.016
So I feel like trying right--

00:38:28.016 --> 00:38:29.890
at the beginning of this
course to figure out

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.140
what those are, and then
looking back and figuring out

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.100
that's what they were.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.600
But then the other
thing I would say

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.960
is, think about what are your
most successful in-person

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.370
experiences and what
makes them successful?

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.959
So at first when I started
talking about this, I'm like,

00:38:42.959 --> 00:38:44.500
well, you know,
we're not going to be

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.630
able to do my favorite
stoplight protocol,

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.270
that's not going to
work online, or I

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:51.520
don't know how we're going
to get people to understand

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.530
the ladder of inference
because, you know,

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:56.420
I need that to be a very
kind of physical thing.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.230
And it's amazing-- if you've got
a great instructional designer

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.820
working with you and if
you can talk about what

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.630
do you do that's crazy
successful in your class that

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.400
gets people, you know, either
excited or really engaged,

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.460
a great instructional designer
will help you kind of pull out

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.890
how to make that more virtual.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:18.870
So don't fear that you
have to give it all up.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.820
You were talking
about having the PhD

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.800
student to go back
to the settings

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.430
and do assessment
and give feedback.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:32.660
My question is, how
do we make sure,

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:38.770
like, we give timely
feedback when the teachers

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:42.580
or implementers have questions
that need to be addressed

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.790
in a short time?

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:45.640
What do we do?

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.850
Or do they approach you?

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:50.170
So it's interesting.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.290
The settings where
people are going--

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.110
where I'm sending my
doctoral students to,

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:59.230
either virtually or in-person
see what's happening someplace,

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.574
those are places that
went way beyond the MOOC.

00:40:01.574 --> 00:40:03.490
So there are places that
started with the MOOC

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.950
but then sent a team
of teachers up here

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.200
and then took a
four-month virtual course,

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.340
and it was in that
four-month virtual course

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.920
that most of the
feedback happened.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.170
And so what was
really important was

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.590
to standardize the
format in which they

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.510
told their stories of what
was happening in the field.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.150
So we have this thing that's--

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.700
we call it a Data Wise
journey, but essentially it's

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.350
a PowerPoint deck that has
sort of that swoosh arrow,

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.960
and then for step one it
says, what did you do?

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.030
What's the evidence
of what happened?

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.470
What do you reflect on it?

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:39.070
And we have our
virtual TFs, they're

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:42.640
looking through those journeys
and providing feedback

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.850
as each step unfolds
about what did you do,

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.280
what is the evidence
and how it goes.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.920
Because otherwise it was just
too overwhelming to think,

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.160
like, you know, we're trying to
improve in our 2,000-kid high

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.687
school and are we
doing a good job?

00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:58.940
Like, I don't know.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.690
So you have to sort
of put it on the site

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:06.880
to give you information in a
way that your trained people are

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.660
prepared to give the feedback
that will move them along.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.910
But to me, that's
very much a question

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.220
about my four-month
online course

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.620
that people do
have to pay for has

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.410
a much different model
in terms of the feedback,

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:23.650
but it draws on the MOOC--
it couldn't actually

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.420
happen if we didn't
have the MOOC

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.180
because I need all
that content somewhere,

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.090
and then I could really use
Brainspace to think about,

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.850
and then what is our feedback
model look like when people are

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.774
willing and able
to pay to receive

00:41:35.774 --> 00:41:36.940
that feedback from our team?

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:47.610
I feel like I'm at the Oscars
every time I hold one of these.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:51.050
So I love the breadth
you were talking about.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:55.200
You know, scale and people
bringing back the learning

00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.550
to their communities and sharing
out the experience via the MOOC

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.010
to some degree.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:07.230
Do you qualify those that sort
of additional sort of ring

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.126
of attendees, if you will?

00:42:09.126 --> 00:42:10.500
That people who
have not attended

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.090
on-campus or
participated specifically

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:17.370
in enrollment for
a non-site course?

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:20.790
But those people who go
back to their districts

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.580
and share it out with
people, is there something

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.060
as just sort of
functional as the login

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.660
having to be an edu
address or having--

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.740
I guess that wouldn't make
sense in K through 12,

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.720
but whatever the equivalent is.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.220
So--

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.860
So you mean do I restrict
who can take the MOOC?

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.040
Yes, is there any
gate-keeping, especially

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.200
even since you have
a forum in terms

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.740
of managing that community?

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.340
One of the ways to do that
is by having your requirement

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:53.938
for signing up, you
know, you must be

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:56.780
and administrator,
or you must be,

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.570
you know, a K
through 12 teacher.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.790
No we don't, and we
made our mistakes.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.590
It's just anybody
who wants to take it.

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:05.260
We do have sort of
light facilitation

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.930
where if somebody were saying
something really offensive,

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:09.180
that would be caught, right?

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.100
So that's not happening.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.736
But it was really
important to keep it wide,

00:43:14.736 --> 00:43:16.360
and what was interesting
was, I sort of

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.734
thought we made
it for educators,

00:43:17.734 --> 00:43:20.410
but you hear people who work in
all levels of different kinds

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.270
of government that
might just want to know

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.040
how to look at data better.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.520
The international participation
has been fascinating,

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.940
like to see who is
drawn to the course,

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.940
and I think if I had had
any gate-keeping on it,

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.523
I might be keeping
people out who seem

00:43:35.523 --> 00:43:37.810
to be getting a lot out of it.

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:40.100
We're at noon, Erin!

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:40.901
We're at noon.

00:43:40.901 --> 00:43:41.400
The time?

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.909
Yeah.

00:43:42.909 --> 00:43:44.950
I can't believe how much
you packed in this hour.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:48.059
[LAUGHTER] That was
really impressive to me,

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:49.850
and I want to thank
you all for being here.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.840
I want to thank Kathy--
yes, for helping--

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.190
[APPLAUSE]
