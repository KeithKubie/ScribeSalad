00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:08.410
In no other age can so many people have harboured
such intense ambitions to become writers.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.789
The longing one day to turn out a book – probably
a novel or, less likely, an autobiography

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:20.090
– lies close to the center of contemporary
aspirations. This is – at one level – a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.780
hugely welcome development, a consequence
of widespread literacy, higher educational

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.770
standards and a proper focus on the power
of books to change lives. But looked at from

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.910
another angle, it may also, in private, be
the result of something rather more desultory:

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.940
an epidemic of isolation and loneliness. The
army of literary agents, scouts, editors and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.460
writing coaches testifies not only to our
love of literature, but also, less intentionally,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.530
to an unaddressed groundswell of painful solitude.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.350
Reasons for wanting to write are multiple

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.700
of course, but the structurally simplest option
may also be the most pervasive: we write because

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.920
there is no one in the vicinity who will listen.
We start to long to set down our memories

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.299
and emotions on a page and to send them out
into the wider world because our friends can’t

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.299
be bothered to hear us, because our partners
are preoccupied and because it’s been agonisingly

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.060
long since anyone gave us an uninterrupted
stretch of time in which we could be attended

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:40.219
to with respect and attention – in short,
because we are very lonely. Writing, for all

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.890
that it might begin with experiences of joy
or disinterested intellectual fascination,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.600
also owes its origins to despair, shame and
a lack of someone to cry with. It is when

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.700
we have screamed a long time for help, and
no one came, that we may begin quietly to

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.159
burn to write a novel instead. Writing can
be the presenting solution to a more poignant

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.830
ambition beneath: to be heard, to be held,
to be respected, to have our feelings interpreted,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.311
and soothed, to be known and appreciated.
Flaubert put it at its simplest: if he had

00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:24.780
been happy in love at eighteen, he would never
have wanted to become a writer.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.360
reading At the start of the West’s journey
into self-awareness, we meet the figure of

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.700
Socrates, who puts forward a striking proposition:
writing is not what thoughtful people should

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.909
ideally be doing with their time, he suggests.
For Socrates, writing is a pale imitation

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:48.060
of and replacement for our true vocation,
which is that of talking to our fellow human

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.480
beings, in the flesh, in real time, often
with a glass of wine on the table, or while

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.380
walking to the harbour or doing some exercise
in the gym, about what really matters. The

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.329
birth of literature is, in the Socratic world
view, simply a symptom of social isolation

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.780
and an indictment of our communities. Related
image Even if we find literature the finest

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.659
of substitutes, infinitely better than anything
else yet invented, it still pays to recognise

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.689
that substitute is what it might primarily
be, that writing is in certain ways an act

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.569
of very polite and artful revenge on a world
too busy to listen and that we would never

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.640
develop such fierce bookish ambitions if we
had not first been let down by those we needed

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.790
so much to rely upon. A slightly more conscious
awareness of writing as compensation may lend

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.290
us energy to acknowledge our unrequited ache
for more visceral forms of contact. Whatever

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.930
the satisfactions of writing alone in bed,
we should perhaps not cease so easily to give

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.170
up on the ecstasies of mutual understanding
and sympathy. It is far from easy to write

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.489
a decent novel; it may be even harder – yet
ultimately more rewarding – to learn to

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.281
locate a circle of true friends. A better
world might, from this perspective, be one

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:20.470
in which we wanted a little less ardently
to be writers – because we had collectively

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.760
grown ever so slightly better at listening
and making ourselves heard. Literature’s

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.960
loss might, in the end, be humanity’s gain.
