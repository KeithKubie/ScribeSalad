00:00:00.207 --> 00:00:01.788
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're gonna come up

00:00:01.788 --> 00:00:03.951
with some strategies for division

00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:06.908
when the quotient isn't a whole number,

00:00:06.908 --> 00:00:08.682
when it's going to be a decimal,

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:12.432
so let's try to compute
three divided by two.

00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.820
Pause the video and see
if you can figure out

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.930
what that is going to be,
and I'll give you a hint,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.140
it's not going to be a whole number.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.709
Alright, now let's try
to work this together.

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:26.488
And like all things in mathematics,

00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:28.619
there's multiple
strategies that you can use

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.036
to try to figure out what
three divided by two is.

00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:35.605
One strategy is, well,
let's just rewrite this

00:00:35.605 --> 00:00:38.317
as a fraction, so three divided by two,

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:40.589
you can write that as,

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.839
you could write that as three over two.

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:51.597
Now, or you could say, this
is the same thing as 3/2.

00:00:51.597 --> 00:00:54.845
But how can we express this as a decimal?

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:57.458
Well, you might recognize that 3/2

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:01.625
is the same thing as 2/2 plus 1/2,

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:04.720
let me write that down.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.550
So this is the same thing
as two plus one over two,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.064
and I'm really doing every step here

00:01:11.064 --> 00:01:13.386
to hopefully make things clear,

00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:16.719
which is the same thing as two over two,

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:20.423
so that's two over two,

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:24.948
plus one over two, plus 1/2.

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:30.047
I could break this up into
two over two plus 1/2.

00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:32.216
Now, two over two is just one,

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:36.486
and so this is going to be equal to 1 1/2.

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:38.468
Now, you might immediately say,

00:01:38.468 --> 00:01:40.787
"Hey, 1/2, I could write that as 5/10,"

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:42.036
and that would be exactly right.

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:45.176
You could just, we don't
wanna spell out every step,

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:47.196
we could say this is equal to one,

00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:49.277
and when we write it in decimal form,

00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:52.696
we express things as tenths
or hundredths or thousandths,

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:56.542
so 1/2 is the same thing as 5/10,

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:58.864
and if we wanna express that as a decimal,

00:01:58.864 --> 00:02:02.447
this would be equal to
one and five tenths.

00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:08.701
Now I did every step here,
as you get more practice,

00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:11.310
you say okay this is
the same thing as 3/2.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.689
3/2, two goes into three one time,

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.067
and there's a 1/2 left over,

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:19.625
so writing this as a
mixed number, it's 1 1/2,

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.792
and 1/2 written as a decimal
is 0.50, so this is 1.50.

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:28.414
Now another way that we
could've thought about this is

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:29.940
"Okay, I'm not getting a whole number,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.850
"when I divide three divided by two.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.512
"Maybe I'll get something
in terms of tenths,

00:02:34.512 --> 00:02:38.921
"so let me express each of
these in terms of tenths."

00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:41.321
So three is how many tenths?

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:43.404
Well, three is 30 tenths,

00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:48.239
and we'd be dividing by two,

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.380
we're gonna be dividing it by two,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.560
so 30 tenths divided by two,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.430
well that's going to
be equal to 15 tenths.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.180
This is equal to 15
tenths, which is equal to

00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:05.360
10 tenths and five tenths, or 1.50.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.261
So both of these are equally
legitimate strategies

00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:13.378
for figuring out what
three divided by two is.

00:03:13.378 --> 00:03:14.699
I like the first one a little bit,

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.099
it leverages what we know about fractions,

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.001
but let's do another example.

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:23.070
Let's do a few more examples, this is fun.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.737
Let's figure out what
34 divided by four is,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.101
and like before, pause this
video and try to figure it out

00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:36.151
and try to see if you can
use some of the strategies

00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:38.734
that we used in the last video.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.762
Alright, so as we just said,

00:03:41.762 --> 00:03:44.182
we can re-express this as a fraction,

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:47.932
this is the same thing
as 34 divided by four,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.710
34 divided by four, or 34/4.

00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:56.611
Now what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:00.001
Well, four goes into 34 eight times,

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:02.172
it's gonna go eight times,

00:04:02.172 --> 00:04:04.370
and you're gonna have two left over,

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.724
so this is eight and 2/4.

00:04:06.724 --> 00:04:09.165
Eight, let me write it both out.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.473
Alright, eight and 2/4,

00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:16.521
let me do that two in
that blue just for fun.

00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:18.521
Eight and two over four,

00:04:21.757 --> 00:04:24.346
8 2/4, so how do I do this again?

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:26.807
I said four goes into 34 eight times,

00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:27.939
and then I have two left over,

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.591
so I'm gonna have 2/4 left over.

00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:31.540
Another way, if you
wanna see all the steps,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.637
you can say, "Hey I can
rewrite this as 32 over four

00:04:35.637 --> 00:04:37.887
"plus two over four."

00:04:37.887 --> 00:04:42.054
The 32 over four is our eight, so 8 2/4.

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.708
Well 2/4, that's the same thing as 1/2.

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:49.578
That's the same thing as 1/2,

00:04:49.578 --> 00:04:52.500
and if we wanna express
that in terms of tenths,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.750
this is equal to eight and,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.031
1/2 is the same thing as 5/10,

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:02.192
8 5/10, which if we wanna
express as a decimal

00:05:02.192 --> 00:05:05.192
is of course eighth and five tenths,

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.222
or 8.50, and we are done.

00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:12.591
Let's do another one of these,

00:05:12.591 --> 00:05:13.880
and actually let's do one of them

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.349
where we're dividing into a decimal,

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.056
where a decimal itself is being divided.

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:23.263
Let's say we wanted to calculate

00:05:23.263 --> 00:05:25.013
8.4 divided by seven.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.569
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.288
When you look at this,
you might immediately say

00:05:35.288 --> 00:05:38.338
well I know 84 is divisible by seven.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.118
We know if you know
your seven times tables,

00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:43.936
we know that seven
times 12 is equal to 84,

00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:47.269
or that 84 divided seven is equal to 12,

00:05:48.655 --> 00:05:51.704
but this isn't 84, this is 8.4,

00:05:51.704 --> 00:05:53.563
so how do we think about it?

00:05:53.563 --> 00:05:56.490
Well one way, we can think
about it in terms of tenths,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.407
8.4 is the same thing as 84 tenths,

00:06:01.432 --> 00:06:04.265
and so 84 tenths divided by seven,

00:06:06.044 --> 00:06:08.273
well 84 of anything divided by seven

00:06:08.273 --> 00:06:10.223
is going to be 12 of that thing,

00:06:10.223 --> 00:06:12.473
so it's gonna be 12 tenths,

00:06:13.555 --> 00:06:17.893
and 12 tenths we can
rewrite as one and 2/10,

00:06:17.893 --> 00:06:19.643
1.20 and we are done,

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:25.444
so this is equal to 1.2.

00:06:25.444 --> 00:06:28.311
Another way that we could
have thought about this

00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:30.422
is we could've said, you know what,

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:33.922
84 tenths is the same thing as 84 over 10.

00:06:35.492 --> 00:06:38.894
If fact, you would read this as 84/10,

00:06:38.894 --> 00:06:41.200
and now you wanna divided this by seven.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.701
So you wanna divide this by
seven, this is the same thing,

00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:46.669
when you divide by something,

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.708
it's the same as multiplying
by the reciprocal,

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:52.125
so it's 84 over ten times 1/7,

00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:58.733
which is equal to, we can
change, let me write it this way.

00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:02.066
This is equal to 84 over 10 times seven,

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:09.164
over ten times seven, and
now we could simplify this.

00:07:09.164 --> 00:07:11.104
If we divide the numerator
and the denominator by seven,

00:07:11.104 --> 00:07:15.637
84 divided by seven is 12,
seven divided by seven is one.

00:07:15.637 --> 00:07:19.358
12 divided by ten, this is
gonna be equal to 12/10,

00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:23.525
which is 1.2, we could write
this as 1 2/10, or 1.2.

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:30.739
Let's do one more example
that's kind of related.

00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:35.609
Let's say we wanna figure out
what seven divided by 70 is.

00:07:35.609 --> 00:07:38.761
Pause this video and try to figure it out.

00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:40.630
Well, we can rewrite this,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.797
as we've been doing, as seven over 70.

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:47.691
Instead of writing it as 70,

00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:50.914
let me write that as seven times ten,

00:07:50.914 --> 00:07:52.072
and what's valuable about this is

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:55.412
we can divide the numerator
and the denominator by seven.

00:07:55.412 --> 00:07:57.412
If we divide the numerator
by seven, we get a one,

00:07:57.412 --> 00:07:58.974
we divide the denominator
by seven, we get a one.

00:07:58.974 --> 00:08:00.001
Remember, we can do the same thing

00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:00.951
to the numerator and the denominator.

00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:02.631
If we multiply or divide
by the same value,

00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:05.750
we're not changing the value
of the actual fraction.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.311
And so you're left with 1/10,

00:08:08.311 --> 00:08:09.951
which if you express it as a decimal,

00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:10.999
you go to the tenths place,

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:13.756
you say I have one of those
tenths, that's one tenth,

00:08:13.756 --> 00:08:16.082
so this is one tenth.

00:08:16.082 --> 00:08:18.381
Another way to think about it is

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:21.053
this is the same thing as,

00:08:21.053 --> 00:08:23.333
and really this is what
we wrote over here,

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:27.500
but you could write this
as seven divided by seven,

00:08:29.297 --> 00:08:33.464
divided by the blue seven,
and then you divide by 10.

00:08:34.675 --> 00:08:36.482
If you're dividing by seven times ten,

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:38.361
actually let me write that down.

00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:41.528
If you're dividing by seven times ten,

00:08:42.695 --> 00:08:44.445
and this essentially
another way of writing

00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:47.455
what we have over here,
this is going to be equal to

00:08:47.455 --> 00:08:50.538
seven divided by seven divided by 10.

00:08:56.043 --> 00:08:58.312
Well, seven divided by seven is one,

00:08:58.312 --> 00:09:02.395
so you get one divided by
10, which is one tenth.
