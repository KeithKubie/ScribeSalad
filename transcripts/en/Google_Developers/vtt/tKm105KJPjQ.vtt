you got a second?

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.883
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh hi ya, Suzie.

00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:14.790
I always have time for
my favorite daughter.

TODD KERPELMAN: She'll be fine.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.332
You were saying?

00:00:24.332 --> 00:00:26.540
SUZIE: Well, Mark and I have
been codeveloping my app

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.207
for a while now.

00:00:27.207 --> 00:00:28.956
TODD KERPELMAN: You
and Mark have spending

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:30.350
an awful lot of time together.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.060
[AUDIENCE GOES WOO]

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.470
SUZIE: Well, yesterday he
suggested we add the Core Plot

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.250
library to my app, and I'm just
not sure we're ready for that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.015
yet.

[AUDIENCE GROANS]

00:00:38.724 --> 00:00:40.181
TODD KERPELMAN:
Well, good for you.

00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:42.770
Don't let any boys pressure you
into incorporating frameworks

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.830
you're not ready for, no
matter how long you've

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.500
been codeveloping.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.940
SUZIE: Yes, sir.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.250
I just-- I wish that
there was some way

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.425
to try a library
before installing it.

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:54.550
TODD KERPELMAN: Why, as a
matter of fact, there is.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.175
Have you heard about Pod Try?

00:00:56.175 --> 00:00:56.800
SUZIE: Pod Try?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.640
What's that?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.431
TODD KERPELMAN: Pod
Try is a low commitment

00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:01.380
way of trying out any
demo project associated

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.590
with a CocoaPod.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.922
Just imagine.

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:06.570
[HARP]

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.230
If you run Pod Try on
a third party library,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.330
CocoaPods will go out to that
library set of project files,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
usually on GitHub,
but not always,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.071
and download them to a temporary
directory on your computer.

00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:19.820
Once there, it will
scan them for anything

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.750
that looks like an Xcode
project or workspace, preferably

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.590
in a directory named something
like demo or example.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.664
Now if it finds one, Pod Try
will open that project in Xcode

00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:30.830
so you can see how it works.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.840
[HARP]

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.340
SUZIE: Oh.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.895
So I could use that to try out
Core Plot without adding it

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:36.635
to my app first?

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:37.760
TODD KERPELMAN: You betcha.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.910
In fact, let's give Pod
Try a try right now.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.625
Bring on over that
mechanized workstation.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.220
So we know the name for
our CocoaPod is Core Plot.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.720
SUZIE: Yep.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.530
And I remember the search
trick that you showed Robbie.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.990
TODD KERPELMAN: Aw, atta girl.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.037
So all you need to do is
type pod try core plot.

00:01:59.037 --> 00:01:59.870
SUZIE: Oh, but wait.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.577
I'm not in my Xcode
project or anything.

00:02:01.577 --> 00:02:03.160
Does it matter which
structure I'm in?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.650
TODD KERPELMAN: Nope.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.700
CocoaPods will put this
in a temporary directory

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.980
so you don't need
to worry about it.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.450
SUZIE: OK.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.139
So I'm going ahead and
type pod try core-plot.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.030
TODD KERPELMAN: That's right.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.363
Now you can see that CocoaPods
is downloading the GitHub

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:15.009
directory and looking for
any Xcode projects it finds.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.800
If it finds more than
one, it might ask you

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.840
which one to open.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.399
But it looks like in our
case, it only found one.

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:21.440
And a few moments later--

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.830
[AUDIENCE GASPS]

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.995
--Xcode starts up with
our sample ready to go.

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.260
Now you go ahead and
run it, make changes,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.110
and fool around with the code
just like any other project.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.780
SUZIE: Golly, that's swell.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.890
So Pod Try will work
with all libraries?

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.140
TODD KERPELMAN: Well, not all.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.164
Some developers, they
don't know about Pod Try.

00:02:36.164 --> 00:02:37.580
And their sample
apps haven't been

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.190
tested to see if they work.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.780
I've noticed
sometimes I need to go

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.157
into these temporary directories
and manually run pod update

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:45.240
to get everything working.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.739
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.657
Some developers, they'll
update their library,

00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:49.490
and then they'll forget
to update the sample

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.931
app that goes along with them.

00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:51.430
Whoops.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.170
And some libraries
like the Google Sign

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.080
In library will require you to
replace a couple of constants

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.267
to get everything working.

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:00.725
SUZIE: Oh, but does
that mean I can

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:02.891
run Pod Try on any of the
official Google CocoaPods,

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.387
and it will open a sample up?

00:03:04.387 --> 00:03:05.220
TODD KERPELMAN: Yep.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.040
Now that Google is making
CocoaPods its primary way

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.949
of distributing
libraries on iOS,

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.990
they're bundling all of
their sample applications

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.960
in the same git repository
as the library themselves.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.819
So it's easy to Pod Try them.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.360
They're also making
these sample apps

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.920
part of their continuous
integration test process.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.340
So you'll be pretty confident
that they will compile.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.685

the same about Mark's code.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.275
So how did that Xcode
project for out for you?

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:45.650
SUZIE: Well, thanks
to Pod Try, I

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.260
was able to try out Core Plot.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.637
But Mark and I decided it wasn't
quite right for us right now.

00:03:50.637 --> 00:03:52.720
TODD KERPELMAN: Well, you
know, that's understand.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.320
Integrating a
third party library

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.541
is a serious step in your
developer relationship,

00:03:56.541 --> 00:03:58.040
and not one you
should take lightly.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.770
SUZIE: That's true.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.686
Oh, and it reminds me.
