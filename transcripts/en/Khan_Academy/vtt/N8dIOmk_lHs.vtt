00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.250
What I want to do in this
video is order these fractions

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.030
from least to greatest.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.510
And the easiest way
and the way that I

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.485
think we can be sure we'll
get the right answer here

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:12.860
is to find a common denominator,
because if we don't find

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.220
a common denominator,
these fractions are really

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.960
hard to compare.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.750
4/9 versus 3/4 versus
4/5, 11/12, 13/15.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.320
You can try to estimate
them, but you'll

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.830
be able to directly
compare them if they all

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.020
had the same denominator.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.400
So the trick here, or at
least the first trick here,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.860
is to try to find that
common denominator.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.650
And there's many ways to do it.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.390
You could just pick
one of these numbers

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.105
and keep taking its multiples
and find that multiple that

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:41.810
is divisible by all the rest.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.410
Another way to do it is look
at the prime factorization

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.790
of each of these numbers.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.890
And then the least
common multiple of them

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.970
will have to have at least all
of those prime numbers in it.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.990
It has to be composed
of all of these numbers.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.350
So let's do it that second way.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.610
And then let's verify that
it definitely is divisible.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.700
So 9 is the same
thing as 3 times 3.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.640
So our least common
multiple is going

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.790
to have at least
one 3 times 3 in it.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.910
And then 4 is the same
thing as 2 times 2.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.590
So we're going to also
have to have a 2 times 2

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.050
in our prime factorization
of our least common multiple.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.910
5 is a prime number.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.420
So we're going to need
to have a 5 in there.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.660
And then 12-- I'm going
to do that in yellow.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.710
12 is the same thing
as 2 times 6, which

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.540
is the same thing as 2 times 3.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.930
And so in our least
common multiple,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.220
we have to have two 2's.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.730
But we already have two 2's
right over here from our 4.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.710
And we already have
one 3 right over here.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.430
Another way to think about it
is something that is divisible

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.742
by both 9 and 4 is going
to be divisible by 12,

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.450
because you're going
to have the two 2's.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.690
And you're going to have
that one 3 right over there.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.720
And then, finally, we need
to be divisible by 15's

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.790
prime factors.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.580
So let's look at
15's prime factors.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.980
15 is the same
thing as 3 times 5.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.640
So once again, this number
right over here already has a 3

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.200
in it.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.470
And it already has a 5 in it.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.310
So we're cool for 15,
for 12, and, obviously,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.469
for the rest of them.

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.010
So this is our least
common multiple.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.180
And we can just
take this product.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.080
And so this is going to be
equal to 3 times 3 is 9.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.800
9 times 2 is 18.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.370
18 times 2 is 36.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.190
36 times 5, you could do that
in your head if you're like.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.860
But I'll do it on the
side just in case.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.790
36 times 5, just so
that we don't mess up.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.476
6 times 5 is 30.

00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:44.970
3 times 5 is 15 plus 3 is 180.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.480
So our least common
multiple is 180.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.630
So we want to rewrite
all of these fractions

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.990
with 180 in the denominator.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.160
So this first fraction,
4/9, is what over 180?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.600
To go from 9 to 180, we have to
multiply the denominator by 20.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.160
So let me do it this way.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.340
So if we do 4/9, to get the
denominator of 9 to be 180,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.346
you have to multiply it by 20.

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:15.720
And since we don't
want to change

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.428
the value of the
fraction, we should also

00:03:17.428 --> 00:03:19.540
multiply the 4 by 20.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.840
So we're just really
multiplying by 20/20.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.380
And so 4/9 is going to be
the same thing as 80/180.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.330
Now, let's do the
same thing for 3/4.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.830
Well, what do we have to
multiply the denominator by

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.150
to get us to 180?

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.600
So it looks like 45.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.720
You could divide 4 into
180 to figure that out.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.022
But if you take 4 times
45, 4 times 40 is 160.

00:03:49.022 --> 00:03:50.124
4 times 5 is 20.

00:03:50.124 --> 00:03:50.790
You add them up.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.090
You get 180.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.070
So if you multiply
the denominator by 45,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.300
you also have to multiply
the numerator by 45.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.650
3 times 45 is 120 plus 15.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.050
So it's 135.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.510
And the denominator here is 180.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.595
Now, let's do 4/5.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.730
To get our
denominator to be 180,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.850
what do you have
to multiply 5 by?

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.350
Let's see.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.190
If you multiply 5 by
30, you'll get to 150.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.759
But then you have another 30.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.300
Actually, we know
it right over here.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.690
You have to multiply it by 36.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.630
Well, then you have to multiply
the numerator by 36 as well.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.880
And so our denominator
is going to be 180.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.782
Our numerator, 4
times 30 is 120.

00:04:39.782 --> 00:04:42.650
4 times 6 is 24.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.970
So it's 144/180.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.690
And then we have
only two more to do.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.640
So we have our 11/12.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.480
So to get the
denominator to be 180,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.084
we have to multiply 12
by-- so 12 times 10 is 120.

00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:04.000
Then you have 60 left.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.690
So you have to multiply it
by 15, 15 In the denominator,

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.540
and 15 in the numerator.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.990
And so the denominator
gives us 180.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.480
And 11 times 15.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.190
So 10 times 15 is 150.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.020
And then you have one more 15.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.520
So it's going to be 165.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.473
And then, finally,
we have 13/15.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.040
To get our denominator to be
180, have to multiply it by 12.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.585
We already figured out
that 12 times 15 is 180.

00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:40.460
So you have to
multiply it by 12.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.872
That will give us 180
in the denominator.

00:05:42.872 --> 00:05:45.080
And so you have to also
multiply the numerator by 12,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.310
so that we don't change
the value of the fraction.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.730
We know 12 times 12 is 144.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.430
You could put one
more 12 in there.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.827
You get 156.

00:05:55.827 --> 00:05:56.660
Did I do that right?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.730
12 plus 144 is going to be 156.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.800
So we've rewritten
each of these fractions

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.870
with that new common
denominator of 180.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.840
And now, it's very
easy to compare them.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.270
You really just have to
look at the numerators.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.360
So the smallest
of the numerators

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.860
is this 80 right over here.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.500
So 4/9 is the smallest.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.084
4/9 is the least
of these numbers.

00:06:21.084 --> 00:06:22.500
So let me just
write it over here.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.520
So this is our ordering.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.370
We have 4/9 comes first, which
is the same thing as 80/180.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.620
Let me write it
both ways-- 80/180.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.550
Then the next the
smallest number

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.210
looks like it's this
135 right over here.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.850
I want to do it in
that same color.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.930
The next one is going to
be that 135/180, which

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.660
is the same thing as 3/4.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.430
And then the next one is
going to be-- let's see,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.160
we have the 144/180.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.520
So this is going to
be the 144/180, which

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.160
is the same thing as 4/5.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.150
And then we have two more.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.560
The next is this 156/180.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.020
So then we have
our 156/180, which

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.540
is the same thing as 13/15.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.390
And then we have one
left over, the 165/180,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.000
which is the same thing-- I
want to do that in yellow.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.106
We have our 165/180, which
is the same thing as 11/12.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.220
And we're done.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.890
We have finished our ordering.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.980
So if you're doing the Khan
Academy module on this,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.475
this is what you would input
into that little box there.
