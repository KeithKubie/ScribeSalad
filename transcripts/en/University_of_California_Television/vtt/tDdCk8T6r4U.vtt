00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.555
(soft music)

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.191
- My name is Paula Varsano

00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:35.640
and I'm professor of East
Asian Languages and Cultures

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.160
and Chair of the Foerster
Lectures Committee.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.450
We're very pleased

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.480
along with the graduate council

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:45.860
to present Maryln Strathern

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.510
this year's speaker in the
Foerster Lectures Series.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.360
As a condition of this request bequest

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.770
we're obligated to tell you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.160
how the endowment

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.660
supporting the Foerster Lectures

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.920
on the Immortality of the Soul

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.090
came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.140
It's a story that exemplifies

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.260
in many ways

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.900
how this campus is linked

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.700
to the history of California

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.840
and the Bay Area.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.620
In 1928

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.310
Miss Edith Zweybruck

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.790
established the Foerster Lectureship

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.230
to honor the memory

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.130
of Agnes A. Foerster

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.320
and Constantine E.A. Foerster.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.200
Edith was a public school teacher

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.310
in San Francisco for many years,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.860
and the teaching profession was to her

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.400
an opportunity to develop a true knowledge

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.550
and love

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.560
of the spiritual values of life

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.170
in the young mind

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.943
entrusted to her care.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.040
Edith's beloved sister

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.760
Agnes A. Foerster

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.700
shared her high ideals and her hopes

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.650
as did Agnes' husband

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.060
Constantine E.A. Foerster.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.770
A lawyer by profession,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.860
Foerster was a man

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.290
of high intellectual achievements

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.210
and a rare personal charm.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.120
Although he passed away at the age of 37

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.240
he had achieved an enviable place

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.090
at the San Francisco Bar

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.090
and was considered

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.860
one of it's most highly respected members.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.350
For several years prior to his death

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.860
Foerster was law partner

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.020
of Alexander F. Morrison;

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.470
one of the most prominent
of San Francisco attorneys

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.630
for whom our own Morrison
memorial library is named.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.080
In her last days

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.330
miss Edith Zweybruck

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.120
expressed an abiding interest

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.810
in the spiritual life

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.458
by creating this lecture series

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:38.400
on the subject

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.210
the Immortality of the Soul

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.810
or other similar spiritual subjects.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.650
She left us

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.000
a little bit of leeway there.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.980
She believed

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.280
that through medium of a great university

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.700
and the words of scholarly lecturers

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.736
she might bring new light upon a subject

00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:57.960
that has interested the
world for centuries.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.140
Thank you Edith Zweybruck.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.200
And now about our lecturer.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.810
Distinguished social anthropologist

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.510
Marilyn Strathern's first field site

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.550
was in Melanesia.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.250
But it's fair to say

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.190
that she quickly revealed herself

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.450
to be an incisive ethnographer

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.940
of Euro-American society, too.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.700
Casting over a period of some 40 years

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.486
a penetrating, yet generous eye

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:29.480
on questions ranging
from the representation

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.910
and practice of gender and kinship

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.220
which engaged her early on,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.650
to the social significance
of reproductive technologies

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.260
and intellectual property, and beyond.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.200
But there is a guiding thread

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.590
as there often is in the
work of a great scholar.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.550
A fruitfully troubling line

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.060
of interrogation

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.550
that extends through her work.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.380
Always in her sights

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.660
seems to be a questioning

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.440
of the very mechanisms

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.390
of knowledge formation

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.010
and knowledge formulation

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.990
that have long guided scholars

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.730
in her field.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.667
Indeed,

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:10.010
and this is very impressive to me,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.640
it was during her undergraduate years

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.970
that she first began interrogating

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.730
not just the objects of
anthropological research,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.713
but the research practices themselves.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.870
As described in one of the
many encyclopedia entries

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.970
dedicated to somehow capturing the breadth

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.640
of her contribution,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.910
professor Strathern quickly arrived

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.760
at the point of asking

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.020
not so much

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.490
what specific objects or practices mean

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.210
but what does it mean

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.523
anthropologically to ask after them?

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.010
One of her best known works,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.010
and she is the author of 15 books

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.270
is The Gender of the Gift,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.930
published in 1988

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.820
and first drafted

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.560
while a visiting scholar here at Berkeley,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.467
which she describes as a, quote

00:05:04.467 --> 00:05:06.267
"Gentle deconstruction

00:05:06.267 --> 00:05:08.850
"Of gender relations in New Guinea."

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.040
but which the encyclopedia

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.080
of theory and social and
cultural anthropology

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.420
describes as

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.930
doubly admonitory.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.880
For it takes seriously

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.713
the fact

00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:23.000
that constructs of gender

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.560
observed in the field

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.080
are not ready-made realities
waiting for analysis

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.610
rather, they are ever evolving

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.744
historically and socially
specific categories

00:05:33.744 --> 00:05:37.520
in dynamic formation at all times

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.330
and not just in the observed society

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.693
but in that of the observer.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.169
Her 1991 work, Partial Connections

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.160
expands this rather
dizzying line of thinking

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.250
into the larger question
of meaning making.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.400
It's especially difficult
to do justice to this work

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.100
recognized almost since its publication

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.610
as a classic in the field.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.360
It makes for challenging reading

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.210
at least for the likes of me,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.960
and not least because language itself

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.660
comes under scrutiny.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.500
And this,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.345
from the perspective of
the student of literature

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:16.600
is a wonderful thing.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.640
As I have done what can only be described

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.310
as reading in Strathern

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.770
I've come to think of her work

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.220
as offering a poetics
of social anthropology.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.910
A body of scholarship

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.030
that takes fiction in all of its senses

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.350
seriously,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.540
in which aesthetics and politics,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.648
history and self-reflection

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:40.490
unfailingly bespeak her fine-tuned instict

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.280
for anthropology's basis

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.710
in relationality.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.350
From what I understand

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.960
professor Strathern is,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.350
as a matter of fact

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.950
currently working on a book

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.100
simply called Relations,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.203
which I now cannot wait to read.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.050
Marilyn Strathern received her B.A.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.052
in archeology and anthropology

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.920
in 1963

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.510
and her Ph.D. in social anthropology

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.254
from Cambridge University.

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:08.210
Strathern held positions

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.670
at Australia National
University in Canberra,

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.440
and at the Girton and
Trinity colleges in Cambridge

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.030
as well as guest lecturing at UC Berkeley.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.160
In 1985

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.870
she was appointed Chair

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.950
of the department of social anthropology

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.811
at Manchester University

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:28.680
before returning to Cambridge to serve

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.560
as William Wise professor

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.040
of social anthropology from 1991

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.540
until her retirement in 2008.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.150
Other notable positions include

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.210
life fellow of Girton
College at Cambridge.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.640
Honorary life president

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.960
of the UK ad common wealth association

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.940
of social anthropologists.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.940
Presidential Chair

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.700
of the European Association
of social anthropologists.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.090
Honorary fellow of Trinity College

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.303
and former member of the
Nuffield Council on Bioethics.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.640
Regarding today's Foerster lecture

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.440
Souls in Other Selves,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.650
and the Immortality of the Body

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.977
professor Strathern notes

00:08:09.977 --> 00:08:11.607
"Sometimes the soul

00:08:11.607 --> 00:08:16.607
"Seems a more precise
concept than the body."

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.300
This lecture

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.890
goes to a place and time

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.290
where kinds of beings

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.200
including food plants

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.350
have souls,

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.140
and where the bodily basis of life

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.830
is immortalized through cloning.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.700
It comments on the way

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.276
present-day anthropology

00:08:35.276 --> 00:08:37.570
brings fresh illumination

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.760
to what we thought we knew.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.840
It's my pleasure to welcome

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.101
professor Marilyn Strathern to Berkeley.

00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:44.934
(applause)

00:08:44.934 --> 00:08:46.783
I should say back to Berkeley.

00:08:51.363 --> 00:08:52.657
- [Marilyn] Thank you so much.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:53.797
- My pleasure.

00:08:53.797 --> 00:08:55.710
- I find it such a pleasure

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.610
to be in Berkeley again.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.830
And in particular

00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.860
to have the honor

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.410
of giving the Foerster lecture.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.830
It's customary on such occasions

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.200
to make a gesture

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.850
towards the rubric of the lecture.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.460
But I want to make more

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.453
than a gesture.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.080
Adding to my warm thanks

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.890
to the graduate council

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.290
for the kindness of the invitation

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.000
thanks are also due

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.170
to Miss Edith Zweybruck

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.963
and the memorial she set up.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.990
That she specified

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.990
the immortality of the soul

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.400
as a topic of contemplation

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.090
has led me to some anticipated thoughts

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.030
on matters

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.060
that one would imagine had
already been thought through

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.320
to exhaustion

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.010
if not actually discarded as unfit

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.623
for present-day thinking.

00:09:47.012 --> 00:09:49.823
Anyway, I do mean thanks.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.660
Because raising the question
of the immortality of the soul

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.590
becomes provocative

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.720
when the soul in question
is the archetype of soul

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.554
in the history of anthropological theory

00:10:03.554 --> 00:10:06.440
namely the animist soul

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.013
as it became known in
the late 19th century.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.190
And I refer to Edward Tyler's

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.060
landmark publication

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.040
on religion in primitive culture

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.763
in 1871.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.360
Tyler demonstrated

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.210
that everywhere

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.690
people had ideas about souls.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.130
With a personal

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.840
or diffused through notions
of ghosts and spirits

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.645
and encompassing the animation
of all kinds of beings

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:38.823
as though like people, they too had souls.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.580
More than that

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.670
his thesis was that this apprehension

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.890
of the vital breath or spirit

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.740
pervading everything

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.410
extensions of what human
beings sensed of themselves

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.230
was the earliest sign

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.163
of a religious disposition.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.350
It was at once the basis

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.410
of later religious development

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.763
hence the primitive, in his title;

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.650
and could be found here and there

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.927
in survivals.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.290
Thus, he both brought animism

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.350
within the purview of the world's cultures

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.500
and revealed its formative role

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.160
in what his contemporaries regarded

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.973
as the higher religions.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.910
Tyler's theory had a long life.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.913
At to the end of the 19th century.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.830
Now, in the course of
his extensive elaboration

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.913
Tyler does something rather surprising.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.540
He suggests

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.950
that we would be imposing

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.460
later theological formulations

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.690
onto animism

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.783
to suppose that the
animist soul was immortal.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.750
The animist soul is not immortal, he said.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.990
Hmm.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.070
The questions come crowding in.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.290
So what is a soul?

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.050
So what is mortality?

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.410
And if the soul is not immortal,

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.203
is nothing immortal?

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.860
The very doctrine of soul

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.350
so central to theories of animism

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.120
is not a straight-forward

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.293
as it might seem.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.500
The argument I eventually make

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.580
is rather simple.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.800
And aspects of it have been articulated

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.993
many times.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.310
But how we get to it

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.893
perhaps holds a little interest.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.340
I'm going to set out various staging posts

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.000
on the way.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.620
And at the outset

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.243
the posts will seem rather far apart.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.800
So they have nothing
to do with one another.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.360
But hopefully, they will
move closer together

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.623
as we proceed.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.830
They are by way

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.013
of illuminations more than anything.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.320
And if I may be so bold

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.530
may I suggest you just sit back

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.440
and relax,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.740
and allow yourself to be carried

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.563
from one to the other.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.090
The overall signpost

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.010
to our destination

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.430
comes from Ms. Zweybruck.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.563
It reads, the signpost reads;

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.930
what might happen

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.460
if contra-Tyler

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.560
we dare as precisely

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.883
about immortality in animist thought.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.010
And I'm going to refer

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.360
to one of the great regions of the world

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.350
who's indigenous cosmologist

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.340
are often described as animist,

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.837
namely Melanesia.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.973
Staging post one.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.423
The immortality of scholarship.

00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:48.450
(laughter)

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.700
Let me start with a secular

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.003
enlightenment form of immortality.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.280
One that certainly is

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.120
but is also a little more

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.293
than metaphoric.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.820
I would not be finding much of interest

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.980
in this Victorian idea of animism

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.180
if it were not for its spectacular rebirth

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.703
in recent anthropological debate.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.870
Often remarked upon with some surprise

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.890
animism now circulates

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.670
as a respectable term

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.640
for insight into the lives and ontologies

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.270
of certain peoples

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.890
as though the very concept

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.773
were risen from the dead.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.610
What remains dead

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.230
is much of the evolutionary
apparatus of Tyler's thinking

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.170
as in the assumption

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.290
that present-day animists practices

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.890
indicate lower echelons of spirituality

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.290
or in higher religions occur

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.807
as mere survivals.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.580
Indeed, as originally presented

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.400
the theory of animism

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.933
is a bit of an embarrassment.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.517
At the same time

00:14:54.517 --> 00:14:56.200
the notion that animism

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.070
is best understood as a
projection of human experience

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.020
onto other forms of life

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.063
continues to be debated.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.970
In any event

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.460
recent anthropological analysis

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.580
has converted its awkward primitivism

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.250
into a dazzling array

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.083
of tools for thought.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.820
And I'm briefly going
to mention three names,

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.720
but you don't need to hold on to them.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.290
So we can read the animist soul

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.940
in other terms.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.910
For example

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:32.170
through Bird-David's
Relational Epistemology.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.587
Alongside Descola's interest

00:15:33.587 --> 00:15:36.170
in the way human interiority

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.163
is attributed to other beings.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.490
Or with Viveiros de Castro
on subject positions,

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.900
animism being less a mental state

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.623
than a theory of mind.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.423
However,

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.360
rather than offering other concepts

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.013
and thus transcending the concept of soul,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.383
I want to turn back to it
rather than away from it.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.470
In anthropologist's ceaseless battle

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.690
with its own ethnocentrism

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.020
one strategy

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.490
is not to avoid the weight and freight

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.280
of its own vocabulary,

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.210
but instead

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.553
get up close to it.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.083
This is in order to test its limits.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.860
So precisely in order to
interrogate the concept

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.590
I propose to talk of the animist soul

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.723
more or less in its Victorian sense.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.900
Among many of Tyler's
contemporaries, after all

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.290
it was a counterpart to the kind of soul

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.883
they thought they had.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.920
Of course, I've no idea

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.750
if Ms. Zweybruck herself

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.523
had given much thought to animism.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.573
This returns us to its
present day incarnation.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.050
Think of the legal axiom

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.480
that through bequests and such like

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.453
a person's will endures
beyond their decease.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.780
In the same way academia
embraces a commitment

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.490
to the future of scholarship

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.620
that will be carried forward

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.190
by diverse minds

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.210
sometimes giving the impression

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.833
that the mind, thereby, endures.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.300
Here just as the will

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.590
only has a future through the good offices

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.280
of the heirs

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.130
for all that scholars may celebrate

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.360
the origination of
ideas in someone's mind.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.670
Tyler's thoughts seemingly
being given a new lease of life

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.560
these ideas are now embedded

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.470
within a scholarly apparatus

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.963
that has a life of its own.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.960
They continue in other minds

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.940
as notions refashioned

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.333
for other debates.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.880
If this continuity

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.410
is immortality of a kind

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.580
then it flourishes through specific acts

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.910
of regeneration

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.260
as when new formulations are acknowledged

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.293
and recognized as the rebirth of old ones.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.140
As we leave the staging post behind

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.800
it's with the suggestion

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.630
that we have in the scholarly circulation

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.060
and reinvention of ideas

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.860
a model of how people's thoughts

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.840
serve as conduits,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.100
channels

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.563
for the thoughts of others.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.080
Staging post two.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.240
Prehistoric horticulture.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.360
And I said at the beginning

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.012
they'd be rather far apart.

00:18:30.012 --> 00:18:32.120
(laughter)

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.763
So, this staging post
seems a bit of an outlier.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.660
We find ourselves on Melanesian island

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.030
in the Pacific

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.043
10 thousand years ago.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.100
Not to linger,

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.080
but staying just long enough to introduce

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.703
some notable plants.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.296
In fact, Tyler sent us over here

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:54.392
with his remarks on the souls of plants

00:18:54.392 --> 00:18:56.767
as a doctrine, I quote

00:18:56.767 --> 00:18:57.600
"That lay deep

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.040
"In the intellectual
history of southeast asia."

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.063
And he was including the Pacific.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.260
We now know

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.330
that the exploitation of food crops there

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.370
goes back

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.953
well before this.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.380
However, 10 thousand
years is interesting to me

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.350
as the horizon of an archeological site

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.830
in the Mount Hagen area

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.180
of western highlands of Papua New Guinea

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.580
called Kuk.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.873
And it's spelled K-U-K.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.613
Kuk.

00:19:29.613 --> 00:19:30.790
A few miles

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:34.320
from where the first
Australians to come to Hagen

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.170
in 1933

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.453
set up camp.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.380
That horizon

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.620
of 10 thousand years

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.170
has yielded evidence of artifacts

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.210
and cultivation features

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.940
and the years following

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.900
such as a stone pestle

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.020
used to prepare yams,
along with taro seeds

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.673
and starch grains.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.320
Yams and taro

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.460
were being exploited at the site

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.490
although undisputed
evidence of cultivation

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.970
in the form of ditching and
mounding is 3000 years later.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.920
But we are talking of 7000 years ago

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.220
and you could orient
this with what you know,

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.330
what was happening with rice in China

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.980
and of course with the middle east.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.513
These were root crops.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.060
The 1930's Australian patrol

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.480
recorded its amazement

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.500
at the scale of intensive
cultivation it found.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.503
In the 1930's.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.600
Since then, archeo-botanical work

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.580
has shown that Papua New
Guinea was a local site

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.200
for the domestication and
dispersal of vegetative crops.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.310
Notably yam and taro,

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.270
also banana and sugar cane

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.260
and a number of others,

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.803
sago and so forth.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.920
Kuk is just one place

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.093
on that large island

00:20:56.093 --> 00:21:00.080
but it's exceptionally
well documented evidence

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.750
has led to the excavation

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.723
being nominated for world heritage status.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.813
There is almost nothing to see.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:09.930
Peering down a trench

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.310
during the dig

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.249
one might have observed landscape features

00:21:13.249 --> 00:21:15.090
a ditch, a mound,

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.103
but little more.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.359
The surface is now covered
over for conservation.

00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:23.400
But then if you raised your eyes

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.010
you would see root crops

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.380
very similar to those excavated

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.303
on the site, being grown today.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.200
When Europeans first arrived

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.860
at coastal and hinterland
parts of Papua New Guinea

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.870
in the late 19th and early 20th century,

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.849
either yam, or taro

00:21:41.849 --> 00:21:43.470
tended to predominate

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.733
as the principal subsistence crop.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.899
The principal crop invariably
received ritual attention;

00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:51.290
people in fact claiming

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.680
that the plants wouldn't grow without it;

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.949
and anthropologists have
called the plants artifacts.

00:21:57.949 --> 00:21:59.850
Sweet potatoes came along

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:00.683
much later.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.270
Whereas sweet potatoes grow from vines

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.180
pushed into the soil

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.030
both yam and taro

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.230
depend on propagation

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.532
through a portion of the tuber or corm

00:22:11.532 --> 00:22:13.710
being detached and put aside

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.300
from what is eaten

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.670
to form the beginnings

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.793
of the new plant.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.520
Yams undergo a bifurcated cycle of growth

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.890
throwing up vines above ground

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.360
that cause nutrients

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.500
to be stored below ground

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.230
in the tuber.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.040
Taro send up thick stalks
and leaves above ground

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.530
and are corm to be replanted

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.723
will have some stalk attached.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.450
The bits so planted may be called

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.350
the mother, or father

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.603
of the child tuber or corm
that grows underground

00:22:45.603 --> 00:22:47.960
and only at harvest, of course

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.853
is what is underground made visible.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.550
Let's leave here then

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.870
but with some sense, perhaps

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.323
of what these root crops
might be in Papua New Guinea.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.610
Since the next staging post

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.763
is all about taro souls.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.270
So, staging post three.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.653
Taro souls.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.040
An ethno-botanical study

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.780
conducted in the 1960's,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.280
it's going to be published
posthumously later this year

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.210
describes the horticulture of the Mayengi.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.320
And that is the name of a people

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.570
I should coming back to.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.150
The Mayengi of new Britain

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.350
off the coast of Papua New Guinea.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.073
Classic animism.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:39.060
Indeed the description

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.333
could have walked off the pages of Tyler.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.950
The cultivators ascribed to taro

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.900
their principal food crop

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.810
the same theory of the soul

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.293
that they entertained of themselves.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.630
The soul was a kind of second self.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.040
A concept Tyler also used

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.330
which in the case of people

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.310
permeated every part of the body

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.970
and was left behind in food remnants

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.403
or siting places.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.430
Taro souls

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.850
were under the control of various deities.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.750
Masters of taro

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.460
who had to be coaxed

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.710
into letting the soul

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.410
stay attached

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:20.963
to the growing plants.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.290
Like peoples

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.170
taro souls make a top

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.810
and wander away.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:29.150
And taro are quick to take offense

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.873
if they're not properly cared for.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:33.610
It is the soul of the taro

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.038
that makes the corm heavy and nutritious.

00:24:37.038 --> 00:24:39.040
And effort has to be made

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.210
to keep the souls tethered to the plants

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.513
or the harvest will be worthless.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.090
Now, while each plant

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.970
will only be nutritious
if its soul is present

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.690
such souls are refractions

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.670
of a generic taro soul.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.780
And dedicated action is necessary

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.260
to attract as much soul as possible.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.960
You could increase the amount of soul

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.923
that a taro has.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.950
You want to attract as much as possible

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.820
into the growing taro corm

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.060
to make it weighty

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.763
and thus satisfy hunger.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.620
There will be plants

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.820
who soul fails to grow

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.780
just as there are people
in the margins of society

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.453
who souls never develop.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.540
Taro soul is as a stalk.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.690
It has to be replenished.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.050
But properly replenished

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.363
it exists in perpetuity.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.840
A fractal entity

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.550
each particular soul

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.703
is also part of generic soul.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.950
The same is true of human beings.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.090
If one thinks, for example

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:48.203
of the perpetuity of
matrilineal kin groups.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.380
The matriclan is at once

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.750
itself and everyone

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.053
who has been born or will be born.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.050
Listen to this Mayengi comment

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.380
on the efforts of patrol officers

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.543
to take a population census.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.130
Those young white men

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.380
are ridiculous with their roll books.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.363
Why do they count only the living?

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.520
Don't they know that the living

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.500
are very few in relation to the dead?

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.230
If only they could see the spirits

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.363
of all the dead.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.640
Spirits of the dead

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.860
travel to the origin
places of their matriclan

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.610
and whether remembered or forgotten

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.440
by living persons

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.803
they're part of the present collectivity.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.370
Now if any of you happen to have heard

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.430
Gananath Obeyesekere Foerster lecture

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.650
on the Trobriand Islands

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.400
you may recall the nature

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.390
of Trobriand afterlife

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:49.363
from which former clan members are reborn.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.400
But the idea of the soul

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.900
as part of a collectivity

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.373
isn't peculiar to matriclans.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.200
Herman Strauss,

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.380
who was part of the staff

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.040
of the Lutheran mission

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.400
established in 1934

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.700
in the vicinity of that first patrol camp

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.810
at Mount Hagen

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:08.670
not far from Kuk

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.350
observed something very similar

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.343
of Hagen patriclans.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:16.890
The personal soul

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.650
which disappears at death

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.290
is a person share

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.840
or participation

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.217
in the life force of the patriclan.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.900
For as long as they are remembered

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.140
particular persons exist
as ancestral spirits

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.083
before turning into moths.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.543
People say sometimes.

00:27:35.996 --> 00:27:38.140
Perhaps its not the fugitive

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.620
future of the personal soul

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.760
to which we should be addressing

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.810
the question of immortality

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.970
but the life force of
which any particular soul

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:47.993
is a part.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:49.983
Life force,

00:27:49.983 --> 00:27:51.410
and I'm sorry about that term

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:52.830
but for want of a better one

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:54.950
has being

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.630
in the enduring kinship collectivity

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.450
where one soul is also the soul

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.323
of others.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.044
We depart from this staging post

00:28:06.044 --> 00:28:09.600
noting that such a life force is not inert

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.433
but requires replenishment.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.393
Staging post four.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.363
Replacements.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.370
Here is a little detail

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.890
that may or may not

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.150
reflect the patroness

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:26.573
of the ethnographic record.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:33.010
Whereas Mayengi ideas about people's souls

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:36.490
can be echoes across the
regions of Papua New Guinea

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.210
we can't say the same

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.093
of plant souls.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.510
The evidence of an animist attribution

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.970
of human-like souls to plant crops

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.400
or other living beings

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.493
seems much more intermittent.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.160
Thus a recent and very detailed account

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.620
of yam cultivation

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.440
in another area

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.580
identifies people's life force

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.691
survives after death in
the form of ancestral power

00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:05.880
but could find no obvious connection

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.000
to the growing of plants.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.833
There

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:11.603
plants were not said to have souls.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.330
So our classic animist study

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.860
is not, after all,

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.873
replicated everywhere across Melanesia.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:22.810
But whatever the reason

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.560
for this intermittency

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.850
something even more intriguing

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:27.913
comes to light.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.390
Many elements

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.310
which in Mayengi are held together

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.400
with ideas about the soul

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.343
are found numerous ethnographic accounts

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:43.343
in terms of the person-like
characteristics of plants.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.427
And such person-like
characteristics of plants

00:29:46.427 --> 00:29:47.940
are there regardless

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.160
of whether or not

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.763
they're thought to have souls.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:57.170
Thus yams are said to be
sensitive to people's movements.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.180
Taro and yams both walk about.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.060
Yams flee;

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.660
but not from a particular example.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.610
Yams flee gardens when there's a drought.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.940
Something of the primordial
plant is in every plant.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.370
Yams have ideas or listen to people

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:13.203
as do taro.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.520
They may be under the control of spirits

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.860
or have their own sources of animation

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.970
in the company of their cultivators,

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.193
or in the company of other plants.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.400
The constellation of trays varies

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.450
but generally the crops don't grow

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.133
without kindness and attention.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.313
In other words

00:30:35.313 --> 00:30:36.520
there's a broader

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.340
and more inclusive sense

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.420
of the animatory qualities

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.230
of yams and taro

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.550
than simply their manifestation

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.463
in a doctrine of the soul.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.920
And this shifts one's thoughts a bit

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.583
and suggests a parallel.

00:30:54.859 --> 00:30:56.460
For similarly,

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.370
one can imagine the future rebirth

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.730
of the personal soul

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:00.710
or spirit

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.150
of people

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.720
in other members of a kin group

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.230
such as a matriclan

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.400
with or without

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.883
a specific doctrine about
the soul's journeying.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.910
There is no one story

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:15.570
of rebirth in Papua New Guinea,

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.120
or in Melanesia at large.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.423
Differences abound.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.580
Where death is supposed to lead

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.190
to reincarnation,

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.050
in some areas the moment of rebirth

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.449
is left vague and unspecified,

00:31:27.449 --> 00:31:29.620
whereas in others it's envisaged

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.263
over a specific three generation cycle.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.930
There may be a defuse sense

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.590
that spirits return

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.830
or none at all.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.710
That is, they just continue their lives

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.373
as ancestors influencing
their descendants.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.840
So on analogy

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.120
with generalized notions
about the animation of plants

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.960
I wonder if notions about reincarnation

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.860
are not equally a particular instance

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.893
of a more general phenomenon.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:00.520
In other words.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.160
In the same way as the person
like animation of plants

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.993
doesn't require

00:32:03.993 --> 00:32:06.320
the notion of a human-like soul,

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.620
neither does the reincarnation

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.713
of persons.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.470
The more diffuse phenomenon, I suggest

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.320
is a concern with replacement.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.490
And I'm translating

00:32:19.742 --> 00:32:20.692
an indigenous term.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.610
With the idea that people who die

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.070
will be replaced

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.713
by specific others.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.110
While this may be elaborators

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.490
of three generation process

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.170
grandparents and grandchildren

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.160
being identified with one another

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.740
it's also found in a two-generation form

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.573
as between parents and children.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.370
It is among other things

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:45.150
enfolded into marriage rules

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.070
as in the claim people
have on formal in-laws

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.670
to provide future spouses

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:51.640
which in turn

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.620
of course depends on the
discreetness of the kin group

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.790
that sees itself being replenished

00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.580
in this way.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.990
And this seems to be

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.333
an immortality of a kind.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.500
The dynamic of replacement

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.810
makes sense of the
often fragmentary nature

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.793
of stories about the afterlife.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.700
Stories often carry on so far

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.243
and the trail vaguely off.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.333
The point is surely

00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:22.090
that there is no need

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.410
for a continuous narrative

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:27.370
as though the soul had a life history.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:31.590
Or for narrational
consistency about its return

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.150
precisely because replacement

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.243
is a self-evident process.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.640
Yet it is concept of replacement

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.920
doesn't require a narrative

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.510
about happens to
particular personal souls.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.920
The soul may come back into the picture

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.550
in another respect.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.793
Namely as part of a generic life force.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.830
From the perspective of the kin group

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.840
matri or patriclan

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.440
replacement is effected

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.600
through the regeneration of group members.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.450
And that implies

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:08.310
that perpetuation of the
collective life force.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.690
And for that

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.930
the clan group

00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:13.480
forever needs conduits,

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.200
needs channels.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.193
Bodily conduits.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.260
One colloquial connotation of replacement

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.370
lies in the Hagen idea

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.780
that a person recognizes

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.620
as his or her particular replacement

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.110
a child or some other relative

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.140
who has a similar body form

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.423
to his or her own.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.110
Nothing to do with
inheritance or succession.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.270
A simple question

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.820
of a counterpart likeness

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.033
in bodily form.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.683
But what is the body?

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.060
We have to turn aside

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.970
at the next staging post

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:52.633
for an issue so far evaded.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.610
Staging post five.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.283
The animist body.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.800
We shouldn't be too surprised

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.860
to find Tyler

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.880
sitting waiting for us

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.293
at the bottom of this post.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:15.420
For among the reasons

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.940
the Victorian thinker

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.760
gave for rejecting the idea

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.120
that the animist soul

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.270
could be described as immortal

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:25.610
was the idea that it was
not immaterial enough.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.310
Not spiritual enough.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:28.687
And I quote

00:35:28.687 --> 00:35:30.921
"The soul as recognized in

00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:32.310
"Such philosophies."

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:33.393
He means animism.

00:35:34.377 --> 00:35:35.657
"Maybe defined

00:35:35.657 --> 00:35:38.667
"As an ethereal surviving being

00:35:38.667 --> 00:35:40.817
"Concepts of which preceded

00:35:40.817 --> 00:35:41.877
"And led up

00:35:41.877 --> 00:35:44.427
"To the more transcendental theory

00:35:44.427 --> 00:35:47.257
"Of the immaterial and immortal soul

00:35:47.257 --> 00:35:49.487
"Which forms part of the theology

00:35:49.487 --> 00:35:51.420
"Of higher nations."

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.253
He says.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.983
In fact,

00:35:53.983 --> 00:35:56.930
he refers to the ethereal substance

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:58.383
of the animist soul.

00:35:59.845 --> 00:36:03.120
Mayengi people would be in accord.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.530
The soul, or double self

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.820
is said to have a viscous liquid presence

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.640
animating at once

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.750
the inner and outer form

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.440
of a person.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.280
It exists

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.413
both sides of the person.

00:36:19.157 --> 00:36:20.940
"It would be no exaggeration."

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.607
I'm quoting from the ethnographer.

00:36:22.607 --> 00:36:23.990
"It would be no exaggeration to say

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.037
"That the whole life cycle of the Mayengi

00:36:27.037 --> 00:36:30.117
"Is spend in the effort of recovering

00:36:30.117 --> 00:36:34.483
"Or keeping these two
souls or selves together.

00:36:35.897 --> 00:36:37.857
"While one may be called inner

00:36:37.857 --> 00:36:40.347
"And the other, outer soul

00:36:40.347 --> 00:36:42.217
"They can only be held together

00:36:42.217 --> 00:36:45.357
"By that to which they give life.

00:36:45.357 --> 00:36:46.487
"Namely the body

00:36:46.487 --> 00:36:48.227
"That after death is no more

00:36:48.227 --> 00:36:49.927
"Than an empty husk."

00:36:51.204 --> 00:36:52.490
The ethnographer argues

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.393
that there is nothing mystical here.

00:36:55.383 --> 00:36:57.750
Counterintuitively for us, perhaps

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.550
this double self

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.160
is captured in terms neither of spirit

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.593
nor of substance.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.573
In many respects

00:37:07.573 --> 00:37:09.580
it seems easier to apprehend

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:10.730
the Melanesian soul

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.953
than to apprehend the Melanesian body.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.340
Perhaps we can call the body

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.143
that which is animated.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:20.443
Reciprocally

00:37:20.443 --> 00:37:21.480
it's also that

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.500
on which the soul's replenishment

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.433
depends.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:29.050
For the soul needs a container,

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.690
a conduit.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.580
And what passes through people's bodies

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.825
is in counterpoint

00:37:34.825 --> 00:37:36.360
to what passes through

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.763
spirit bodies.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.216
In relation to Mayengi taro

00:37:41.216 --> 00:37:42.780
in myth,

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.800
food is the excrement

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.420
of supernatural beings

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.720
conveyed by

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.170
and coming from their bodies.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:52.670
While people's bodies

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.150
are equally conduits

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.450
for the growth and continuity

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:57.693
of taro soul.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.870
Taro soul is augmented

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.417
by passing through the bodies of people.

00:38:03.417 --> 00:38:05.003
More generally you may say

00:38:05.003 --> 00:38:07.130
that the soul requires

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.170
this constant replenishment

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:10.893
in the things it animates.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.130
Yet the notion of material substance

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.390
clings fast

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.639
to the way anthropologists have described

00:38:18.639 --> 00:38:21.793
Melanesian conceptualizations of the body.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.123
In life

00:38:24.123 --> 00:38:26.060
the body appears to be composed

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.480
of substances that circulate
inside and outside blood

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.140
and milk, and so forth,

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.030
in relation to other bodies.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.350
Just as in death

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.580
people treated in terms

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.680
of the difference

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.940
between flesh that decays

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.313
and bones that endure.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.370
In the language they use

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.330
Euro-American anthropologists

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.600
cannot help giving these aggregations

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.100
and disaggregations

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.360
a material cast

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.883
as in the very notion of substance itself.

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:56.280
But perhaps what we've
learned about the soul

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.593
will help here.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.563
I focus on one aspect

00:39:02.563 --> 00:39:04.460
of life and death

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.440
recognizable across Melanesia

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.540
including Mount Hagen.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.030
There seem parallels

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.960
between on the one hand

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.438
the personal soul that
dissipates after death

00:39:15.438 --> 00:39:18.023
and the bodily materials that decompose.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.650
And on the other

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.630
what endures of the bones for a while

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:25.220
and continuing identity

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.060
for a while

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.603
of ancestral spirits.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.000
To the Euro-American observer

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.359
the body's materiality

00:39:32.359 --> 00:39:34.520
seems especially evident

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.105
in the decay and
disappearance of the flesh.

00:39:38.105 --> 00:39:40.690
But perhaps we should pay more attention

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.770
to that process

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.083
of decomposition.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.939
It is regenerative.

00:39:45.939 --> 00:39:48.641
Flesh is invariably regarded

00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:51.060
as returning to the land

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.170
and contributing to the regeneration

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.653
of the fertility of the soil.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.423
How so?

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:01.970
Surely because

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.940
the vitality its soul gave it.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.510
And do you remember that soul permeates

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.403
the living body.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.930
It's that vitality

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:11.850
that is released

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:13.013
into the ground.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.023
In other words,

00:40:15.023 --> 00:40:15.856
the very feature

00:40:15.856 --> 00:40:18.090
that might suggest the body is material

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.400
it's capacity for decomposition

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.270
is a flow of life force

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.533
the basis of fresh growth.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.650
That same aspect,

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:29.090
bodily decay

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.960
is also in Euro-American eyes

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.433
a sign of mortality.

00:40:33.636 --> 00:40:35.800
Yet in these Melanesian configurations

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.490
the constant replenishment of the soil

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:39.410
seems to me

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:41.686
no less immortalizing

00:40:41.686 --> 00:40:44.950
than a perpetual replacement of persons

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.783
as members of kin groups.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.530
Indeed in many areas

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.420
there's a direct connection

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.253
for example

00:40:52.253 --> 00:40:54.030
through a clan's identification

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.003
with its land.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.310
And as the soul

00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.650
now more generically

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:01.783
life force

00:41:01.783 --> 00:41:04.440
travels from one container to another,

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.860
it too is replenished

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.090
now growing as a person's body,

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.280
now growing as fertile soil

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.830
and the animate body's human

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:13.850
and non-human

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:15.563
that the soil will produce.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.518
Might we then, in this regard

00:41:18.518 --> 00:41:22.033
talk of the immortality of the body.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.650
I turned to notions

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.000
about the reincarnation

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.253
of food plants.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.280
It's in the treatment of the
dead parts of these plants

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.720
that we find a specific justification

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.793
for talking about immortality.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.820
We shall catch up with Tyler

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.930
at the post after next,

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:43.980
but in the meanwhile

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.910
what follows

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.693
is obviously speculative.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.420
Staging post six.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.523
The immortality of the body.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:56.130
As we look around

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:57.823
we can see Kuk again.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.750
You'll recall the
archeological site in Hagen

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.450
though from another point of view.

00:42:05.362 --> 00:42:08.240
There is not much in
the ethnographic record

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.790
that would speak as directly

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.070
as I'm going to

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.633
although there are plenty
of signs and pointers.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.050
That said, similar reflections

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:18.320
have not escaped

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.010
one or two present-day

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.670
Papua New Guinean academics.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:23.503
Notably,

00:42:24.804 --> 00:42:27.590
the archeologist John Muke

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:28.910
who was closely involved

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.763
with the nomination of
the world heritage site.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.470
He articulated

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.680
one of the foundations

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.580
on which the nomination was based.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.830
The environs of the site.

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.290
As I said, there's
nothing there to be seen

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:44.460
which presents some problems

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.633
to the local committee
who needs indicators.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.293
Visible around Kuk, he argued,

00:42:53.293 --> 00:42:56.592
was an organically evolved landscape

00:42:56.592 --> 00:42:57.880
displaying

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.670
the continuing cultivation of plants

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.860
to whose early exploitation

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.523
the archeology attested.

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.650
He also mentioned the perpetual movement

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:11.050
of plants and people across clan groups.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:12.880
And the value always put

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.570
on finding new gardens

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.080
for replanting

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.270
a circulation already imagined

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.893
by the archeologist of a
thousands of years ago.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.200
Now the phrase continuing cultivation

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.980
hides an observation

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.250
that the linguist-botanist

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:32.240
André Haudricourt

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.380
made many years ago

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.593
of Yam growing in island Melanesia.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.590
Each plant is a clone

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.340
of a previous one.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.553
The same genetic individual.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:47.920
The taro and yams

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.760
that Hargon people cultivate

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.820
are in this sense

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.620
the same individuals.

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.597
The clones of those first plants

00:43:54.597 --> 00:43:58.253
that were to be cultivated
over the millennia.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.640
And this does not mean

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.100
that there was no possibility

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.000
of change.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.190
In the words of two archeo-botanists;

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.180
and I have to quote them

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.273
because I don't really understand this.

00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:11.697
(laughter)

00:44:11.697 --> 00:44:15.017
"While reproduction involves
the clonal propagation

00:44:15.017 --> 00:44:16.727
"From one plant to another

00:44:16.727 --> 00:44:18.317
"This does not prevent the formation

00:44:18.317 --> 00:44:20.815
"Of novel hybrids or domesticates."

00:44:20.815 --> 00:44:21.920
And what they say is

00:44:22.837 --> 00:44:24.647
"Though asexual propagation

00:44:24.647 --> 00:44:27.517
"Only allows for sematic mutation

00:44:27.517 --> 00:44:29.837
"In the genome of the new plants

00:44:29.837 --> 00:44:31.487
"Changes to the physical environment

00:44:31.487 --> 00:44:34.227
"Can cause favorable and lasting changes

00:44:34.227 --> 00:44:36.557
"To the clonal phenotypes,

00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:38.527
"And the movement of these varieties

00:44:38.527 --> 00:44:40.457
"Within human spaces

00:44:40.457 --> 00:44:41.977
"Would have naturally led to the creation

00:44:41.977 --> 00:44:44.587
"Of new variants.

00:44:44.587 --> 00:44:47.297
"Vegetative or a sexual propagation

00:44:47.297 --> 00:44:49.657
"Does not lack change then

00:44:49.657 --> 00:44:51.497
"But it does mean that each plant

00:44:51.497 --> 00:44:53.590
"Is a clone of a previous one."

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.393
They are all one plant.

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:00.412
Now, there is evidence that
in Melanesian horticulture

00:45:00.412 --> 00:45:03.030
such propagation was pursued

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.460
as a matter of choice.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.440
Many of these plants were capable

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.270
of being propagated by seed

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.690
but that was ignored

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:13.773
and vegetative propagation
was the preferred method.

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.090
Each new plant taking a cutting

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.500
or node from a previous one.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.980
And in the case of taro

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.740
the stalk is detached
from the corm to be eaten

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.640
with a little bit of the parent corm

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.053
adhering to it for replanting.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:32.720
For not so distant neighbors of Mayengi,

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.930
though I won't bother you with the name,

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:36.690
another ethnographer of New Britain

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.057
says outright

00:45:38.057 --> 00:45:40.960
"The taro stalk is immortal."

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.337
And she says

00:45:42.337 --> 00:45:44.497
"Taro stalks are inherited, traded

00:45:44.497 --> 00:45:46.777
"Imported and exported.

00:45:46.777 --> 00:45:50.717
"When someone said, this
is my grandfathers taro

00:45:50.717 --> 00:45:52.927
"It was clear that it was
not only the same variety

00:45:52.927 --> 00:45:54.817
"As the grandfather had planted,

00:45:54.817 --> 00:45:59.467
"But was considered to
be the identical stalk

00:45:59.467 --> 00:46:01.577
"That the grandfather had planted.

00:46:01.577 --> 00:46:03.837
"The taro stalk has an immortality

00:46:03.837 --> 00:46:06.163
"That is taken as a human model.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.087
"In some instances

00:46:09.087 --> 00:46:11.317
"The history of a specific variety

00:46:11.317 --> 00:46:12.517
"Parallels that

00:46:12.517 --> 00:46:14.897
"Of a genealogical descent group.

00:46:14.897 --> 00:46:16.657
"In others of a local group.

00:46:16.657 --> 00:46:17.527
"And in yet others

00:46:17.527 --> 00:46:19.227
"Offers a personal history

00:46:19.227 --> 00:46:21.073
"As to who first imported it.

00:46:22.167 --> 00:46:25.137
"Above all, the identification
of the present planter

00:46:25.137 --> 00:46:27.177
"With his or her predecessor

00:46:27.177 --> 00:46:29.627
"The one who he or she has replaced

00:46:29.627 --> 00:46:31.553
"Is repeated over and again.

00:46:32.557 --> 00:46:35.483
"Both men and women desire replacements.

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:39.217
"With the next generation
in sight, however

00:46:39.217 --> 00:46:41.417
"Anticipating their replacement

00:46:41.417 --> 00:46:44.877
"Also anticipates their death.

00:46:44.877 --> 00:46:47.207
"And the same is true of plants.

00:46:47.207 --> 00:46:49.097
"Without going into detail

00:46:49.097 --> 00:46:50.550
"It's the bit of the corm or tuber

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:51.637
"That is cut off,

00:46:51.637 --> 00:46:54.257
"Or otherwise separated
from what is to be eaten

00:46:54.257 --> 00:46:55.967
"That provides the nourishment

00:46:55.967 --> 00:46:57.967
"For the new corm or tuber

00:46:57.967 --> 00:46:59.383
"That grows in its stead.

00:47:00.517 --> 00:47:02.557
"What is eventually harvested

00:47:02.557 --> 00:47:04.920
"Is in effect a replacement

00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:07.607
"For the piece that was planted.

00:47:07.607 --> 00:47:09.457
"If you could imagine as a parent

00:47:09.457 --> 00:47:10.787
"Where the father or mother

00:47:10.787 --> 00:47:14.337
"Who dries up, shrivels and dies away."

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.873
There's an observation to be made here.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.760
We do not need to decide

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.315
Whether the discarded part of the plant

00:47:26.315 --> 00:47:29.050
and what is growing in its place

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.183
is soul or substance.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:33.860
We don't need to decide.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.170
Not just because of the
impossibility of these terms

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.110
but because unlike the demands

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.530
of the world heritage nomination,

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:45.210
we don't require a doctrine of continuity

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:47.780
that would have to trace
the past and future

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.710
of these elements.

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:52.410
There is no need to narrativize the soul

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.173
or have a theory about
continuous material regeneration.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.360
On the contrary,

00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.660
if we were to ally

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:00.930
the botanists knowledge

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.220
of vegetative reproduction

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.660
through cloning

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.300
with these indigenous actions

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.740
that ensure perpetual replacement

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:11.400
our attention would be elsewhere.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.520
It would be on the repeated breaks

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.196
with the previous generation.

00:48:16.196 --> 00:48:17.800
The repeated cuts.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.430
The repeated deaths

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:23.223
required for the next
generation to spring anew.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:28.150
Thus, among some present-day people

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:29.210
at Kuk

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:31.700
where heritage debates
might suppose claims

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.757
about unbroken continuity

00:48:33.757 --> 00:48:37.010
the kind of continuity that John Muke,

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:39.740
the Papua New Guinea
Archeologist was pointing to

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.173
seems closer to an analogy.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.620
And this certainly,

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.753
at least how some Hagen
people also express it.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.440
They say they can't possibly know

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.090
who it was who cultivated this area

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:54.223
millennia ago.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.920
But those people's actions and practices

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.600
were like those of today

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.900
and today's people

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.313
now live there in their stead.

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.200
What is evident

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.320
is the replacement

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.280
just as in the clan child

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.743
or the plant offspring.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.950
Repeated cuts,

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:16.783
repeated deaths.

00:49:16.783 --> 00:49:17.743
So, what is death?

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:22.570
We turn up at the penultimate staging post

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:25.330
where Tyler's shadow can be seen again

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:26.440
and are going to stay here

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.433
little bit longer.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:32.560
Staging post seven,

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.683
life and death.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.160
Something Tyler

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.840
said about the animist soul

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.243
comes back to mind.

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:45.740
Apropos the spiritual aspects of the soul

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.295
in the theology of higher nations,

00:49:48.295 --> 00:49:52.260
he talks of the immaterial
and immortal soul

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.913
as a transcendental one.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.580
The life of the soul surpasses

00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.563
other forms of existence.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.540
We may add that the very formulation

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.354
holds transcendental possibility.

00:50:05.354 --> 00:50:10.354
A transcendentalist view
at once embraces ideas

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:12.300
of both transcendence

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.653
and imminence,

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.000
while also supposing imminence

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.303
as it's transcended opposite.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:22.990
Thus it can suggest

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:24.963
which is as far as Tyler goes

00:50:24.963 --> 00:50:28.240
that there are lower beliefs and practices

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.190
locked into

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:32.423
some kind of pre-transcendental state.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.940
In that state of affairs

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.870
there's no life or power

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.540
beyond what is already imminent

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.933
in the mundane world.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.040
Whether we go back to the axial age

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:47.080
or to the countless reformations
of Christian history

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:51.210
transcendence in the perspective
from which immanentism

00:50:52.093 --> 00:50:53.470
in whatever form

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:56.040
can emerge as an apparently counter

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.173
set of beliefs and practices.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:02.600
As to what has to be over come

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.630
in transcendentalist thinking,

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:06.720
in the case of persons,

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:07.980
this generally entails

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:10.060
some aspect of their being

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.033
or selfhood.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:13.360
One answer

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.200
that must have been familiar

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.560
to Tyler's 19th century contemporaries

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.970
with those higher religions in mind

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:21.150
is obvious.

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:23.403
What is overcome is mortality.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.810
It follows that if it's the
soul that transcends death

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.340
then some other part
of the person must die

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.010
from which comes a particular imagining

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:35.603
of the material mortal body.

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.100
Death this implies a cessation
of non spiritual life

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.523
the end of the life course
in the present world.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.080
That radical disjuncture

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.150
also requires

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.403
though only dies once.

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:50.650
And we'll come back to that.

00:51:52.264 --> 00:51:54.350
Not in Tyler's terms

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:56.790
but as a legacy of his writing

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.930
I want to suggest that
the concept of immanentism

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:02.273
turns out to be unexpectedly helpful.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.940
Understood as a mode of existence

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:10.130
that resides within, or
permeates being in the world

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:11.210
it allows me

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:14.293
to give a half turn to the
question I started with.

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:16.640
I had wondered

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.650
if we might ask about
immortality in immanest thought

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.600
Melanesian-speaking.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.770
So let me rephrase that.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.540
The question becomes

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.130
what would everlasting life

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:32.570
for an immanentist existence look like?

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:34.180
And it carries a corollary.

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.530
What would death look like?

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.403
First then, immanentist life.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.490
By definition

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:44.150
such life is discoverable anywhere

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:46.420
though people may formulate
it in different ways

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.563
for persons plants or animals.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.360
Entities that Euro-Americans
would regard as inanimate

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.270
such as features of the landscape

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.473
maybe addressed as personal beings.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.580
As a force of growth or regeneration

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.610
life is present in the
form things take and trees

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:04.650
grow in the flourishing of children,

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:06.240
in good health and so forth.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.095
It implies an active positive condition

00:53:09.095 --> 00:53:10.720
often additionally secured

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.720
through invisible

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.820
but present beings

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.520
such as ancestral ghosts.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.880
And is made visible

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.040
in the health and brightness

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.743
of enduring vitality.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:25.140
Mayengi would say that these show

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.093
how much soul one has.

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:29.760
Such life is everlasting

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.560
because people take steps to perpetuate it

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.763
through appropriate
rituals or cult activity.

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:43.539
They intervene to ensure his perpetuation.

00:53:43.539 --> 00:53:46.610
Whether on a routine basis
through spells or magic

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:48.190
to make things grow

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:49.660
or in an occasional basis

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.282
by bringing in spirit beings

00:53:51.282 --> 00:53:54.840
as special concentrations of life force.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.673
In other words

00:53:55.673 --> 00:53:57.608
they immortalize themselves

00:53:57.608 --> 00:53:59.253
and what sustains them.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.430
In fact, one might say

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:03.140
that life in this sense

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:07.230
is the mortalizing set of
actions that people take

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:09.230
in order to perpetuate their being.

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:10.850
We might even say

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:13.070
that the only life that can be lived

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.120
is life everlasting.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.240
In so far as the evidence for vitality

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.300
and thus the flourishing of people

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.640
is there in the antecedent generations

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.070
that brought them into
being and will exist

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:26.943
in the future generations
that replace them.

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:29.990
Moreover, as we saw in
the case of the cycling

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:32.410
of Mayengi taro souls

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:35.180
people don't just draw on
such generative capacities

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:37.410
a source of life for themselves

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:38.900
they are also conduits

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.363
for its perpetuation.

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.330
Equally significantly then

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:45.960
peoples actions are important

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.633
for replenishing this power.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:50.670
Life has to be regenerated.

00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:52.280
People have to plant

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.703
and they have to procreate.

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:56.820
But this sense of procreation

00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.240
is perhaps closer

00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.580
to that of cloning

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:00.853
than of lineality.

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.083
Depending on where one is in Melanesia

00:55:05.696 --> 00:55:08.561
collectivities of kin

00:55:08.561 --> 00:55:11.368
perpetually replace themselves.

00:55:11.368 --> 00:55:15.190
The point is that there must
be forth coming generations

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:16.890
who will be the future channels

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:18.370
or conduits of life

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:21.073
like the tubers that
spring anew from the soil.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:23.617
This kind of immanentist life

00:55:23.617 --> 00:55:25.460
does not culminate

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.460
in a higher order of being

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.650
but inheres in the deliberate regeneration

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:32.180
of the present order of being

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:33.723
to which everything belongs.

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.220
So what about immanentist death?

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.530
Well, you can imagine
what I'm going to say.

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:42.510
If life is all around and everlasting,

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:45.083
so too death is all
around and everlasting.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:47.719
It's not the same as life.

00:55:47.719 --> 00:55:50.010
Rather, it's the condition of existence

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:52.310
that makes people work so hard

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:53.963
at being alive.

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.913
It is what makes life an achievement.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:00.413
In truth, people die all the time.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.700
As when their souls,
their invisible selves

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.140
wander away when they're sleeping

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.853
or get captured by others.

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.870
The botanist Haudricourt

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.670
tells of an encounter on
the dock side in Port Vila

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:14.110
Vanuatu,

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:17.900
between two men who imagined
they recognize one another.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:18.733
One of them

00:56:18.733 --> 00:56:21.050
thinking the other is the
long deceased relative

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:21.920
whispers to him

00:56:22.777 --> 00:56:25.117
"Are you dead or alive?"

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.440
Rather than a sate of finality

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.490
death is an ever-present possibility

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:34.133
for a person's invisible self.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.300
Indeed when it's held in a person,

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.530
life or life force is
under constant attack,

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:43.320
whether from malevolent
sorcery, or malicious enemies,

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.550
or ancestral ghosts with withdraw support.

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:48.470
Someone's innards may be eaten by a which

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:49.810
but sown up again

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.200
and the victim doesn't know

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.033
he or she

00:56:52.033 --> 00:56:53.833
has only a short while left.

00:56:55.070 --> 00:56:57.740
The very fact that life
force permeates the body

00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.860
means that it is present in it

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.623
vulnerable to manipulation
by death dealing others.

00:57:04.178 --> 00:57:07.119
A person dies once and for all

00:57:07.119 --> 00:57:09.840
only when their invisible self

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.066
succumbs to an attack
that is irreversible.

00:57:13.066 --> 00:57:14.010
In other words,

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:17.500
they can no longer keep
their soul or souls together

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.520
with the body as the soul's container.

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.700
In the language I've been using

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.720
They've ceased to be a conduit

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.023
for the increase of life force.

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:30.910
Like a Mayengi taro
without its invisible self,

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:33.470
the body without a soul cannot survive

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:36.200
to nourish others in that form.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.400
And of course it's routinely reported

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.170
that morning for a person starts

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:41.900
once their soul is departed

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.420
and assumes there are
signs of it's departure

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.710
the body is bound to drop away

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:50.083
because life continues in other persons.

00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.860
If life is part of a generic life force

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.020
sustained through
particular people's actions,

00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:00.690
so death, we may say, is
part of a death force.

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.740
As has been described for
Hagen people around Kuk

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:04.990
everything that exists

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:07.060
can be seen as a transmitter of the forces

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.323
of life or death.

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.630
Death is imagined as a specific agency

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:14.840
penetrating the world of human affairs.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.800
And every irreversible death

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.230
comes from malign will of spirits or men.

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:23.500
That is from an attack on the life force.

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.120
I quote the aim of sorcerers

00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.790
to the destroy the soul

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.551
of the life force of
the person to be killed.

00:58:29.551 --> 00:58:32.410
And this is the missionary
anthropology Strauss

00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:33.860
whom I mentioned before

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.090
who'd been at Kuk in the area

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:36.430
since the 1930's.

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.670
For which one needs something,

00:58:41.545 --> 00:58:44.590
within which the soul of
the person is contained.

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:46.780
Or bits of the soul like left over food,

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:47.880
or discarded garments,

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.970
or simply a persons name.

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:51.220
And it's possible in this way

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.130
to take revenge for an injury

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:55.080
without recourse to fighting.

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.090
It all happens invisibly.

00:58:57.090 --> 00:58:58.670
One can destroy an enemy

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:00.190
by having a ritual expert

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:02.300
call on the enemy's name

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:04.590
through which one enlists
his ancestral spirit

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:06.313
so they hand over his soul.

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.603
One more comment on death.

00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:12.070
On analogy with the life

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:13.140
that springs anew

00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:16.700
in the newly growing
taro corm or yam tuber

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:18.060
the falling away of the husk

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.290
that was initially planted

00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:21.720
as the offspring's mother or father

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.953
also seems a regenerative moment.

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:26.160
That wasting and decay

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.600
enables new life

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.720
which is itself the parent

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.270
in a transformed state.

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:33.790
It's a form of death

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:35.420
that is not a finality

00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:36.790
to be overcome

00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:38.410
or transcended.

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:40.280
Rather, it's an instrument

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:41.480
of everyday,

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.223
non-miraculous rebirth.

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:47.730
We've come to the...

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.920
Not worrying about the time, I hope.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.670
We've just come to the last
staging post, number eight.

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.053
Souls in other selves.

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:04.080
I've obviously trod a very selective path

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.420
from post to post.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.070
Among innumerable
combinations and permutations

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:11.330
in how people frame life and death.

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:14.610
I focused on only two kinds of food plants

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.910
and while the horizon
of 10 thousand years ago

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.660
was introduced partly to
put the last 60 or 100 years

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.340
into perspective as a very recent epoch

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.930
I've ignored even more
recent ways of life.

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:29.450
But these qualifications aside

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:30.980
let me reflect

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.833
on what has emerged about
Melanesian immanentism.

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:37.940
It's important to appreciate

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.610
that the everlasting character

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:40.690
of both life and death

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:43.420
does not imply endless continuity

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.590
or lack of change.

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:46.423
To the contrary.

01:00:46.423 --> 01:00:47.320
People's interest

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.730
in the replacement

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:49.620
of a life force

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.020
whether in themselves

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.790
or the crops that are
so much of themselves

01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:55.100
is also an interest

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.510
in the displacement

01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:59.063
of one life by another.

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.000
Gardeners, for example

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.150
are always looking

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:05.340
for new varieties of food crops

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.193
to plant.

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:09.350
The process of keeping life going

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.890
is never straight forward,

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:13.770
always requires work,
ritual and otherwise.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.800
And moving from one moment to the next,

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.060
this replacement

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.480
which is also a displacement

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.793
is disjunctive.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.510
The life force that infuses any

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.040
particular soul

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.100
must enter fresh conduits

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:27.933
other selves.

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:32.230
Perhaps we now have some sense

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.120
of the immanentist soul

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.793
for these horticulturalists.

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:40.720
While we may appreciate
Tyler's healthy skepticism

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.560
about reading 19th century
theological notions

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.470
into the animism of other cultures

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:48.300
he pursued a relation

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.803
between the material and immaterial.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.460
Indeed the Victorians over compensated

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.033
in their auto-critique.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.580
Criticizing the assumption

01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.310
that the soul is invariably
a spiritual being

01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:04.670
they stressed the materiality

01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:06.400
of animist notions,

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.370
and of course, the accessibility

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.800
of the spirit world at large

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.380
to human needs and desires,

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.980
overplaying the material and mundane,

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.790
and reserving for themselves

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:20.420
a different kind of spirituality.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.240
A transcendental move

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.313
if there was one.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:27.690
But Ms. Zweybruck wonderful rubric

01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:30.010
concerning immortality

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:31.793
has lifted us out if this.

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:36.400
We simply do not need to concern ourselves

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.760
with the relation between body and soul

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.490
in the terms of materiality

01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:42.930
and spirituality;

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:45.143
the material and the immaterial.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.120
I threw in a playful aside

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.690
on the immortality of the body

01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:52.140
just to underlie

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.763
the ambiguities these terms introduce.

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:57.070
I hasten to add

01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:57.903
in that case,

01:02:57.903 --> 01:02:59.940
that this isn't getting rid of a binary

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.150
for the sake of doing so.

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.983
On the contrary.

01:03:02.983 --> 01:03:05.110
There's a powerful binary at play

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:07.583
in these immanentist
worlds, but it's not this.

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:10.190
We've already encountered it

01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:11.390
at one or two junctures.

01:03:12.679 --> 01:03:15.310
The contrast between what is seen

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.293
and what exists unseen.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.510
Melanesians are constantly testing

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:22.890
what it is they see.

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:25.540
Are you a living man or a dead one

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.393
was the whisper.

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.240
The unseen is many registers

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.740
from the secrecy that excludes

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.573
some

01:03:32.573 --> 01:03:35.550
to whole invisible counter worlds.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.730
And although of another time and place

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.020
I'm reminded of Mariane Ferme's

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.763
The Underneath of Things.

01:03:42.992 --> 01:03:44.425
What is invisible

01:03:44.425 --> 01:03:46.710
works as a motivating

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:49.820
potentially activating state of affairs

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:51.570
of which visible appearance

01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:52.940
may, or may not

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.993
offer a cue.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.200
In effect, this is a pairing

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.730
that may be turned inside out.

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:00.350
We might say that the visible

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:01.370
and the invisible

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.270
adhere to each other

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:06.463
rather like Mayengis
outer and inner souls.

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:09.523
At the outset

01:04:09.523 --> 01:04:11.860
I remarked on the kind of immortality

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.380
that the circulation of ideas

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.900
in the academy suggests.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.228
Not only in the notion
that one person's ideas

01:04:18.228 --> 01:04:20.920
maybe reborn as another's

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.473
but also that they are
purposefully regenerated.

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.950
Perhaps that makes less strange

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:30.840
some of these immanentist notions,

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.673
despite, of course

01:04:31.673 --> 01:04:33.993
different orientations
in many other respects.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.670
As to purposeful regeneration, however

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:40.230
let me be explicit

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.260
about what we might,

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.580
or might not want

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.593
to keep of Tyler's doctrine of souls.

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:48.150
As we've heard,

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.600
Tyler tied immortality

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.480
to a notion of an enduring

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.320
immaterial spiritual life.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.450
In animism

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:58.490
he demonstrated over and again

01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:00.060
to his own satisfaction

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.470
that what might look like
a notion of immortality

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:03.490
was diminished

01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:06.930
by not being immaterial enough.

01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:08.367
Thus, he wrote

01:05:08.367 --> 01:05:11.867
"Granted that the soul
survives the death of the body

01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:14.247
"Instance after instance from the records

01:05:14.247 --> 01:05:15.987
"Shows this soul to be regarded

01:05:15.987 --> 01:05:17.157
"As a mortal being

01:05:17.157 --> 01:05:18.847
"Liable like the body itself

01:05:18.847 --> 01:05:20.577
"To accidents and death."

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:23.330
In retrospect

01:05:23.330 --> 01:05:24.410
we can see

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:27.040
that combining immortal an immaterial

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.660
is simply repeated

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.970
in his opposite

01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:30.990
the identification

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:33.530
of the mortal with the material,

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:34.580
and it's not helpful.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.910
What we might like to keep

01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:40.070
is that in talking about soul

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:43.520
he found a common language
with his contemporaries

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.930
for all that he wished to disabuse them

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:48.310
of misconceptions about the origins

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:49.463
of religious thought.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.250
The problem of language recurs,

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.043
is born over and again.

01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:57.983
An English speaker cannot talk of soul

01:05:57.983 --> 01:06:00.000
with his opposite body,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.723
and body is the mortal bit.

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:04.670
Take that opposition away

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:07.573
and one subject matter seems to vanish.

01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:12.060
So rather than throwing out the concepts

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.840
The anthropologist may set them spinning

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.753
as I've tried to do here.

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:20.870
I have tethered the account instead

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:24.340
to areas of Melanesian
horticultural practice

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.140
insofar as these provide

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.690
a specific model

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:30.440
for thinking of everlasting life.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.273
Less, perhaps

01:06:31.273 --> 01:06:34.620
as an immortality frozen
at the moment of death

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.453
as in

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:40.050
some Euro-American views

01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:42.943
than as ceaseless regeneration.

01:06:44.207 --> 01:06:45.950
If we can identify as something

01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:47.710
as appropriate to call soul

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.370
and refer to its rebirth

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:51.560
within a kinship community,

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.540
it can also be identified

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.130
in the constant return

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:57.210
of fleshly nourishment

01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:59.450
to the soil and its cultivation

01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:01.060
and Melanesians themselves

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:01.940
may express this

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.550
by drawing attention to the life cycles

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:07.163
of the taro and yams they cultivate.

01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:10.090
Long ago

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:12.423
Haudricourt offered an apt formula.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.840
Apropos Melanesia,

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.720
people are cultivated during
their lifetime, he said.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.950
And indeed

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:23.670
planted is the way

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:27.770
we would have to translate
human in Hagen idiom,

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:30.923
as the Kuk archeologist Muke also attests.

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:36.800
And they cease to be cultivated at death.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.048
Ms. Zweybruck interest in immortality

01:07:39.048 --> 01:07:41.460
has opened up what it means

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.500
that such being are no longer themselves.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.810
Cultivated

01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:47.590
they survive now

01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:49.753
in the life of others.

01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:53.343
I have

01:07:54.948 --> 01:07:57.403
a very brief postscript if you will allow.

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:02.320
If you'll just indulge me.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.150
This is a postscript

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:06.263
for the anthropologists who are here.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.770
Ms. Zweybruck interest in immortality

01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:12.570
is not irrelevant

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.530
to the 20th century anthropology

01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.570
that flourished after animism

01:08:16.570 --> 01:08:18.163
had disappeared as a topic.

01:08:19.108 --> 01:08:23.020
There was a long period
when aspects of societies

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:26.120
that might formally have
been called animistic

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.610
were studied under the
rubric of categories

01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:29.840
more compatible

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.050
with self-acknowledged

01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:32.940
modern institutions

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.660
such as politics, economics,

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.273
religion and so forth.

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.040
For British social anthropologists

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.500
like myself

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.400
the social turn

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.560
that followed Durkheim's
transformative formula.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.690
Religion is society worshiping itself

01:08:48.690 --> 01:08:50.740
meant that there was a
great swing of interest

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.110
towards social organization

01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:55.110
including the prominence of institutions

01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:56.760
such as dissent groups

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.890
that is the interactions

01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:59.493
of clan and kin collectivities.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.560
This was a notable example

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.110
of anthropological rejuvenation and demise

01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:10.830
for dissent groups were
discovered in Melanesia

01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:12.203
and then discarded.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.810
The point to extract

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:17.920
is that when they were
occupying center stage

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.850
these constructs made
a kind of immortality

01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:23.023
visible to the anthropologist.

01:09:24.610 --> 01:09:27.750
As anthropologist uncovered
the powers and circumstances

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:30.490
of a markedly social life

01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:32.300
where political or economic interests

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.870
were seen to shape religious precepts

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:37.160
or kinship obligations,

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.400
they also brought attention

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.590
the dynamics of a self regenerating

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:44.273
social formation,

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.320
perpetual succession,

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.960
society enduring in its structures,

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.810
rolls reproduced,

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:52.873
and so forth.

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:57.110
Perhaps those immortal dissent groups

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.150
have since been

01:09:58.150 --> 01:09:59.810
too quickly dispatched

01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:01.453
from anthropological purview.

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.570
Indeed, one might revisit analyses

01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:06.090
of the way in which people are,

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:08.306
or are not caught up in kin groups

01:10:08.306 --> 01:10:10.220
as a model of self-formation

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:12.709
that also a collective formation.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.690
In order to query

01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:16.235
an axiomatic assumption

01:10:16.235 --> 01:10:20.340
that ran through the
early animist literature.

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.333
And I end on this point.

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:24.950
This was the assumption

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:26.770
that people's personal awareness

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:29.461
of their experience as sentient beings

01:10:29.461 --> 01:10:31.171
projected, it was argued

01:10:31.171 --> 01:10:33.167
onto their environment

01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:35.300
is sufficient to account

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.830
for their apprehensions

01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:38.313
and ideas.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.973
The notion that how
people perceive themselves

01:10:41.973 --> 01:10:44.460
is projected onto other entities

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.441
normalizes the soul

01:10:46.441 --> 01:10:49.873
as originating within the human being.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:53.400
Now, it's no doubt going too far

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.370
to suggest that people
gave themselves the souls

01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:59.510
they already recognized in other selves,

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:01.273
human or non-human.

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:03.840
But in any event

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.250
that notion of projection

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:07.570
has often rendered mute

01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:09.110
the state of affairs

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:12.160
encountered in immanentist regimes

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.550
and people's immortalizing work

01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:16.973
in keeping the world going.

01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:19.748
Thank you very much.

01:11:19.748 --> 01:11:21.998
(applause)

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.410
- [Paula] I'd really like
to thank professor Strathern

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:33.820
for making the world feel so much richer

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.389
and a lot more crowded, I would say.

01:11:36.389 --> 01:11:38.110
(laughter)

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:40.410
Professor Strathern will take questions

01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:44.870
and Ellen will take the
microphone around and...

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.970
- We ask that you

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.170
make these questions

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:50.003
and make them brief

01:11:50.003 --> 01:11:51.430
so everyone who

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:52.500
would like to ask something

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.520
has time to do so.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.630
So please raise your hand

01:11:55.630 --> 01:11:56.780
if you have a question.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.450
- [Marilyn] I have hearing problems

01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:08.040
so I need to come close to you

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.770
despite your microphone.

01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:11.390
- [Woman] I won't yell loudly then.

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:12.223
Thank you.

01:12:12.223 --> 01:12:13.056
Thank you so much.

01:12:13.056 --> 01:12:14.240
As an archeo-botanist

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.370
I just love this.

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:16.597
- Oh, thank you.

01:12:16.597 --> 01:12:18.090
- [Woman] But I did want
to ask you something

01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:20.820
that maybe too specific for your talk.

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.810
Anna Meigs has been a big influence on me

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:25.740
and she talks about this
life force called new Nu.

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.420
And I'm assuming you know about that

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.290
because it's from--

01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:30.290
- This is Anna Sing.

01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:31.210
- [Woman] No, Meigs.

01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:32.043
- Oh, sorry.

01:12:32.043 --> 01:12:32.876
- [Woman] Meigs.

01:12:32.876 --> 01:12:33.709
Anna Meigs.

01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:34.542
- Oh sorry, I beg your pardon.

01:12:34.542 --> 01:12:35.375
- [Woman] Meigs.

01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:36.208
- Oh Anna Meigs, yes of course.

01:12:36.208 --> 01:12:37.041
- [Woman] Yes.

01:12:37.041 --> 01:12:37.874
- I know Anna Meigs.

01:12:37.874 --> 01:12:38.707
- [Woman] Right, Nu.

01:12:38.707 --> 01:12:39.540
And I'm assuming

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.470
that's a version of the life force

01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:42.303
you were talking about.

01:12:42.303 --> 01:12:43.136
- Absolutely, yes.

01:12:43.136 --> 01:12:43.969
- [Woman] Would you say it's the same

01:12:43.969 --> 01:12:45.680
or different, how is it?

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.800
Because the focus that she talks about

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.700
is people gain life force through eating.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.739
Eating the food that's being generated--

01:12:53.739 --> 01:12:54.572
- Exactly.

01:12:54.572 --> 01:12:55.405
- [Woman] In the garden.

01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:56.370
And that is

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:57.960
certainly part of what
you were talking about

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.300
but you didn't say anything about that.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.870
If you could comment about

01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:02.070
eating.

01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:03.010
- Absolutely.

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:06.170
What she says is absolutely correct.

01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:07.603
That is part

01:13:07.603 --> 01:13:08.850
of the whole cycle.

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:10.240
And in course in eating

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.150
your also eating

01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:14.967
in those places that
regard plants having souls

01:13:14.967 --> 01:13:17.010
and not all do.

01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:19.638
But you are

01:13:19.638 --> 01:13:22.175
channeling the vitality

01:13:22.175 --> 01:13:23.970
of the plants as well

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:26.053
in that process.

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:29.320
Both sides are nourished.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.363
It's a mutual nourishment in a sense.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:35.090
Which is a non-consuming metaphor

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:36.110
if anybody wants to ask

01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:37.000
what the relevant of this is

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.462
to 21st century.

01:13:38.462 --> 01:13:40.712
(laughter)

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.550
- Surely there's at
least one more question.

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:52.363
- [Woman] As a comment.

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:56.306
This is coming from Tibetan Buddhism.

01:13:56.306 --> 01:13:57.560
(laughter)

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.580
So, there are three bodies

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:02.042
that emanate dharmakaya,

01:14:02.042 --> 01:14:03.193
sambhogakaya,

01:14:03.193 --> 01:14:04.026
and nirmanakaya

01:14:04.026 --> 01:14:04.980
It's this eminence

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.780
of presence in being

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.050
and everything appears

01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:10.000
in permanence.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.880
So it follows very nicely.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.090
I really appreciated what you had to say.

01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:15.990
And it's interesting

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:17.540
how different traditions

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.433
have very similar--

01:14:19.433 --> 01:14:20.266
- Yes.

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:22.510
- [Woman] Truth.

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:24.060
There's only one reality.

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.745
- But shouldn't I be
uncomfortable about that?

01:14:26.745 --> 01:14:28.010
- [Woman] How so?

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:29.850
- Shouldn't I regard

01:14:29.850 --> 01:14:31.050
forms Buddhism

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:33.053
as belonging to the transcendental?

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.700
- [Woman] It depends on
what kind of Buddhism

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.820
your talking about.
- Of course.

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:38.653
- [Woman] Yes.

01:14:38.653 --> 01:14:39.486
(laughter)

01:14:39.486 --> 01:14:40.319
- Sorry.

01:14:42.168 --> 01:14:43.001
- Thank you.

01:14:43.001 --> 01:14:44.834
- Thank you very much.

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:51.550
- [Man] Thank you very much Marilyn.

01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:53.700
I want to talk about the people

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.981
with whom I've worked Inuit, or Eskimos

01:14:55.981 --> 01:14:57.440
in northern Canada

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.630
because the kind of
arguments about immortality

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.680
have a great relevance today.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.880
One of which is the Canadian

01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:07.920
sorrow and anger

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.160
at the enormous suicide rate

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.670
amongst the indigenous peoples.

01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:13.930
Particularly the Inuit.

01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:15.433
Particularly young men.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.407
But the Inuit have

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:21.180
explicitly or tacitly

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:23.148
a belief in three souls.

01:15:23.148 --> 01:15:25.050
One of which is a breath soul

01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:26.350
that leaves you when you die.

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:27.740
Breath is a soul.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:28.573
The other one

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:30.930
it's a...

01:15:31.906 --> 01:15:33.210
I guess it's more like the

01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:34.150
kinds of soul

01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:35.520
that

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.860
when you die goes somewhere

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.880
but it doesn't reenter you.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.080
But the most important one

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.140
is the name.

01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:42.560
The name is the person, is the soul.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.150
And when a child is about to be born

01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:46.900
somebody is calling

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.179
the name of a past person,

01:15:48.179 --> 01:15:51.220
and when it is, its name, it comes out.

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.053
And, of course

01:15:52.053 --> 01:15:54.693
this means that they don't
designate men or women.

01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:57.210
So you are,

01:15:57.210 --> 01:15:58.690
you may be called by your mother,

01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:00.110
grandfather or great uncle

01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.943
or something like that

01:16:00.943 --> 01:16:02.100
because that's who you are,

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.330
which is one of the reasons

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:04.969
that children are treated
with some respect,

01:16:04.969 --> 01:16:07.150
or supposed to be.

01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:07.983
But nowadays

01:16:07.983 --> 01:16:10.380
the Canadian government
and many other people

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:11.213
are really worried

01:16:11.213 --> 01:16:12.610
about the high suicide rate.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:14.200
But from the point of view

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.010
of many of the young people

01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:18.110
and this is the work of Lisa Stevenson

01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:21.160
who got a Ph.D. at
Berkeley a few years ago.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.480
They say, well

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.790
my friend dies recently

01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:26.130
or my friend committed suicide recently.

01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:27.110
And he's up there

01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:28.660
and I'd love to join him.

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:30.120
I miss him.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.170
I don't particularly like it here anyhow.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.080
So

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.250
maybe I'll go off in my
truck and shoot myself

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:38.880
or otherwise commit suicide.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.540
Then, I'll see who I become the next time.

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:42.373
After all,

01:16:42.373 --> 01:16:44.040
I've been alive for thousands of years.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.520
I am the same person

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.830
for thousands of years.

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:49.563
- [Marilyn] Fascinating, thank you.

01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:51.400
Thank you for that.

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.293
Put it in a nut shell.

01:16:59.110 --> 01:17:01.720
- [Woman] I am curious about the structure

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.970
of your talk.

01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:04.060
The eight posts.

01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.393
- [Marilyn] Yes.

01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:09.030
- [Woman] Have you used that before

01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:10.970
in giving a talk?

01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:12.340
- [Marilyn] Well

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.220
I wasn't showing any slides.

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:17.100
There was no relief from the text.

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.054
- [Woman] Right.

01:17:18.054 --> 01:17:19.810
(laughter)

01:17:19.810 --> 01:17:20.643
- So I thought

01:17:21.513 --> 01:17:22.670
it might actually help

01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:25.090
if there was a little joke

01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:27.218
that recurred

01:17:27.218 --> 01:17:29.030
at intervals.

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:30.750
But it also enabled me to do

01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:31.583
something of course

01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:32.910
which I have used

01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:34.120
many times,

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.997
which is to juxtapose
quite different material.

01:17:35.997 --> 01:17:37.773
I think I should bring it together.

01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:40.440
That is device.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.720
You start far apart

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.730
and then by the end

01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:44.452
you put it together.

01:17:44.452 --> 01:17:46.220
And that's a device I'd often use, yes.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.053
But on this occasion

01:17:47.053 --> 01:17:47.886
it was because

01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:51.029
there was no other relief.

01:17:51.991 --> 01:17:54.060
- [Woman] It worked beautifully.

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.900
And I think it did help

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.620
the listener to also visualize

01:17:58.620 --> 01:17:59.940
the posts

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.010
and urged us

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.550
to make connections.

01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:04.160
- [Marilyn] They ruined
my head, about this high.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.130
- [Woman] Oh yeah.

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:06.191
(laughter)

01:18:06.191 --> 01:18:08.730
And you transmitted that to ours as well.

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:09.563
Thank you.

01:18:09.563 --> 01:18:10.396
(laughter)

01:18:10.396 --> 01:18:11.229
- Thank you so much.

01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:12.433
I really appreciate that comment.

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:19.380
- [Man] Since you have
reanimated for us animism

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:24.360
I wonder of you can
also reconstitute for us

01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:27.380
where we stand

01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:30.650
as something that's not animistic.

01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:32.270
You mentioned Euro-America

01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:33.180
or something like that

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.670
which sounds like
Disneyland, or something.

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:37.503
- [Marilyn] Yes.

01:18:37.503 --> 01:18:39.750
- [Man] But how would you characterize

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:42.038
this Euro-American idea

01:18:42.038 --> 01:18:45.543
insofar as it's different from animism?

01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:47.983
- Yes.

01:18:47.983 --> 01:18:49.450
Perhaps I should make very clear.

01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:52.130
I'm not actually doing a comparison

01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:55.600
between Euro-American
societies and cultures

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.060
and these other Melanesian
societies and cultures.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:59.590
And those two terms

01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:01.200
are not on a par

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.731
even though I label them

01:19:02.731 --> 01:19:04.403
as though they are.

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:07.010
The point is that

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.350
the language through which I'm describing

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:14.960
what I'm trying to describe in Melanesia

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.140
is of itself os a particular historical

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.190
cultural moment.

01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:21.720
And it is labeling that moment.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.940
So I am actually labeling
the language I use

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.603
as Euro-American.

01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:32.150
I think that's probably
the best way I can;

01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:34.773
but as to, well.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.801
Sorry.

01:19:38.801 --> 01:19:41.423
I'm getting really out of my depth here.

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:44.730
But insofar as that little contrast

01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:47.700
between transcendentalism and immanentism

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.533
has any force,

01:19:48.533 --> 01:19:50.780
it is of course countlessly reinvented

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:51.790
at every moment

01:19:53.253 --> 01:19:54.730
of religious

01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:55.640
reformation

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.410
of diverse kinds

01:19:58.820 --> 01:19:59.840
for 2000 years

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.420
as far as Christianity.

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:03.890
So, things are identified

01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:07.040
as one or the other, constantly.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.360
So it's a constantly reinvented

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.250
duo.

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:14.140
Which means that we
shouldn't be at all surprised

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.106
to find ourselves doing
immanentist things.

01:20:17.106 --> 01:20:20.690
That's not an issue.

01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:21.610
The only thing is

01:20:21.610 --> 01:20:24.480
that if you start talking that way

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:29.700
then you evoke

01:20:32.003 --> 01:20:33.600
a problem sometimes

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:35.840
because they look as though

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.680
you're being superstitious

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.079
or you're not being rational.

01:20:39.079 --> 01:20:41.540
Or whatever, whatever.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:42.840
But it's not a problem

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.530
that the immanentists I'm talking about

01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:46.570
have.

01:20:46.570 --> 01:20:48.760
It's only a problem of
immanentist behavior

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.480
within a transcendentalist position.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.353
But I'm sorry about those awkward terms.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.570
- [Ellen] We have time
for one more question.

01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:00.900
There will be time after the lectures

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:01.770
if you'd like to speak

01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:03.543
to professor Strathern.

01:21:03.543 --> 01:21:04.471
- [Woman] Thank you.

01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:06.027
- [Marilyn] Sorry.

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:08.840
- [Woman] Thank you so much for the talk.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.250
I have a more personal question

01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:14.310
for how you decided

01:21:15.702 --> 01:21:16.900
the topic of this,

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.851
I know it's linked to the lecture

01:21:18.851 --> 01:21:23.160
but where does your inspiration

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.240
to think about concepts

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.390
the way think.

01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:27.950
And thinking through relations

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:29.260
with relations come from.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:33.530
It's like this memories
from your experience

01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:34.730
in Melanesia?

01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:36.710
Or, do you need to go back

01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:38.529
to conversations.

01:21:38.529 --> 01:21:43.233
Do you need to go personally back there?

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.903
I'm just wondering

01:21:44.903 --> 01:21:46.100
where these kind of

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.270
force come from

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:51.100
that makes you think

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:52.193
from the limit.

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:54.573
Yeah.

01:21:54.573 --> 01:21:55.406
- [Marilyn] Alright, thank you.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.503
That's actually a very important question.

01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:05.450
Because I've been doing

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.452
what many scholars do

01:22:09.452 --> 01:22:12.070
which is mingle their thoughts

01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:13.860
in with the material

01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.460
that they're trying to describe.

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:18.280
In one sense that's completely

01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:21.450
unavoidable.

01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:24.410
Because you can only order that material

01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:26.800
by conceptualizing it

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.113
in certain ways.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.711
Actually,

01:22:33.711 --> 01:22:35.140
that's one thing I could say in my favor.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.971
Don't let me forget it.

01:22:36.971 --> 01:22:39.580
(laughter)

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:40.483
Clenched my hand.

01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:45.460
You're completely right
to ask the question

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.700
because one has to keep that process

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.100
really under control.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.330
One has to be constantly self-scrutinizing

01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:54.180
the categories

01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:57.633
through which one's
thinking and presenting.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.450
I don't know how

01:23:01.450 --> 01:23:04.730
familiar you are with
anthropological procedures

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:07.970
but everything I've talked about

01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:11.570
is rooted in descriptions.

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:12.403
It will be made

01:23:12.403 --> 01:23:13.630
by numerous anthropologists

01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:16.070
across Melanesia.

01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:18.300
So almost all my

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:20.770
baseline

01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.920
observations are documented by others

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.396
and that's what I mean

01:23:27.396 --> 01:23:29.296
by referring to ethnographic accounts.

01:23:30.314 --> 01:23:32.210
Then of course I've spun things

01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:35.858
because of the pleasure of spinning.

01:23:35.858 --> 01:23:38.108
(laughter)

01:23:38.957 --> 01:23:40.380
But in my own favor

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:41.570
I will say that

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.820
one or two Papua New Guinea academics

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.160
who've read the Gender of the Gift

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.680
think it gives a reasonable

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.513
account.

01:23:51.513 --> 01:23:52.346
So,

01:23:52.346 --> 01:23:56.276
I think maybe the
spinning sometimes works.

01:23:56.276 --> 01:23:58.419
(laughter)

01:23:58.419 --> 01:24:00.669
(applause)

01:24:01.521 --> 01:24:03.938
(soft music)
