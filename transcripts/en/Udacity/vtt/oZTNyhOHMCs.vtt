00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This next question asks about the handshake protocol in TOR.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the handshake protocol, which is based on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Alice sends Bob g^x encrypted with Bob's public key

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and Bob responds with g^y and the hash of K plus the handshake

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
where K is g^xy, which is the shared symmetric key.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The question is, why does the response include the hash of K and the handshake.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
