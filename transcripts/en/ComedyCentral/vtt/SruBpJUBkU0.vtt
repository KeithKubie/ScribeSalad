As we go to our next game,
Swipecasting. Swipecasting.

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:09.109
-I've got some work to do here.
-Now,

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.445
I'm gonna show you a series
of eligible bachelors

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.447
and other types of
eligible things, and I want you

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.650
to ring in to swipe left
or swipe right,

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.919
but you have to tell us why,
all right?

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.255
That's the most important thing.
First up, Urkel.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:22.789
Here he is. Yes, Liza.

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:24.791
Swipe right.
Nerds eat mad (bleep).

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.393
All right.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.128
(cheering and applause)

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.097
(laughing):
Oh!

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:34.368
Next up, Jar Jar Binks.
Jar Jar Binks.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.569
Yes, Dom.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.571
Uh, swipe right,
'cause I'm an ear guy.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.575
-(laughing): Yeah.
Points. Points. -Oh.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.544
Uh...

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.983
Uh, next up, Gronk. Huh?

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.652
-Liza.
-Swipe right.

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.187
I've always wanted to make out

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.922
with someone
that was like a cute Shrek.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.190
-Yeah, points.
-You know?

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.625
(laughing):
A cute Shrek.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.729
Next up, Oprah.

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:04.665
-Mamrie.
-Uh, swipe right

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.267
'cause I want to show her
the cover of my <i>O-face Magazine.</i>

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:09.536
Yes, points.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.673
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.675
And she's eating bread again,
and I love bread.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.610
What would the cover
of that magazine look like?

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.745
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Okay, all right.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:21.415
And finally, Drake.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.150
Yes, Mamrie.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:26.320
Uh, swipe left, because
da grass is always greener.

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.121
Oh, what?!

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.523
Oh...

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.391
Oh, my stomach.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:32.860
Oh!

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:32.960
Oh, my stomach.
