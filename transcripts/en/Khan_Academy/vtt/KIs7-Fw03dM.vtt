00:00:00.326 --> 00:00:02.705
- [Instructor] We are asked,
what is the critical value

00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:05.733
t star or t asterisk for constructing

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.137
a 98% confidence interval for a mean

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:13.304
from a sample size of n is
equal to 15 observations?

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:16.521
So just as a reminder
of what's going on here,

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:19.630
you have some population,
there's a parameter here,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.368
let's say it's the population mean,

00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:25.046
we do not know what this
is so we take a sample.

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:27.716
Here, we're gonna take a sample of 15.

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:29.850
So n is equal to 15.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.078
And from that sample, we
can calculate a sample mean.

00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:36.310
But we also wanna construct
a 98% confidence interval

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.874
about that sample mean.

00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:39.968
So we're gonna go take that sample mean

00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:42.731
and we're gonna go plus or
minus some margin of error.

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:44.437
Now in other videos, we have talked about

00:00:44.437 --> 00:00:46.488
that we wanna use the t distribution here

00:00:46.488 --> 00:00:50.057
because we don't want to
underestimate the margin of error.

00:00:50.057 --> 00:00:51.885
So it's going to be t star

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.360
times the sample standard deviation

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.639
divided by the square
root of our sample size

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.845
which in this case was going to be 15,

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:02.165
so square root of n.

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:03.881
But what they're asking us is well

00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:05.669
what is the appropriate critical value?

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:10.036
What is the t star that we
should use in this situation?

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.232
And so we're about to look at a,

00:01:12.232 --> 00:01:15.291
as you would call it, a t
table instead of a z table.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:16.821
But the key thing to realize

00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:19.639
is there's one extra variable
to take into consideration

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:22.716
when we're looking up the
appropriate critical value

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:27.479
on a t table and that's this
notion of degree of freedom.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.592
Sometimes it's abbreviated df.

00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:31.983
And I'm not gonna go in
depth on degrees of freedom.

00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:34.793
It's actually a pretty deep concept.

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.111
But it's this idea that you actually have

00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:37.800
a different t distribution

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.714
depending on the different sample sizes.

00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:42.623
Depending on the degrees of freedom.

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:45.041
And your degree of freedom is going to be

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:47.195
your sample size minus one.

00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:49.116
So in this situation,
our degree of freedom

00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:51.758
is going to be 15 minus one.

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:54.175
So in this situation,
our degree of freedom

00:01:54.175 --> 00:01:55.972
is going to be equal to 14.

00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:58.469
And this isn't the first
time that we have seen this.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.259
We talked a little bit
about degrees of freedom

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.461
when we first talked about
sample standard deviations

00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:04.973
and how to have an unbiased estimate

00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:07.077
for the population standard deviation.

00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:08.345
And in future videos, we're going

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:11.088
to more advanced conversations
about degrees of freedom.

00:02:11.088 --> 00:02:13.283
But for the purposes of this example,

00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:17.274
you need to know that when
you're look at the t distribution

00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:18.990
for a given degree of freedom,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.053
your degree of freedom is
based on this sample size,

00:02:21.053 --> 00:02:22.829
and it's going to be your
sample size minus one

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.609
when we're thinking about
a confidence interval

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.548
for your mean.

00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:28.722
So now let's look at the t table.

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:32.437
So we want a 98% confidence interval

00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:35.604
and we want a degree of freedom of 14.

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:39.541
So let's get our t table out

00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.391
and I actually copy and
pasted this bottom part,

00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:43.421
moved it up so you can
see the whole thing here.

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:45.565
And what's useful about this t table is

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:48.032
they actually give our confidence
levels right over here.

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:50.339
So if you want a confidence level of 98%,

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.735
you're going to look at this column,

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:55.561
you're gonna look at this
column right over here.

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:59.015
Another way of thinking about
a confidence level of 98%,

00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:02.686
if you have a confidence level of 98%,

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:05.591
that means you're leaving 1%

00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:08.802
unfilled in at either end of the tail

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:10.964
and so if you're looking
at your t distribution

00:03:10.964 --> 00:03:14.012
everything up to including that top 1%,

00:03:14.012 --> 00:03:17.762
you would look for a
tail probability of 0.01

00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:21.489
which is, you can't see
it right over there,

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.909
let me do it in a slightly brighter color,

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.796
which would be that tail
probability to the right.

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:27.677
But either way, we're in
this column right over here,

00:03:27.677 --> 00:03:29.526
we have a confidence level of 98%.

00:03:29.526 --> 00:03:33.109
And remember, our degree
of freedom here is

00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:38.303
we have 14 degrees of freedom and so,

00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:41.928
we'll look at this row right over here,

00:03:41.928 --> 00:03:43.260
and so there you have it,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
this is our critical t value, 2.624.

00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:50.948
Let's just go back over here.

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:56.245
And so there you have it,
we have 2.624 is our answer.
