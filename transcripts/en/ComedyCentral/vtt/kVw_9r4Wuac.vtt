What's going on people?

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:03.569 line:0%
Kevin Hart here.

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.571 line:0%
And we are at Baddies Comedy Co.

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.040 line:0%
Obviously, I'm not
here by myself.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.808 line:0%
I'm with some
talented comedians,

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:15.615 line:0%
Greg Coleman, Earl Elliot, Bruce
Leroy Williams, and Ali Sultan.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:16.549 line:0%
Take 1.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.317 line:0%
Where you from, Ali?

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.452 line:0%
Well, live in Minneapolis.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.220
But I moved here 13--

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:22.622
13 years ago from Yemen.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.457
How long you
been doing comedy?

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.459
I attempted it
seven years ago.

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.261
But I've been active
for the last five years.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.329
Define that, so
people can understand.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:31.697
Like when say active.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.567
So the first year, I
did like seven open mic.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.335
That doesn't help at all.

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:39.539
You don't learn anything from
going up seven times a year.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.340
You have to do at least
seven times a week,

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:42.642
I think, to just get started.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.610
So what inspired you
to start doing stand up?

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:46.546
Did somebody else help
push you in that direction?

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.247
Or were you like, you know what?

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.549
I just want to give it a shot.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:50.783 line:0%
I always wanted to
be a stand up as a kid.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.452 line:0%
But I grew up in a
athletic house, man.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:54.120 line:0%
I had uncles pro ball.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.321
My father was a pro ball player.

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:56.522
Did they you look
at you like yeah,

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.758
man, you ain't repping
the family name.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:00:59.592
We be out there.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:00.793
We-- we play ball.

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:01.794
I mean--

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:02.795
Quit telling jokes, sucker.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.097
- He was a punter.
- OK.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.730
Oh, shit.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.165
Oh, Jesus.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:07.667
He was the first
black punter in the NFL.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.668
So it wasn't like--

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.203
he wasn't like a linebacker.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.204
You know, what I mean?

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.505
That's tough.

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:13.639
Because eventually, you
got to call him out.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:15.608
Dad, you-- you the
fucking punter.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:18.578
Stop talking like you was
our there laying the hat.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.313
If you had to describe
your style of comedy,

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.881
what would it be?

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.117
Majority of the people in the
world grow up in a struggle.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.852
And that's what I talk
about, growing up struggling.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.353
OK.

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:28.454 line:0%
I quit my job, not
knowing that any of this

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.522 line:0%
was gonna happen.

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:30.723 line:0%
Today marks two months--

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:31.824 line:0%
Two months?

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:33.292
Being out, being
an entrepreneur.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:34.794
We fre-- we fresh
off the system

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:36.395
Oh, super fresh.
Super fresh.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:37.830
Do you feel like it's
important for an audience

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:39.632
to leave understanding
who you guys are?

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:41.267
Very much so.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.602
Or would you rather an
audience leave just saying,

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.170
oh my god, he was the
funniest person ever?

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:45.605
I don't do it for them.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:46.439
I do it for me.

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:47.306
KEVIN HART: OK.

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.342
Does that make sense?

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.511
Like if-- if I
worked at a bank, I'd

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.412
be sitting outside talking to
myself, smoking a cigarette,

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:54.447
looking like a crazy person.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.481
So I go on stage.

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:56.616
That's where-- that's for me.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.783
And if they like
it, they like it.

00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:59.485
What does this
moment mean to you?

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:00.887
Oh, man, it's--

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.856
it's literally history,
because no one has ever

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.491
been on TV from my country--

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:07.260
KEVIN HART: OK.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.497
Who has not been like on an
FBI, like, most wanted show.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.403
I'm excited to see you
guys perform tonight.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:18.704
I'm here to support a man.

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:21.741
So without further ado,
let's get to it, man.
