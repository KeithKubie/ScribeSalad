00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
For this quiz, your goal is to define the procedure add page to index

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.689
that takes 3 inputs. The 1st is the index,

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.510
and I've drawn a picture of index to remind you of its structure--

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.980
and it's a list where each entry in the list is a list containing a key,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.890
and the list of the URLs where that keyword is found.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.750
The 2nd input is the URL--

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.320
so that's the location of the page, where the content came from--

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.330
And the 3rd input is the content.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.230
That's the entire text of the page at that location where URL is.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.270
The results should be updating the index to include all word occurrences

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.810
found in the page content by adding the URL to the words associated URL list.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.580
I'll show you a few examples so it is clear what add to index should do,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.150
and then you'll have a chance to define it yourself.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.550
We're going to start with an empty index--

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.320
and we'll call add page to index--

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.360
and let's print out what index looks like after this--

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.190
it's a little hard to see like that, so let's see what index position zero is.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.099
We can see that the keyword this appears at the URL "fake test"

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.940
if we print index at position 1

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.040
we'll see the same thing, but this time for the keyword is.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.640
We have an entry,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.710
we have an index,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.640
we have 4 words in our index

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.450
this is a and test

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.820
and for each word, the list of URLs where each word appears is fake.test

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.090
which is what we passed in as the URL here.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.390
Let's try adding some other things to our index.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.860
This time, we'll add a page called real.test.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
and have the content of the page be this is not a test.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.430
Now, when we run this, we see this index

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.070
if we look at a particular element--let's look at the element at position 2--

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.210
it has 2 entries in its URL list--

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.640
since both of the pages we passed in contain is--

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.010
and if you look at index position 4--

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.990
we see that for the word not--that only appears on the real.test page--

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.720
so there's only 1 entry in it's URL list.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.160
We already defined the procedure for respond to new query.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.490
So, that should work on this index. Let's try.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:14.030
Look up takes the index and the keyword and returns the list of URLs at that keyword.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.670
Delete the previous tests, and see what happens when we look up is,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.340
we see that it occurs on both pages--

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.450
if we look up udacity--it doesn't occur anywhere so far.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.020
I hope it's clear now what add to index page should do--

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.020
see if you can write the code to define add page to index.
