JONATHAN: Good
morning, and welcome

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.860
to Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.970
Today, it's my great pleasure to
introduce Doctor Alan Lightman

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.585
who's here to discuss
his most recent book,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.890
"The Accidental Universe: The
World You Thought You Knew".

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.300
I could easily spend the next
10 minutes detailing his CV.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.320
But in the interest
of time, I'm just

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.880
going through out a
bunch of things from it.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.550
Novelist, essayist,
physicist, educator, professor

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.650
of science and writing
and senior lecturer

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.340
in physics at MIT.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.510
Co-founded the graduate program
in science writing at MIT.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.500
Co-founded the catalyst
collaborative at MIT.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.210
A collaboration between MIT and
the underground railway theater

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.670
of Boston.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.700
Distinguished physicist
and accomplished novelist.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.480
First professor at MIT to
receive a joint appointment

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.150
in the sciences
and the humanities.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.450
His novel, "Einstein's Dreams",
was an international best

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.310
seller and has been
translated into 30 languages.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.960
His novel, "The
Diagnosis", was a finalist

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.150
for the 2000 National
Book Award in fiction.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.440
He founded the
Harpswell Foundation,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.760
a nonprofit organization
whose mission

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.700
is to empower a new
generation of women leaders

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.250
in Cambodia and the developing
world, and on and on and on.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.180
He's also married to Jean
Lightman, one of the absolutely

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.560
most talented and notable
painters in Boston.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.210
And that's barely
scratching the surface.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.842
Please join me in
welcoming Alan Lightman.

00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:41.101
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.142
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Thank you.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.960
Thank you, Jonathan.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.430
It's very nice to
be here at Google.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.300
And I'm especially
grateful to you

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.770
for mentioning my wife who
is a wonderful painter.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.389
I went to Google a few years
ago to your Mountain View

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.080
headquarters and
gave a talk there.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.750
And I've always been
a great fan of Google.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.100
My talk today is going to be
a little piece of my book,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.180
"The Accidental Universe".

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.980
It's going to deal with
science and religion.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.280
And I'm going to first
briefly summarise

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.400
some of the high
points of science

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.150
over the last few
centuries that touch

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.245
upon theological, philosophical,
and ethical issues.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.415
The main trend of science over
the centuries is, as you know,

00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:52.050
has been to enlarge
the domain of what

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.410
we call the physical
universe and to provide

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.470
material and rational and
scientific explanations

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.115
for most phenomena in
the physical universe.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.990
After that, I'm going
to turn to religion.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.170
And I'm going to discuss
the kind of religious belief

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.860
that is compatible with science,
which does not necessarily

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.585
involve or require
a belief in God.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.056
I'm going to talk about the
different kinds of knowledge

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:28.252
that science and religion have
and the differences in the way

00:03:28.252 --> 00:03:29.585
that they obtain that knowledge.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.130
And finally, I'll
talk a little bit

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.720
about what I will call
the spiritual universe.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.740
And I will define exactly
what I mean by that

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.230
and suggest that there is
a spiritual universe that

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.195
exists alongside the
physical universe.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.220
Let me start with biology.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.450
And one of the leading
paradigm beliefs

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.900
in biology for centuries has
been really a controversy

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.580
between two different views.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.950
The view of what we can
call the mechanists who

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.260
believe that
everything in the body

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.150
is just a matter of springs
and pulleys and weights

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.050
and that you can
understand everything

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.990
about the body in terms
of physics, chemistry,

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.360
and biology.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.290
A purely material
view of the body.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.970
And then there are
the vitalists who

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.690
have believed that there is some
additional non-material essence

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.750
of the body in the
body that provides

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.590
energy and spirit and so on.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.310
Plato, Aristotle,
Descartes, were vitalists.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.790
The first mechanist
was Baruch Spinoza.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.110
And if any of you know his
work, you will know for sure.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.275
You will certainly understand
that he was a mechanist.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.670
In the 1800s, a
German physician named

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.620
Julius Mayer proposed that all
of the energy needs of the body

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.085
can be provided by food.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.550
That is a purely
material explanation

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.490
for the energy use of the body.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:47.306
And a little bit later, a German
physiologist-- Max Rubner--

00:05:47.306 --> 00:05:48.180
did some experiments.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.310
What he did was he looked
at the energy requirements

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.480
of the body both in motion
and just in generating heat.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.450
Everything that requires energy.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.370
And he tabulated that up.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.525
And then he compared it to
the energy content of food.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.350
And he concluded, looking
at a number of people,

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.290
that the energy
demands of the body

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.400
were, in fact, completely
supplied exactly by the food

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.300
that we eat.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.680
So this is a purely
material explanation

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.930
for energy uses of the body.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.200
Of course, another
major development

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.920
of biology that everyone
knows is the discovery of DNA

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.750
and the structure
of DNA, which is

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.160
a material explanation
for the command

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.015
and control and
reproduction of the body.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.440
Here's an example of
a particular string

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.530
of genetic code that codes
for 9 amino acids with three

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.495
molecules needed to
specify each amino acid.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.510
We now know, of course, that not
all the information in the body

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:15.610
is given in the genes that there
is environmental aspects where

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.150
the environment of the body
and actually experiences

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.110
can alter genes by either
turning them on or turning them

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.610
off.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.450
So it's a more
complicated picture

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.230
that we have now than we
did in the 1950s and '60s.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.110
But still, it's a purely
material understanding

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.470
of the command and control
and production of proteins

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.740
and so on in the body.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:50.270
If we move to the brain,
of course, the mind,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.100
body debate has been a
major philosophical debate

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.770
for centuries
whether the mind is

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.300
something separate
from the body.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.950
We now understand
or most scientists

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.420
believe that the mind is really
nothing more than the material

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.535
action of the brain,
the set of neurons,

00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:13.795
and the communication
between neurons.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.680
As you know, the brain has
about 100 billion neurons.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.580
And each one of them has
1,000 connections, roughly,

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.535
with other neurons.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.680
We now know how
information is stored

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.830
in the neurons, both short term
memory and long term memory,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.630
as a result of work
by Eric Kandel.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.805
We know how the brain is able
to pay attention to things.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.270
When we're paying
attention to something

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.530
and ignoring something
else, the neurons that

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.560
are paying attention,
their electrical impulses

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.830
all become synchronized with
each other like, of course,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.500
singing in unison.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.040
So we have learned quite
a lot about the way

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.970
that the brain functions at
the neuronal level and even

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:02.910
the molecular level.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.650
There still is, of course,
a tremendous amount

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.800
that we don't know.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.540
We don't really understand
consciousness, sort of,

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.040
the higher cognitive functions.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.650
Many biologists believe
that even consciousness

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.640
will eventually be
understood in terms

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.685
of the actions of
individual neurons.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.300
It's only a matter of time and,
in fact, Google may actually

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.760
be involved with this
before we have creatures

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.570
that are part machine
and part human.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.910
And of course,
that will bring up

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.665
many philosophical
and ethical issues.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.310
If I just go back to
the brain for a moment,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.090
there's a question of one
of the other longstanding

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.780
philosophical questions is
do we have free will or not.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.330
Are we free to make decisions?

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:17.350
And now that we know the action
of the brain at the level

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:22.350
of individual
neurons, the question

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.300
is what does freedom
really mean when you're

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.780
looking at individual neurons?

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.370
We still believe, of course,
that there's cause and effect

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.860
relationships in
the material brain.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.770
But what does it mean
to ask the question

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.910
do we have freedom of choice
at the neuronal level?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.950
So there's still a lot
of questions that remain,

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.950
even though we have a
largely material explanation

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.300
for everything in the
body and in the brain.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.245
So let me turn now to physics.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:03.010
And one of the-- Lucretius
was a Roman poet.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.700
But I also thinking
of him as a physicist

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.800
because he was one
of the first people

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.160
to put forth the atomic
view of the world, which

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.850
is that everything is made
out of indestructible atoms

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.120
and the properties
of materials derived

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.870
from the shapes and the
textures of individual atoms.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.590
It was really a causal
material explanation

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.500
for all of the phenomenon
in the universe.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.850
And Lucretius really was
one of the first people who

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.155
had the concept of
a law of nature.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.210
And what I mean
by a law of nature

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.090
or the laws of
nature-- first of all,

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.290
there's the idea that
nature obeys laws.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.550
Secondly, that those laws
are quantifiable, usually

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.170
in terms of mathematics and
apply everywhere in the cosmos.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.420
And finally, that the laws are
discoverable by human beings.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.045
And that last point is,
of course, very important.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:14.660
Galileo was the first
scientist to put forth

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.790
a quantitative law of
nature, a mathematical law.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.020
And that was his law
of falling bodies,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.900
which he proposed in 1590.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.200
And that is that the time
that it takes an object

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.060
to fall a certain
distance-- I mean,

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.650
the distance that an object
falls in a certain time

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.530
is proportional of
the square of the time

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.488
that it's been falling.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.900
So in one second, it
will fall one foot.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.290
In two seconds, it
will fall four feet.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.440
In three seconds, nine feet.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.020
Something-- that's
the mathematical form.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.340
Of course, if you put a
ball on an incline plane,

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.180
it will fall at a
different speed.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.790
But it will still follow
this law of fallen bodies

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.620
that the distance fallen is
proportional to the square

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.160
of the time that it's falling.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.570
This was a quantitative law.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:12.850
And it was a special case of
Isaac Newton's law of gravity.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:21.450
And of course, one of the
great things that Newton did

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.580
is he proposed that
gravity on Earth

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.580
works the same as
gravity in the cosmos.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.120
That the laws in the
cosmos are really

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.690
the same as the laws on earth.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.470
There's a single universal
law of gravitation

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.525
that applies everywhere.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.620
I'm sorry.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.786
I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.290
So by the end of
the 20th century,

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:01.790
we can say that
physicists had given us

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.960
the notion that there's a
strong connectedness of all

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.190
the phenomenon.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.060
Earth and the heavens.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.465
That everything obeys the
same universal physical laws.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.140
So I'm going to turn now
and end with a few comments

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.750
about astronomy.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.357
And of course, I'm going over
centuries of science very,

00:14:24.357 --> 00:14:26.815
very quickly and just pointing
out a few of the highlights.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.020
As you all know, the early
astronomers and scientists

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.735
believe that the Earth was
the center of the cosmos.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.720
Very good physical
reason for believing so.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.160
When we go outside at
night, we see the planets

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.020
and stars revolving around us.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.820
So it's certainly
very natural to think

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.445
that we're at the
center of the cosmos.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:56.520
Copernicus proposed
otherwise that it

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.665
is the sun at the
center of the cosmos.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.340
A sun centered cosmology.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.030
And one of the earliest
questions to come up

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.830
was how long has
the cosmos existed.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.410
Has it existed
forever, or was it

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.720
created at a finite
time in the past?

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.280
This is a question,
of course, that

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.013
has both scientific and
theological reverberations.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:31.090
The astronomer who settled
this issue was Edwin Hubble.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.300
An American astronomer.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.380
He was a Rhodes Scholar.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.080
He was a boxer.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.220
He had a law degree.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.620
But instead of going into
law, he went into astronomy.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:54.060
And around 1929, using
this telescope-- the Hooker

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.840
telescope; 100
inches in diameter;

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.460
the largest telescope
in the world

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.350
at that time on Mount
Wilson California-- Hubble

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.205
saw evidence for the
expansion of the universe.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.700
What he saw was a
picture like this

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.060
with all the galaxies
moving away from each other.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.800
And he didn't
realize exactly what

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.290
he was sitting at the time.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.110
But combining his observations
with the theoretical work

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:30.340
of other astronomers, including
Einstein, we eventually

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.570
came to the conclusion that
the universe is expanding.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.900
You can play that
movie backwards

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.720
with all of the
galaxies getting closer

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.770
and closer to each other.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.020
And you can conclude
that the universe began

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.390
about 14 billion years ago
in a state of very, very

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.820
high density when all of
the matter of the universe

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.020
was crushed into a region
smaller than an atom.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.150
And there are a
number of other routes

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.980
that we can get to that number
of about 14 billion years.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.920
We can also date the
oldest stars that we see.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.369
We can date the age of the
Earth from radioactive rocks.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:13.650
And all of them give numbers
within a factor of two

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.170
that are consistent with
about 14 billion years.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:22.319
And every time I think about
that discovery it just blows

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:29.260
my mind that we little creatures
here on this one planet

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.950
orbiting an ordinary
star in one galaxy

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:37.840
can figure out that our
whole universe began

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.940
at a certain finite
time in the past

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.890
and actually calculate
when that was.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.870
That's just an
incredible accomplishment

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.655
of the human mind.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.880
We actually have a
quantitative theory

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:01.420
for the universe from its
beginning 14 billion years ago.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.920
And this, for
example, is a graph

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.290
of the temperature of the
universe from the beginning

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.050
to equal zero until now.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:18.400
Each one of those marks on
the x-axis is a factor of 10

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:25.050
to the 10 different bigger or
smaller than the adjacent mark.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:32.289
You can see that we are
very recent in this picture,

00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:33.330
at least logarithmically.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.200
The first planets were here.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.640
The first atomic nuclei when
the universe was around a second

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.970
old, that's when the
first atoms began forming.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:53.410
And we can trace the history
of the universe quantitatively

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.850
and mathematically all
the way back to about 10

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.430
to the minus 35 seconds.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.800
And that is when
the universe went

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.570
through the so-called
inflationary period

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.380
where it began
expanding very, very

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.010
rapidly for just a tiny
fraction of a second.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.165
We don't know what came before
10 to the minus 35 seconds.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.720
That's an incredibly small time.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.190
That's about one trillionth
of one trillionth

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.270
of one trillionth of a
second after the Big Bang

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.480
after t equals 0.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:31.770
There's no way that we can know
what came before that point.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.270
But we have some vague
notion that there

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:45.220
was a quantum foam
where universes

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.870
were materializing
out of a vacuum.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.150
Some had the right properties
to begin expanding.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.510
Some did not.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.610
And they recollapsed.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.500
And I've drawn those universes
here as little circles.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.840
But that's just a metaphor.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.265
We really don't know.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.260
Between those little
spheres there,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.830
space and time did not exist
because a universe creates

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.350
its own space and time.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.920
So this is a hazy
area of physics.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.790
What came before t
equals 0 in our universe.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.330
We do think that there are
other universes that exist.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.030
But this is an area
of extrapolation.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.710
There's no way that we can
do any experiments to tell

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.400
what came before t equals zero.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:42.120
So this is one of the areas
where science and religion come

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.400
together and philosophy.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.720
So this is sort of
a good place to turn

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.455
to the intersection of
science and religion.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.730
And I want to lay out a
little of the territory first.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.380
I think that the areas where
science and religion overlap

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.320
or some of the areas
are the question

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.560
of what created the universe.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.660
That's a question that science
will never know the answer to.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.020
Are the laws of nature
sufficient to explain

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.280
the physical universe,
or do we need something

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.160
beyond the laws of nature?

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.075
Do we have free will?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.920
This I touched on
briefly before when

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.095
discussing the behavior
of individual neurons.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.430
So I think all of
these questions

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:45.011
are questions where philosophy,
theology, and science all come

00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:45.510
together.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:51.950
Some areas where I think
religion and science

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.050
are quite distinct and
have separate territories

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.850
and I'm just giving you a few.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.700
I think ethics and
morality lies largely

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.400
within the theological domain.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.800
Questions like the meaning of
life, I don't think science

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.390
can ever answer a
question like that.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.510
I think that lies within
the area of theology.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.720
A question of
whether God exists,

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.530
I think that lies
within religion.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.540
I don't think that science
can ever prove or disprove

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.710
the existence of God.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.860
On the other hand,
every issue dealing

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.880
with the nature of the
physical universe, I think,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.260
lies squarely within
the domain of science.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.230
Well let me talk briefly about
the kind of religious belief

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.280
that would be completely
compatible with science.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.740
And before I do that, I
have to define something

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.630
that I call the central
doctrine of science.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:57.090
And all scientists, most
of the time, believe this.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.130
I think most of us believe
it all of the time.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.630
And that is that all phenomenon
in the physical universe

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.000
are governed by laws.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.765
And those laws apply everywhere
and at all times in a universe.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.860
And if you're a graduate
student in biology or chemistry

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.130
or physics, your
thesis adviser may not

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.880
articulate the central
doctrine of science

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.290
specifically, explicitly,
but it's, sort of,

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.825
the working assumption
of all scientists.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.290
So what kind of
religious belief would

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:38.600
be compatible with science
given this central doctrine

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.840
of science?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:49.020
And to discuss that further, I
have to respectfully put forth

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.840
a working definition of God.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:57.050
If God exists, certainly
we don't know what God is.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.890
But for the purposes of
this discussion and as

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.640
believed by all
religions on earth,

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:09.230
God is a being who lives
outside of time and space

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:13.670
and is not limited by
the laws of nature.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:17.240
And that is one
facet of God that

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.645
is subscribed to
by all religions.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.250
So having gone
through all of that,

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:29.700
then we can say that science and
religion are compatible if God

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.920
does not intervene in
the physical universe.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.480
And note that it is
not necessary to deny

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.615
the existence of God to
have this compatibility.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.910
It's just that if
God does intervene,

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.430
that would violate the
central doctrine of science.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.890
So you can believe in God as
long as God, sort of, sits

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.440
on the sidelines once
having created the universe

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.750
and does not intervene
and perform miracles.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.480
And that kind of
belief is completely

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.620
consistent with science.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.120
Science will never
be able to rule out

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.630
that kind of religious belief.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.520
Most organized
religions do not uphold

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.560
the central doctrine of science.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.140
Most of them have
Gods that intervene

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.390
in the physical universe.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:30.160
For example, in Judaism
and Christianity, just as

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.000
one example, there are the 10
plagues that fell upon Egypt.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.230
In Islam, Muhammad
split the moon in two.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:45.510
And in Hinduism, the various
reincarnations of Vishnu

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:50.300
are constantly coming to
Earth and interacting.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.880
So according to the
very specific criteria

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:03.965
that I've given, most religions
are incompatible with science.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:15.440
Despite this, the
actual situation

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.300
and the actual
situation of beliefs

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.970
is much more complicated.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.730
I've given a very
black and white set

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.480
of criteria and boundaries.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.680
But the situation is more
complicated than that.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.550
If we find evidence
of a law of nature

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:40.250
that is being violated-- that
seems to be being violated--

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.690
does that mean that God
has intervened or does

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.790
that mean that we have
incomplete knowledge

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.410
of that law of nature
and need to learn more?

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:54.770
For example, we believe that
the law of energy conservation

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.710
was being violated in the
1920s in a certain kind

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.655
of radioactivity
called beta decay.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.640
Did that mean that
God was intervening?

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.500
Well, a few years later,
various scientists

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.190
postulated that there
was an existence

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.180
of another type of particle
called the neutrino, which

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.440
was carrying away
the extra energy.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.530
And we found a neutrino
a few years after that.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:23.770
That's just an example
of the uncertainty

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.960
when a law of nature
appears to be violated.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.950
And I should say also that
in terms of personal beliefs

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:37.290
that there are many
non-scientists who

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:41.830
believe in an intervening
God but yet who also

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.255
place much value in
science and technology.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.320
Every time we get
in an airplane we

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.230
are trusting in
the laws of physics

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.850
to keep that plane aloft,
whether we believe in

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.445
and intervening God or not.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.420
On the flip side of
the coin and this

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.980
is what's most
interesting to me,

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.480
there are a number of
distinguished scientist-- maybe

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.960
5% or so-- who believes
not only in God

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.060
but believe in an
intervening God.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.755
About 25% of all
scientists believe in God.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.410
And about one fifth
of those actually

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.600
believe in an intervening God.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.990
One such scientist here-- a
colleague of mine at MIT--

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.790
is Ian Hutchinson who is
professor of nuclear science

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.180
and engineering at MIT.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.930
And he told me and I'm
going to quote from him,

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.810
"The universe exists
because of God's actions.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:49.090
What we call the laws of
nature are upheld by God,

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.820
and they are our description
of the normal way

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.455
in which God orders the world.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:58.530
I do think miracles take place
today and have taken place

00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:59.105
over history.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.150
I take the view
that science is not

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.020
all the reliable
knowledge that exists.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.450
The evidence of the Resurrection
of Christ, for example,

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:12.210
cannot be approached
in a scientific way."

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.570
And here's another
scientist, Owen Gingerich,

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.850
who is professor
emeritus of astronomy

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:21.090
in the history of science
at Harvard University.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:25.560
And he says, I quote, "I believe
that our physical universe

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.340
is somehow wrapped within
a broader and deeper

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.810
spiritual universe in
which miracles can occur.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.970
We would not be able to
plan ahead or make decisions

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.210
without a world that
is largely law like.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:45.000
But those laws do not apply
to all events", end quote.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.160
So you can see the situation
is fairly interesting in terms

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.335
of what we actually believe.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.650
And I think that devoutly
religious scientists such

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.450
as Hutchinson and
Gingerich-- that 5%--

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:03.370
reconcile their belief in
science with their belief

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:08.060
in an interventionist of God by
adopting a worldview in which

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:12.190
the laws of physics, chemistry,
and biology apply most

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.910
of the time.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:18.480
But once in awhile, God
can intervene and violate

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.065
those laws.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:24.220
And these exceptional, divine
actions cannot be analyzed

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.535
by the methods of science.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:32.100
Well, let me say a little bit
about the nature of knowledge

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.815
and science versus
religion and the way

00:30:34.815 --> 00:30:36.485
that that knowledge is obtained.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.890
And I'll say first that I think
a couple of key differences

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:46.400
in science and
religion-- first of all,

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.090
I think science proceeds
by measurement and proof

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:55.140
and religion proceeds by faith.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.710
And I'll say a little bit more
about what I mean by faith.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.355
But basically, it's a set of
beliefs that cannot be proved.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.590
And science is impersonal
at the group level

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.405
and religion is more personal.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.170
And in all of this
discussion, now I'm

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:18.270
going to be talking not about
organize institutional religion

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.000
but about the religious
beliefs of individual people.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.420
Organize institutional
religion has

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:28.330
a lot of political
dimensions, social dimensions,

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:30.620
that I'm not going
to try to deal with.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.290
So what are the kinds
of knowledge in science?

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:38.390
Well I would argue there are two
kinds of knowledge in science.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.350
There the properties
of material things.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.300
And there are the laws
that those objects obey.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.270
And we can talk
about-- here's a golf

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.730
ball, for example,
a physical object.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.890
I don't know whether
any of you play golf.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.275
I'm a terrible golfer myself.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.910
We can talk about the
size of the golf ball.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:03.280
We can talk about its color.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.580
We can talk about its texture.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.890
The golf ball is an object that
lies outside of our bodies.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:12.485
And we can also
talk about the laws

00:32:12.485 --> 00:32:14.770
that that golf ball behaves.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:19.820
For example, it behaves
Galileo's law falling bodies.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.780
If we drop it, it
will fall a distance

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.182
that's proportional to
the square of the time

00:32:26.182 --> 00:32:27.140
that it's been falling.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:34.490
How do we come to discover
these physical properties

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.760
and the laws?

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.375
We come to discover them by
observation and measurement.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:46.660
For example, Galileo discovered
his law of falling bodies

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.190
by rolling balls
down inclined planes

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.110
and then measuring
how long it took

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:53.610
them to fall a certain distance.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.640
Of course, Galileo didn't
have a modern clock like this.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.860
He probably used a water
glass or a pendulum.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.539
But he was able to measure
pretty accurately the time

00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:04.830
that it would take for a ball
to fall a certain object.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:18.720
And then, of course, Newton
had the more general law

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.045
of gravity, which explained
Galileo's measurements as a sub

00:33:24.045 --> 00:33:24.545
case.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.030
But Newton's law of
gravity was a little bit

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.085
off in explaining the orbit
of the planet Mercury.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:44.000
Its orbit shifted by a
tiny fraction of a degree

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.270
every orbit that was not
accountable by Newton's

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:47.910
law of gravity.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.170
And Newton's law of
gravity was eventually

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:55.215
replaced by Einstein's
law of gravity.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.355
And this is the way
that science proceeds.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.120
We have a theory.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.050
We test the theory.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.530
We believe it until
it begins to disagree

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.815
with certain more
refined experiments.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.580
And then we modify
the law or develop

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.540
a new law, as was the case
with Einstein putting forth

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.280
his new law of gravity.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.800
Einstein's law
gravity will probably

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.510
be modified as well because
we know that it does not

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.645
include quantum physics.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.130
So this is the way that
science gets knowledge.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:34.449
It's the way that it
tests it's knowledge.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:40.389
And experiment is a critical
tool in obtaining and testing

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:41.510
knowledge and science.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:42.810
It plays a critical role.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:49.030
Now let me turn to
religion, which is probably

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.030
more interesting to
you since all of you

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.674
know the science well, I'm sure.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.830
And first of all, what
do I mean by religion?

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.860
And I'm going to quote William
James who was the great Harvard

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.015
philosopher and psychologist.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.760
And he wrote this
wonderful book in 1902

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.190
called "Varieties of
Religious Experience"

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.540
in which he talked to a
lot of different people

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.890
and tried to understand what
their religious beliefs were.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:24.835
And what James says in the way
that he defines religion is,

00:35:24.835 --> 00:35:30.110
"Religion consists of a belief
that there is an unseen order

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.650
and that our supreme good
lies in harmoniously adjusting

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:36.550
ourselves to that order."

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.580
And I think that
in this sentence

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.540
there are a lot of
important words.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:46.430
Belief is very important
here because religion

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:49.880
is more about faith than
about physical evidence

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.595
and because it's more personal.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.810
Unseen is important
because a lot

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:59.640
of the objects that religion
believes in are invisible.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.020
And finally, the word good.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.050
Our supreme good lies in
harmoniously adjusting

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:15.760
ourselves suggested there are
ethical and moral dimensions

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.550
to religious belief.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.410
So I think James
definition of religion

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.835
captures all of the key aspects.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.460
So what are the kinds of
knowledge in religion?

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.310
Well I would argue that
there are two kinds.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.710
There might be more
but at least two kinds.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.335
The first kind is the
transcendent experience.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.920
And the second kind
of knowledge lies

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.190
in the content of
the sacred books.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.040
And I want to say a
little bit about both

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.685
of those two kinds of knowledge.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.090
By transcendent
experience I mean

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:55.030
the immediate and
vital experience

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.060
of being connected
to something larger

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.690
than ourselves and
the feeling there's

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.160
some unseen order in the world.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:09.710
The transcendent
experience may or may not

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.320
involve a belief in God.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.440
And I imagine-- well, I
should say first that to me,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.085
as both a scientist
and a humanist,

00:37:19.085 --> 00:37:23.000
that the transcendent experience
is the strongest evidence

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.460
that we have for a
spiritual universe.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:30.140
I'm not going to
say evidence for God

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.310
but I will say evidence
for a spiritual universe.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:36.230
And I'm going to define
that more as I go along.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.360
But roughly, by
spiritual universe

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.380
I mean a group of human
experiences and feelings

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.090
that are not
completely analyzable

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.250
by the reductive
methods of science.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.290
And I imagine that
many of you have

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:53.050
had a transcendent experience.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:57.340
But I wanted to tell you one
that I had a few years ago

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.770
to give you an
idea of what I mean

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.376
by transcendent experience.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.355
My wife is a painter, as
Jonathan mentioned earlier.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.750
I am now mostly a writer.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:13.040
And we spend our summers
on an island in Maine.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.510
About 100 feet from our
house is a tall tree

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.360
that has an ospreys nest in it.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.950
And every summer,
we watch the ospreys

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:27.605
go through their rituals
and their habits.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:33.435
In April, the parents
arrive to the nest.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.835
The mother lays the eggs.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:43.350
Around beginning of June, the
eggs hatch and the baby ospreys

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:44.930
start growing up.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:47.890
The father goes out and
catches fish for the babies.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.780
The mother usually just
takes care of the nest

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.200
and takes care of the babies.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.610
The osprey is a very large bird.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.990
It's the second largest bird
there is after the eagle.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:03.060
So it has a wingspan of about
this, and the nest is huge.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:09.050
So my wife and I, we
watch these birds.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.170
We take pictures.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.680
We take notes.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.710
We keep a journal.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.970
And for years, we've sort of
documented their behavior.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.890
This is just 100
feet from our house.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.445
So it's like
watching reality TV.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:32.850
We've learned over the years
how many babies they usually

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:34.040
have each season.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.880
Usually two.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.860
Sometimes three.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.660
We know the different
calls that they make.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:45.290
We know what the call sounds
for danger or for hunger

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.685
or for when food is
arriving at the nest.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.510
The babies grow up
over the summer.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.780
And usually around mid August
they take their first flight.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.080
And until that
time, they've stayed

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.730
in the nest getting
bigger and bigger.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:09.080
So my wife and I felt that
we understood these birds

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:09.840
pretty well.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.740
And then, one summer
a few summers ago

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.035
it was an August afternoon.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.310
I had been watching the nest
every day during the summer.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.760
And our summer house
is a two story house.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.080
And it has a circular
deck on the second story.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.730
And I'd been standing on the
secular deck for maybe an hour

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.420
so every day
looking at the nest.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.830
And I was about nest high.

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:43.520
So the birds were looking at
me as I was looking at them.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.130
And I'm sure to them it looked
like I was in my own nest

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.730
because I was on
this circular deck.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:53.270
So I'd been, sort of, looking
at these baby birds all summer

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.450
getting bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:59.760
And then, one day in mid August,
they had their maiden flight.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.470
The baby birds-- there
were two of them--

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:04.900
were finally large enough
to fly out of the nest.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.170
And they took off.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:09.520
I was standing on the deck.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:18.830
And they did a very large loop--
maybe a half mile in diameter--

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.740
around the island
and then came back

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.580
and they started careening
straight towards me

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.260
as I was standing on the deck.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.290
And they were coming
at very high speed.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.270
And these birds now,
I call them baby

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.480
but they were big by this time.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.077
And they have very
powerful claws

00:41:37.077 --> 00:41:38.160
that they use for fishing.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.820
And they could have
ripped my face off.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.770
It was like two F15s
coming right at you.

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:52.160
And my first impulse
was to run for cover.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:57.560
But instead I just
stood there frozen.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.140
And the birds came right at me.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.000
And when they were about 20
or 30 feet away-- very, very

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.310
close-- they did a very
high g acceleration

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:11.610
and went vertically up and
over the top of the house.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.240
Before they did that a high
g acceleration and went

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:20.475
over the house, for about a half
a second we made eye contact.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.550
And those birds were looking
at me straight in the eye.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.290
And I don't know exactly what
happened during that half

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:35.260
second, but I felt like
we were communicating.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.370
I felt like the
birds were telling me

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.120
we've been watching
you all summer,

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:45.240
you've been watching us, we're
brothers living on this land

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.240
together, and we
respect each other.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.170
It was some kind of feeling
like that that I had.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:57.410
And after they had gone, I
realized that I was in tears

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:58.160
and I was shaking.

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:02.205
It was such a
powerful experience.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:08.170
There's no way that
that experience could

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:13.590
be analyzed by the methods
of science, in my opinion.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:18.460
I think you could hook up MRI's
and CAT scans to my brain,

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.480
you can measure all
the electrical activity

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.630
of my neurons, and I
think it still would not

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:28.330
express the feeling that I
had for that half second.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.020
I had connected with what I
call the spiritual universe.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.890
It was a feeling
of being connected

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:36.670
to something larger than myself.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:40.035
It was a feeling of
the unity of nature.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.540
And that's what I mean
by the spiritual world.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.620
It did not involve
any belief in God.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:53.240
It was just this incredible
connection with nature

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.515
through these two wild animals.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.150
Let me say a little
bit about the content

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.825
of the sacred books.

00:44:05.315 --> 00:44:08.470
Of course, sometimes some
people take the content

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:11.204
of the sacred books as fact.

00:44:11.204 --> 00:44:12.620
Some people take
it as a metaphor.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.505
Some people take it
as the word of God.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.470
I think that however you take
the content of the sacred books

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.290
that there's some
knowledge their.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:31.080
It's knowledge of the feelings,
the mentality, the inspiration

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.990
of certain people who
wrote those books.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.670
I would argue that any
statements in the sacred books

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.120
that deal with the
physical universe,

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.340
such as the age
of the Earth, fall

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.100
within the realm
of science and have

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.970
to be tested by the same means
as any other propositions

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:49.470
in science.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.480
I'm almost finished with
the remarks I wanted to say.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.310
I mentioned faith
a couple of times

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:59.465
and I wanted to say a
little bit more about that.

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:03.390
There are many things
that we take on faith.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.220
Maybe you're not aware of them.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:10.070
Without physical proof and even
sometimes without methodology

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:16.690
for proof we cannot show why
the ending of a novel haunts us

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:20.090
or why a particular character
in a novel haunts us.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.130
We cannot prove under what
conditions we would sacrifice

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.880
our life to save the
life of our children.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:33.760
We can't prove whether it is
right or wrong to steal food

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:39.780
to feed our families
or even prove

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.470
a definition of what
is right and wrong.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:47.980
We can't prove what is
the meaning of our life

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.070
or even whether life
has any meaning at all.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:55.070
These are all questions
where we can gather evidence,

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:58.080
we can debate them,
but there's no way

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.770
in which we can prove or
test any of these questions

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.910
in the same way that a physicist
can test how many seconds it

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:10.280
takes a ball to drop 10 feet.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.900
These previous questions
are questions of ethics.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.889
They're questions of
philosophy, morality,

00:46:17.889 --> 00:46:19.972
they're questions for the
arts and the humanities.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:25.340
And they're also questions
that religion deals with.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.150
They're questions
of faith and belief.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:34.070
I want to say something
more about the distinction

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.835
between the physical universe
and the spiritual universe.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:40.960
Events in the end
the physical universe

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.810
can be recorded with rulers and
clocks outside of our bodies.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.520
Those measurements provide the
evidence for what we believe.

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:55.040
Evidence in the spiritual
universe cannot be tested

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.040
and recorded in that way.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:01.870
The evidence lies in
what we feel individually

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.360
person by person, such
as the experience that I

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.310
had with the ospreys.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.900
The physical universe and
the spiritual universe

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.990
each have their own
domains of validity

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:14.073
and their own limitations.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.090
The question of the age
of the earth, for example,

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:20.670
is a question that lies
within the physical universe.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.550
We can date.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.380
We can test the
age of the universe

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.910
by the radioactive
decay of rocks.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:35.510
In contrast, questions like
did some intelligence create

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:40.220
the universe or is it moral to
kill people in times of war,

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:44.400
these questions lie outside
of the boundary of science.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.640
They lie within the realm
of the spiritual universe.

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:54.620
And I am impatient with people
like Richard Dawkins or Sam

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:58.840
Harris or Daniel Dennett
who try to disprove

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.890
the existence of God with
scientific arguments.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.350
I don't think that science
can ever prove or disprove

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.650
the existence of God
because if God exists,

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:13.190
as understood by
most religions, God

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.175
is not subject to
rational analysis.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.060
God lies outside of
the physical universe.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:24.290
And I'm equally impatient with
people who make statements

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:27.650
about the physical
universe that violate

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:30.610
physical evidence in the
known laws of nature.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.870
I think that both science and
religion are seeking truth.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:39.130
It's a different kind of truth.

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:43.320
In science, we're seeking
truth in the physical world.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.740
In religion, we're seeking
truth in the spiritual world.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.380
The experience that I
had with the ospreys

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.860
was a spiritual experience.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:58.180
And after that experience,
I had discovered

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.440
what I think is a
truth about the world,

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.790
a truth about the
connectedness of life,

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:07.400
a truth about the
unity of nature,

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.930
and a truth about my own
emotional and psychological

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.806
being at that moment.

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:17.180
I think that science
and religion are both

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.255
seeking beauty.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:23.030
Anyone who has worked in
science-- and of course, that

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:26.790
includes all of you guys--
know the beauty of an equation.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:30.470
There's Galileo's law
of falling bodies, which

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:32.510
is a parabola, a
beautiful shape.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.949
You know the beauty
of mathematics.

00:49:35.949 --> 00:49:36.865
The beauty of science.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.180
I think there's also a
beauty in the spiritual world

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.640
when we experience the
power and the subtlety

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.230
of human relationships
and human emotions

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:50.390
when we have this sense of being
connected to a larger world.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.260
Some people believe that
there's only a single universe

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.010
that the physical
and spiritual are

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:02.725
part of the oneness of a unity.

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.790
This is an appealing idea.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:09.820
According to this idea,
there's no distinction

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:14.620
between the outer and the
inner, between the subjective

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:18.700
and the objective, and
there's no distinction

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.640
between the miraculous
and the rational.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.810
Although these are appealing
and compelling ideas,

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:28.875
I cannot accept them myself.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.730
For me, both as a
scientist and humanist,

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.750
I need to make a distinction
between the physical

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:39.990
and the spiritual world.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:44.290
For me, there is room
for both just as there's

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.535
room for both
science and religion.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.960
Each universe has its own power.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.600
Each has its own domain.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.445
Each has its own
beauty and mystery.

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:59.080
And I'll end with just a comment
that a Presbyterian minister

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.940
made to me a year ago.

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:05.080
He said to me that science
and religion both share

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.590
a sense of wonder
and I would agree.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:09.744
Thank you.

00:51:09.744 --> 00:51:14.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:17.802 --> 00:51:19.330
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Do
we have questions?

00:51:21.432 --> 00:51:22.455
AUDIENCE: Yes, please.

00:51:22.455 --> 00:51:23.080
My name's Matt.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:26.920
Great talk.

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:31.530
So in the beginning, we
didn't have much science.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:34.660
We had beliefs.

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.490
Models, maybe.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.350
And as science has
developed, it has disproved,

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:42.114
I think, some of those fictions.

00:51:42.114 --> 00:51:42.780
Not all of them.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.580
Science or our knowledge of
it has always been finite.

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.480
Always will be.

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:53.780
But I don't see that there's
a requirement that phenomenon

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:59.370
unexplained by science need
a fictional explanation.

00:52:03.344 --> 00:52:04.510
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yes, I agree.

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:10.690
AUDIENCE: Also, with the human
perception, we are fallible.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:11.190
Right?

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:13.040
We know some people are crazy.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:18.430
Even sane people can have
unreliable perceptions

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:19.890
momentarily or whatever.

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:23.420
So I don't think that this
transcendence personal

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.120
experience is really valid.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.420
If it's not repeatable,
if it's not testable,

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.030
why should it have any weight?

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.500
I guess the crux
of my question is

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.330
why isn't the
burden of the proof

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:42.715
on the claimant for
spiritual notions?

00:52:42.715 --> 00:52:45.120
ALAN LIGHTMAN:
Well, I don't think

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.890
they were trying to
prove anything here.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:52.890
What I'm suggesting
is that there

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:57.550
are certain powerful,
emotional experiences

00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:05.180
that we have that happen at a
qualitative level that are not

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:10.710
going to be explainable
in terms of the actions

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:12.310
of individual neurons.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.670
It's not that I think that
something supernatural is

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:15.170
happening.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.450
It's not that I think
that cause and effect

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.025
relationships are
being violated.

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:28.260
It's that I think that the
reductionist methodology

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:32.085
of science is not able to
capture the experience.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.440
So that's what I mean.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.220
And I don't think that that's
inconsistent with anything

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:38.870
that you said.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:46.150
I'm not saying that what I call
a transcendent experience is

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:50.506
evidence for a
supernatural world.

00:53:50.506 --> 00:53:54.340
AUDIENCE: You said that
the experiences like

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.685
your experience with
the eagle or the bird--

00:53:56.685 --> 00:53:57.810
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yeah, right.

00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:59.268
AUDIENCE: --are
evidence that there

00:53:59.268 --> 00:54:01.210
is some sort of
spiritual universe.

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:05.390
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Well it's a
spiritual universe within--

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:07.120
I'm rooting it in
the individual.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.510
I'm not saying--

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:12.050
AUDIENCE: Well it's a metaphor
for a phenomenon, which

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:14.510
are too complex to analyze.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:15.680
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yes.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.180
Yes.

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.030
So you might call
that another name.

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:25.900
I'm not saying that
that's evidence for God.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.240
I'm not saying it's
evidence for a violation

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.730
of the laws of nature.

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.800
I'm saying that it is an
experience that many people

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:39.040
have had or many
such experiences that

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.520
are not going to be analyzable.

00:54:42.052 --> 00:54:43.240
AUDIENCE: Even in theory?

00:54:46.904 --> 00:54:48.850
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Well,
that's a good question.

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:49.515
Even in theory.

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.730
I do believe that everything
that happens in the brain

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:56.485
is a material phenomenon.

00:54:57.790 --> 00:54:59.070
AUDIENCE: So then--

00:55:00.412 --> 00:55:02.245
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yeah, I
thin that there are--

00:55:02.245 --> 00:55:03.161
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:03.161 --> 00:55:07.100
ALAN LIGHTMAN: I think that when
I say even in theory I mean,

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.190
of course, I can't say
anything even in theory

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:13.270
because we don't know
what science is going

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:16.200
to produce 1,000 years from now.

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.450
But I think that
there are and I think

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:21.620
that sometimes the
physicists have recently

00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.040
been giving a name to
some of these phenomenon.

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.240
They call them
emergent phenomenon

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.720
where there are phenomena
that can't be understood

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.470
in terms of the
individual parts.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:33.490
And it's something like that.

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:35.080
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Leda.

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.150
Every so often, some
people come to my door

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:42.610
and promote a
particular religion.

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:46.090
And they ask me
if I'm religious.

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:46.965
And I say absolutely.

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:49.480
My religion is string theory.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.290
And I just wanted to know
it seems to me that string

00:55:56.290 --> 00:56:00.360
theory does, sort
of, touch both sides

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:07.430
of the spiritual and
physical world in the sense

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.450
that we have no way to test it.

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:12.960
And I'm just wondering--

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.044
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Well I think
that's a good analogy.

00:56:15.044 --> 00:56:16.168
AUDIENCE: --what you think.

00:56:16.168 --> 00:56:18.890
ALAN LIGHTMAN: I mean, that's
an example of something

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:22.920
that we believe in science as a
matter of faith without proof.

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.200
Those of us who believe
in string theory

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:31.710
believe it because
it unifies gravity

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:33.920
with the other three forces.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.170
It's beautiful mathematically.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.250
But you're right.

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:43.820
We can't envision any way
to test it at the moment.

00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:49.650
I think Stephen Hawking's
boundary condition

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:51.430
for the beginning
of the universe

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:54.920
is another such thing that
we believe but is untestable.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.680
The central doctrine
of science is something

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.740
that we believe and take
as a matter of faith.

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:11.640
But of course, the ways that
we obtain knowledge in science

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:15.330
are vastly different from the
ways that we do in religion.

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:20.250
So there are huge
differences, but I

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:22.750
think there are
matters of faith.

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:25.590
And string theory is
one of them in science.

00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:26.830
So it's a good point.

00:57:28.141 --> 00:57:30.420
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.830
One is about your
statement about

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:38.510
non-interventionist
deities, right?

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:41.390
What if the physical laws
are probabilistic in nature?

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:43.680
Like a radioactive
decay says that they

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.370
have to occur a certain
rate but the event

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:47.760
happens deterministically.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.166
Is there room for intervention
in these little gaps?

00:57:51.166 --> 00:57:52.040
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Right.

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:58.570
I mean, some thinkers
have said that that's

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:00.200
where God might intervene.

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:06.420
I don't really have
that view myself

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:11.700
because even though the
laws of quantum physics

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:17.970
are probabilistic, when you
have a large number of atoms,

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:20.600
you can make very accurate
predictions of the way

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:21.600
they're going to behave.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.950
And if God was intervening
in those spaces

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:29.660
between an electron changing
orbitals and one atom

00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:32.810
I think that that
intervention would

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:38.760
be visible on the
macroscopic scale somehow.

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.190
I don't think that
there could be

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:44.130
an intervention in a
violation of the laws

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:50.180
on the individual atomic
level in any kind of way

00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:53.780
which wouldn't show
up from time to time

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.140
when you have a billion atoms.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:59:01.414
So I agree that
that's a place where

00:59:01.414 --> 00:59:02.580
you could have intervention.

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:08.330
But I don't subscribe
to that view myself.

00:59:10.262 --> 00:59:11.750
AUDIENCE: And
briefly, I was going

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:15.270
to say your discussion of
transcending experiences

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:17.670
reminds me of Philip K.
Dick's story, "The Electric

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:20.070
Ant", where a man
goes in a hospital

00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:22.750
and he finds out that
he's actually an Android.

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:25.930
And completely, his
world is upturned.

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:27.459
And then he opens
his chest, and he

00:59:27.459 --> 00:59:29.250
finds a paper tape that
is his programming.

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:30.041
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yes.

00:59:30.041 --> 00:59:32.495
AUDIENCE: And he cannot resist
the urge to tamper with it.

00:59:32.495 --> 00:59:33.286
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yes.

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:38.380
I think that happened in one
of the episodes of Star Trek,

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.650
as well.

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:41.040
Data, yeah.

00:59:42.225 --> 00:59:46.040
AUDIENCE: So I actually
share your belief

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.000
about the limits of
reductionism and this,

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.340
sort of, emerging phenomenon
being unable to be explained.

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.820
But I sometimes think about
the opposite question, right.

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.028
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Can you talk
closer to the microphone?

00:59:58.028 --> 00:59:59.450
AUDIENCE: Sometimes
I'm too tall.

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.740
I sometimes think about the
opposite question, right.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.115
So in computer
science, you know,

01:00:03.115 --> 01:00:06.020
we're starting to see neural
network algorithms, which

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.940
show emergent behavior
that we can't explain

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.050
in terms of these coefficients.

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:12.300
Like, it's just unexplainable.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.480
There's too many
layers of networks.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.430
Too many sigmoids stacked
on top of each other.

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:21.712
And I wonder if, you
know, given the way

01:00:21.712 --> 01:00:23.670
you articulated your
thinking before, you think

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:27.150
there's space for a
spiritual universe of sorts

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:29.550
within that kind of
a computer system

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:31.050
when the computer's
powerful enough

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:32.668
to generate those networks.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:39.440
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Well I'm
hesitant to use the word

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.930
spiritual universe
because it's laden with so

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.400
many connotations.

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:50.600
But I do think that as
we're able to build computer

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:56.580
systems that have the
complexity of the human mind--

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.580
the human brain, I should
say-- with 100 billion neurons

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:04.070
and 1,000 connections between
each one-- every two of them--

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:09.020
that I think that there
will be phenomenon that

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.835
emerge that are
difficult to analyze.

01:01:14.835 --> 01:01:15.710
I'll put it that way.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.242
That doesn't mean that there's
something supernatural going on

01:01:20.242 --> 01:01:21.950
or something magic or
anything like that.

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:25.910
It's just that the
complexity is so enormous.

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:30.860
And it may be that the question
of free will versus determinism

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.930
has that kind of
resolution, as well.

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:38.680
That even though
everything in the brain

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:42.020
happens completely according
to the laws of cause and effect

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:47.180
and eventually you can
track every action molecule

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:54.320
by molecule it could be that
the complexity is so enormous

01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:00.410
that it's always impossible
to predict exactly what next

01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:02.080
state you're going to be in.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.220
If you start from
state A, where's

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.520
state B going to be
a second from then.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.580
It may be just, for practical
purposes, an impossible

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.680
prediction.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:18.470
And that may be what gives
us the illusion of free will.

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:19.940
It could be like that.

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:23.330
AUDIENCE: So you think that free
will means unpredictability?

01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:30.665
It's an interesting thing that
a lot of people seem to believe.

01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:31.165
But it's--

01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:33.220
ALAN LIGHTMAN:
Yeah, I don't know.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.260
I haven't read a really good
definition of free will,

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.760
and especially
when you're trying

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:45.060
to define it in terms of a
material assortment of neurons.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:48.660
I think it's a great question.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.370
I have heard a lot of
people say unpredictability.

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.300
But of course, if
you're a materialist

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.910
and you believe strictly
in cause and effect,

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:06.790
then there's nothing which
is completely unpredictable,

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:09.817
except when you take
in the quantum effects.

01:03:09.817 --> 01:03:11.275
There's, you know,
a probabilistic.

01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.670
So--

01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:14.336
AUDIENCE: Depending
on when [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:16.461
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yeah, so
it's a great question.

01:03:16.461 --> 01:03:17.710
I don't know the answer to it.

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:25.230
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the spiritual universe.

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:28.525
So if the spiritual
universe is outside

01:03:28.525 --> 01:03:29.900
of the physical
universe, which I

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.260
think is what-- I hope I'm
understanding what you meant

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:38.810
earlier-- but it's
not supernatural,

01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:41.475
how can it be outside of
the physical universe?

01:03:43.442 --> 01:03:46.550
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Well,
that's a good point.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:55.000
And I'm trying to make
a subtle distinction

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.300
that by spiritual
universe I mean

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:06.760
that it is a set of phenomena
human experiences that are not

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:12.985
completely analyzable or
understood stood by science.

01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:18.685
It doesn't mean that something's
happening that's supernatural.

01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:24.920
So maybe calling it
a spiritual universe

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.963
is not the best terminology.

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:33.105
But I try to define what
I mean by giving examples.

01:04:33.105 --> 01:04:35.460
AUDIENCE: So 1,000
years ago there

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.440
might have been a
whole lot of things

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.690
in the spiritual universe
that have been plucked away.

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:40.940
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Oh, definitely.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.750
Yes, there's no
doubt that science

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:47.640
has brought within its folds
a lot of things that were once

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.870
considered supernatural.

01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:50.911
AUDIENCE: Are you worried
science will completely

01:04:50.911 --> 01:04:53.259
eliminate the spiritual
universe overtime?

01:04:53.259 --> 01:04:54.550
ALAN LIGHTMAN: I'm not worried.

01:04:57.330 --> 01:05:01.840
I think there will always
be a boundary between what

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.260
we understood.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:06.520
But we can understand in an
reductionist manner and things

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.730
that we can't understand
in an reductionist manner.

01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.130
That boundary may move.

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:13.490
No doubt, it shifts in time.

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:18.840
But I don't have the view
that we're ultimately

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.455
going to be able to
reduce everything.

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:27.380
And actually, I
think that mystery

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:32.410
is a good thing in science,
as well as the arts.

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:38.130
I think having a boundary
beyond which there are mysteries

01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:42.150
is one of the
motivations of science.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:48.840
And there's a wonderful
thing that Einstein said,

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.390
which is that the most
beautiful experience we can have

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:52.600
is the mysterious.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.145
It lies at the cradle of
true art and true science.

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:58.590
And I think that when Einstein
used that word mysterious

01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:01.085
he wasn't talking about
something supernatural.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.645
He was just talking
about an unknown.

01:06:06.645 --> 01:06:07.145
The unknown.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:14.167
The awe of getting to the edge
of a cliff and looking over.

01:06:14.167 --> 01:06:15.000
Something like that.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:23.830
AUDIENCE: About ethics
being spiritual,

01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:27.680
I wouldn't go as far as to
claim that ethics would be fully

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.040
encompassed by science
or that there's

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.970
laws of the universe
governing ethics.

01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:33.040
I make no such claims.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.600
But ethics are
testable, I think,

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.930
in that they're closer
related to governmental laws

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:41.670
and we can institute laws
and see how they work.

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:45.100
We can measure them quantifiably
to see what they do.

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.880
Now there's a framework of
how we say what's good or bad.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.780
I mean, I'm not going there.

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.550
But ethics are testable.

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:53.320
And I don't think
that there necessarily

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.360
needs to be some spiritual
component to that.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:01.350
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Well, I
think we shouldn't group all

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:04.170
ethics into one lump.

01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:09.160
I think a question like
is it OK to steal food

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.600
to feed your family or
is it OK to kill an enemy

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.170
soldier in time of war.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.875
I don't think that those
questions are testable.

01:07:19.972 --> 01:07:21.940
AUDIENCE: No, they are
testable because we

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.000
can have laws that
actually specify what

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:24.940
judges should do in [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.530
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yeah,
but that doesn't--

01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:27.470
AUDIENCE: And see
what results from it.

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:29.960
ALAN LIGHTMAN: You could
have laws about anything.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.000
I can have a law that
says God doesn't exist.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.070
The fact that we
have laws about them

01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:39.480
doesn't mean that we have
determined the rightness

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.300
or wrongness.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.620
The laws just tell
us how we're going

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:48.246
to behave as a society for
people who do certain things

01:07:48.246 --> 01:07:49.370
or don't do certain things.

01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:52.460
But I don't think the
law answers the question

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:55.587
whether certain actions
are right or wrong.

01:07:55.587 --> 01:07:57.920
They're just agreements about
how we're going to behave.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.620
They don't answer the
question of right or wrong.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.495
AUDIENCE: I'm simply
saying they're testable.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.116
AUDIENCE: They're observable.

01:08:04.116 --> 01:08:05.450
AUDIENCE: They're observable.

01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:07.660
You can see what happens
in experiments that we've

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.480
had with different
societies across time.

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.460
We do this all the time,
actually, at Google.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:16.510
We test, like, experiments on
people searches and whatever.

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:18.550
And there may be
ethical issues there.

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:19.460
I don't know.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.840
But we can see the results.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.339
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Yeah,
but how are you

01:08:22.339 --> 01:08:25.950
going to do a test to
determine whether it's

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:30.787
right or wrong to kill an
enemy soldier in time of war

01:08:30.787 --> 01:08:32.620
or whether it's right
or wrong to steal food

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:33.453
to feed your family?

01:08:33.453 --> 01:08:34.420
How are you going to?

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:38.029
AUDIENCE: There are laws
that address such behaviors.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.850
AUDIENCE: How can
you tell [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:41.074
AUDIENCE: You can
observe the results.

01:08:41.074 --> 01:08:42.299
AUDIENCE: And who observes?

01:08:42.299 --> 01:08:43.160
What is the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.243
AUDIENCE: We collectively
can observe the results.

01:08:45.243 --> 01:08:47.170
And we can say whether
they're good or bad.

01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:49.419
We do have a process
for coming to consensus.

01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:51.439
It's ongoing.

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:52.490
It never ends.

01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:56.109
And it's embodied in terms of
the set of laws that we have,

01:08:56.109 --> 01:08:58.370
which I admit are
internally inconsistent.

01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:01.660
And I mean, I wouldn't say are
all good but there they are.

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.350
And as a society, that's
what we have agreed upon.

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:06.890
Now previously our
society decided

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:08.470
that slavery was just fine.

01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:10.630
So we're clearly
not always right.

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:13.950
But it's a process.

01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:15.860
And we're getting
there, I would say.

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:17.625
ALAN LIGHTMAN:
Interesting comment.

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:19.500
Well I'll stick around
for one more question.

01:09:21.656 --> 01:09:24.170
AUDIENCE: Just curious
your thoughts around, like,

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:28.090
the existence of a heaven
or a hell type place

01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:29.995
and the existence of them.

01:09:29.995 --> 01:09:31.120
ALAN LIGHTMAN: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.292
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:34.470
ALAN LIGHTMAN: I didn't hear it.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:39.729
AUDIENCE: Like, your thoughts
around the existence of heaven

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:41.500
or a hell type location.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.060
ALAN LIGHTMAN: Oh, well I don't
believe in heaven or hell.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.483
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:09:45.483 --> 01:09:46.149
Never mind then.

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:47.274
ALAN LIGHTMAN: I mean, yes.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.470
I think this is it.

01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:56.365
Whatever we're experiencing
right now, this is it.

01:09:56.365 --> 01:09:59.266
And this is all there
is, in my opinion.

01:09:59.266 --> 01:10:01.640
But I don't know anything more
about this than any of you

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.140
guys.

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:05.830
Thank you very much.

01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:07.380
