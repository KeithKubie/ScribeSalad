really worth thinking about is that we

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320
really worth thinking about is that we
 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.310
really worth thinking about is that we
think of this as a financial waste but

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320
think of this as a financial waste but
 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.840

concept that some healthcare may be
 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.470
concept that some healthcare may be
negative and I think we all know from

negative and I think we all know from
 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.229
negative and I think we all know from
our own lives that some health care is

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239
our own lives that some health care is
 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.930

is negative there are some some pills we

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
is negative there are some some pills we

really worth it there are some tests we

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390
really worth it there are some tests we
 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.509
really worth it there are some tests we
think all right if I took that test and

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519
think all right if I took that test and
 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.370
think all right if I took that test and
found out I have a greater propensity to
