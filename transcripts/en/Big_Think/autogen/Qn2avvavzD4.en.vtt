writer it was an English classroom so it
was so tightly part of their and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130
was so tightly part of their and
 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.650
was so tightly part of their and

following your passion you're one with
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.820
following your passion you're one with
your passion but it's bi-directional

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830
your passion but it's bi-directional
 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.460
your passion but it's bi-directional
with effort in the sense that sometimes

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470
with effort in the sense that sometimes
 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.809
with effort in the sense that sometimes
even if you don't have a passion

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819
even if you don't have a passion
 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.030
even if you don't have a passion
beforehand and you put in the hard work

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040
beforehand and you put in the hard work
 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.740
beforehand and you put in the hard work
and effort into something and you

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
and effort into something and you
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.140
and effort into something and you
develop a competency or you develop

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150
develop a competency or you develop
 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.940
develop a competency or you develop
mastery in something that actually

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950
mastery in something that actually
 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.059
mastery in something that actually
increases your passion for the activity

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069
increases your passion for the activity
 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.410
increases your passion for the activity
and then the more you increase your

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420
and then the more you increase your
 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.380
and then the more you increase your
passion the more it fuels the motivation

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390
passion the more it fuels the motivation
 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.030
passion the more it fuels the motivation
to learn more and increases your skills

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040
to learn more and increases your skills
 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.210
to learn more and increases your skills
so it's a cycle so effort and passion is

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
so it's a cycle so effort and passion is
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.520
so it's a cycle so effort and passion is
this continuous cycle and that's what

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
this continuous cycle and that's what
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.190
this continuous cycle and that's what
the way the science is showing
