1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,510
Happen. The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah.
That's a funny thing with actors, right.

2
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:06,420
And the billing. Yeah. They want,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,740
they want to make sure that their name is
red first. Well that's, that's, I mean,

4
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:14,250
you've got to have egos to do these
things. I mean there's so many things.

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:18,240
Need an ego to do them. Yeah. And
then hopefully you can switch,

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,080
dial your ego down when you come off
stage. Some people can't do that. Um,

7
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:24,210
when it comes to billing,
Steve,

8
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:28,350
if you know about Steve Mcqueen and his
mum was a sort of sometime prostitute

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,220
and have man in and out of the house
where the Andy's dad was just never there.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,020
And he found himself through,
uh, a boy's, a boy's retreat,

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,440
you know, cause he was breaking the law
and they send them off to this place.

12
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:44,370
And then they told him to talk
these kids out to train wild horses.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,480
And that was one of the first things
he did. And he was just so ambitious.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,860
And with your Brenner in,
um, in magnificent seven,

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,980
because you know, if you know that film
at the beginning, they've got yield.

16
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:59,010
Brenda, do you know that feeling well?
Was that actually don't remember it. Well,

17
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:01,170
it's maximums have is a great film,

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,270
so it's got Yule Brenner with
his coloring and, but no habits,

19
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:08,520
such an amazing look.
And Steve Mcqueen at the beginning,

20
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:13,521
they'd go up to boot hill to bury this
Indian guy up boot hill and people are

21
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:14,581
not allowing it.

22
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:18,510
There's racism in the town and they both
go up and they ride shotgun again to

23
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,790
hear us. But he was, he was Yule
Brenner was the top guy. And uh,

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,990
finally seem okay. Can you see what
you, you see what Brenda's doing?

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,900
You see what his caravan is, ma'am? God,

26
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:31,640
he's got all this stuff here and he
just wanted to be the top guy. Yeah.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,390
And he got there and it is,
it's a beautiful story. It
doesn't end brilliantly,

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,630
but you know, a bullet is
great. Great escape is great.

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,670
Yeah. He's a fascinating guy. Steve
McQueen became a race car driver.

30
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,280
Like see? Yeah. Well serious
race card. Yeah, no, he,

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,720
he came second and the one
before there's a documentary on,

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,920
on the mall, the mall. I used the 24 hour
race and he became, he did a race in, uh,

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,340
in America, which was, I
think it was a 12 hour raise,

34
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,510
and they came second with a broken
foot. He did it, and he was just,

35
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,710
he's kind of a force of nature, but
he was also do crazy things. I mean,

36
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,670
really crazy things. We should just
not, we died fairly young to write 50.

37
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:16,350
He didn't die of cancer. Smoking and
drinking. Yeah. I Dunno know what it was.

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
How do you know? We still don't know why
people get cancer. My mum died when I,

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,810
when I, when I was six, and she
was in this and never smoked.

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,980
And she died of bowel cancer. I
mean, what shoes? What is that? Yeah.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,670
Nothing like sentence if,
yeah,

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,790
and unless you put in random into the
world. That's my theory of the universe.

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,790
[inaudible].
