00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.070
GILBERT STRANG: OK, I
thought I would talk

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.270
today about power series.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.230
These are powers of x.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.050
I'm going to keep going.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.210
All powers, all those x to the
fourth, x to the fifth,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.910
they'll all come in too.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:30.890
And my idea is combine them,
add them up to get

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.020
a function of x.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.320
So we're doing calculus, but a
new part of it, with these

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.980
infinite series.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.440
So what do I mean
by combine them?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.780
I mean I'll multiply those
powers by some numbers.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.000
Let me call those numbers a0.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.910
So this first guy will be
an a0, and then I'll

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.000
add on an a1 x.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.830
I'm out of x.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:06.540
I'll add on some a2 x squared,
some a3 x cubed and onwards.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.320
So now I have a function.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.770
And that function, let
me call it f of x.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.930
So here's my starting
plan here.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.740
Well, we've seen this
for e to the x.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.140
Let me remember how e to the x
could come, the series for

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.940
that particular function.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.730
So here's the plan.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.890
I'm going to choose those
a's so as to match--

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.350
let me put these words down.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.110
I'll match at x equals 0.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.170
The function, its derivative,
its next derivative, its third

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.430
derivative, and onwards.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.430
Each a, like a3, will be chosen
so that that right-hand

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.010
side has the correct derivative,
third derivative,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.400
at x equals 0.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.210
So this Taylor series--

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.410
Taylor's name is associated
with series like this--

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.300
everything's happening
at x equals 0.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.320
So in the case of e
to the x, all its

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.910
derivatives were the same.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.980
Still e to the x.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.230
And they all equal
1 at x equals 0.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.620
So I want that function
to give me 1 for every

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.330
derivative.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.320
That doesn't mean that the
a's should all be 1.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.180
Why not?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.220
Because when I take the
derivative, for example, of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.130
this guy, that x cubed,
the first

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.260
derivative, will be 3x squared.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.180
The next derivative 6x.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.620
The next derivative 6.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.260
That's the one I want.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.730
That third derivative, but it'll
be 6 so a3 will have to

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.630
be 1/6 to give me the
correct answer 1.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.380
Let me write those
things down.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.010
So what we just did is the
derivative of x to the n-th.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.370
The n-th derivative.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.570
What's the n-th derivative
of x to the n?

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.490
We get to use our nice formula
for derivatives.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.500
So the first derivative is
nx to the n minus 1.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.500
The derivative of that will be
n times n minus 1 x to one

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.060
lower power.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.330
Keep going, do it n times,
and what have you got?

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.380
You finally got down to the 0-th
power of x, a constant.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.150
But what is that constant?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:08.010
It's n times n minus 1, so that
n-th derivative will be n

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.760
from the first, n minus
1 from the second.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.860
Keep multiply until you
finally get down to 1.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.300
And of course, that's called
because it comes up often

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.600
enough to have its
own special name.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.270
That name is n factorial.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.750
And it's written n with
an exclamation mark.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.550
So that's n factorial and that's
the n-th derivative of

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.310
x to the n.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.060
So for the particular function
e to the x, if I worked out

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.730
its series, all the derivatives
I'm trying to get

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.990
are all 1's.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.290
But what the powers of x gives
me these n factorials.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.680
The a's had better divide
by the n factorial.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.180
So let me recall the series for
e to the x, and then go

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.120
onto new functions.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.740
That's the point
of my lecture.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.060
So we're getting e to the x in
a slightly different way from

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.170
the original way, but
this is a good way.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.760
e to the x at x equals 0 is 1.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.700
At the first derivative of e to
the x is 1, so I divide by

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.780
1 factorial.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.080
That's 1.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.340
But here I have to divide by 2
because the second derivative

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.120
is 2 and I want those
to cancel.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.860
And here I divide by--

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.730
what do I divide by?

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.990
6 because the third
derivative is 6.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.600
And a typical term is I have
to divide by n factorial

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.130
because when I take n
derivatives I get n factorial.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.900
The n-th derivative of
that thing we just

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.910
worked out is n factorial.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.610
So I divide by n factorial and
I've got the derivative to

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.730
come out 1.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.760
And that's correct
for e to the x.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.700
So that's the plan, matching
derivatives at x equals 0 by

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.450
each power of x.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.710
And now I'm ready for
a new function.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.890
And a nice choice is sine x.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.960
So now on this board, if I can
come here, I'm going take a

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.800
different function.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.230
No longer e to the x.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.450
My function is going
to be sine x.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.021
Well, I better figure out
all its derivatives.

00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:48.970
And they're nice, of course.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.550
Sine x, its derivative.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.970
Can I just list them all?

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.060
These are the things that
I have to match.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.690
I'll plug in x equals 0.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.160
But let me first find
the derivatives.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.840
The derivative of
sine is cosine.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.590
The derivative of cosine
is minus the sine.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.600
The derivative of minus the
sine is minus the cosine.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:15.550
And then I'm back to sine again,
and repeating forever.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.910
That's a list of the derivatives
of sine x.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.220
This is my f of x here.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.660
This guy, first one.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.130
OK, now I plug in x equals
0 because I want all the

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.120
derivatives at 0.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.270
The whole series is being
built focused on that

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.750
point x equals 0.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.890
So at x equals 0, that's
easy to plug in.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.930
The sine is 0, the cosine is
1, the minus the sine is 0.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.050
Minus the cosine is minus 1.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.260
The sine is 0.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.900
And repeat.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.740
0, 1, 0, minus 1 forever.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.720
OK, so I know the derivatives
that I have to match.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:08.060
Now can I construct the power
series that matches that?

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:13.050
OK, so that power series will
give me sine x, and

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.070
what will it have?

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.710
It starts with 0.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.210
The constant term is 0 because
the sine of 0 when x is 0-- of

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.600
course, we want to get
the answer is 0.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:32.750
Then, the next term, the x,
its coefficient is 1.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.000
1x.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.860
No x squared's in sine x.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.260
No x squared's.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.520
But now minus.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.950
Do I have minus 1x cubed?

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.490
Not quite.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:53.460
Minus x cubed, but I have to
divide by 6 because when I

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.880
take that three derivatives,
it will produce 6.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.520
So I have to divide by 6,
which is 3 factorial.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.590
That's really the number
that's there.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.360
3 times 2 times 1.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.900
6.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.740
Now the fourth degree
term, the x to the

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.950
fourth is not there.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.940
x to the fifth is going to
come in with a plus.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.930
So there's a plus
from this guy.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:26.040
This is x to the 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.280
x to the fifth.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.230
And now what do I
divide by now?

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.480
5 factorial.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.270
120.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.090
And then minus and so on.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.210
Minus an x to the seventh
over 7 factorial.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:50.530
We have created the power series
around 0, focused on 0.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:55.580
And let me remove that 1 because
just waste of space.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.160
x minus x cubed.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.960
All odd powers and
that's because

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.080
sine x is an odd function.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.600
If I change from x to minus x,
everything will change sign.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.420
What would happen if I plugged
in x equal pi?

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.450
Suppose I took x equal pi in
this formula for sine x.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.550
This infinite formula,
keeps going forever.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:32.720
Well, I would get pi minus pi
cubed over 6 plus pi to the

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.040
fifth over 120.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.580
It would look ridiculous.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.870
But you and I know that the
answer would have to come out.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.090
The correct sine of pi?

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.200
0.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.980
I don't plan to do it,
but it has to work.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.600
OK, so that's the sine.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.470
That's the sine.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.810
And it's an odd series.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.900
Now OK, good example.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.040
Its twin has got to
show up here.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.820
The cosine.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.850
What's the series
for the cosine?

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.560
These are the two series
that are worth knowing.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.780
You notice here that slope of
1, the big deal about the

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:15.040
slope of sine x at x equals
0, the slope is 1.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.420
And that does have
a slope of 1.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.990
OK, what about the cosine?

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.500
Well, now I have to plug in.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.460
All right, the cosine is
going to start here.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.460
Cosine minus sine
minus cosine.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.720
Now my f of x is going
to be cosine x.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.920
And I need its derivatives.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.120
I'm going to have three lines
again that are going to look

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.650
just like these three lines.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.490
But they'll be for the cosine.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.400
So they start with a cosine.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.690
Its derivative is
minus the sine.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.200
Its derivative is minus
the cosine.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.600
Its derivative is what?

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:09.430
Plus sine and then cosine, and
forever, minus the sine.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.980
And let me plug in now
at x equals 0.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.530
This is our system.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.470
Find the derivatives,
plug in 0.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.640
So find the derivative at 0.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.780
Well, the function itself,
the 0-th derivative is 1.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.780
The first derivative is 0.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.280
The second derivative
is minus 1.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.000
The third is 0.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.560
The fourth derivative is
plus 1, 0, and so on.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:47.270
It's the same line as we have,
but just starting over by 1.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.770
Starting with the cosine.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.570
I know what derivatives I
want, now I just have to

00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:03.660
create my series for cosine x,
which matches these numbers.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.430
One more time.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.750
Just match those numbers with
the coefficients that I

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:16.050
originally called a0, a1, a2,
a3, but now we have numbers.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.400
OK, at x equals 0.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.580
So how does this series start?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.060
At x equals 0, the
cosine of 0 is 1.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.200
It starts with a 1.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.200
That's the constant term
sitting there.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:38.140
The coefficient of x, the
linear term is 0.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:43.560
Because the cosine has
0 slope at the start.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.270
Then we come to something
that shows up.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:46.910
Minus.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.750
This will be-- now what
are we in to?

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.270
This is the constant, the
first power is gone.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.200
The second power minus
x squared.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.980
But you know if I'm looking to
match the second derivative to

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.280
make it b minus 1.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.000
Right now it's minus 2.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.280
Differentiating would give
me a 2x and a 2.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.830
So I have to divide by that
2 or 2 factorial.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.360
Now it's good.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.430
Now it matches the correct
second derivative minus 1.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.150
Then there's no third
derivative.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.470
The fourth derivative
is plus 1 x to the

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:32.250
fourth over 4 factorial.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:36.580
And then minus and so on, x to
the sixth over 6 factorial.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:44.720
All even powers, so this
is an even powers.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.830
The 0-th, second, fourth,
sixth power.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.700
So it's an even function.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:00.010
That means that the cosine of
minus x is exactly the same as

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.260
the cosine of x.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:12.380
We get a nice little insight
on these two special groups

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.040
for which the sine is the
perfect example of an odd

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.030
function and the cosine
is the perfect

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.660
example of an even function.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.310
Well, there's so much here.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:33.630
What happens if I cut
the series off?

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:38.000
I just want to look at those
first terms to see exactly

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.260
what they represent.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:45.650
Suppose I stop here after
the linear term.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.540
What do I have?

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.250
What is that x just by itself?

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.530
It's really 0 plus x because
there was a 0 from the

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:56.870
constant term.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.260
That is the linear
approximation.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.940
That gives me the equation
of the tangent line, y

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.800
equals x, slope 1.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.050
More interesting, cut
this one off.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.360
Cut this one off here.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.870
That's a very important
estimate.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.810
It's not the exact cosine
because the exact cosine has

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.180
got all these later guys.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.290
But don't forget and I should
have said this from the very

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:34.270
beginning, these n factorials
grow fast. And all the series

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.930
that we're talking about,
because those n factorials

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.590
grow so fast and I'm dividing by
them, I can take any x and

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.520
I get a reasonable number.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:52.280
If I take x equaled pi, that's
this sine series gave me 0.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.254
What do I get if I plug
in x equals pi

00:16:56.254 --> 00:17:01.150
in the cosine series?

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.020
So the cosine series, if I
plugged in x equals pi and had

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.290
patience to go pretty far, my
numbers would be getting near

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.920
the cosine of pi.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.230
Which would be minus 1.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.640
I don't see minus
1 coming out.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.109
Here is 1, minus 1/2
of pi squared.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.980
I don't know, that's around--

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.250
1/2 pi squared might be
around 5 or something.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.319
But they knock each other off.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:32.390
They get very small and we
get the answer minus 1.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:39.170
OK, so those are two important
series and now I get to tell

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.530
you about Euler's
great formula.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:52.560
It connects these three series
that you've seen.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.800
But to make that connection
I have to bring in the

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.280
imaginary number i.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.770
Is that OK?

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.070
Just imagine a number i.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.270
And everybody knows what you're
supposed to imagine.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:14.100
You're supposed to imagine that
i squared is minus 1.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:22.880
And we all know there
is no real number.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.370
The square of a real number is
always going to be greater or

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.590
equal to 0.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:35.400
So let's just create a symbol
i with a rule, with the

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.510
understanding that any time we
see i squared, I'm entitled to

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.750
write minus 1.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.860
OK.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.070
So now, what is Euler's
great formula?

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:54.590
Euler's great formula, his
brilliant insight was make x

00:18:54.590 --> 00:19:00.120
in this e to the x series,
make x imaginary.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.540
Change x to ix.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.410
So make it an imaginary
number.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:11.870
So can I just take Euler's, take
Taylor's series, or oh,

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.460
maybe Euler's out of this
too, because that

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.770
letter e is his initial.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.330
Probably he did.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:23.460
So I guess that's why he found
this lovely connection.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:30.680
So if I take e to the ix and
instead of x in this series I

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.770
put in ix, just go for it.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.750
Let x be imaginary.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:41.370
OK, can I write out the
series 1 plus--

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.330
instead of x I have ix.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.610
And then I have 1 over 2
factorial ix squared.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.890
And then I have 1 over
3 factorial ix cubes.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.810
And 1 over 4 factorial
ix to the fourth.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.350
That's e to the ix.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.100
OK, you say, you just
changed x to ix.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.710
That's all I did.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.380
Now, here's the point.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:17.850
Now I'm going to look at this
mess and I'm going to separate

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:25.140
out the part that is real from
the part that's imaginary.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.820
I'm going to separate it into
its real part and its

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.220
imaginary part.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.760
So what is real in this thing?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.550
I see one is certainly
a real number.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:41.260
Do you see the other one, the
next one that's real?

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.170
It comes from this i squared.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.790
That i squared I can replace
by minus 1, perfectly real.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:53.760
So it's minus from the i squared
1 over 2 factorial.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.850
x squared is still there.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.360
The i squared was minus 1.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.720
That's all.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:05.600
And then would come something
from the i to the fourth.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.540
Because what is i
to the fourth?

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:12.090
It's i squared squared
minus 1 squared.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.620
We'd be back to plus 1.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.470
So plus sign.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:16.100
Good.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:24.070
Now comes the part that has an
i in it and a single i I have

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.430
to live with.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.780
So that i is multiplied by x.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.250
Now I have i cubed.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.600
How do I deal with i cubed?

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:40.070
i cubed is i squared
minus 1 times i.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.490
i squared times i is minus i.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:47.950
So I have a minus i.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.370
1 over 3 factorial and the
x cubed and so on.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.230
Do you see what we have?

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:04.440
Do you see what this real
part of e to the ix is?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.970
It's the cosine.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.080
Right there, same thing.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:17.040
So I'm getting cosine x for the
real part and then i times

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.360
this series.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.740
And you can see what
that series is.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:30.030
It's the sine series, x minus
1/6 x cubed plus 1/20 of x to

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.530
the fifth sine x.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:38.470
There is Euler's great formula
that e to the ix--

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.020
oh, I better write it
on a fresh board.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.645
Maybe I'll just write
it over here.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:53.720
I'm going to copy from this
board my Euler's great formula

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.530
that e to the ix comes out to
have a real part cos x.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.240
Imaginary part gives
me the i sine x.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.420
And I'll write that down.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.610
Now let me work here.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:14.810
e to the ix is cos
x plus i sine x.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.090
And I want to draw a picture.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.340
OK, here's a picture.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.110
Actually, Euler often wrote his
formula, or we often write

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:33.006
his formula because we're taking
cosines and sines.

00:23:33.006 --> 00:23:35.900
Somehow x isn't such--

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.150
those are angles.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:40.840
So it's more natural
to write--

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.160
Now that we've showing up with
sines and cosines, it's more

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.360
natural to write a symbol
that we think of as

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.570
an angle like theta.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:55.360
So you would more often
see it this way.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.750
I'm just changing letters from
x to theta as a way of

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.000
remembering that
it's an angle.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.880
And now I'll draw it.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.040
So I have to draw that thing.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.560
OK, this is the real direction
and that's

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.440
the imaginary direction.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.670
I just go that's
the real part.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.110
I go cos theta across here.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.860
So let that be cos theta.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.590
And then I go upwards in the
imaginary up or down.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:33.970
So across is the real part,
up/down is the imaginary part.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.930
Say sine theta I go up.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:44.390
That height is sine theta
and that angle is theta.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.490
Fantastic.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.320
That's a picture of
Euler's formula.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.350
Well, that's the best
way to see it is

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.880
that beautiful statement.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.040
And this is a picture
to remind us.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.890
We would say that's the complex
plane because points

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.950
have two parts, a real part
and an imaginary part.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.930
Nothing so complex about that.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:22.480
Now, before I stop, we've done
three important series.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.290
Can I mention two more, just two
more out of a long list of

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.610
possibilities?

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.410
One is the most important
series of all, where the

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.720
coefficients are all 1's.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.500
So the coefficients
are all 1's.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.720
That's called the geometric
series.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.110
Let me write its name here.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.080
That's a Taylor series.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.190
That's a power series.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.710
And the function it comes
from happens to be 1

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.670
over 1 minus x.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.220
That's the function.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.110
And you will see why, if you
multiply both sides by 1 minus

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.970
x, I'll get 1 here.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.360
If you watch, everything will
cancel except the 1.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.090
So that's it.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.630
Now, there's a significant
difference between that series

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.940
and e to the x.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.180
The biggest difference is
we're not dividing by n

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.310
factorial anymore.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:32.790
And as a result, these terms
don't get necessarily smaller

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.430
and smaller and smaller.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.410
Unless x is below 1.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:42.640
So we're OK for x below 1.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.530
And x could be negative.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:49.270
I can even say absolute value of
x below 1, then these terms

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:49.930
gets smaller.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.700
But at x equals 1 we're dead.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.030
At x equals 1 I have 1
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.340
All 1's.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.510
I'm getting infinity.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.240
And on the left side I'm
getting infinity also.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.590
At x equals 1 blows up.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.030
OK, one more series,
then we're done.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.630
One more.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:15.080
It's a neat one because it
brings in the logarithm.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.440
How am I going to get it?

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.120
I'm going to start with this
series, which is the big one,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.840
the geometric series.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.170
And I'm going to take the
integral of every term.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.160
So if I integrate 1 I get x.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.460
If I integrate x I get
x squared over 2.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.210
If I integrate x squared
I get x cube over 3.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.530
x fourth over 4 and so on.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.690
Not 3 factorial, just 3.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:52.880
And if I integrate this, well,
let me put the answer down and

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.080
then we can take its derivative
and say, yep, it

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.310
does give that.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.260
So the answer is minus.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.020
This minus sign shows up
here as a minus the

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.010
logarithm of 1 minus x.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:17.540
Because if I take the derivative
of that the

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.190
logarithm always puts this
inside function down to the

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.110
bottom, and then the derivative
of the inside

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:28.350
function, the chain rule brings
out a minus 1, and the

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.720
minus 1's go away,
and beautiful.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:37.230
So just have a look at that
series then for the logarithm.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.170
The logarithm of 1 minus x.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.300
Again, we're matching
at x equals 0.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.040
At x equals 0, this
function is OK.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.750
In fact, at x equals 0,
what is that function?

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.670
Logarithm of 1, which is 0, and
there's no constant term.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.360
Good.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.570
OK, what comments to make about
this final example?

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:04.490
This one was OK for
x smaller than 1.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.750
But then it died
at x equals 1.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:13.890
This one, well, it's getting
a little help dividing

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.120
by 3 and 4 and 5.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.670
But that's puny help.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:24.150
That's no way compared to
dividing by 3 factorial, 4

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:27.270
factorial, and so on, which
will really help.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:32.730
So actually, this series
is also only OK

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.350
out to x equals 1.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.760
At x equals 1, it fails again.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.800
At x equals 1, what do I have?

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:49.240
When x is 1, I have the log
of 0 minus infinity.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.850
I've got infinity
at x equals 1.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:55.020
At x equals 1, this is
1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.230
plus 1/4 plus 1/5.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.640
Getting smaller, but
not very fast and

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.060
adding up to infinity.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.430
So there's a whole discussion.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:12.170
We could spend hours on that
famous series, 1 plus 1/2 plus

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:16.150
1/3 plus a quarter and other
series of numbers.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:21.960
I wanted to do calculus,
derivatives, integrals, so I

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.840
took functions and series of
powers, not series of numbers

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.830
to illustrate this.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:29.660
OK, good.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.520
Thanks.
