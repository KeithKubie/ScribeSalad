00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.520
Let's review our intuition
of what a limit even is.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.580
So let me draw some axes here.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.260
So let's say this is my y-axis,
so try to draw a vertical line.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.050
So that right over
there is my y-axis.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.761
And then let's say
this is my x-axis.

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:20.135
I'll focus on the
first quadrant,

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:22.000
although I don't have to.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.940
So let's say this right
over here is my x-axis.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.780
And then let me draw a function.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.000
So let's say my function
looks something like that,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.280
could look like anything,
but that seems suitable.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.297
So this is the function
y is equal to f of x.

00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:38.380
And just for the sake of
conceptual understanding,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.900
I'm going to say it's
not defined at a point.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.800
I didn't have to do this.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.020
You can find the limit as
x approaches a point where

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.722
the function
actually is defined,

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:47.180
but it becomes that much more
interesting, at least for me,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.513
or you start to understand
why a limit might be relevant

00:00:49.513 --> 00:00:51.690
where a function is not
defined at some point.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.430
So the way I've drawn
it, this function

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.320
is not defined when
x is equal to c.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.989
Now, the way that we've
thought about a limit

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.310
is what does f of x
approach as x approaches c?

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.270
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.582
When x is a reasonable
bit lower than c,

00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:19.840
f of x, for our function that we
just drew, is right over here.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.020
That's what f of x is going to
be equal. y is equal to f of x.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.490
When x gets a little bit
closer, then our f of x

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.560
is right over there.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.070
When x gets even closer,
maybe really almost

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.900
at c, but not quite at c, then
our f of x is right over here.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.750
And the way we see it,
we see that our f of x

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.300
seems to be-- as x gets
closer and closer to c

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.240
it looks like our f
of x is getting closer

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.790
and closer to some
value right over there.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.992
Maybe I'll draw it
with a more solid line.

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.450
And that was actually
only the case

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.840
when x was getting closer
to c from the left,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.290
from values of x less than c.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.650
But what happens as we
get closer and closer

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.490
to c from values of x
that are larger than c?

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.970
Well, when x is over here,
f of x is right over here.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.790
And so that's what f of x
is, is right over there.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.810
When x gets a little bit
closer to c, our f of x

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.140
is right over there.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.710
When x is just very slightly
larger than c, then our f of x

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.770
is right over there.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.360
And you see, once
again, it seems

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.510
to be approaching
that same value.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.140
And we call that value,
that value that f of x

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.460
seems to be approaching
as x approaches

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.150
c, we call that value
L, or the limit.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.700
And so the way we
would denote it

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.124
is we would call that the limit.

00:02:49.124 --> 00:02:50.790
We don't have to call
it L all the time,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.716
but it is referred
to as the limit.

00:02:52.716 --> 00:02:54.090
And the way that
we would kind of

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.560
write that mathematically is
we would say the limit of f

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.120
of x as x approaches
c is equal to L.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.655
And this is a fine conceptual
understanding of limits,

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:12.280
and it really will
take you pretty far,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.880
and you're ready to
progress and start thinking

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.410
about taking a lot of limits.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.940
But this isn't a very
mathematically-rigorous

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.800
definition of limits.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.180
And so this sets us
up for the intuition.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.470
In the next few videos,
we will introduce

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.610
a mathematically-rigorous
definition

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.120
of limits that will
allow us to do things

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.360
like prove that the
limit as x approaches c

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.820
truly is equal to L.
