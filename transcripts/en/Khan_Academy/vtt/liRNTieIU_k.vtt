00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.580
Factor 25x squared
minus 30x plus 9.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.590
And we have a leading
coefficient that's not a 1,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.130
and it doesn't look like
there are any common factors.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.050
Both 25 and 30 are divisible by
5, but 9 isn't divisible by 5.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.510
We could factor
this by grouping.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.080
But if we look a little
bit more carefully here,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.530
see something interesting.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.410
25 is a perfect square, and 25x
squared is a perfect square.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.390
It's the square of 5x.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.720
And then nine is also
a perfect square.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.374
It's the square of
3, or actually, it

00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:35.790
could be the square
of negative 3.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.730
This could also be the
square of negative 5x.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.210
Maybe, just maybe this
could be a perfect square.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.930
Let's just think
about what happens

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.910
when we take the perfect square
of a binomial, especially

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.000
when the coefficient on
the x term is not a 1.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.130
If we have ax plus b
squared, what will this look

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.810
like when we expand
this into a trinomial?

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.440
Well, this is the same
thing as ax plus b times ax

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.370
plus b, which is the same
thing as ax times ax.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:15.310
Ax times ax is a squared x
squared plus ax times b, which

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.430
is abx plus b times
ax, which is another.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.450
You You could call
it bax or abx, plus b

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.140
times b, so plus b squared.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.110
This is equal to a squared
x squared plus-- these two

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.060
are the same term--
2abx plus c squared.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.450
This is what happens when
you square a binomial.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.600
Now, this pattern seems
to work out pretty good.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.520
Let me rewrite our
problem right below it.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.260
We have 25x squared
minus 30x plus 9.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.240
If this is a
perfect square, then

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.480
that means that the a squared
part right over here is 25.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.190
And then that means
that the b squared

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.630
part-- let me do this in
a different color-- is 9.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.900
That tells us that a
could be plus or minus 5

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.460
and that b could
be plus or minus 3.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.990
Now let's see if this gels
with this middle term.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.030
For this middle
term to work out--

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.420
I'm trying to look for good
colors-- 2ab, this part

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.400
right over here, needs to
be equal to negative 30.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.780
Or another way-- let me write
it over here-- 2ab needs

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.450
to be equal to negative 30.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.570
Or if we divide
both sides by 2, ab

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.950
needs to be equal
to negative 15.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.610
That tells us that the
product is negative.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.120
One has to be positive,
and one has to be negative.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.175
Now, lucky for us the
product of 5 and 3 is 15.

00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:07.550
If we make one of them positive
and one of them negative,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.170
we'll get up to negative 15.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.460
It looks like things
are going to work out.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.660
We could select a is
equal to positive 5,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.830
and b is equal to negative 3.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.450
Those would work out to ab
being equal to negative 15.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.910
Or we could make a is
equal to negative 5,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.020
and b is equal to positive 3.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.770
Either of these will work.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.480
If we factor this
out, this could

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.670
be either a is negative--
let's do this first one.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.670
It could either be a
is 5, b is negative 3.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.290
This could either be
5x minus 3 squared.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.030
a is 5, b is negative 3.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.470
It could be that.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.631
Or you could have-- we could
switch the signs on the two

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:56.130
terms.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.480
Or a could be negative 5,
and b could be positive 3.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.330
Or it could be negative
5x plus 3 squared.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.870
Either of these
are possible ways

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.302
to factor this term out here.

00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:13.010
And you say wait, how
does this work out?

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.650
How can both of these
multiply to the same thing?

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.300
Well, this term, remember,
this negative 5x plus 3,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.720
we could factor
out a negative 1.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.400
So this right here is the same
thing as negative 1 times 5x

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.800
minus 3, the whole
thing squared.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.900
And that's the same thing
as negative 1 squared times

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.630
5x minus 3 squared.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.650
And negative 1 squared
is clearly equal to 1.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.170
That's why this and
this are the same thing.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.460
This comes out to the same
thing as 5x minus 3 squared,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.020
which is the same thing
as that over there.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.650
Either of these are
possible answers.
