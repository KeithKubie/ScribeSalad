00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.019
Well I'm going to start by writing down
5 kilometers, and then I know I need to

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.280
convert, so I'm going to get ready for
my conversion factor.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.370
And I want kilometers on the bottom,
so I can simplify with this.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.173
So I multiply by 1 mile divided by
1.609 kilometers and kilometers cancel.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.450
And carrying out this multiplication,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.400
I find I've run a distance
of about 3.1 miles.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.522
So if you've ever run a 5K,
as people call it, you've run 3.1 miles.
