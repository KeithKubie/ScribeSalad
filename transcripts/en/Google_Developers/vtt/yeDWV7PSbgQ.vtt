DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don
Dodge, and this

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.320
is Google Root Access.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.520
Today, we're going to talk
about open source and

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.500
specifically how startups
can use open source

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.040
to build their business.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.230
My guest today is
Chris DiBona.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.470
Chris runs the Open Source
Programs for Google.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.140
Welcome, Chris.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.400
CHRIS DIBONA: Hi, Don.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.430
DON DODGE: So tell me
a little bit about--

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.620
you've been involved in open
source for a long, long time.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.090
So tell me a little bit
about what you do.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.170
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, I look after
open source for Google.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.330
And we've talked about that
in a previous show.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.900
But I've also been just involved
in companies that use

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.220
open source for--

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.390
since 1994, I guess.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.480
It's when I was first exposed
to it personally and started

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.700
bringing it into my work.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.910
So, yeah.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.340
DON DODGE: Well, you
advise startups.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.810
CHRIS DIBONA: I do.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.200
DON DODGE: You invest
in startups.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.520
CHRIS DIBONA: I do.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.740
DON DODGE: You work with
Google Ventures.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.230
CHRIS DIBONA: I do.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.470
Yeah, so I've been doing
that for probably about

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.590
nine years, 10 years.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.620
I had a startup myself that
failed miserably.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.030
So maybe you shouldn't
take my advice.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.080
But yeah.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.780
So and obviously when people
want to talk to me, it's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.210
oftentimes about how to use
open-source software and how

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.410
to use that in a developer
ecosystem, how to reach

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.220
developers, and that
kind of thing.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.110
DON DODGE: So let's
give people a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.690
little free advice here.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.790
How can startups best
use open source?

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.430
CHRIS DIBONA: Well first of all,
if they're not using open

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.620
source, I would probably
not advise them.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.860
And not because that's all I'm
good at but because I don't

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.720
have a lot of respect for people
who want to reinvent

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.640
the wheel that much.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.390
Starting from scratch on
software seems very broken to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.770
me when you can start with--

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.470
I mean, look at the Ruby on
Rails revolution and all those

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.340
web startups that came
out of that.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.690
They didn't have to
start with Rails.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.490
They could have just written a
bunch of PHP and started from

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.000
scratch with their own
templating and their own

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
database access libraries.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.460
But they used Ruby
on Rails why?

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.880
Because it made things really,
really, really easy.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.949
And they could be creative on
top of it first instead of

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.120
having to build all these
fundamentals and then be

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.850
creative and try to attract
a user base and the rest.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.090
So when I talk to startups,
it's because they want to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.250
continue to use open-source
software in an effective way.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.550
Or they're at the point where
they want to release their own

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.230
software or bring developers
into their ecosystem.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.610
And that's when I end up
talking to people.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.950
DON DODGE: So you mentioned
Ruby on Rails.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.220
That's interesting.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.350
What are some of the other
foundational kinds of open

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.120
source that startups
should consider?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.570
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, it depends
on when in time, when in the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.080
dusty annals of time we're
talking about.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.110
Because I mean, there were times
when people were making

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.090
a big jump over to open-source
databases, open-source

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.830
operating systems, open-source
languages, open-source

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.880
frameworks like Rails, and
open-source scripting

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.230
approaches.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.320
I mean, there's so many things
that you would slap the open

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.570
source label onto and either use
or learn from or whatever.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.955
And it's just fast.

00:03:03.955 --> 00:03:06.430
It's like saying, which drop of
this ocean would you like

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.520
to speak about?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.820
It's really interesting.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.430
When people decide to start
releasing and trying to drive,

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.180
frankly, the direction of an
open-source project from

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.740
inside a startup or from inside
a company, that's also

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.820
something I'm pretty good at.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.330
I've been doing it
for a long time.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.090
When I was at VA Linux and VA
Research, and now at Google,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.480
it's a fundamental part of what
I do is how do we drive

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.080
developer desire and developer
productivity towards these

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.510
platforms and ecosystems
around open source?

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.780
DON DODGE: So lots of
startups use Hadoop.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.610
I talked to one yesterday
that uses Freebase.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.000
There's MongoDB.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.290
CHRIS DIBONA: Redis
and LevelDB and--

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.320
DON DODGE: So what are some of
the decisions you would make

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.820
on which way to go using
some of these things?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.670
CHRIS DIBONA: So I usually start
with sort of the basics

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.030
of what's important
to the company now

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.400
and in the near future.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.550
I don't want to sound too
conservative here, but a lot

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.310
of times people want to put the
scaling cart before the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.370
user horse.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.710
And they don't really think
through, OK, I have to have

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.400
users before I worry about
scaling to millions of them.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.230
Or they want to plan ahead
for scaling that

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.519
will never, ever happen.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.910
Or they don't really understand
a lot of the tools

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.750
that are out there that have
been around for a while,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.500
things like MySQL
and Postgres.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.150
You can scale them fairly
dramatically on modern

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.910
hardware before you're ever
going to see any sort of blips

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.810
that would even require you
to go to a master-slave

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.670
relationship, much less to a
NoSQL-style database where

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.280
you're going to lose a lot of
functionality in return for

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.640
what you think is scaling.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.650
DON DODGE: And most startups
never get to

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.670
those scaling issues.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.120
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, I mean,
I don't want to sound too

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.060
pessimistic, but yeah.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.560
Most startups have a really hard
time attracting users,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.420
much less scaling the
users they have.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.190
That said, I mean, you don't
want to plan for failure.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.560
You want to plan for
awesomeness and

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.760
hyper growth, right?

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.940
And so there are some things
you can do in the very

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.930
beginning to do that.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.840
Like you can ensure that your
database queries are a certain

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.890
kind and aren't too many
left-handed joins or whatever.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.935
But it really comes down to
understanding the fundamentals

00:05:19.935 --> 00:05:22.000
that underpin your system.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.870
It's funny, because a lot of
people talk about Twitter's

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.770
scaling problems in
the early days.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.480
But if you think about it, they
scaled as well as they

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.610
needed to to grow
very quickly.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.370
Right?

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.240
We made jokes about fail whales,
but you know what,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.480
people were seeing them.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.940
And that meant that people were
using the hell out of

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.390
that thing, right?

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.070
So yeah, it's embarrassing to
show that underbelly of your

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.310
company, that you failed
to scale today.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.940
But at the same time, it's
good that you have that

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.390
problem is sort of the
long and short of it.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.710
And the reality is, is by the
time that you have that

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.700
problem, there are people that
we know that we can bring in

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.490
and say, OK, you want to
scale MySQL for reals?

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.850
You want to scale Apache
for reals?

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.610
You want to start using
memcached for reals?

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.420
Well, here's who we're
going to talk to.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.750
And here's who you're going
to want to have come in.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.630
Or here's the kind of software
you're going to bring into the

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.040
company to make it
scale better.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.570
It's funny, because if you
look at Wikipedia and

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.000
Livejournal and how they
scaled, it's extremely

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.180
instructive.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.730
It's actually fairly shocking
how many people never really

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.460
looked at how these sites scaled
and instead went this

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.720
other direction, which was
incredibly computer intensive

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.960
and CPU intensive and machine
intensive, when they could

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.880
have just been much more
aggressive about caching.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.270
People fail to understand how
little their databases are

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.580
changing from user view to user
view, for instance, and

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.480
how aggressively caches
can reduce the

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.220
draw on your machinery.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.040
And then you get into these
side conversations.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.765
Well, what happens when the
cache is empty and you

00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:53.440
need to fill it?

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.080
And how can you pre-fill
caches?

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.820
And so we can have all
these discussions.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.730
But it's pretty surprising to
me how little people have

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.120
learned from the scaling
lessons of the past.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.140
And I'm not even talking about
the Slashdots and the circa

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.620
2000 or circa 2001.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.830
I'm talking about things that
have happened in the last

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:17.240
couple of years and how little
they've learned about some of

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.280
the cloud providers and
their I/O performance.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.940
DON DODGE: Where are
these lessons?

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.620
CHRIS DIBONA: They're
hard to find.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.960
There are certain conferences,
I think, that are better than

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.710
others at exposing them.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.140
But the thing is, if you go
to YouTube and you type in

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.380
"scaling my favorite website,"
whether your favorite website

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.620
is Twitter or Google or
whatever, there's somebody who

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.840
has given a talk at a Google
I/O or an OSCON or whatever

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.470
about exactly that topic.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.890
Spend the 45 minutes during your
lunch hour, eat at your

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.100
desk or whatever, and learn.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.560
There are so many great lessons
that are just waiting

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.340
there on YouTube.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.045
I mean, really, you don't
even have to go

00:07:55.045 --> 00:07:56.420
to a special website.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.840
You can just go right there
and just type in "scaling

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.770
Twitter," "scaling this," and
you'll still see people

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.240
talking about exactly what they
encountered and what they

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.200
experienced and how
they did it.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.400
Suppose you're using Rails.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.880
You could say "scaling Rails."
Suppose you're using Drupal.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.170
"Scaling Drupal." I mean, you'll
find these lessons.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:10.620
They're out there.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.180
You don't need a guy like me.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:12.950
You don't need Brian Aker.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.300
You don't need to go pay guys
like that, even though they're

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.390
great, to go and learn
these things.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.860
But they've already told you.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.300
DON DODGE: So just a Google
search or a YouTube search on

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.130
scaling Drupal or scaling--

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.680
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, and often
the code is right there.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.680
You can copy it.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.410
It's open source.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.390
You can bring it over.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.393
I mean, I think Brian's
Fitzpat--

00:08:33.393 --> 00:08:34.120
sorry.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.799
We joke about the wrong Fitz
inside the company.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.510
Brad Fitzpatrick, who wrote

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.130
Livejournal and then memcached.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.830
He's given the scaling memcached
and advances in

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.370
memcached talk at OSCON.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.180
I think he gave it
for five years.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.320
And the content certainly
changed and updated.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.820
And it's different now than it
was the last time he gave it,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.270
but not fundamentally.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.020
I mean, the lessons are all
there for you to learn.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.720
And it doesn't take a lot
of time to learn.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.670
You can turn around in an
hour from right now.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.700
You can shut off this podcast.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.320
DON DODGE: Please don't.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.500
CHRIS DIBONA: Don't.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.530
And you could learn enough to
scale 2x, 10x, 100x, the

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.320
performance of MySQL, the
performance of Apache, the

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.410
performance of memcached, the
performance of Rails.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.810
And we're talking in and out.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.400
This is not a huge
amount of time.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.750
You would have spent that long
re-watching "House Of Cards"

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.470
on Netflix.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.910
DON DODGE: So literally, you can
find some experts giving

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.870
talks on scaling issues or using
open source issues on

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.540
YouTube or Google.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.960
CHRIS DIBONA: Yes, exactly.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.980
And you owe it to yourself
to do that

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.045
if you're in a startup.

00:09:40.045 --> 00:09:42.200
Because startups, you have
all the great problems.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.390
You have the problems
of getting users.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.370
Once you get the users--

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.630
and there's lots of talks
on getting users.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.180
I think you've given a talk on
how to become a startup.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.760
It's like getting the users,
serving the users, and then

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.100
even monetizing, advertising.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.390
Everything is out there.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.800
Honestly, when I did
my startup--

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.670
and failed at it, I should
just point out.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.540
This is the one I failed at.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.910
It didn't fail because
of scaling.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.490
It didn't fail because
of even attracting a

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.450
potential user base.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.290
I had 25,000 people who
would have paid me

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.750
as soon as we launched.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.060
It was failure to launch.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.920
It was failure to execute
internally.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.165
And so there's ample
opportunities to fail

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.340
independent of this knowledge.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.560
But there's so much knowledge
out there now.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.260
DON DODGE: Let's talk about
tools that are available to

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.960
help you manage your code or
manage open source and merging

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.780
it with your proprietary code.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.350
CHRIS DIBONA: OK.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.990
So we had talked earlier about
segregation of code so that

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.010
you know what you're using
and how you're using it.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.740
There's tooling out there
that will help you track

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.020
open-source code and the rest.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.920
But honestly, there's
not a lot you have

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.960
to worry about there.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.570
If you're shipping software--

00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:00.480
like you're writing an iOS app
or an Android Play app--

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.570
you'll want to be a little more
careful about the GPLs

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.040
and the share alike licenses
if you're not ready

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.600
to share your code.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:15.530
But as far as tooling goes,
GitHub, code.google.com,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.280
they're out there to help you
share and interact with these

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.420
outside communities already.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.450
So what sort of tooling
do you mean, Don?

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:26.260
DON DODGE: Well, for example,
I've heard of startups that,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.200
when they were in the process of
being acquired, discovered

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.480
open-source code they didn't
even know they had, because

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.740
some random developer employees
put open-source code

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.310
in there and didn't tell
them about it.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.020
And they didn't discover
it until later.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.320
CHRIS DIBONA: And that tends to
slow down acquisitions and

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.150
exits and the rest.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.010
So again, just tell
your engineers.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.060
And I've told tons of engineers
this in the

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.210
companies I've advised.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.920
It's real simple.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.960
If you bring software into the
company, if you're not being

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.570
creative in your brain and
typing it into the computer,

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.380
put it in the third
party directory.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.040
Think about where that code
is coming from and

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.940
just keep it separate.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.220
And then that's really
all you need.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.290
If you're the kind of company
that ships software, well,

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.050
you're going to care about
if you're using

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.910
a share alike license.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.400
If you're the kind of company
that ships on the web, you're

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.020
going to care about the ones
that really sort of want you

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:25.030
to pay instead of doing
that, the AGPLs.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.130
So just a little bit
of foresight, and

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.180
it'll save some trouble.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.070
DON DODGE: In the early days of
a startup, just eight or 10

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.630
guys hacking away and building
code, and you're not really

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.600
paying attention to having nice,
tidy code repositories

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.280
and keeping track of where you
picked up open-source code and

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.210
that kind of stuff.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.680
CHRIS DIBONA: That
does happen.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.140
Or they're not as complete as
we would want them to be in

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.070
our part of the world.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.480
And that happens.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.600
So the problem is it's like
everything in development.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.830
You can do it now, or
you can do it later.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.780
If you do it later, it's going
to take you 10, 100 times as

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.680
much work to do.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.000
So to pull out a piece of
software that is running

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.270
inside your service before you
are acquired by another

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.250
company is going to take a vast

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.960
amount of work to replicate.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.670
So you can do a couple
of things right now

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.000
as a software developer.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.020
You just get in the habit of
dropping third-party code in a

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.390
third-party directory.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.210
You can get in the habit of just
thinking through where

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.190
code comes from.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.840
You can get the habit, frankly,
of learning from

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.470
places instead of just copying
the code if there's no license

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.460
apparent, as opposed to later
having to pull it out.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.750
I've had to go back on
acquisitions and say, OK, if

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.620
you want to be purchased by
us, before we can give you

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.150
money, or before you can hit
a milestone, you have to

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.540
do x, y, and z.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.600
And the look on--

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.080
actually, the non-engineer
face is always pretty

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.520
entertaining.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.580
But the engineers are like, OK,
how am I going to do this?

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:49.980
OK.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.830
And it's usually actually
really easy to do.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.430
It's not hard.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.990
Usually, with most open-source
packages, you're putting them

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.900
separate anyway, and
then you're calling

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.390
them in certain ways.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.040
Or they're designed in such a
way that your code is very

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.750
clearly delineated
from their code.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.140
But yeah, sometimes people are
like, wait, we could delay our

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.670
acquisition because of this?

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.320
We could delay our exit
because of this?

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.920
And it's like, yeah, you know,
because we have to respect

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.910
these people who have been so
generous as to give their time

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.110
and code to you.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.280
All we have to do is be
a little courteous.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.530
And that's the right
thing to do.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.790
DON DODGE: So there are tools
like Black Duck software.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.110
CHRIS DIBONA: Black
Duck, Palamida.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.510
There's OpenLogic, which
is a nonprofit.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.010
DON DODGE: So these tools will
review your source code and

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.920
find where there are open-source
segments and tell

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.100
you what licenses
you need to do.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.460
So there are simple tools out
there that can help you.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.970
CHRIS DIBONA: There's some very
simple tools out there.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.990
We don't use Black Duck
here, Palamida here.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.900
It's just, we're a
search company.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.900
We're good at that
kind of thing.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:52.750
They're fine.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:57.230
Honestly, we've gotten to the
point now, at Google at least,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.010
if we see the nature of your
startup, I can tell you what

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.120
software they're using.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.710
It's video startups
use FFmpeg.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.432
The use some of these
other libraries.

00:15:07.432 --> 00:15:11.680
If you're some consumer
communications app, I know

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.420
what libraries you're using.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.510
And it's not just me.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.920
There's plenty of people
like me who are like,

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.200
OK, you're like this.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.585
Or you could just buy that
expertise from the Palamidas

00:15:20.585 --> 00:15:22.165
and the Black Ducks
and the rest.

00:15:22.165 --> 00:15:25.780
DON DODGE: So let's talk about
another part of it.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.420
Is it reasonable for a
startup to build a

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.580
viable open-source community?

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.260
CHRIS DIBONA: So yes and no.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.440
What we see more often is an
open-source community that

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440
becomes a startup.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.550
You saw this--

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.590
I think, actually, Mongo
started this way.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.960
I know that Drupal did and
Acquia, which is the Drupal

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.320
commercialization company.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.090
Joomla was a little
bit of both.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.510
I think they started-- they
wanted to do a CMS, but they

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.930
knew that to compete
in that market they

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.030
had to be open source.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.380
So it just depends.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.850
But yeah, I think fundamental
to having a developer

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.190
ecosystem around your product,
whether it's open source or

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.000
not, you're going to be using
open source examples.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.930
If you look at how Google does
it, and we've done since the

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.160
very beginning, when we release
an example of code,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.430
when you see a piece of code
in a Google blog, like the

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.740
Google Coder blog, you know
that license is there.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.300
Even if it's just a snippet, we
say snippets are licensed

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.930
under the Apache license,
[? taxes ?] license under

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.940
Creative Commons
ShareAlike 3.0.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.320
We say this at the bottom of
every blog, and we say this in

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.850
the About boxes, and we say
this all over the place,

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.890
because we want to have the
right relationship with our

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.080
developers.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.050
We say, if you have this
software, here is the deal.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.880
And I have to be honest with
you, one of the things that's

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.740
been happening lately around
hackathons and the rest, they

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.150
say if you take part in this
hackathon you're giving us all

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.110
of your patents, all the work
you're doing, all the

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.040
copyright, and the right to use
you in our marketing and

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.510
da da da da da.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.910
And it's actually
deeply unfair.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.980
DON DODGE: That sounds
kind of scary.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.880
CHRIS DIBONA: It is scary.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.620
It should really make people
pause and wait and look at

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.630
them, because it's come down
to there are some-- like

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.935
Googlers want to do
these hacker cups

00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.160
and hackathons sometimes.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.470
And I have to tell them no in
some of these cases unless

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.119
they change the terms
of the contest.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:05.920
And what's funny about contests
and the way contest

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.445
law works in the United States,
if you structure it as

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:10.589
a contest, you have to give the
same rules to everybody

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.339
who takes part in it.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.720
So you can't fix it
after the fact.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.980
You have to fix it before the
contest starts and before

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.760
people start registering
for this contest.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.660
So it's really a place where
every once in while, the

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.140
rapaciousness of the industry
will pop its head up and say

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.619
hey, I'm over here.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.640
And you have to sort of have a
real eagle eye towards that.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.210
Because people think nothing of
joining these hackathons.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.650
And so what I try to do on
Google's side is make sure

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.500
that ours don't have those
kinds of stanzas in their

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.400
terms and conditions.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.260
DON DODGE: And so if I'm
a hacker and I want to

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.960
participate in a hackathon,
what do I

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.870
need to look out for?

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:43.970
I've never seen this.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.910
CHRIS DIBONA: Look out for terms
in the terms of services

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:51.680
of the hackathon that say all
the work of all participants

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.070
in this hackathon become the
property of or are given an

00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:00.240
exclusive, and sometimes even
non-exclusive, right to all

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.170
patents and copyright
and all the rest.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.310
You've seen these sorts of
agreements happen when people

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.820
try to do deals with big
companies, right?

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.000
It's like, sometimes you just
have to take it and

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.090
just stick with it.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.360
But most the time, you should be
controlling your destiny a

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.110
little more carefully
than that.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.520
And on behalf of our employees,
I have to.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.670
So sometimes I have to give the
bad news that they can't

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.300
take part, which I hate doing.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.360
Because I don't want to tell
somebody that thing you think

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.070
is for fun and for good and
computers science is not.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.580
It's just nasty.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.030
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.080
I'd never heard that before.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.290
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, so that's
something that's actually been

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.600
an emerging issue lately,
because hackathons have gotten

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.660
super popular over
the last year.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.250
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:48.220
Another recent issue, I read a
story this morning about crowd

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.700
funding of open-source
projects.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.200
So sort of like Kickstarter
for capital applied to

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.180
open-source projects.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.060
And it sort of blew my mind.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.090
I had not seen that before.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.860
CHRIS DIBONA: So we have, in
this world of open source,

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.650
back in 1997 there was a company
called Source Exchange

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.660
that tried this, where basically
they would have bug

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.500
bounties that would be directed
toward specific

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.460
improvements on open-source
software.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.470
And then CollabNet, this was
their initial business model

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.580
before they switched over to
Version Control and the rest.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.230
And then half a dozen
since then.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.590
And I don't want to sound
negative on the idea, but by

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:30.220
the time open source wants
capital, wants money to drive

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.310
development, they either form a
company the way that Acquia

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:39.650
is for Drupal or whatever, or
companies will hire developers

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.640
directly to contribute.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.750
I haven't seen crowd
funding that works

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.070
for open source yet.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.950
And if you say, well,
what about the Ouya,

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:50.620
and what about this?

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.190
I would say, well, those were
actually hardcore products,

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.100
and they're using open source,
but they're not really

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.030
contributing to open source.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.420
Or you say there's a
recent iteration

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.280
of PiDev, for instance.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.140
And he's like, if I get
money I'll do this

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:04.640
and this and this.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.260
And he says if he hits a certain
threshold, he'll make

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:06.940
it open source.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.200
And it's like, well that
doesn't sound like

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:08.990
open source to me.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.650
That sounds like you're funding
the development of a

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.410
specific kind of development
tool.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.730
And maybe it'll be open source
if he hits 250,000.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.920
It's like, so you hit
these sort of like--

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.830
open source is just the
sugar on the cake.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.590
It's just this syntactic
sugar, as it were.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.800
But it's not what it is.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.750
And then I guess we had talked
about this earlier, and you'd

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.660
mentioned that there was like an
equity stake that was also

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.650
going to be proposed.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.270
DON DODGE: Yes.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.650
CHRIS DIBONA: And I have
to be honest with you.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.390
As somebody involved in
startups, I can't see wanting

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.920
to dilute across 10,000 people
an equity stake.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.350
People forget.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.230
And I know the JOBS Act changed
a lot of things.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:52.510
But the fundamental difficulty
of having a lot of

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.180
stakeholders is not to
be underestimated.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:56.810
DON DODGE: Right.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.460
CHRIS DIBONA: I mean, there's
a reason why companies avoid

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.465
going public for so long when
they're profitable.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:09.870
It's a significant tax on the
company to have to report for

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.470
many, many shareholders.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.120
And in fact, it's funny.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.090
When people do go public, it's
because they have to do that

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.590
tracking anyways, because they
have too many shareholders.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:20.130
So they might as well go public
since they're going to

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.205
have to be paying the price
anyway of having to share all

00:21:22.205 --> 00:21:23.000
that information.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.330
So I'm not as thrilled
with the idea.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.050
I should read up more on this
most recent version of it.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.250
But it's tough.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.210
So you'll have to convince me
that it's going to work where

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:39.080
it hasn't worked before and that
the few models that have

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.830
worked for commercialization of
open-source communities and

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.210
open-source projects
that they've

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.750
stopped working somehow.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.250
DON DODGE: So I think your point
is that if you have a

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.730
successful open-source project
that's attracting developers

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.960
and is becoming successful, then
you aren't going to have

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.390
a problem raising
money anyway.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.750
CHRIS DIBONA: Exactly.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.150
So I've never seen anyone
having problems from

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.060
[? name VCs, ?]

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.060
name whatever, getting
funding.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.450
DON DODGE: And conversely, if
you don't have a successful

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.230
open-source project, the chances
of raising money

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.520
through a Kickstarter kind
of thing are pretty slim.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.100
CHRIS DIBONA: Are lower, yes.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.252
Now, it's funny about
Kickstarter.

00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:20.330
And this will sound orthogonal,
but it's not, and

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.230
the success of self-publishing
novels on these digital

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.490
marketplaces, where
basically you're

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.400
cutting out a middleman.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.890
So I think that there's probably
some knowledge to be

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:31.770
gained there.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.260
Is there a situation in the
realm that we're talking about

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.510
that looks like the cutting
out of a middle man?

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.230
Maybe.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.700
But I've always been deeply
suspicious of people who want

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.380
to be the middle man for
me to open source.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.300
So we've been approached by lots
of people who say, what

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.240
we'll do is we'll take Google
money, and we'll make sure it

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.530
gets distributed to these
program groups or these

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:54.785
developers.

00:22:54.785 --> 00:22:58.080
And I'm like, or we can
just cut them checks.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:03.740
Why would we let you rip 5%,
10%, 30% off the top to give

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.960
us the pleasure of funding some
organization that's--

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.250
so I'm a little skeptical of
a Kickstarter model for

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.050
funding like that.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.330
But I'm happy to be wrong.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.170
If it creates more open-source
code, who cares?

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.140
DON DODGE: So the best advice
I heard from you in the past

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.700
10 minutes is if you're a
startup that wants to use open

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.930
source, do a search on Google
or YouTube for how to use it

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.400
or how to scale it,
and you can find a

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.690
lot of great advice.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.700
CHRIS DIBONA: Or the
best warning ever.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.600
A lot of people will say, if you
do this, you're going to

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.090
be screwed.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:36.810
Don't do this.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.710
And it usually won't affect what
you want to do with the

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:41.530
software at all.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.640
It's just like, oh, if I go down
that road, I'm going to

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.320
have 10 times the queries, so
I don't want to do that.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.080
DON DODGE: So even great
advice is free.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:49.760
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.650
It really is.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.370
It's better than free.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.380
It's really high-quality HD
streams from some of the

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.520
smartest people in
development.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.300
And you can really buff up your
engineers in ways that

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.990
sending them to conferences
won't do and

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.620
sending them to training.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.470
DON DODGE: Just watch YouTube.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.510
CHRIS DIBONA: Just watch YouTube
for a little bit.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.887
Have watching YouTube parties
during lunch or something.

00:24:11.887 --> 00:24:13.170
I don't know.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.370
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.580
Well, that's another good
piece of advice.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.640
If you're a startup, just watch

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.220
YouTube videos at lunch--

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:20.950
CHRIS DIBONA: It's
really true.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.430
DON DODGE: --on how to do
things, and you can learn more

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.060
than a week at a conference.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.910
CHRIS DIBONA: I would say that's
almost certainly true.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:26.970
And conferences are a blast.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:27.730
I love going to conferences.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.530
I love speaking at them.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.230
Well, most of them.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.840
Not all of them.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.980
We talked about that
earlier, too.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.220
But I won't say that out loud.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.390
But you're not going to go to
more than one, two conferences

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:41.020
a year, because you're murdering
a week of your life.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.770
And that's 1/52 of your
productive time.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.640
And then if you want a vacation
that's another.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.880
So I mean, you're just chopping
away at the time you

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.660
have to spend on your
life's work.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.230
Why would you want to do that?

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.390
DON DODGE: Well, thank you
for sharing with us.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.915
CHRIS DIBONA: Thanks
for having me.

00:24:54.915 --> 00:24:55.820
DON DODGE: This was terrific.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.050
Thank you very much.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.380
CHRIS DIBONA: Good
talking to you.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.850
DON DODGE: And thank
you for joining us

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.320
on Google Root Access.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.270
Join us again next week when
we'll talk about a topic of

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.630
interest to startups.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:05.880
Thank you.
