00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.530
- [Voiceover] At the
Constitutional Convention of 1787,

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.539
the proposal to replace the existing

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:09.208
Articles of Confederation
with a federal constitution

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:12.618
were met with fierce opposition.

00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:15.096
So, what's off here is what was met

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:16.973
with fierce opposition?

00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:19.620
Well, the proposal,
the proposal to replace

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.153
the existing Articles of Confederation

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:22.557
with a federal constitution.

00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:24.310
The proposal is what is being met

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.829
with fierce opposition.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.330
Now the proposal, this is clearly,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.174
we're talking about one
proposal, the proposal.

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:35.745
This is right over here
is singular, singular.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.962
While this right over,
they're saying were met.

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:40.133
Well, one thing, you wouldn't use were,

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.908
if you're talking about a singular thing

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:47.134
that's it's happening to,
that it's being met with.

00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:48.898
So this right over here,

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:52.779
this verb is for plural.

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:54.765
This is for if we had many proposals.

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:56.990
If this said, the proposals
to replace the existing

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.658
Articles of Confederation were
met with fierce opposition,

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:01.900
then that would make sense.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.862
But this needs to be singular.

00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:05.047
So let's look at the options.

00:01:05.047 --> 00:01:06.640
So we definitely don't like it as is,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.041
so let's rule that out.

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:10.212
And so let's see if we can see one

00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:13.082
that is where the verb

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:17.723
matches the singular noun.

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:21.864
So let's see, at the
Constitutional Convention of 1787,

00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:23.954
the proposal, and you know, we could even

00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:25.869
for the sake of kind
of thinking about this,

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.392
we can ignore to replace the existing

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:30.733
Articles of Confederation
with a federal constitution

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:35.725
So the proposal having been
met with fierce opposition.

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:38.517
Well, once again, now
it's not even giving us

00:01:38.517 --> 00:01:40.543
an action for the proposal.

00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:42.215
It's leaving us hanging.

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:43.875
It's a sentence fragment,
there's no predicate.

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:46.475
So we can rule this one out.

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:49.807
The proposal it met
with fierce opposition.

00:01:49.807 --> 00:01:54.168
Well now it's giving us
a noun and then a pronoun

00:01:54.168 --> 00:01:55.650
to refer to the same thing.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.829
So that doesn't make any sense.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.080
The proposal met with fierce opposition.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.016
That looks pretty good.

00:02:04.016 --> 00:02:06.141
Now let's just read it
out, the whole thing.

00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:09.575
At the Constitutional Convention of 1787,

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:12.456
the proposal to replace the existing

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:16.252
Articles of Confederation
with a federal constitution

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:19.503
met with fierce opposition.

00:02:19.503 --> 00:02:22.768
So that seems exactly right.

00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:26.619
A single proposal can be
met with fierce opposition.

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.674
You wouldn't say were met with.

00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:30.508
So this seems right.

00:02:30.508 --> 00:02:31.994
Now let's just look at this last one.

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:36.011
The proposal met their fierce opposition.

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:37.973
So who's their referring to.

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:42.106
They're not talking
about, this is ambiguous.

00:02:42.106 --> 00:02:44.497
Who is this protagonist?

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:47.246
This possessive pronoun their.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.326
I don't even see who it's referring to.

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:53.052
So let's rule that one out.

00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:55.473
So we definitely like D.
