Psych2Go's Five Dating Tips for People with Social Anxiety.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.360
Have you ever been at a party and found yourself making better friends with the dog or cat often a quiet corner somewhere,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.240
rather than mingling with the company of the human variety?

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.140
If you are one of the many people who live with social anxiety, this may sound all too familiar.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.960
And even though our furry friends do make for wonderful companions, those of us with social anxiety

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.680
may still want to find that special human someone to share a little love and affection.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.780
Now, if the prospect of juggling romance and social anxiety makes you, well, anxious,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.520
and just thinking about it is sending your brain into overdrive with a million different thoughts and what ifs, just take a moment and breathe.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.100
We've got you covered.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.860
Because dating can be challenging at the best of times and may seem even more daunting when it has double billing with social anxiety.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.300
Psych2Go has compiled a quick list of 5 tips to keep in mind as you head out in search for a dreammate.

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:11.259
Number 1,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.140
Take a good long look in the mirror and ask yourself what you truly want in a partner.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.400
If the prospect of spending time with someone who thrives on being smack dab in the middle of action

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.240
breaks you out into a cold sweat, people with those personality traits may not make for the best romantic pursuits.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.540
Remember, you have control over who you choose to ask out or accept dates from.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.350
Number 2,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:44.200
You also have the power to control your surroundings. Do big crowds and loud busy bars or clubs make you long for that quiet corner with a fluffy pet?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.780
Try suggesting an activity that makes you feel a little more comfortable and don't feel pressured to make any big explanations.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.500
It can be as simple as saying, "Actually I'm not a fan of that" or "I'd rather do this if that's okay".

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.340
Number 3, now as the old saying goes, Dress for Success!

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.600
Just like having control over who you date and where you go, you can control how you feel heading out on your romantic adventure.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.380
Choose an outfit that makes you feel comfortable and at ease, and that you love to wear.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.440
When you look good, you feel good, and feeling good can often be a big help in keeping your anxiety in check.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.700
Number 4, if meeting new people makes you nervous try setting up a safety net for yourself.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.440
Ask a friend to text and check in or to hang out nearby so that they can bump into you and see how you're doing.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.480
Or invite your date to do something with a group of your friends.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.180
Having people you already know and trust waiting in the wings to support you when you are first getting to know someone new, can be just the thing to mellow out some of those anxieties.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.740
Number 5, last but certainly not least, take a big deep breath and go have some fun!

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.580
Remember, dating is supposed to be an enjoyable experience. A way to get to know someone you like and want to spend time with.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.420
Remind yourself of that before you head out on your date and if things do happen to not go as well as you hoped,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.400
you've got your friends' safety net standing by and you never have to see your date again if you don't want to.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.400
Living with social anxiety can sometimes feel like you're not in control.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.660
But you are and hopefully these tips will help you as you wade out into the dating pool.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.680
