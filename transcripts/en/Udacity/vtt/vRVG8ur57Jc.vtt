00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now that we have this, what should we do to get a contradiction

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and prove that there's no maximum prime number?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So the possibilities are to: divide by Q;

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to divide by P i;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or try proof by intimidation.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is an especially effective proof technique when we're proving something that Euclid already proved.
