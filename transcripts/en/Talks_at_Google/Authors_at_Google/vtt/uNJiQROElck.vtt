FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome
again to Authors at Google.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.530
Welcome to the
parents who are here

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.600
for Take Your
Parents to Work Day.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.430
We are excited to have
Brandon Sanderson here today.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.950
He has written quite
a lot of books.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.530
And has a lot in
the works, according

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.250
to Wikipedia, which is where
I got my info for this bio.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.990
And it tells me he is best
known for his "Mistborn" series

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.670
and his work finishing
Robert Jordan's epic fantasy

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.140
series, "The Wheel
of Time," which

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.620
at least for me,
"The Wheel of Time"

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.790
is how I was introduced
to his works.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.370
And I am glad that
I was because I

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.980
have loved the "Mistborn" books
as well as his new "Reckoners"

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.459
series, and can't wait
to read even more.

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:55.500
I think that's about all
I'm going to do for you,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.380
short and sweet.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.762
So please join me in
welcoming Brandon Sanderson.

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:04.185
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:05.810
BRANDON SANDERSON:
Thank you very much.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.726
And thank you, Google.

00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:09.110
This is actually my
fourth Google campus.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.060
I'm trying to visit
them all, I guess.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.920
It's like Pokemon.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.420
What's that?

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.919
Yeah.

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:15.950
I get a badge for that.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.684
Yeah.

00:01:17.684 --> 00:01:19.100
So what we're going
to do today is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.391
I'm actually going to talk
at you, just a little speech

00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.240
for maybe 15, 20 minutes.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.990
And then we will do a
short Q&amp;A. And then, I'm

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.340
going to do a reading that takes
another 15, 20 minutes to wrap

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.940
off our whole hour here.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.476
All right?

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.820
When I first went
on tour, I started

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.920
talking a lot about my
books at the speeches.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.020
But then I started to
realize that everyone

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.180
who was at my
signings already had

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.860
the book I was talking about.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.270
So I didn't really
need to do a hard sell.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.430
So instead, I started
thinking about they give me

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.050
this platform.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.054
I'm a university professor.

00:01:55.054 --> 00:01:56.720
You give me a microphone
and a platform,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.540
I'll start talking about stuff.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.829
I started just talking a
little bit about whatever I

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.120
was thinking about at the time.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.050
And it does usually
relate a little bit

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.842
to my writing in some way.

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:07.550
It's just whatever's
been inside my head.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.440
People like to reach
in there and be like,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.070
oh, this is what the
author is thinking about.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.610
And my story, actually,
this time starts in Sharjah.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.370
Does anyone know
where Sharjah is?

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.420
Oh, smart people in this room.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.649
I had no idea where
Sharjah was when

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.440
they wrote me and said,
hey, would you like

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.070
to come to our book festival.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.810
Turns out Sharjah is one of
the United Arab Emirates.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.610
So you've heard of Dubai
and Abu Dhabi, most likely.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.320
Sharjah is next door to them.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.440
And you know, I get invitations
to book festivals quite a lot.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.710
And I got this one
and said, free trip?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.320
Sure.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.260
I mean, I've never been
to the Middle East before.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.093
And the United Arab
Emirates are right there

00:02:46.093 --> 00:02:48.930
on the Arabian Peninsula,
right next to Saudi Arabia.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.310
I thought, this
will be super cool.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.270
I don't know if anyone
there reads my books.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.680
Often, you get invitations
to these festivals

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.440
just because they're
looking and saying,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.150
who is someone we
haven't had yet?

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.350
Him.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.405
But it sounded like
it was a fun time.

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:05.030
And I said yes.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.380
And indeed, over there--
if you get a chance,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.920
the United Arab
Emirates is awesome.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.720
I got to go out and
see the sand dunes.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.219
Right?

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.440
These enormous-- we flew in
a helicopter for 45 minutes

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.940
over them.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.815
They're just endless.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:19.730
Right?

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.470
Over to the Arabian
border, and I

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.430
took lots of pictures of myself
on top of giant sand dunes

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.030
making Arrakis jokes.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.030
You can tell I'm a nerd.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.210
It's not Lawrence of Arabia.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.210
It's like, walk
without rhythm, guys.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.890
Sand worms will eat you.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.405
But then it came time
to go to my signing.

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:42.875
And I was a little apprehensive
because you go to a signing,

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.000
you're never sure if anyone's
was going to show up.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.700
And you go to a signing
in a foreign country,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.560
you're extra uncertain
what it's going to be like,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.680
what the expectations are.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.154
And I walk into
the big hall where

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:54.320
they're having the signings.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.080
And there's this
big line of people.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.360
And they're wearing traditional
Emirati clothing, which

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.520
means for the women, they
wear the hi-jab, which

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.690
is the head scarf that leaves
the face open, the black one.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.330
And they were wearing
the black dress.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.340
And then the men are
wearing the thobe,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.436
which is the white garments.

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:12.060
And then they have
their own headdress.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.310
And it looks all very formal
and kind of intimidating.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.470
And yet, they're all
holding huge stacks

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.680
of Brandon Sanderson
novels, these big stacks.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.180
I mean, I feel so
bad for people.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.221
They come to my signings.

00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:27.990
My books kind of are big.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.070
And so they're
lugging them along.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.130
But I stopped and I look
at this big line of people,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.720
and I think it's my people.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.820
Right?

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.757
I've come home.

00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:40.090
I've traveled across the world
to a completely different

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.730
culture.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.930
And I found the
science fiction nerds.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.140
And it was really
this wonderful moment

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.750
where I thought about the power
of storytelling and fiction

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.910
to connect people.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.700
Here, I had somehow
made a connection

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.300
with people in a very
different culture from my own

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.520
writing these stories.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.430
I sat in the line.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.927
We got to talk about our
favorite Star Trek captains.

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:04.010
There was one woman there
who had just gotten back

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.740
from comic-con in Dubai.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.150
And it was really cool.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.470
She did a cosplay.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.740
She dressed as the
character No-Face

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.070
from the Miyazaki film, which
is this character who is all

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.383
black with a white face mask.

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.850
She just put a face mask on.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.100
She's like, I did it.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.230
It was so easy!

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.570
It was an amazing, amazing
moment, just thinking about,

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.070
like I said.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.240
That power of fiction.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.850
I can read a book written
3,000 years ago by someone

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.000
on a different continent.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.020
And I can feel the same
emotions they were feeling

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.710
when they wrote that story.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.510
And that is absolutely amazing.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.800
And so this led
me, as is natural,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.490
to thinking about
King Sejong the Great.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.750
Right?

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.820
That's where you
guys went, right?

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.520
King Sejong.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.990
King Sejong is one my
favorite people in history.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.230
He was king of
Korea in the 1400s.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.450
And Sejong, when
he rose to power,

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.000
he had this really interesting
problem he wanted to solve.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.950
And he did this in secret.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.300
He gathered a bunch
of scholars together.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.780
Very secret, very hush-hush.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.530
It was like "Mission Impossible"
with Confucian scholar kings.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.390
And he gets his
scholars together.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.520
And he says, I want to
come up with a writing

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.260
system for my people.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.490
Now, the thing is, back then
and still commonly in Asia,

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.640
but back then, you wrote Korean
using Chinese characters.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.280
Does anyone here speak Chinese?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.410
A few of you.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.910
So I apologize for what
I'm about to do to Chinese.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.160
And I don't know simplified.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.230
I only know complex.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.310
And I'm not very good at it.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.120
But Chinese is this
really cool writing system

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.320
because what we Chinese is
what we call logographic.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.760
At least, it's
mostly logographic.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.700
That means that each Chinese
character represents an idea

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.410
rather than being
something phonetic

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.630
that you can sound out.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.220
And this pen is not
working terribly well.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.787
But it's OK.

00:07:02.787 --> 00:07:04.620
And there's not supposed
to be one of those.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.810
This one's better?

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.000
OK, I'll let you take that one.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.830
Oh, that is way better.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.990
If you want to
write, for instance,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.970
"Korea," you have to
write it like this.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.450
That's "Korea" in
Chinese characters,

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.010
written very poorly.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.145
Now, the great thing about
this is, whatever your language

00:07:28.145 --> 00:07:29.960
is, you can read this
in your language,

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.270
if you know the characters.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.610
So if you show this
to someone in Japan,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.130
they'll be like, oh,
that means "Korea."

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.410
If you show it to
someone in China,

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.420
you show it to someone in Korea,
show it to someone in Thailand,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.110
someone in Mongolia, it
crosses cultural boundaries

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.400
really well because
the characters just

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.350
represent an idea.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:52.700
But the big problem with Chinese
is that you can't sound it out,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.980
which means that for
King Sejong's people, who

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.510
were mostly farmers,
not scholars,

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.160
memorizing thousands of these
things to be able to read

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.080
was very tough.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.820
So his people were
completely illiterate.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.220
And beyond that, can write
Chinese really well in this,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:09.940
obviously.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.020
But writing Korean is
difficult because Korean

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.040
has different conjugation
and structure than Chinese.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.190
And so it's like, how do you
write the Korean conjugation.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:18.960
You just can't.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.230
You can't write
Korean possessives.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.220
Korean, when you
write it out, whatever

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.680
your subject is, you put a
little marker on it to say,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.970
this is our subject.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.580
You write like [SPEAKS KOREAN].

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.260
You can't write that
with the Chinese.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.860
You either have to
write in caveman speak.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.612
Or you have to add in all these
characters that don't actually

00:08:37.612 --> 00:08:38.820
mean what they say they mean.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.630
And it gets really confusing.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.429
And so King Sejong said,
I want to solve this.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.390
We're going to
come up with a way

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.310
to write Korean that
works with the Chinese.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.430
And they came up with
something really ingenious.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.480
It's called Hangul.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:01.990
And Hangul is this thing where
you create a phonetic version

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.280
of a Chinese character.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.840
This is [SPEAKS  KOREAN]
Hangul, Korea.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.950
And you put these together in
these syllable blocks, where

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.070
you construct something that
would work in the same writing

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.110
system with the Chinese, which
is really nifty because what

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.030
you can do is you can
still write in Chinese

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.820
and then add the Korean letters
to give the conjugation if you

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.460
want to.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.500
Or you can just write
straight in Korean

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.600
and write it exactly
the same way.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.820
Or you can drop in the
occasional cool Chinese

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.177
character to look awesome, which
is what people do these days.

00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:35.510
If you want to be cool, you
write some words in Chinese.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.030
You're like,
yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.520
And then the rest
is all in Korean

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.370
because Chinese just looks
beautiful on the page.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.300
So King Sejong
came up with this.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.070
It is amazing how
well this works.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.320
In fact, Korea is one of
the most literate countries

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.050
in the world today, partially
because of how great

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.570
this writing system is.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.750
Linguists just drool
over this writing system.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:59.617
It is so nifty.

00:09:59.617 --> 00:10:01.450
There's lots of really
cool things about it.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.310
But he presents it to his court
after they come up with it.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.100
And they hated it.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.280
They absolutely hated it.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.320
In fact, one of the people in
court wrote, "How could this

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.120
not to be a setback
to our civilization?

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.990
Spending too much thought
and effort on this

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.820
is a waste of time detrimental
to the timely pursuit

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.320
of scholarship."

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.510
Yeah.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.640
So this cool system
that is brilliant

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.650
and since then has
been widely regarded

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.936
as one of the best
alphabets ever invented,

00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:34.810
in fact, I think the
only major alphabet that

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:39.000
was designed by scholars rather
than arising accidentally.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.270
So why did they hate it?

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.915
Any guesses?

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:45.832
AUDIENCE: It made
scholarship more accessible.

00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:48.123
BRANDON SANDERSON: It made
scholarship more accessible.

00:10:48.123 --> 00:10:49.380
That's exactly what it was.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.463
At this time, if you know
anything about Confucian

00:10:51.463 --> 00:10:55.120
society, taking the
tests in Chinese

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.090
to prove how great
you are at Chinese

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.850
is what got you a place
in the government, which

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.280
are the best jobs.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.970
It was a mark of nobility.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.110
And the idea that the
common people could read

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.420
was really a big
deal to the Koreans.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.914
And it completely causes
a huge revolution.

00:11:13.914 --> 00:11:15.330
There's these
stories, by the way,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.580
King Sejong writing
Hangul on leaves

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.250
and spreading them through
the air to the people,

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.280
like people would see
it and be like oh,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.440
and immediately recognize
that this is brilliant

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.690
and start being able to write
it because they found it

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.600
on the leaves.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.290
But years later,
someone, one of the kings

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.560
tried to forbid this
because of this reason

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.960
to keep people from reading it.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.072
By then, in just
a few generations,

00:11:36.072 --> 00:11:37.780
it had become so
pervasive in the culture

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.680
that he couldn't stamp it out,
no matter how hard he tried.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.540
This stuff is awesome.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.140
And yet, people tried to keep
everyone else from reading.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.800
And this is actually a theme.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.980
This is a pretty big
theme through history.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.450
The people who tried
to first translate

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.890
the Bible into English,
didn't go so well for them.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.140
I don't know if you know that.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.720
But they got burned
at the stake.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.850
And the resistance
to literacy programs

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.020
in the 1800s in early 1900s
is shocking to us nowadays.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.580
We're like, why would anyone
not want other people to read.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.210
Well, it's a theme.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.140
It's something for
some reason that people

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.530
who know something often
want to keep everyone

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:16.669
else from figuring it out.

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:18.460
And you might be saying,
OK, Brandon, we're

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.510
here at a book signing.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.000
We work for Google.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.940
We're good on this
literacy thing.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.670
We promised to teach
people to read.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.940
You're preaching to the choir.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.400
Well, there's an
issue relating to this

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.880
that has really
started bothering me

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.870
over the last few years.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.290
And I think we're doing
something very similar to what

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.920
these scholars are doing inside
of the science fiction/ fantasy

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.480
reading community.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.690
Let me read you a quote from
a blogger named Bonnie Burton.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.560
She says, "As a
geek girl, I have

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.350
been accused of wearing a Star
Wars shirt to get attention

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.030
from guys.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.370
I've been told to move aside
and let real gamers play

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.440
the demos at conventions.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.670
Lately, it seems elements
of the geek community

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.720
have become a lot less
a welcome wagon and more

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.360
a judgmental jedi council that
refuses to let newbies in,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.510
especially if they
happen to be girls.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.800
In a community once known
for celebrating outcasts

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.690
and underdogs, it
sometimes now seems

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.040
like you have to take some
sort of Voight-Kamff test

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.420
to prove your geekdom is legit."

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.010
And if you didn't
get that reference,

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.540
that is a "Blade
Runner" reference.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.450
She is totally proving her
geekdom is legit with that one.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.800
But there's this
sense that you have

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.320
to prove that you are
a true fan to become

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.620
part of our community.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.550
Right?

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.330
And this is bigger than
the video game community.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.740
It's this idea that with
how popular, for instance,

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.600
the comic book movies have
become, I found myself saying,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.970
you guys are not
true "Iron Man" fans.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.660
Or my big one was the turtles,
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.160
right?

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.915
I read Eastman and
Laird original run

00:13:55.915 --> 00:13:57.290
of "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles"

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.260
when they all had red masks.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:13:59.920
Right?

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.000
This is the way
it's supposed to be.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.630
And when it's got
popular, I'm like,

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.400
you guys do not
know the Turtles.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.690
You are not fans of my Turtles.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:08.820
How dare you?

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.480
Right?

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.189
How many here--
because I've done it.

00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.980
I'll raise my hand.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.950
How many here have
made fun of "Twilight"?

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.830
Yeah.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.460
Or "Eragon" or
"The Hunger Games,"

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.570
or whatever popular
fiction seems

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.990
to be bringing people into the
science fiction and fantasy

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.823
community at a time.

00:14:26.823 --> 00:14:30.080
For some reason, those of
us entrenched inside of it

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.400
get really resistant.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.690
I remember when I was at
science fiction conventions

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.430
in the late 90s, early
2000s, and people

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:44.390
referred to JK Rowling as
"that damn Scottish woman"

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:48.240
because all these people
inside the community

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.030
had had this club.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.480
And suddenly, it was everywhere.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.170
Now, it's hard to imagine that
now because JK Rowling went on

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.250
to win a Hugo Award.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.970
She's been very accepted
by the community.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.560
And yet, initially,
when something

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.510
takes off and gets
popular, the community

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.490
wants to push back against it.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.830
And I found myself doing this.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.500
Now, I want to take an aside.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.536
I'm not saying we
can't criticize.

00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:13.660
In fact, I think we should.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.280
I have an English degree.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.390
It's four years of learning
to criticize stuff, right?

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.380
It's important to
say, I don't like this

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.320
and this is why, to just
start that discourse,

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.450
to have a discussion.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.950
But what I'm talking
about people doing

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:33.820
is less about the criticism
and more about the shaming.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.490
Right?

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.130
It's the kid who gets
on the forums, excited

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.400
because he's read "Eragon."

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.170
And it's like he's
discovered something

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.630
that changed his life.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.160
And he goes and he posts,
I love the fantasy books.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.230
I just read "Eragon."

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.840
Can we talk about this?

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.040
And the responses, you can see
like 50 responses in a row of,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.600
why don't you read
something real.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.470
You idiot.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.810
This is dumb.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:59.760
That's just a copy of
"Star Wars," or whatever.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.350
Just all the way down the list.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.650
That's what I'm talking about.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.250
And it's particularly
bad on the internet.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.820
It's become worse and
worse over the last decade

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.650
because of just how we
are treating one another.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.400
And that hurts me because
fiction is about connecting.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.400
Right?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.490
I spent several years in higher
education getting a master's

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.710
degree in creative writing.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.620
And I had to fight every
day to convince them

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.610
that science fiction was legit.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.370
Right?

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.910
I had professors who refused
to give me good grades

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.360
because I was writing fantasy
novels and turning them in.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.410
And so to have been
fighting all that and then

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.530
to see our community
doing it to the people who

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.520
are trying to get in and be
part of it really bothers me.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.270
So this is my plea
and my request.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.240
Can we be a little less acerbic?

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.700
Can we be a little less
hateful, a little less critical?

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.560
Can we talk about
what we like and don't

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.440
like without dragging
the people who like what

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.630
we don't into the discussion.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.240
Right?

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.372
Can we keep it about
the fiction and less

00:17:00.372 --> 00:17:01.580
about the people who love it.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.619
And next time you run into
something that you're like,

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:08.050
I just don't like
this, maybe instead of

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.750
your first instinct being
to go online and say,

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.990
everyone who likes this
is stupid, maybe give it

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.760
another read, maybe
read through something

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.890
you wouldn't have before.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.140
And you don't have to like it.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.560
But read through it with
the intent of figuring out

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.500
why other people love it.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.278
And if you can figure that
out, if you can do that,

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:28.319
then the fiction is still
fulfilling its purpose.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.237
It's doing what I did
when I went to Sharjah

00:17:30.237 --> 00:17:31.820
and I was able to
connect with people.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.890
You can connect
with people who are

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.530
different than yourselves, who
like things different than you

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:36.030
do.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.526
And if you can figure out
why they love something,

00:17:38.526 --> 00:17:40.650
I think you'll understand
them a little bit better.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.130
So thank you very much.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:47.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.420
So let's go ahead and
do a short Q&amp;A. Anything

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.570
you guys are interested
in asking me, go ahead.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.180
And I'll just repeat
the questions.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.492
That will be easier for the
camera and things like that.

00:17:58.492 --> 00:18:00.450
So whatever you want to
know, I'll answer them.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.710
And then we'll do the reading.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.450
Any questions?

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.560
Oh, no questions.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.524
OK, right here.

00:18:05.524 --> 00:18:07.690
AUDIENCE: You're known to
be a very prolific writer.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.770
What do you attribute
your productivity to?

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.310
BRANDON SANDERSON: So I'm known
to be a very prolific writer.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.000
To what do I attribute
my productivity?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.290
I can liken this one to Google.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.260
I remember the first
time I visited Google.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.610
It was the Seattle campus.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.300
And I got there.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.060
And they had valet
parking for the engineers.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.294
And I'm like, valet
parking for the engineers.

00:18:28.294 --> 00:18:28.960
What's going on?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.960
They're like, well, you
know, it might take them

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.356
a little too long
to find a space

00:18:32.356 --> 00:18:33.480
because it's of tight here.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.804
We want them to just get
in and start working.

00:18:35.804 --> 00:18:38.220
And then I go in and they have
this full-service cafeteria

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.595
that's serving
this amazing food.

00:18:39.595 --> 00:18:41.140
And I'm like, this is all free?

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.530
And they're like, yeah, yeah.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.470
And then there's massage tables.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.020
There's candy.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.810
And I realized all
they wanted to do

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.560
was keep you there
working and make

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.750
you forget what time it was.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.666
So it's like midnight.

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:55.550
And you're like, oh, I've just
been enjoying myself so much.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.984
Or one of the people
joked that it's

00:18:57.984 --> 00:18:59.650
like they start dinner
at a certain time

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.520
so if you get done
working, you're like,

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.690
oh, if I just wait another
hour or two, dinner's here.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.985
Right?

00:19:05.985 --> 00:19:08.480
And it's all kind of designed
around this idea of keeping

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.880
you happy and working.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.000
That's my life, right?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.920
I love my job.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.000
And I work from home for
most of the time, which

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.260
means that I actually have
plenty of time with my family

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.290
because I work from
about noon until 5:00.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.810
And I get done, I play
with my kids, my family,

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.830
from about 5:30 to
about 8:30, 9:00.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.360
And then I go back to work.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.510
And I work from 9:00 or
10:00 until 3:00 or 4:00.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.080
And I enjoy my job.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.620
And I don't have a commute.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:39.120
Right?

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.860
I'm just there.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.880
And it's like, I could
go do something else,

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.640
or I could do what I love.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.900
And what I love usually wins.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.540
I'm not that fast a writer.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.674
But what I am is I'm
a consistent writer.

00:19:51.674 --> 00:19:53.340
And I'm very passionate
about what I do.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.340
And so I produce around
2,000 words a day, basically

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.110
every day.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.280
And that just adds up.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.670
So yep.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:03.970
All right, other questions?

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:04.470
Right there.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.370
AUDIENCE: How much
of your writing

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.176
do you plot out in advance
and how much unfolds?

00:20:07.176 --> 00:20:08.717
BRANDON SANDERSON:
Oh, good question.

00:20:08.717 --> 00:20:11.590
How much do I plot out in
advance and how much unfolds?

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.650
So most writers fall
somewhere on a spectrum

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:20.240
between what we call discovery
writers and outline writers.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.100
George R. Martin has
great terms for these.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.220
He calls them gardeners
and architects.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.980
And I am much more an architect.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.730
I would say about 70/30
on the architect side.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.400
So what I do is I
build an outline.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.770
I actually build it in reverse.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.490
I start with what I
want to have happen.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.340
And then I work backward.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.410
And it's not like
Heading A, Subheading

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.370
B. It's not like that.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.267
What I do is I think, all right,
I've got these two characters.

00:20:48.267 --> 00:20:49.850
What's their
relationship going to be?

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.141
How are they going to interact?

00:20:51.141 --> 00:20:53.270
All right, what's the end goal?

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.490
What do I want the moment
between them at the end to be?

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.072
It can be they don't
like each other.

00:20:58.072 --> 00:20:59.780
It can be they like
each other, whatever.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.776
I will then brainstorm
steps along the way

00:21:01.776 --> 00:21:02.900
as a list of bullet points.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.330
And I'll do that for every
subplot-- my mystery, how

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.370
does the magic work, a training,
a character becoming better

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.050
at something, any sort of
we need to figure this out.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.550
And the main one
is usually whatever

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.633
the big plot of the book
is, but all the subplots.

00:21:16.633 --> 00:21:19.720
And so I have all of these
goals and bullet points.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.002
And that becomes my outline.

00:21:21.002 --> 00:21:23.210
When I work forward, I'm
grabbing these bullet points

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:25.417
and weaving them in
as I go so that I

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.500
make sure I'm getting all
the proper foreshadowing

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.120
for the different subplots.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.630
I do a lot of planning in my
worldbuilding ahead of time,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.830
a ton of that.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.870
Worldbuilding is
very important to me.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.346
One of the things I've
tried to bring to fantasy

00:21:38.346 --> 00:21:40.720
is I would like to have a
little bit of a science fiction

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.880
rigor for fantasy worlds,
which is not something

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.570
that, as a reader,
I've found a lot of.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.960
And so it felt like
a hole in the genre

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.080
that I wanted to fill.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.180
My characters, I do not
do a lot of planning.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.460
I figure out who they are.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.860
But usually, I do that
by writing some scenes

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.460
through their viewpoint and
try to explore who they are.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.290
And then I'm like,
all right, I got

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.760
a feel for who this person is.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.530
Let's build a plot for them.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.860
But it's very vague
and very loose.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.230
And that trumps all
the other stuff.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:14.200
If I'm writing this character
along and who they're becoming

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.499
would not fulfill the plot
that is planned for them,

00:22:16.499 --> 00:22:18.040
then I have to go
rebuild my outline,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.000
or I have to tear the character
out and put a new character

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.583
in that place.

00:22:20.583 --> 00:22:23.650
So I've done both,
depending on the situation.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.980
And so it's this organic thing.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.790
And I do that very
intentionally because outline

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.050
writers tend to have a
problem that their endings are

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.250
explosive but their
characters are weak.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.650
And discovery writers
tend to have weak endings

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.890
and great characters.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.680
And if you take
that as a guide, you

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.730
can usually figure out
who is who in writing.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.260
Right?

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.295
You usually can.

00:22:45.295 --> 00:22:47.250
You can figure out if they're
more an outline writer or more

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.190
a discovery writer.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.060
And where books really
start to take off, I feel,

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.820
is where you can
hybridize the two,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.310
and you can use the discovery
writing for the characters

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.896
and the outlining for the plot.

00:22:56.896 --> 00:22:59.020
And when you can get those
two working really well,

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.590
that's where I
think books really

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:01.870
start to come together for me.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.350
So there you are.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.604
Let's go right here.

00:23:04.604 --> 00:23:06.270
AUDIENCE: So sort of
a related question,

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.970
but on the [INAUDIBLE] level.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.710
You have this universe
connecting a lot of your books.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.150
BRANDON SANDERSON: Yes.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.840
AUDIENCE: To what
extent do you have

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.710
that built out in your head?

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.918
BRANDON SANDERSON: Excellent.

00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:20.170
So I have something
called the Cosmere.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.350
If you're unfamiliar,
my epic fantasies

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.290
are all connected in
very subtle, minor ways.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.740
They are cameos from different
characters in each one.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.867
So any of my books that
don't mention Earth

00:23:31.867 --> 00:23:32.950
tend to be in the Cosmere.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.440
That's rule of thumb,
what is and what isn't.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.210
And I'm weaving a few
characters with a hidden epic

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.850
behind the scenes that
I'll eventually get to.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.520
Right now, it's all
just Easter eggs.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.960
But because I'm
planning all this,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.320
I have to have a really solid
outline for the entire Cosmere.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.240
When I originally plotted it,
it was between 32 and 36 books,

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.390
depending on which books got
split and things like that.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:02.730
And yes, I have a pretty
solid outline for all of that.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.891
The fortunate aspect of
that is remember that it's

00:24:05.891 --> 00:24:07.140
all Easter eggs for right now.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.350
So you can read the
series out of order.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.210
It doesn't matter.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.420
You're not missing anything.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.753
You just have to watch for
some of these characters that

00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:14.900
are popping in and out.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.280
And eventually, you'll find more
and more of what they're doing.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.390
That does require
a lot of plotting.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.967
And it's something I did because
some of my favorite writers

00:24:23.967 --> 00:24:25.800
connected some of their
worlds late in life.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.091
And I thought it was brilliant.

00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:28.950
But it also was obvious
they didn't do it

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:29.550
from the beginning.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.049
Right?

00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:31.850
Isaac Asimov wove
together the robots

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.540
in "Foundation" in
a really clever way.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.100
But it wasn't there
from the get go.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.320
He just figured it
out later on, which

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.050
is what you have to do when
you start writing and the 30s

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.860
and you weave them together in
the 70s or something like that.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.400
But that inspired me.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.470
I'm like, he's done that.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.261
Stephen King did the
thing where he kind of

00:24:49.261 --> 00:24:52.090
tied them all together with the
Dark Tower and stuff like this.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.100
Can I do something from
the get go that plans this?

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.850
And so from "Elantris," my first
book, which was sold in 2003,

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.770
I have all of these kinds of
thing seeded with the idea

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.100
being that there is
an overarching plot

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.020
for the whole thing.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.180
So it is coming.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.510
But there's a lot of
that's a ways off.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:14.410
The "Mistborn" books are
forming a core for that, which--

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.260
Yeah, I should actually talk
about my book, shouldn't I?

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.580
When I originally pitched
"Mistborn" to my editor,

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.430
I said, I want to do something
I haven't seen in fantasy.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.160
It's kind of one of
my guiding principles.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.550
Have I seen it done in fantasy?

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.440
Let's see if we can do it.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.450
I want to do a
fantasy world that

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.352
evolved into a modern-day
world that eventually evolved

00:25:33.352 --> 00:25:34.560
into a science fiction world.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.330
And the magic becomes
the means by which

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.700
space travel is possible.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.320
Right?

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.596
And so I wrote this
epic fantasy trilogy.

00:25:40.596 --> 00:25:41.970
And then I jumped
forward and I'm

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:47.640
kind of doing 1910s era to show
how the fantasy books became

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.480
the foundation of mythology
and history for a modern take.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.030
And then I'm going
contemporary-ish next.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.450
I'm really probably
going go in 1980s, kind

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.017
of Tom-Clancy-esque spy epics.

00:26:02.017 --> 00:26:03.350
But you guys will like that one.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.560
The main character
in that, she's

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.090
a programmer in a
very early programming

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.995
language on Scadriel.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:17.780
So imagine a programmer who
gets recruited by the CIA

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.470
to go be a field agent.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:20.720
It'll make sense when I do it.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.860
But we will eventually evolve
that into a science fiction

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.090
space epic.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.272
So that's where I'm
going with those.

00:26:30.272 --> 00:26:32.105
And I should have
mentioned when I did this,

00:26:32.105 --> 00:26:35.160
this was actually the
inspiration for "Elantris."

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.120
This idea of the Chinese
characters and Korean,

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.431
because I speak Korean.

00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:40.430
I've been learning this.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:41.221
It was really cool.

00:26:41.221 --> 00:26:43.610
And that's why my very first
published book, "Elantris,"

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.970
has this magic system based
around these cool characters

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.140
and the language
surrounding them.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.330
Let's go do like one
more question right here.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:52.920
Yes.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.961
AUDIENCE: How do you feel
about movie adaptations

00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:55.796
of your books?

00:26:55.796 --> 00:26:57.280
Would you be open to that?

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.190
BRANDON SANDERSON:
Would I be open to doing

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.890
movie adaptations of my books?

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.710
I would love to see
movie adaptations done.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:06.020
I am child of the 70s.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.200
or of the 80s, really.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.180
And I was born in '75.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.490
I grew up with "Star Wars."

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.115
I grew up with all
this stuff, right?

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.160
Science fiction
cinematic history

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.290
is a big part of what
made me into a writer.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.610
And so yes.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:25.190
Now, I understand that
sometimes they screw it up.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.030
And I say "they"
as a nebulous they.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.690
Usually, when films
go wrong, it's

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.400
not because someone is
trying to make a bad film.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.360
It just doesn't come together.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.210
But I would rather roll
the dice on a good film

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.620
and risk having a bad film.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.000
That's something that I
would very much like to do.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.490
So I have sold the rights
to several of my series.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.460
"Mistborn" is owned
by one company.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:54.870
"The Reckoners" is owned by Fox
with Shawn Levy's production

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.370
company.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.936
He's the one who did "The
Night at the Museum" films,

00:27:57.936 --> 00:28:00.310
and a film called "Real Steel,"
which I highly recommend.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.601
If you haven't seen it's,
it's great film-- "Wolverine"

00:28:02.601 --> 00:28:05.860
with fighting robots.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:11.160
And then "The Emperor's Soul"
is owned by DMG Entertainment.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.780
So I've sold a lot of these.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.120
And I'm working with them.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.450
They've all been very
easy to work with.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.880
But nothing has gotten
a green light yet.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.510
So until something
gets a green light,

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.520
it means it's just
in production.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.870
And it could be there
for the next 20 years.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.790
So don't hold your breath.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.790
One in 30 of these
is the statistic

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.890
I keep hearing that get made.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.350
But I'm very hopeful.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.620
All right, I'm going to go
ahead and stop now and go

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.690
ahead and go into the reading.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:44.340
Now, this reading
is actually going

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.420
to be from the third
"Stormlight" book.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.021
But I am reading a
flashback sequence

00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:53.520
for a character
named Dalinar, which

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.420
means if you haven't read
the other "Stormlight" books,

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.340
it's not a spoiler
because it takes place

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.370
30 years before the
first book begins.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.379
It may change your
perception of this character

00:29:04.379 --> 00:29:05.170
when we get to him.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.930
But so I'm going
to do this reading.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.486
It's about 20 minutes long.

00:29:09.486 --> 00:29:10.610
This doesn't matter to you.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.380
But for parents who
might be watching,

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.790
this is a little bit
on the violent side.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.890
I mean, it's Dalinar at war.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.670
So yeah, yeah.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.270
Well, we're recording this.

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:21.900
They're going to put it up.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.774
So I wanted to put that
little warning there.

00:29:23.774 --> 00:29:27.786
That's why I said, for parents
who might be watching this.

00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:29.910
Yeah, I'm talking to the
video camera for that one,

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:30.600
not to you guys.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.700
I understand.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.660
I understand you
can handle PG-13.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.480
All right

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.840
"Rockbuds crunched like
skulls beneath Dalinar's boots

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.310
as he charged across
the burning field.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.900
His elites tromped behind him,
a hand-picked force of soldiers

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.910
both light-eyed and dark.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.510
They weren't an honor guard.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.110
Dalinar didn't need guards.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.180
These were simply the men
he considered competent

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.670
enough not to embarrass him.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.030
"Around him, rockbuds smoldered.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.810
Moss, dried from the
summer heat and long days

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.600
between storms
this time of year,

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.170
flared up in waves,
setting the rockbud shells

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.120
themselves aflame.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.670
Dalinar charged the smoke,
trusting in his padded armor

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.550
and thick boots to protect him.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.240
Flamespren, like tiny
people made of fire,

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.760
danced from one patch
of flame to the next.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.710
"The enemy, pressed by
his armies from the North,

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:27.710
had pulled back into
the town just ahead.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.190
Dalinar had held himself
back with difficulty

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.087
from entering that
initial clash.

00:30:32.087 --> 00:30:34.170
He'd known the real fighting
would take place here

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.790
in the town.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.170
He hadn't expected the enemy
to, in a desperate move, fire

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.170
this plain, burning
their own crops

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.150
to block the southern approach.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:45.430
"Well, no matter.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.560
The fires could go to damnation
for all Dalinar cared.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.140
He led his men in a charge.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.600
And though some were overwhelmed
by the smoke or heat,

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.620
most stayed with him.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.820
They'd crash into the
enemy from the South,

00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.410
pressing them between his
men here and the main army.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.540
Hammer and anvil, the
best kind of tactic,

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:08.180
the type that didn't allow his
enemies to get away from him.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.280
"As Dalinar burst
from the smoky air,

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.190
he found a few lines of
spearmen hastily making ranks

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.300
on the southern
edge of the town.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.960
There were remnants of a wall.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.300
But that had been
torn down years ago.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.560
Dalinar had forgotten
the town's name.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.490
But the location was ideal.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.630
A large ridge to the East made
a natural break from the storms

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:31.830
and had allowed this place to
sprawl almost like a real city.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.950
"Dalinar screamed at
the enemy soldiers,

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:38.310
beating a sword-- just a regular
longsword-- against his shield.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.410
He wore a sturdy
breastplate and helm along

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.070
with iron-lined boots.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.820
The spearmen ahead
of him wavered

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.270
as his elites roared
from the smoke and flame,

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.000
shouting a
bloodthirsty cacaphony.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.780
A few of the spearmen
dropped weapons and ran.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.410
Fearspren, like
globs of violet goo,

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:57.790
wriggled up from the ground en
masse around the enemy rank.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.240
"Dalinar grinned.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.030
He didn't need
Shards to intimidate.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.300
He hit the spearman
like a boulder,

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.290
rolling through a grove of
saplings, swinging his sword

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.750
and sending limbs into the air.

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.880
A good fight was about momentum.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.570
Don't stop.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.630
Don't think.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.620
Drive forward and
convince your enemies

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.830
that they were as
good as dead already.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.290
That way, they'd fight
you less as you sent them

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.190
to their pyres.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.210
As he waded among
them, the spearmen

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.550
thrust weapons
frantically toward him,

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:30.410
less trying to killed
Dalinar and more

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.110
trying to push away this madman.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:34.440
Their ranks collapsed.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.500
And many of them turned their
sides to Dalinar's elites.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.340
"Dalinar laughed, slamming aside
a pair of spears with a shield,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.400
then disemboweling one man
with a sword deep in the gut.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.110
He jumped and left the man to
drop his spear, and in a panic,

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.186
trying to grab at his entrails.

00:32:51.186 --> 00:32:53.310
The man's allies backed
away at the horrific sight.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.660
So Dalinar came in swinging,
catching the two off balance,

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.160
killing them with the sword
that bore their friend's blood.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.500
"Dalinar's elites decimated
the now broken line.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.057
Dalinar himself pushed forward,
keeping momentum, shearing

00:33:06.057 --> 00:33:07.890
through the ranks until
he reached the back,

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:11.520
breathing deeply and wiping
ashen sweat from his face.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.330
A young spearman
fell before him,

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.130
crying, screaming
for his mother as he

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.280
crawled across the stony
ground, trailing blood.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.620
Fearspren mixed with
Painspren all around.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.070
"Dalinar shook his head,
picking up a fallen spear

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.200
and striding past the
youth, slamming it down

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.630
in the boy's back.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.850
Men often cried for their
parents as they died.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.440
Didn't matter how old they were.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.730
He'd seen gray beards do it,
same as kids like this one.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:37.450
'He's not much younger than
I am,' Dalinar thought.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:41.370
'Maybe 17.' But then Dalinar
had never felt young,

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.390
regardless of his age.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.080
His elites filled in
behind him, having

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.050
carved the enemy line in two.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.590
Dalinar danced, shaking
off his bloody blade,

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.890
feeling alert, excited,
but not yet alive.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.180
Where was it?

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.180
'Come on,' he thought.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.970
"A larger group of
soldiers hiked down

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.670
the street toward him, led by
some officers in white and red.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.600
Dalinar could see from
the way they pulled up,

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.900
alarmed, that they hadn't
expected their spearmen

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.760
to fall so quickly.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.210
Dalinar charged.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.330
His elites knew to watch.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.050
So he was followed by
a force of 50 or 60.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.010
The rest had to finish off
the unfortunate spearmen.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.449
Well, 50 would do.

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:19.280
The crowded confines
of the town would mean

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.670
Dalinar shouldn't need more.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:24.420
As he neared this newer force,
he focused his attention

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.000
on the one man riding a horse.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.699
The fellow wore
plate armor obviously

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.340
meant to recreate Shardplate,
though it was only

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.830
of common steel.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:36.120
It lacked the beauty,
the power, of true Plate.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.090
He still looked like he was the
most important person around.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.226
Hopefully, that would
mean he was the best.

00:34:41.226 --> 00:34:43.380
"The man's honor guard
rushed to engage.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.909
And Dalinar felt something
stir inside of him

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:48.350
like a thirst, a physical need.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:52.250
Challenge, he needed
a challenge, storm it!

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.610
He let his elites
handle the honor guard.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:56.949
He made his way
toward the Brightlord.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.470
The man wasn't old enough
to be the highprince.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:01.780
Some other important lighteyes?

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.550
Or didn't Dalinar remember
something about a son

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.000
during Gavilar's endless
planning meetings?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.570
Well, this man certainly looked
grand on that white mare,

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.400
watching the battle
behind a helmed face.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.230
"The foe turned toward
Dalinar and raised his sword

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:18.490
to his helm in a sign
of a challenge accepted.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.720
Idiot.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.500
Dalinar raised his
shield arm and pointed,

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.166
counting on at least
one of his strikers

00:35:24.166 --> 00:35:25.760
to have lived and
stayed with him.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.750
Indeed, Jenin
stepped up, unhooked

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.120
the short bow from his back.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.460
And as the Brightlord
shouted in surprise,

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.080
shot the horse in the chest.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.170
"'Hate shooting
horses,' Jenin grumbled,

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.760
as the beast reared in pain.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.580
"like throwing 1,000 broams into
the storming ocean, Brightlord.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.630
"'I'll buy you two
when we finish this,"

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:47.740
Dalinar said as the Brightlord
tumbled backward off his horse.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.430
"Dalinar dodged around flashing
hooves and snorts of pain,

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.170
seeking out the fallen man.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.150
He was pleased to
find the enemy rising.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.890
Dalinar came in swinging.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.880
The Brightlord managed
to get his sword up.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.610
And Dalinar battered it away
and then dropped his own shield

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.210
completely, and came in with
a two-handed power swing,

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:07.250
intending to knock the
lighteyed soldier back down.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.760
Fortunately, the man was good
enough to recover his stance

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.450
and intercept the
blow with his shield.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.410
They probably heard
the subsequent crack

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:15.980
all the way in Kholinar.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.510
indeed, it vibrated
up Dalinar's arms.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.500
"Momentum, life
was about momentum.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.360
Pick a direction and don't
let anything, man or storm,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.850
turn you aside.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.450
Dalinar battered
at the Brightlord,

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.830
driving him backward until
surprisingly, the men managed

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:33.850
to pull a feint,
and getting close,

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:36.030
to ram Dalinar with his shield.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.220
Dalinar ducked the sword
swing that followed.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.310
But the backhand hit him
solidly on the side of the head,

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.670
sending him stumbling,
his helm twisted,

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.030
metal bent by the blow biting
into his scalp, drawing blood.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.810
He saw double.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.730
His vision swimming.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:53.000
"He roared at the lord, as
the lord smartly came in

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.260
for the kill.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.340
Dalinar swept his blade up in
a lurching, full-shoulder blow,

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.140
slapping the lord's
weapon out of his hands

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.330
and tossing both swords away.

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.910
The man in turn punched Dalinar
in the face with his gauntlet.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.690
And Dalinar's nose crunched.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.120
Dalinar fell to his
knees, vision blurry.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.620
His foe was breathing deeply,
cursing between breaths,

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.310
winded by the short,
frantic contest.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.400
The Brightlord fished
at his belt for a knife.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.760
"An emotion stirred
instead of Dalinar, a fire

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.030
that filled the pit within.

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.760
It washed through him and
awakened him, bringing clarity.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.220
The sounds of his elites
fighting the Brightlord's honor

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.670
guard faded, metal on metal
becoming distant clinks, grunts

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:35.370
becoming like a humming.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:36.760
Dalinar grinned.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.000
Then that grin became
a toothy smile.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.550
His vision returned
as the Brightlord, who

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.130
had just retrieved his
knife, looked up and started,

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.550
stumbling back.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.530
He seemed horrified.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.400
"Dalinar roared, spitting
blood and throwing himself

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.370
at the enemy.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:53.470
The swing that came
for him seem pitiful.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.190
And Dalinar ducked it, pushing
his shoulder against his foe

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.630
and shoving him backward.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.650
Something thrummed
inside of Dalinar,

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:03.130
the pulse of the battle, the
rhythm of killing and dying,

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.220
the Thrill.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.960
He knocked his opponent
off balance, then reached

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.110
for his sword.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.330
"Dym, however, hollered his
name and tossed him a pole axe,

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:15.730
with a hook on one side and
broad, thin axe on the other.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.910
Dalinar seized it
from the air and spun,

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:19.412
ducking the lord's swing.

00:38:19.412 --> 00:38:20.870
At the same time,
he hooked the man

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.720
around the ankle with
the axe-head and yanked.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.000
The Brightlord fell
in a clatter of steel.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.250
"Unfortunately, before
Dalinar could attack further,

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.410
the honor guard became a bother.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.280
Two had managed to extricate
themselves from Dalinar's men.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.860
And they came to the
defense of their lord.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.140
Dalinar caught their sword
strikes on his polearm

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.170
and twisted about,
backing away and bringing

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.030
the axe-head slamming
into one man's side.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.390
Dalinar ripped it
free and spun again,

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.900
this time smashing the weapon
against the rising lord's head

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.600
and sending him to his knees.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.340
"Then he came back
and barely managed

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.410
to catch the other guard's sword
on the haft of his polearm.

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:59.150
Dalinar pushed upward, holding
the polearm in two hands,

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.394
sweeping the guard's blade
into the air over his head

00:39:01.394 --> 00:39:03.310
and stepping forward
until he was face-to-face

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:04.210
with the fellow.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.420
He could feel the man's
breath on his face.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.680
"Dalinar spit blood
from a shattered nose

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.470
into the guard's eyes, then
kicked him in the stomach.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.990
He turned toward the lord,
who had scrambled again

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.480
to his feet, and was
now trying to flee.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.660
Dalinar growled,
full of the Thrill,

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.420
and swung his
polearm by one hand,

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.960
hooking the spike
in the lord's side

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.780
and yanking, dropping
him a third time.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.510
The lord rolled.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:29.620
And this time, he was greeted
by the sight of Dalinar slamming

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.730
his polearm down by
two hands, driving

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:35.100
the spike right through the
breastplate and into the chest.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.860
It made a satisfying crunch.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.840
And Dalinar pulled
it out, bloodied.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.007
"The blow seemed
a signal of sorts.

00:39:42.007 --> 00:39:43.590
And the honor guard
and other soldiers

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.590
finally broke before his elites.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.180
Dalinar grinned
as he watched them

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.270
go, Gloryspren
popping up around him

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.560
like glowing, golden spheres.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.270
His men took out
their short bows

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.630
and managed to drop a good
dozen of the fleeing enemy

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.970
in the backs.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:01.150
Damnation, it felt good to best
to force larger than his own.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.810
"The Thrill dwindled.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.890
He could never seem to hold
onto it as long as he wanted.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.220
Nearby, the man he'd
felled groaned softly.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:14.180
Dalinar stepped over, curious,
kicking at the armored chest.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.000
"Why, the man said
from within his helm.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.780
'Why us?'

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.780
"'Don't know,' Dalinar said,
tossing the polearm back

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.920
to Dym.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.530
"'You-- you don't know?'

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.860
"'My brother chooses.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.000
I just go where he points me.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.457
"He gestured toward
the dying man.

00:40:30.457 --> 00:40:32.790
And Dym rammed his sword in
the hole in the breastplate,

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.080
finishing the job.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.810
The fellow had fought
reasonably well.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.190
No need to extend his suffering.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:41.240
"Another soldier approached,
handing Dalinar his sword.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.180
It had a chip the size of
a thumb right in the blade.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.670
Looked like it
had bent, as well.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.910
"'You're supposed to stick
it in the squishy parts,

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:52.880
Brightlord,' Dym said, 'not
pound it against the hard

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.110
parts.'

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.570
"'I'll keep that in
mind,' Dalinar said,

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.820
tossing the sword aside,
as one of his men selected

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.610
a replacement from among the
fallen of high enough rank

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:02.920
to have one.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.820
"'You all right, Brightlord?'

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.830
"'Never been better,'
Dalinar said,

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.200
then sucked the blood up
through his broken nose.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.510
Hurt like damnation itself.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.100
"His men formed around him.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.744
And Dalinar led the way
further down the street.

00:41:16.744 --> 00:41:18.160
Before too long,
he could make out

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.690
the bulk of the enemy still
fighting ahead, harried

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.490
by his main army.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:25.040
He halted his elites,
contemplating.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.690
"'Orders, sir?' Thakka,
Captain of the Elites, asked.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.710
"'Raid those buildings,'
Dalinar said,

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.120
pointing at a line of homes.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.800
'Let's see how well they fight
while they see us rounding up

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.780
their families.'

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.040
"Thakka nodded,
shouting the orders.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.770
Dalinar reached for some water.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.440
He'd need to meet
up with Sadeas,

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.760
and-- something slammed
into Dalinar's shoulder.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.200
He got only a brief
sight of it, a black blur

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.250
that hit with the force
of a roundhouse kick.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.070
It threw him down.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.490
And pain flared
up from his side.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:56.630
"'An arrow?' he said, blinking
as he found himself lying

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:57.470
on the ground.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.000
A storming arrow sprouted
from his right shoulder, one

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.640
with a long, thick shaft.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.380
It had gone right
through the plate.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.430
"'My Lord,' Thakka
said, kneeling,

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.990
shielding Dalinar with his body.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.490
Kelek!

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:10.700
Brightlord, are you--

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.260
"'Who in damnation shot
that?' Dalinar demanded.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.770
"'Up there,' Dym said,
pointing at a ridge above town.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:21.330
"'That's got to be over
300 yards,' Dalinar said,

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.410
shoving Thakka
aside and standing.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.470
'That can't possibly--

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:26.390
"He was watching.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.770
So he was able to jump out
of the way of the next arrow,

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:31.560
which dropped a mere foot from
him, slamming against the stone

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.670
ground.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.200
Dalinar stared at it,
then started shouting.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:35.950
"'Horses!

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:37.640
Where are the storming horses?'

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.390
"Had the fires delayed them?

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:40.680
No, fortunately.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.260
A small group of soldiers had
guided them more carefully

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.717
across the fields, but
had caught up by now.

00:42:45.717 --> 00:42:47.550
They stood with the
rear guard of the elites

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.070
and came trotting forward as
Dalinar's order was passed,

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.110
bringing all 11 horses.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.920
Dalinar had to
dodge another arrow

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.490
as he seized the reins of
Fullnight, his black gelding,

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.560
and heaved himself
into the saddle.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.190
He galloped back the
way he'd came in,

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:02.390
trailed by 10 of his best men.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.650
There had to be a
way up that slope.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:07.950
There, a rocky set
of switchbacks,

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:10.649
shallow enough that he didn't
mind running Fullnight up them.

00:43:10.649 --> 00:43:13.190
Dalinar was more worried that
by the time he reached the top,

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.360
his quarry would have escaped.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.140
"He eventually burst onto
the top of the ridge.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.357
And an arrow slammed
into his left shoulder,

00:43:20.357 --> 00:43:21.940
going straight through
the breastplate

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.100
and nearly throwing
him from the saddle.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.020
Damnation.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.600
He hung on somehow, clenching
the reins in one hand

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.090
and leaning low, watching
ahead as the archer,

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.860
still a distant figure,
stood upon a rocky knob

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.740
and launched another
arrow, and another.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.910
Storms, the fellow was quick.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:40.250
"Dalinar jerked Fullnight
to one side, then the other,

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:43.630
feeling the thrumming
sense of the Thrill return.

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:47.550
It pushed back the pain as
hooves made a clatter on stone.

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:51.340
And another arrow zipped past
his face, dangerously close.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.550
Ahead, the archer finally
seemed to grow alarmed and lept

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.180
from his perch to flee.

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.380
Dalinar are charged
Fullnight right over that lip

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.380
a moment later, jumping the
horse after the fleeing archer,

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.570
who turned out to be a
man in his 20s wearing

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:06.010
rugged clothing.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.850
Dalinar had the option to run
him down, but instead, galloped

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:11.190
Fullnight right past and
kicked the archer in the back,

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.060
sending him sprawling.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.180
Dalinar pulled up his
horse, then turned it about

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.640
to pass by the groaning
archer, who lay in a heap

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.420
amid spilled black arrows.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.010
"Dalinar's elites caught
up as he climbed roughly

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.840
from the saddle, an arrow
sprouting from each shoulder.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.690
He seized the archer, who had
finally struggled to his feet

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.900
and was moving, dazed,
for his belt knife.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.750
Dalinar turned the fellow
about, noting the blue tattoo

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:35.940
on his cheek.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.170
The archer gasped,
staring at Dalinar,

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:42.030
who was covered in soot from the
fires, his face a mask of blood

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.980
from the broken nose and cut
scalp, and stuck with not one,

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.460
but two arrows.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.040
"'You waited until my helm
was off,' Dalinar demanded.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.450
"You are an assassin.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.420
You were sent here
specifically to watch for me.'

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.120
"The man winced as
Dalinar gripped him hard,

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.010
but then nodded.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.160
"'Amazing, Dalinar said,
letting go of the fellow.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.780
'Show me that shot again.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.230
How far is that, Thakka?

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:09.120
I'm right, aren't I?

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.670
Over 300 yards?

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:14.460
"'Almost four,' Thakka said,
'ut with a height advantage.'

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:18.420
"'Still, Dalinar said, stepping
up to the lip of the ridge.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.390
He looked back at
the befuddled archer.

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:23.030
"'Well, go grab your bow.'

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.570
"'My bow,' the archer said.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:26.620
"'Are you deaf, man?

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.280
Go get it!'

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.430
"The man regarded the 10
armed elites on horseback,

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:35.340
grim-faced and dangerous,
before wisely deciding to obey.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.050
He picked up his bow
and a few arrows,

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.260
then stepped hesitantly
over to Dalinar,

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.560
giving one glance to
the similar shafts that

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.510
were still sprouting from him.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.410
"'Went right through my storming
armor,' Dalinar muttered,

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:48.600
shading his eyes.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.580
To his right, the
armies clashed.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.560
And the main body of elites
had come up to press the flank.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.260
The rear guard and
found some civilians

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.800
and was shoving them
out onto the street.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.800
"'Pick a corpse,' Dalinar said,
pointing to a nearby square

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.050
where a skirmish had happened.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.130
'Stick an arrow in one
of those, if you can.'

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:08.390
"The archer licked his lips,
still seeming confused.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:11.830
Finally, he took a spyglass of
his belt and studied the area.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:14.150
"'That one in blue,'
he finally said,

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:16.350
'near the overturned cart.'

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.920
"Dalinar squinted, then nodded.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.350
Nearby, Thakka had
climbed off his horse

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.320
and had slid out his
sword, resting it

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.360
on his shoulder in a
not-so-subtle warning.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.000
The archer contemplated
this, then drew his bow,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.840
and launched a single
black-fletched arrow.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.420
It soared true, sinking
into the chosen corpse.

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.740
"'Stormfather,' Dalinar
said, lowering his hand.

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.460
"Thakka, before today, I'd have
bet you half the princedom that

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.360
such a shot wasn't possible.'

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.780
"He turned to the archer.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.960
"'What's your name, assassin?'

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.950
"The man raised his
chin, but didn't reply.

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.510
"'Well, either way,
welcome to my elites.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.870
Somebody get this
fellow a horse.

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:57.800
"'What?

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.350
the archer said. 'I
tried to kill you.'

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:05.410
"'Yes, from a distance, which
shows remarkably good judgment.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:08.180
I have use for someone
of your skills.'

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.970
"'We're enemies.'

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.930
"Dalinar nodded
toward the town below,

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:15.390
where the beleaguered enemy
army was, at long last,

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:16.630
surrendering.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:17.930
"'Not any more.

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:21.940
Looks like we're
all allies now.'"

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:22.890
And there it is.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:23.977
That's the end, guys.

00:47:23.977 --> 00:47:29.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:33.327
So for those wondering,
it's out next November.

00:47:33.327 --> 00:47:35.910
And for those who haven't read
those books or any of my books,

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.640
I'm not sure if that's the
best introduction to Dalinar

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.480
you can get.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.080
Most of them are not
quite that Dalinar running

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.790
around killing people ish ness.

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:45.760
That's a word.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.030
String that together.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.940
Either way, I really
appreciate you guys

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.290
having me in to Google.

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:52.791
I get to check this
one off my list.

00:47:52.791 --> 00:47:54.915
And hopefully, I'll get to
many more in the future.

00:47:54.915 --> 00:47:55.760
Thank you very much.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.310
[APPLAUSE]
