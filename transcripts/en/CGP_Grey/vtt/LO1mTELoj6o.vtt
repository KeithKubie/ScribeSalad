00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
Happiness -- many will advise you how to
obtain it but maybe you're not trying to

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.660
be happy. Your actions
aim for the opposite. You want to be the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.080
saddest saddo sailing on the sea of
sadness -- much easier to achieve and this

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.230
video has 7 tactics to get you started
toward the dark currents, at least one of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.860
which you are already doing. So let's
begin. First, stay still. Remain indoors as

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.320
much as possible, preferably in the same
room. Be the human equivalent of a pile

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.550
of laundry -- inert, unmoving. Don't let a
beautiful day tempt you for a walk. Avoid

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.660
anything even vaguely exercisial.
This keeps reward chemicals out of your

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.050
brain which could diverge you and
stillness guides you towards medical

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.840
problems which will keep this wheel
turning. Stillness is the most effective

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.860
thing you can do, so be the laundry pile.
Make your bedroom your allroom. Live and

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.070
work and play and sleep in the smallest
radius you can. Which brings us to screw

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.449
with your sleep. The wrath of insomnia
will be your co-pilot on the sea of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.280
sadness. Her mere presence is unpleasant,
but she also helps confuse the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.430
productive part of your brain which
might look to navigate you toward the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.200
islands of happiness on the horizon. More on that later. A regular sleep cycle is a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.850
fragile thing and takes at least three
days to establish. Be sure then to vary

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
your bedtime by several hours twice a
week, at least. Even better:

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.939
vary your wake time. Sleep in late,
preferably very late, some but not all

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.479
days. And tell yourself you are making up for sleep to feel like you're doing

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.920
something healthy even though you feel
terrible when you wake up early and when

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.579
you wake up late. Irregular sleep is
another of the sea's accelerating

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.479
currents. The more you vary your sleep,
the harder regular sleep becomes, which

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.979
makes your sleep more variable. To never
sleep or wake at the same time naturally

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.259
is the goal. And to help in this, maximize
your screen time. Staying on-screen

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.610
complements the previous sailing tactics.
Boredom could drive you to motion, so let

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.810
the screen entertain you. Tiredness can
push you to sleep, so let the screen keep

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.020
you awake, sort of, as long as possible.
Always fall asleep with a screen in your

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.060
hand and put your eyes back on it as
soon as you wake.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.080
Every moment away from a screen is a
moment you might notice the horizon. Keep

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.240
your head down and let the currents pull
you. Here you have allies unknown. Behind

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.780
the screen are teams of the smartest
people and brightest bots competing to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.910
hold your attention on them as long as
possible. Let them reach you to pull you

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.780
back if you turn away. Plus, screens
help with number four: use your screen to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.590
stoke your negative emotions, to feed
your anger or anxiety about things over

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.390
which you have no control or influence.
Be well informed while doing nothing. The

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.630
things you care about could be
navigational guides out of the sea,

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.890
reasons to leave your allroom and take
meaningful action with the humans around

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.300
you. But you can instead use the things
you care about as further sources of

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.920
misery. Focus on the bad to fuel your
resentment or despair. If you must

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.660
contribute, do so only in meaningless
token ways and be disappointed in the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.069
lack of change. We're coming towards the
end and if you're doing it right, misery

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.750
is descending. But some part of your
brain is rebelling, trying to turn the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.680
ship by setting a goal. If you're not
careful, that part of your brain just

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.329
might save you, but luckily we can do
more than just hobble it. We can fool it

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.549
to navigate deeper into the sea. To reach
goals, they must be specific, measurable,

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.079
actionable, for which you are responsible,
and time bounded. I will turn the wheel

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.760
one degree right now. Instead, set the
productive part of your brain on vapid

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.620
goals: vague, amorphous, pie-in-the-sky,
irrelevant, delayed. Make the target

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.810
unclear and the path unclear. If
motivation strikes, aim ridiculously high

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.489
to guarantee failure. I will clean the
whole house today is much better than I

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.540
will do the laundry in this pile.
Cleaning a whole house is impossible.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.890
There's always more to do, so you will
always fail. Focus on goals that are

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.299
after what you wish to achieve. Learn how
to market an app before you learn to

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.709
code. This will distract the productive
part of your brain quite nicely. And be

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.269
sure to wait for motivation rather than
setting a time. You'll do something when

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.400
you feel like it, which will be never or
never enough to matter. With vapid goals,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.669
you will turn the productive part of
your brain from a dangerous source of

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.659
self-improvement that rewards
every small step into a consistent nag

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.409
that berates you for your failure to
have already accomplished your goal

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.379
every step of the way.
Now the vapid goals you've set should

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.370
distract the productive part of your
brain, but if it still fights against you,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.129
direct it towards the mirage on the sea
of sadness: the islands of happiness

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.919
themselves. Pursue happiness directly. The
human mind is such that by setting sail

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.569
towards happiness, you will achieve the
opposite. Imagine happiness as a place

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.569
where happy people are happy all the
time.

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.129
This turns happiness into an unreachable
feeling of constant bliss that no one

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.229
has. True happiness is like a bird that
might land on your ship, but never if you

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.699
constantly stand guard to catch it.
Instead, improve your ship and sail into

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.830
warmer waters -- the bird will land when
you aren't looking. Uh -- so be sure never to

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.270
do that. Aim toward the mirage of
happiness rather than improving the ship

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.590
upon which you sail. Last, but most
important, follow your instincts.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.729
Navigation deeper into the sea of
sadness is quite easy, for there is a

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.779
dark magnetic field that points the
compass of your impulses in the right

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:38.759
direction once you get started. You will
want to stay indoors, you will want to

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.889
not exercise, you will want to sleep in,
you will want to do what you know will

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.349
make you sadder after you've done it.
Your compass points the way, both in and

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:55.020
out, so follow the true north of your
impulses and stay away from that other

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.360
pole of the long-term. It's all so simple.
Just get started with these tactics and

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.630
let the sea carry you along.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.480
This video was produced as an adaptation
of How to Be Miserable by Dr. Randy J.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.530
Patterson, which is a great example of
how thinking about the opposite of your

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.190
goal can help you achieve what you
really want. And if you want to listen to
