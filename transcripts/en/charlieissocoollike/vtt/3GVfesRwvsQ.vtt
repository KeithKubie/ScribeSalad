00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.920
I want to talk about consent today, 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.790
which means I'm going to be talking about sex, 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.530
so if you're not ready to hear me,
family friendly Charlie, 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.540
talking about sex, warning: sex. 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.820
In my lifetime, I have had a grand total
of two sexual partners. 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.230
I lost my virginity when I was 21,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.500
and it's kind of surprising to me these days how
little those quantifiers actually matter to me. 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.700
Back in school, however, my self-perceived
sexual inadequacy 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.590
seemed like the most shameful thing in the world,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.140
like nothing was more terrifying to me than
the idea of one of my

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.360
school friends asking me how far I had gotten
with a girl, 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.340
and honestly when they did ask me, the few times
they did, 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.850
I just lied, which makes me feel like they probably
were just lying as well. 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.970
In hindsight, though, I'm very glad that I didn't
rush into anything 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.110
'cause I think it helped me to learn the
importance of, you know, not rushing. 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.750
In my experience, taking the time to really
get to know the person that you're with 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.550
and what they like makes the whole sex thing
much more enjoyable,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.900
and it's also just a really great way to make sure 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.450
that the person that you're with really wants
to be there too. 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.060
And that is what consent is. 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.820
It's about making a positive decision that you
and the person that you're with 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.250
both definitely want to have sex together. 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.500
And for me, personally, having that mutual
consent is completely vital. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.740
If there's ever any doubt in my mind that
the person I'm with 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.500
doesn't want to be there with me, I stop and I talk
to them about it. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.180
It kind of ruins the flow, yeah, but it's the
right thing to do, 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.800
and it's something I think about every single
I'm with them too 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.780
because just because someone says "yes"
the first time 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.200
doesn't automatically make it a "yes" every
other time. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.420
When I was in school, sex was talked about like it
was some kind of trophy, 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.390
like it was something you had to get to win
approval, but really, 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.510
it's something you have to get approval for from
two people: 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.520
from yourself and from the person that you're with. 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.860
If you don't, want to have sex and you're being
pressured into doing it, it's horrible - 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.090
be that through your peers making you feel bad
because you're still a virgin 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.470
or be it through you making your partner feel bad
because they aren't up for it. 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.100
Everybody always has a choice about how far
they want to go 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.560
and what they feel comfortable with. 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.720
You can't force someone into doing it, 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.320
and you can't pressure someone into doing it until
they give in either. 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.550
If the person that you're with says "no,"
then you stop, 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.510
and even if they don't say "no," even if they just
give the impression that they're not in the mood 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.260
i.e. their body language, they stop kissing you,
they just don't want to be held, then you stop.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.730
Because in the eyes of the law, that is exactly the
same as them saying "no." 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.900
And if the person that you're with says "no" in any
of those ways 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.340
and you go ahead and have sex with them
anyway, that's rape.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.120
That's what rape is, and if you're charged with it, 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.050
you could go to prison, you could get put on the
sex offenders register, 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.340
and it would likely seriously mess up your future. 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.960
I am assuming you don't want that, though. 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.960
When you're in the mood, and your partner isn't,
yes, it can be very frustrating, 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.380
but in my experience, there is nothing better than
being with someone 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.520
who you know definitely wants to be there with you. 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.750
Sex is great, but it is so much greater when you
can be 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.160
giving as much pleasure as you're getting. 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.890
In summary, Charlie's sexy advice is:
be safe, be smart, 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.590
be with someone who you know wants to be with
you every single time. 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.040
Don't do anything illegal, just to be safe. 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.330
And have lots of fun because sex is great,
and that's my official statement. Bye. 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.670
