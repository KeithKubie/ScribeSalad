00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.200
Cigarette smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in America,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.560
killing 500,000 people each year.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.880
Vaping claims to be a safer alternative

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.880
and with 72% of all vapes sold, being the sleek new Juul vapes, what exactly is the difference between

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.160
smoking and juuling? Smoking a cigarette involves a narrow cylinder of paper filled with tobacco.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.569
The filter is made of hairlike fibers meant to trap some of the bad smoke.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.049
Unfortunately, one study found smoking with the filter actually made people inhale harder, pulling in more

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.980
harmful chemicals.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.279
A Juul is an electronic cigarette designed to look like a flash drive and is charged in a USB port.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.820
It has two components: one contains the battery and the system that regulates the temperature;

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.420
the other is a cartridge full of an E-liquid which also acts as the mouthpiece.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.129
These are called Juul pods and can be switched out or replaced when they are empty.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.460
In Canada for example, a single pack of Marlboro cigarettes costs around $13 which consists of 20 cigarettes

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.080
A Juul pod, which has similar nicotine content to a pack of cigarettes cost $16 and gives you roughly 200 puffs.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.720
Therefore Juuling is more expensive, but as are most things that claim to be healthier.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.300
So let's get into what is in a cigarette versus a jewel pod.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.640
The main ingredient in cigarettes is cured tobacco leaves,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.020
but also recycled stems, stocks, and floor sweepings known as sheet.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.500
Tobacco companies have added

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.980
hundreds of ingredients to improve taste, decrease harshness, and increase absorption.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.620
Some examples are sugars for taste,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.820
menthol to numb the throat, and ammonia to increase nicotine absorption in your lungs.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.880
Studies show that depending on the cigarette there are either hundreds to thousands of ingredients

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.180
of which many are proven to cause cancer.

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.880
Cigarettes involve combustion

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.822
and burn at a temperature between 400 to 700 degrees Celsius.

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:55.160
Meaning you inhale carbon monoxide, poly-aromatic hydrocarbons,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.040
and nitric oxide. All of which are dangerous toxins.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.000
Juuling, on the other hand, does not involve

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.069
consumption of the tobacco plant. The creators of Juul found that by adding

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.780
benzoic acid to just the nicotine salts in tobacco, they could mimic a cigarettes rapid nicotine delivery.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.420
Unlike cigarettes, Juul E-liquid only consists of five ingredients which are benzoic acid, a nicotine solution

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.400
glycerol, propylene glycol, and food-grade flavoring.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.740
Other vape companies may use the chemical diacetyl for flavoring, which can cause dangerous lung inflammation.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.980
But Juul makes a point to not include this chemical

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.109
The temperature needs to be at least

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.679
150 degrees Celsius to create an inhalable aerosol.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.100
Therefore, there is no combustion reaction, which means decreased toxins.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.030
For now, science says that drooling is healthier than smoking.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.860
But they both involve consumption of a similar amount of a mind-altering drug.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.290
Whether you smoke or Juul you are inhaling

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.540
nicotine into your chest where it passes through the thin membrane of your lungs and into your bloodstream.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.820
From there, the nicotine is carried to the brain

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.020
and within seconds, it binds to neurons in the reward pathway of your brain.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.980
This is the part of the brain that evolved to make you feel good after doing biologically important things

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.960
like eating, or exercising.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.600
The inhaled nicotine cheats the system by fitting right into the receptors in this pathway,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.820
causing the release of a neurotransmitter called dopamine.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.940
This causes the cigarette you smoked or the Juul you vaped to make you feel good, satisfied, and happy.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.760
Nicotine can wake you up if sleepy or calm you down if stressed. So, it is no wonder nicotine is

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.820
extremely addictive. The popularity of Juuling amongst young people

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.780
means less are smoking cigarettes. Which some

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.760
Epidemiologists think is a good thing.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.880
However, Juuling is also very new which means there is no long-term studies to uncover any hidden

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.089
negative effects. The best thing you can do right now for your health is to skip

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.260
nicotine products all together. If you want to know even more about Juuling,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.780
we just uploaded the newest episode of our podcast *Sidenote to YouTube where we talk about the new FDA regulations,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.320
our first time smoking, and scientifically debate whether or not we think Juuling is good.
