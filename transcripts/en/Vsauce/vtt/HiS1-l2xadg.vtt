A Big Mac hat, and a cat-bunny salad, it's
episode 45 of IMG!

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.000
This tent was pitched high up above the clouds.
The snow and clouds make it look like a sky-tent.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.650
But, can you find what's hiding in these leaves?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.370
Make your Snuggy super by looking like Spiderman,
Batman, or Wonderwoman.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.040
These double pupils are photoshopped, but
have you ever noticed that Sonic has it too?

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.180
His eyes are conjoined! They're like one big,
giant, white ball in his head, with two pupils.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.180
Perfectlytimedphotos.com has some neat-o shots.
Lightning on water, head touching water, cat

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.370
not-yet-touching water, and a ping pong ball.
You're never too old to play.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.990
And now, some unfortunately placed price tags.
Enjoy.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.320
Tyree Callahan invented this color typewriter.
The keys use pastels to generate art, and

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.170
this poor seal was abandoned by all the other
seals because he was born a ginger.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.630
Wet suits are funa and so are baby dolphins.
But let's get cuter. This dog is getting a

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.580
bear hug. Not enough? How about a Chimpanzee
feeding a tiger cub or tiger's licking.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.380
Better yet? This guy who, no kidding, actually
stole a photographer's camera and snapped

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.280
these photos of himself.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.530
Now, all of these animal images were on Buzzfeed's
list, a site where typing to Konami code rewards

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.030
you...kind of.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.970
By the way, you can still play Pacman on Google
by going to Google.com/pacman.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.220
And this product is not available yet, but
it's genius. Hamburger wrapping paper. Stack

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.310
gifts to make custom burgers.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.410
If you have expensive tastes, try these name-brand
cereals concepts.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.650
Artist Tim Schneider makes the world a better
place by putting big old eyeballs on things.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.580
And this road in Norway looks like it goes
nowhere. But actually, it's just an oddly

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.900
curved bridge.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.980
Now let's learn.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.060
Dailyinfographic.com is sweet. Here's a history
of the word "Geek." From the word's origins

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.950
in the 1500's as "Gecken," meaning a "fool,"
to the middle period when it meant someone

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.090
obsessed with technology, or a certain subculture,
to the modern "Geek Chic" meaning where a

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.030
"geek" or "gleek" is a revered title.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.080
And how about this one covering the chemicals
your skin takes in? Your skin absorbs 60%

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.780
of every topical product you put on it. Furthermore,
in her lifetime, the average girl will involuntarily

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.550
eat 4 pounds of lipstick.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.100
On the subject of infographics, and charts,
and graphs, take a look at this: it's an illustration

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.810
of the Turkish empire's reach, made in 1801
by William Playfair, and it was the very first

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.530
piechart ever drawn by humans. Neat, huh?

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.250
On Monday I tweeted my excitement for owning
this book, because shadows are magic. Like

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.540
these two strangers who passed by each other,
though their shadows told a different story.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.489
I also tweeted this illusion demonstrating
Troxler's Fading. Blurry, or faint colors

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.270
will disappear from your periphery if you
stare long enough.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.250
Finally, I shot a gun for the first time in
my life. Destin was there with me and he

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.489
has this excellent scientific method for recording
muzzle flash and the shooter. You go from

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.520
this, to this.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.000
He's gonna have a video soon where he explains
the entire process and how he made the photos

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.950
happen. But, in the meantime, check out this
video of the very moment I fired a gun for

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.550
the first time.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.860
"You are the man. You're the man!"

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.630
Phew, that felt pretty good.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.780
And as always,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.180
thanks for watching.
