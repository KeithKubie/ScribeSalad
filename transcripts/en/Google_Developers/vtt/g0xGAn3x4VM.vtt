WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Hi, I'm Wayne
Piekarski for the Developer

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.910
Show, and this is your update
on the coolest developer news

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.760
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.790
.app is the newest top-level
domain from Google Registry

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.680
and it's now open for
general registration.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.040
The link's on the post
in the description below.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.260
If you're heading
to WWDC this year,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.660
join us at the Firebase
party on June 4

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.280
to hang out with
other developers,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.830
meet engineers and product
leads from the Firebase team,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.830
and relax after the
first day of WWDC.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.200
Head on over to the post
to request an invite.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.620
On Google Cloud
platform, alias IPs

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.140
allow you to configure
secondary IPs or IP

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.810
ranges on your virtual
machine instances

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.110
for a secure and highly
scalable way to deliver traffic

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.880
to your applications.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.210
You can now dynamically add
and remove alias IP ranges

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.550
for existing running
VMs so that you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.500
can migrate your
applications from one VM

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.460
to another in the event of
a software machine failure.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.470
[INAUDIBLE] and example
commands are on the post.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.960
We've rolled out the next
generation schedule for App

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.150
Engine standard
environment, and our tests

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.610
showed that it delivers
better scaling performance,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.530
more efficient
resource consumption,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.970
and lower costs for you.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.630
Check out the post for metrics
and links to get started.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.730
Logs contain some of
the most valuable data

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.565
available, particularly when
troubleshooting an incident,

00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:20.190
and structured log data
is even more powerful,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.060
enabling you to extract the most
valuable data from your logs.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.977
We recently announced
new features

00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:27.685
so that you can better
use structured log

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:30.926
data, such as the ability to add
custom fields in logs if you're

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:31.895
in Stackdriver.

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:34.380
Take a look at the post
for screenshots and steps

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.310
to get started.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.030
HTTPS usage on the
web has taken off

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.370
as we've evolved Chrome
security indicators.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.010
Later this year, we'll be
taking several more steps

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.360
along this path.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.910
To learn more about the
changes and to get the link

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.200
to our setup guides for HTTPS,
head on over to the post.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.030
Over one billion
people in the world

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.860
have some form of disability.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.450
Building products
that don't consider

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.370
a diverse range of
needs could mean

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.880
missing a substantial group of
potential users and customers.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.710
But don't worry,
we're here to help.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.050
We recently launched a
new suite of resources

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.080
to help you make your products
and designs more accessible,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.670
and links to those
resources are in the post.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.765
Please remember to like,
subscribe, and share.

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:16.680
I'm Wayne Piekarski
for the Developer Show.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.721
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:21.860
