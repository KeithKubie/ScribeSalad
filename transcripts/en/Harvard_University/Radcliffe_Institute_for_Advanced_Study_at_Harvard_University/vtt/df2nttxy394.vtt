00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.740
- So at this point,
anyone who would

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.800
like to ask a question to
any and all of the speakers

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.180
should line up behind
the microphone.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.890
And can we have
your name, please?

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.150
- Hi, I'm Evelyn
[? Ginsberg. ?] This

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.890
is a basic genetic question.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.750
If we share 99 point
something percent of our genes

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.940
with chimpanzees, but my distant
cousins on 23andMe share 2%,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.360
is this a different
counting system?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.780
How are we counting what
percentage of genes match?

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.940
- Who's going to answer that?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.030
- I can try to speak to that
since I brought up the factoid.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.300
So 99.9% of your DNA is the
same as, say, your neighbors,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.760
or somebody across the planet.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.830
That said, that
fraction that varies

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.540
tells us a lot
about inheritance.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.280
So if you're looking between
you versus one of your parents,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.550
you will share 50% of the
variable sites in your DNA

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.630
with your parents.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.280
And then if you start to
look back further and further

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.140
in time, say, look
at your grandparents,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.770
you'll share on average about a
quarter of your variable sites

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.450
in your DNA with
your grandparents.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.090
So it's a difference between
what's varying generally

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.610
in the population versus what
varies across enormous time

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.450
scales.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.560
- So it's the variation
between different humans,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.836
assuming that you've found all
the variation that there is?

00:01:28.836 --> 00:01:29.710
- Yeah, that's right.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.610
And this is due to
common variation, not

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.120
these super, super rare
individual specific variants

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.880
that are arising very newly
within the population.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.730
- So it's some small subset
of all possible genes

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.560
that you're measuring
when you say we have

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.720
2% in common with Neanderthals.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.620
- Yeah, so that refers
to what fraction

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.120
of your genetic ancestry traces
itself to the Neanderthals.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.450
So the 2% number
says, essentially you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.930
can think of every
point in your genome,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.360
you can trace its ancestors.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.470
And so you have many
such genetic ancestors.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.610
And of those set of
genetic ancestors, about 2%

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.930
will trace their ancestry
to the Neanderthal lineage.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.850
So that's really what
we mean when we talk

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.854
about 2% Neanderthal ancestry.

00:02:23.854 --> 00:02:25.020
- I'm not sure I understand.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.450
2% of the entire genome,
counting every single DNA pair?

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.060
- So it's the ancestry
along of your genome.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.460
So for example, when
you're looking at parents,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.407
right, so that is genetic
ancestry that's immediate.

00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:48.240
But then when you go
to the next generation,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.781
you have your
grandparents, and there

00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:52.590
are four possible ancestors.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.900
And they can contribute
different amounts

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.550
of genetic material to
different parts of your genome.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.400
- Oh, so it's 2% of the tree?

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.890
- So the way to
think about it is,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.200
if you take one
point in your genome,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.460
and you go to your parent--

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.710
so you inherit it from
one of your parents.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.730
And then you follow which parent
that parent inherited it from,

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.250
and you keep going
all the way back.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.000
So you will, at some point,
maybe 50,000 years back,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.890
you will either go
to the Neanderthal,

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.560
or you will go to
the modern human.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.476
So this is for one
point in your genome.

00:03:27.476 --> 00:03:29.850
Now, you go to another point,
and you repeat this process

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.000
and see which ancestor that
part of the genome traces

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.030
its ancestry to.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.790
In general, they
need not be the same,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.060
and this is because
of recombination.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.010
So it keeps switching around
as you move along the genome.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.890
And so that's where--

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.480
then you count it
up, and you ask,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.520
what percentage comes
from Neanderthals?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.900
On average, it's about 2%.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.760
- Thank you.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.300
- Thank you.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.800
Next.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.070
- Hi.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.950
My question is
for Alicia Martin.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.700
And this problem, right, that
we have, it's not a new problem.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.940
I think of it as sampling error,
where the data that we collect

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.350
and the conclusions that
we draw from it in medicine

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.480
have been around for
a really long time.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.470
So this seems to me to be
an extension of a very, very

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.280
old problem, and the fact
that we draw conclusions

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.770
in ways which somehow don't
really take into account

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.760
what the actual sample is.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.260
Do you have any
thoughts on how we

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.290
can go about correcting this?

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.980
- Yeah.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.160
That's a great question.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.660
Thanks.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.457
Yeah, so to your
point, this problem

00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:44.790
has been around for a long time.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.400
It's been around as
long as genetics,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.050
or even far before genetics
was being studied regularly

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.210
across populations.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.190
So like a decade ago,
for example, researchers

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.229
said that 96% of participants
in genetic studies

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.270
were of European descent.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.319
Now we're 80%.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.360
So we're making some
progress, but of course it's

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.800
not fast enough.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.300
And so I think the
ways that we need

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.561
to start enabling some parity in
these public health issues that

00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:12.560
are going to start emerging
with the translation

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.790
of genetic technologies is
by enabling funding sources

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.590
to start to focus more outside
of European populations

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.300
than within European
populations.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.140
I think we're also going
to need to encourage

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.020
more genetic
investment of resources

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.402
outside of Europe and the US.

00:05:32.402 --> 00:05:33.860
Local researchers
are going to need

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.250
to take this up at scale within
different continents, as well.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.900
I think this is going to need
to happen on a very large scale

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.500
globally.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.420
But it's also important
to note that we're not

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.760
reflecting the diversity
that's present in the US.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.580
So the US is also going to
need to step up and make sure

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.540
that the data access for some
very large, diverse cohorts

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.750
that already exist are
accessible to a globally

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.060
diverse community.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.627
So there are some
very large cohorts

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:02.960
that are out there that capture
the breadth of diversity

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.660
in the US, where it's
actually really hard to access

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.280
genetic summary statistics.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.230
And this isn't due to
any privacy concerns,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.730
because genetic summary
data is exactly that.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.030
It's summary data.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.220
There's no individual
level privacy

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.610
concerns for that type of data.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.150
So we also need to make sure
that we can access that.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.520
So there's many
different moving parts

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.250
that all need to coalesce, I
think, to move towards parity.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.990
And it's going to be
a very hard problem

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.590
that we need to start really
making concerted efforts to try

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.080
to address over the
coming many years.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.150
- Just one quick follow
up, and that is, do you

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.650
think it would help to diversify
the professional community

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.380
of researchers doing the work?

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.126
- Yeah.

00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:48.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.600
It feels a little
ironic talking to some

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.300
of my more diverse
colleagues who

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.250
are studying European
participants at scale

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.537
as sort of the white girl
up here harping on the fact

00:06:57.537 --> 00:06:59.120
that we need more
diverse participants

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.930
in genetic studies.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.550
Of course that's the case.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.470
And I think we certainly
need to diversify

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.580
the academic community.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.060
But we also need to
encourage new leaders that

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.890
are invested in this
problem as something

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.150
that they're going to be
driving forward longer term.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.840
So yeah, I absolutely
agree with that.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.975
- Nick?

00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:18.250
- I'm Nick Patterson.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.140
I used to be at Broad, and I'm
at Harvard Evolutionary Biology

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.580
and Harvard Medical School.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.160
And I just wanted to share with
you something I talked about

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.030
with Alicia, how
some of the minority

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.600
communities in this country
have not been treated well,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.690
and there's a second order
effect on whether they

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.380
participate in studies.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.080
So I just will share
with you, I was

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.150
involved in a medical study
of cardiovascular genetics

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.950
in African-Americans.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.880
And the primary center of
the study was in Mississippi.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.060
And we had a poorer
response than we

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.450
wanted from the
African-American community.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.910
And a common question
we were asked

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.700
is, if we give you
our genetic data,

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.880
will that be available
to law enforcement?

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.430
And the legal answer is, under
subpoena, absolutely yes.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.540
And it's hardly a secret that
the African-American community

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.270
in the deep south
and law enforcement

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.850
have not always
got on very well.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.520
So the consequence was
that our participation

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.600
was lower than we wanted.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.810
And so that's a
political problem

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.700
due to past political and
present political effects

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.090
in the United States.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.419
And it's causing
technical difficulties

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.260
in acquiring the data
that Alicia wants to see.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.784
So I just thought
I'd share that.

00:08:41.784 --> 00:08:43.450
- Yeah, Nick, that's
an excellent point.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.075
Thank you so much
for bringing that up.

00:08:45.075 --> 00:08:47.640
I forgot to mention that,
absolutely, the mistrust that

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.770
happens in academic
research is often

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.800
earned through
historical misuse of data

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.320
or through historical
tensions with law enforcement.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.582
That's absolutely the case.

00:08:56.582 --> 00:08:59.040
And I think to start to broach
some of these issues we need

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.456
to be very delicate about how
we start to communicate both

00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:05.340
the needs for public health
purposes versus the tensions

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.380
with law enforcement
or with other bodies.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.250
- Yes, Alyssa?

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.070
- Hi.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.190
So I have my freshman
seminar students here today,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.620
and they're taking a freshman
seminar about prediction.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.870
And some people here know I
have a particular interest

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.050
in prediction.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.420
And my long term dream is
that data science will help us

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.020
with climate change.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.810
And so what does this
have to do with you?

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.810
The question is, I know
that in academia there

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.500
are a lot of silos.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.520
And a lot of what you are
doing is obviously related

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.680
to what each other
are doing here, right?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.360
And what I want to
know is, let's say

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.740
we're thinking about
a future where we're

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.690
going to have the ability
to really simulate

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.130
the future of the earth.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.490
And we need to understand the
interaction of all four things

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.950
that you were talking about.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.180
And how is the
climate forcing that?

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.840
And how are the fact that people
are eating tilapia, and ones

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.930
with Neanderthal DNA
are, and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.977
and then they're having clover
honey on it, and whatever else

00:10:00.977 --> 00:10:01.560
they're doing.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.000
So what venues are there
for you to exchange

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.670
your data and your ideas, other
than today, which is wonderful.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.580
But in other words,
are there organizations

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.820
where people are thinking
about pooling the kind of data

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.450
and research that you all have
across your sub-disciplines

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.685
that all touch on evolution?

00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:22.560
- Anybody can answer.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.530
- Anybody answer that.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.270
- I mean, I don't
know about the others,

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.570
but I'm a strong
proponent of open science.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.450
I put all of my data
sets, all of my code,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.790
drafts of my manuscript,
everything is just available

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.710
online even before publication.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.740
Which might be a
pretty extreme route.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.510
But I think, I
believe in just having

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.976
it out there for other
people to use and see.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.600
Now, I know that's
not always the case,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.516
especially if you're
dealing in human genetics

00:10:46.516 --> 00:10:49.482
and you have samples that maybe
would violate some sort of law.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.940
And you can't just put it out
on the internet for everybody

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.720
to have access to.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.880
But at least nobody cares
about clover to that extent.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.770
So I'm happy to put all of
my data and my code online,

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.570
and it's often helpful
for other people,

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.030
too, who are doing
similar things.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.990
So at least in my case, I just
try to be as open as possible,

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.540
as I can, with the stuff that
I am doing and want to do,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.280
and then hopefully
that fosters that sort

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.760
of open science type of idea
that you're talking about.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.410
- And that, if I may, and that
is the problem right there,

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:25.330
a big portion of the problem
is that, the white clover,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.290
who really cares?

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:32.200
But the implications for
humans, and of course tilapia

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:38.170
aside, is that we are
restricted by putting human data

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.920
or identified-- everything
is de-identified.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.520
And it's not, from
my experience,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.570
it's not so much that the
participants are worried

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.070
about what they put online.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:53.440
It's really because of
the health insurance

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.100
discrimination.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.690
There's other-- we
have to go deep,

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.860
and it's going to be more
than the two minutes that

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.230
are left in this
session, to uncover

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.610
why we can't have open access.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.150
My experience is not because
there's not a willingness

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.010
to be transparent
and forthcoming

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:17.260
by the participants, but
they're hindered by forces

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.230
beyond themselves.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.380
So I'm going to open
it up to the rest.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.970
I didn't mean to
get on my soapbox.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.370
But go on.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.090
Anybody else?

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.810
Yes, Katie.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.890
- Just one other note.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.160
I think that that idea
requires us to really think

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.380
outside the box.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.090
It's not only data
accessibility,

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.510
it's thinking about how we cross
disciplinary boundaries to make

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.040
those kinds of connections.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.480
And I think that's a
persistent societal challenge.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.410
I don't think that there is an
organization that does that,

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.530
but it requires
individual thinkers to be

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.280
willing to take those leaps.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:54.910
- Yes, sir.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.472
A few questions?

00:12:57.472 --> 00:12:59.230
- Hi.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.890
OK, I have a couple questions.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.600
Number one, in your
talk, you mentioned

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.990
that there's 2% Neanderthal
DNA on average in a person.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.790
And I noticed in
that graph where

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:19.570
you had the figure where you
had the amount of introgression

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.780
in, I think, East Asians
and some other populations,

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.130
the peaks were not overlapping.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:34.250
So I'm just curious,
what's the total coverage

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.045
of Neanderthal peaks
across everyone?

00:13:38.045 --> 00:13:40.310
So if I have 2--
well, I don't have 2%.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.760
But if someone else has 2%,
and someone else has 2%,

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.980
that might be 3% total coverage.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.050
Are they very overlapping, or
just completely everywhere?

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:56.410
- Yeah, so we tried to do
this experiment where we said,

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.220
let's say we took all of the
segments of Neanderthal DNA

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.490
across all the people
that we can identify.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.720
Can we stitch them together?

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.380
And if you do that, how
much of the Neanderthal

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.640
do we actually recover
from present day people?

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:23.510
And so we recovered of the order
of around 60% of the genome.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.330
Yeah.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.300
So-- six-zero, in
terms of length.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:35.830
So what that's telling you
is, at least one person has

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:40.240
a chunk of Neanderthal DNA that
you can use to stitch together

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.830
a full kind of genome.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.900
And now you can
ask, I mean, there's

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.840
another question you can ask,
maybe how much further can we

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.440
get?

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.390
If we had a bigger sample
size, can we get closer?

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.750
And I think that's where
you run into these issues

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.730
of these deserts,
which nobody seems

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.390
to have Neanderthal DNA at.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.720
And so I think they're kind
of saturating, literally,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.240
how much of their genome
we can cover that way.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.980
- OK, well, that's
already a surprise.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.530
I thought it would be like 8%.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.010
Is that a published
analysis, or is

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.330
that just like some experiment?

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.750
- It's published
in our 2014 paper.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.660
- OK, sweet.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.980
All right, second question,
because I was confused.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.110
You had this argument of
constraints to justify--

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.610
actually, I completely forgot.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:32.220
I just want you to re-explain
how constraint on evolution

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.315
helps you make arguments for
introgression events, sort

00:15:37.315 --> 00:15:40.890
of re-explain.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:46.260
- So I'm assuming you're talking
about what happens in regions

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.420
of the genome that
are constrained,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.560
and how much Neanderthal DNA
is present in those regions?

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.060
- Yeah.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.030
You just had some graphs that's
like constraints on the x-axis.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.530
I just didn't understand that.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.110
- Yeah, so there are some
regions of the genome,

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:05.430
for example, if you go close
to genes, which are functional

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.840
elements in the genome, that
tends to be more constrained.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.090
So what that means is--

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.590
- No, yeah.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:12.798
Yeah, I know what that means.

00:16:12.798 --> 00:16:16.490
I'm just saying, how does that
play into the introgression?

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.620
- OK, so those are
places where there

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.120
is going to be stronger
selection on mutations

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.680
that are deleterious.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.410
So for example, if you have
a Neanderthal chunk that

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.644
carries a deleterious
mutation, depending

00:16:31.644 --> 00:16:33.560
on which part of the
genome you're looking at,

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.450
whether it's a more constrained
or a less constrained genome,

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.310
the selection is
going to be stronger

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.050
in one versus the other.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.220
And so in the first case,
it gets removed quickly.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.390
And so you're going to
see a reduction compared

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.780
to the second case.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.280
- OK, cool.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.330
And then, sorry, one
more question for Alicia.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.520
- Can you save your
question for the reception?

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.110
We'll have a reception
downstairs right after,

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.940
and then you can
corner [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.320
and ask all the
questions you want.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.650
I'm sorry.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.940
If your question is quick?

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.140
- Yeah, really quick.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.690
My name's Christina
Wilson, and I'm

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.270
thrilled by the
advances in research

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.020
that you all are doing.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.369
But I also wonder
what you personally

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.920
feel like your obligations
are in a country like America

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.680
where, for instance,
health care is not

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.099
a guaranteed-- access to health
care is not a guaranteed right.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:31.230
And what the implications of
essentially marking everyone's

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.210
pre-existing conditions from
birth, I think you said,

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:41.370
has on the sociopolitical
economic conditions that

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.350
may or may not be exacerbated.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.350
One thing, to the organizers,
I would have loved

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.380
to see a bioethicist or a--

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.520
- We talked about that.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.860
Sean, didn't you say during
the break that-- yes,

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.085
we've already taken that--

00:17:54.085 --> 00:17:54.585
- Oh, great.

00:17:54.585 --> 00:17:56.670
So that's fantastic.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.400
But also personally,
I mean, we already

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.190
heard from James
that his philosophy

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.190
is put it all out there.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.140
And you're dealing with clover.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:09.150
But this happens in cities,
too, with open data in cities,

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.290
about technological points of
contact and similar things.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.350
You have corporations
and for-profit industries

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:21.600
using this public data to
do what they will with.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.450
So I'm just wondering
what, as scientists,

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.490
what your personal
sense of obligation

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.960
is to protecting the
rest of us living--

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.330
and being thrilled
by the discoveries,

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.780
but wanting to live a good life.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.569
- Thank you.

00:18:40.569 --> 00:18:42.110
Yeah, that was a
pretty big question.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:46.390
So I think maybe we can start
to tag-team pieces of this.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:50.200
So in thinking about how
genetics can mark you

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.870
from birth for
some traits or not,

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.060
I want to re-emphasize the
fact that genetics is not

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.760
deterministic, especially
for complex traits

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.570
that we're studying like
cardiovascular disease.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.290
Of course, your
environmental effects

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.210
can be as big or more
important than some

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.530
of your genetic factors.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.660
So I think it's, of
course, an important issue

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.000
to make sure that the
non-discrimination acts

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.430
in genetics continue
to be upheld.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.080
We need to make sure
that that does not

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.360
go away at any point in time.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.180
I think we need to
advocate to policymakers

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.830
that this is really important
as it stays separate from health

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.710
insurance companies.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.140
All of those factors
are really important.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.160
And then, to the open
science sense of camaraderie

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.780
that we all share,
I would emphasize

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.520
that, in human
genetics, while it's

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.380
hard to share
individual-level data,

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.620
we are also interested in
sharing summary data that

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.440
can be used for anybody
that's out there to compute

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.640
their own scores or start to
learn about their own biology.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.270
So that's certainly
also out there

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.350
and accessible through a
lot of these public servers.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.367
And we also put all
of our code out there,

00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:56.950
and we also put all
of our manuscripts

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.116
on pre-print servers, so
that anyone can access them

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:02.660
as soon as we're in a state
to actually share them.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.940
Yeah.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.910
Does anyone else
want to add anything?

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.235
- Yeah, so I'm also part
of the same community,

00:20:09.235 --> 00:20:13.100
and so again, I think
it's extremely useful

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.050
to have access to data.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:20.300
So in human genetics,
a lot of the genotypes,

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.307
including the Neanderthal DNA,
that's publicly available.

00:20:23.307 --> 00:20:24.140
You can access them.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.140
You can search for them.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.890
You can write your own
tools to query your DNA.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.670
Harder when you overlay it with
free data of different kinds,

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.740
but that's where the
community has agreed

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.870
to the sharing of some
of these statistics,

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:43.100
and that's been a way of still
sharing data without getting

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.429
into these privacy issues.

00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:46.220
And I think that's been
extremely valuable.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.184
- So again, [INAUDIBLE]
that you're talking about

00:20:49.184 --> 00:20:52.642
[INAUDIBLE] which is great,
talking about the bottom-up

00:20:52.642 --> 00:20:56.100
effect of us taking that
knowledge that we now know

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.440
about our personal genome, like
taking a 23andMe or whatever,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.421
and making changes
in our lifestyle.

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:03.876
But what I'm talking
about is a top-down.

00:21:03.876 --> 00:21:07.804
And so being able, at a policy
level, or a corporate level,

00:21:07.804 --> 00:21:10.750
to take that data and apply
it to mass populations.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.732
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.200
- OK, well, that is great
for reception discussion.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.640
I would like to thank
wholeheartedly these four

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.420
fantastic rock stars.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.174
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:31.174 --> 00:21:36.050
Sriram, Alicia,
Katie, and James.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:36.550
Thank you.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.180
I am very optimistic.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.620
The future is very bright.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.760
Because these are early curious
scientists that will inform us

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.520
for many, many years to
come, years that Alyssa

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.140
and I will no longer be here--

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.030
no.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.590
Didn't you take your 23andMe?

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.810
I'm kidding.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.640
OK, with that, the reception
is on the first floor.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.500
Thank you.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.950
