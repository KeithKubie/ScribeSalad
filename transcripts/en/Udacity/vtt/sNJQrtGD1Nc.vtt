[Evans] This works for things other than words.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The place where you've seen it the most so far has been in language,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but we're also going to see how to use it to make procedures,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and you'll also see how to use it in later classes

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
how to define data structures.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are lots and lots of different things in computing that are defined recursively.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A recursive definition has 2 parts.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It has the base case.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In our example with the word, that was the second rule.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the base case we can think of as a starting point.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The important thing about the base case is it's not defined in terms of itself.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It has to be something where we already know how to define it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So for programs it's usually going to be the smallest input

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or one of the simplest inputs--something where we already know the answer,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we don't have to do any computation to figure it out.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The second part is the recursive case,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and that is defined in terms of itself.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But it shouldn't be defined in terms of itself exactly,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
it should be defined in terms of some sort of smaller version of itself.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We need to make progress to eventually get to the base case.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We'll see what that means in programs soon.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
First we're going to try one other example not in terms of a program

00:01:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
just to get a better sense for how things can be defined recursively.
