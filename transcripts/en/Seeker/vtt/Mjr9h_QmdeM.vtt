00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:14.085
Is 
it just me or are more people allergic to

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:16.215
peanuts now than ever before?

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.295
What's going on?

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:28.425
Why are we allergic to these little things?

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:30.114
Peanuts are delicious.

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:34.224
They're free on airplanes, and though I'm
not a huge fan of peanut butter unless it's

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:40.395
on a granny smith apple -- it's a very popular
thing in the US.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:43.505
And yet, peanut allergies are becoming an
epidemic!

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:46.355
Or… maybe they're not, and we're just freaking
out.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:47.505
Humans do that.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:51.495
Firstly, there are two negative ways your
body can react to food.

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:52.495
Allergic reaction, or intolerance.

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:58.204
An intolerance is like indigestion, your body
isn't HAPPY with the food you've consumed,

00:00:58.204 --> 00:00:59.545
but it's not dangerous.

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:03.535
The VAST majority of people who react to peanuts
and other foods have intolerances.

00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:08.935
If you can eat a peanut accidentally and not
die, but you won't feel great, you probably

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.035
are intolerant, not allergic.

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:16.185
The FDA says 90 percent of all food allergies
are caused by milk or dairy, eggs, certain

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:20.745
fish and shellfish, wheat, soybeans, tree
nuts and peanuts.

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:26.874
If you accidentally eat even a tiny bit of
these and are allergic, you'd have a severe

00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:28.965
and rapid reaction.

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:33.135
Allergies are your immune system freaking
out and attacking what it thinks is a pathogen.

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:37.816
Though food allergies are a growing problem,
only 8-percent of children have them, and

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:41.335
of those less than 40 percent react severely.

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:46.635
According to a 2010 study by Mount Sinai Hospital,
only 1.4 percent of children were allergic

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:50.675
to peanuts specifically, and other numbers
are even lower.

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:56.804
Pollen, by contrast, affects as many as 1
in 5 people according to The Asthma and Allergy

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:57.804
Foundation!

00:01:57.804 --> 00:02:02.194
But, of course, pollen doesn't cause anaphylaxis
-- or a potentially fatal immune reaction

00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:04.615
that can be so strong it inhibits breathing.

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:13.905
The CDC, though, says deaths are rare -- only
17 people from 1979 to 1995 -- way fewer than

00:02:13.905 --> 00:02:16.145
died from lightning strikes.

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.875
That being said, we ARE getting more allergic
to things.

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:19.875
It's growing.

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:23.795
The number of people allergic to peanuts has
tripled since the late 70s, and scientists

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:24.795
don't know why…

00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:26.675
Even still, they're working on solutions.

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:32.795
A 2014 study in the journal JAMA Pediatric
found if moms consumed peanuts while pregnant,

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:36.415
the kid in the womb had a much lower risk
of developing the peanut allergy!

00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:40.015
Perhaps part of the rise is because moms are
eating fewer peanuts?

00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:44.315
Scientists figure the early exposure to tiny
levels of peanut proteins will help prep the

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:47.605
developing fetus so they don't freak out when
they meet them on the outside.

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:49.515
But again, they aren't sure.

00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:53.995
Since we know the allergic population is growing,
there are lots of steps being taken to protect

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:54.995
kids.

00:02:54.995 --> 00:03:00.995
A University of Florida study this week found
pulsing UV light onto peanuts eroded an allergen

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:02.365
protein called "ARA h1-h3" to a QUOTE "undetectable
level."

00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:03.875
A University of Florida study this week found
pulsing UV light onto peanuts eroded the allergen

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.865
proteins ARA h1, h2 and h3 to a QUOTE "undetectable
level."

00:03:06.865 --> 00:03:12.465
According to the report, they can cut the
allergens so 95 percent of people with allergies

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:13.465
would be safe!

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:17.815
It might be extreme, but it could mean a lot
for the piece of mind at school cafeterias.

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:21.895
In the end, kids CAN and often DO grow out
of their youthful allergies.

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:27.345
There ARE schools that have banned peanut
butter -- much to the chagrin American Academy

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:33.095
of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, The Food
Allergy &amp; Anaphylaxis Network and other parents.

00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:36.475
They all agree, bans aren't the answer.

00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:40.775
It's better to treat each child with their
individual allergy symptoms, as those symptoms

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:41.775
arise.

00:03:41.775 --> 00:03:44.185
Are you allergic to peanuts or intolerant?

00:03:44.185 --> 00:04:06.295
What do you think is causing all these allergies?!
