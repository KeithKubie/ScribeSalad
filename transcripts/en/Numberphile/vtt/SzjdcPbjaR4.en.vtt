00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:02.600
BRADY HARAN: So good Will
Hunting in the film is a

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.740
troubled mathematical genius.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
And he solved this problem
on the blackboard.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.300
There are a few candidates for
the real Will Hunting.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.750
Shall we talk about them?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.700
Will Hunting solves
this problem.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.300
There is an urban legend that's
similar of a student

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.830
who ran into his exam late.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.370
And he copied down the problem
from the board, and he went

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.910
and solved them.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.290
And the last one seemed
really hard, but he

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.190
kept working on it.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.060
And he managed to
solve it, and he

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.370
handed in his exam paper.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.540
And then the professor rings
him that night saying, you

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.440
were only meant to do the
first few problems.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.590
The last one was an unsolvable
problem.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.110
Oh, you've solved it!

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.950
So that's an urban legend.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.350
Great thing about that
is that it happened.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.010
So the real story of that
is there was a guy

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.250
called George Dantzig.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.930
He was a Ph.D. Mathematician.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.180
And it wasn't an exam.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.850
It was a lecture.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.640
He went into his lecture, and he
copied down the homework on

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.060
the board, these two problems.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.240
And he went home and
solved them.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.620
And he handed them in, and it
did seem harder than usual.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.710
And his professor went,
oh, just throw it onto

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.930
the desk, will you?

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.150
The professor--

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.900
and this is what happened,
apparently.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.670
This is the true story.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.540
This is how he tells it--

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.910
wakes him up six weeks later
banging on his door, 8 o'clock

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.410
in the morning on a Sunday
morning, saying, can I write

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.060
the introduction
to your paper?

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.040
He goes, what paper?

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.040
He goes, those two problems
you solved were unsolved

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.400
statistical problems
that you've done.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.790
And this is the first he's
ever heard of it.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.310
This actually happened.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.000
George Dantzig was his name.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.170
A year later when he had to pick
his Ph.D. topic, he asked

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.270
his professor what
he should do.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.790
And his professor said, oh, just
put those two problems in

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.010
a binder, and we'll call
that your thesis.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.670
Maybe you have to have done a
Ph.D. to understand how much I

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.180
hate him right now.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.580
So that's one candidate for the
real good Will Hunting.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.000
There's another famous possible
candidate for this.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.150
There was a guy called
William Sidis.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.510
Now he was an American
guy who was a child

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.260
genius, a child prodigy.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.240
They said he had an
IQ of over 250.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.460
And at the age of 11, he was
giving a lecture at Harvard

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.410
for the Harvard mathematicians
on some sort--

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.030
He was touted as he will
grow up to be a great

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.860
mathematician someday.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.340
He got into trouble
as a young man.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.430
He carried the red flag
at a Communist rally.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.050
And so he was arrested.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.870
And he was arrested for
assaulting a policeman.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.630
And part of his bail--

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.770
INTERVIEWER: You hit
a cop, you go down.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.810
BRADY HARAN: Yeah!

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.970
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.880
And if you're a Communist
as well.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.940
So part of his bail was to get
a job as a technician at MIT,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.110
which is kind of like Will
Hunting, and to see a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.280
psychologist.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.780
And the psychologist that he had
to see was his own father,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.450
who put him in a private asylum
for a whole year, which

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.420
he called mental torture.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.880
When he came out, he pretty
much swore off academia,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.140
mathematics, and spent the
rest of his life taking

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.790
clerical work, office jobs,
working the adding machines.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.680
He found it relaxing.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.640
He quite liked the adding
machines, but swore off

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.430
mathematics for the
rest of his life.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.240
It's possible that the story of
William Sidis that I just

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.160
told may have influenced Matt
Damon, because they were both

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.740
Harvard people.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.160
So Matt Damon went to
Harvard as well.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.180
And so it's a famous story,
and he was a very

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.390
famous child prodigy.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.380
So it's quite possible.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.480
But in the film, what they
reference is Ramanujan.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.170
Ramanujan was this famous
Indian clerk.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.680
I have talked about him before,
but I'll tell his

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.480
story properly this time.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.400
He was a mathematical genius,
again, because where he was in

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.840
India, he had very limited
mathematical education.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.360
He only had a couple of maths
textbooks to work from.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.680
And only from this, he was able
to reinvent a whole bunch

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.620
of mathematical results
by his own.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.050
He dropped out of college,
because he was so obsessed

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.650
with his maths he was failing
his other subjects.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.100
And he had to take a
job in an office.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.490
He sent his mathematical results
to some Cambridge

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.640
mathematicians including
Hardy, who realized how

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.240
important, how amazing
it was, and

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.130
invited him over to Cambridge.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.680
If you want to understand the
relationship between the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.480
professor in the film and Will
Hunting, then well, what I've

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.300
got here is a quote from
Hardy about Ramanujan.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.510
I think it's an important quote,
and I think it will

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.360
explain what's happening
in the film.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.080
So if I may read it from here.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.330
He said--

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.490
So that's what Hardy thought
about Ramanujan.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.190
And you have to remember this.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.300
If you see the film, this is how
the professor feels about

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.810
Will Hunting.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.580
When they're at loggerheads,
when he's so concerned about

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.750
his career, it's because there
is the sense that mathematics

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.210
is a young man's game.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.920
This is how Hardy felt
about Ramanujan.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.010
This is how the professor in
the film feels about Will

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.100
Hunting as well.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.610
So another big thing in the
film is the Fields Medal.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.520
The professor in the film is a
Fields Medal winner, if I get

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.300
that right.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.160
And they make a big
deal of it.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.510
They call it the Nobel
Prize of mathematics,

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.110
which is kind of true.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.290
They give four of these medals
every four years.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.900
And it is a big deal in maths.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.470
There is no Nobel Prize
in mathematics.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.050
The rumor that goes around
maths departments is that

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.830
Nobel didn't like
mathematicians.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.030
There's the story that his
wife ran off with a

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.740
mathematician.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.680
Which is not true, because
he was a bachelor,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.410
and he wasn't married.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.710
So it isn't true at all.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.180
He just didn't value maths.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.310
He was interested in physics and
chemistry, and he wasn't

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.560
interested in maths.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.360
That's why there is no Nobel
Prize in biology.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.100
INTERVIEWER: When you watch
"Good Will Hunting", does it

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.160
make you feel good about
mathematics?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.030
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.980
INTERVIEWER: Is it good for
mathematics, that film?

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.690
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.040
Because what it does,
is it shows--

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.040
well, first of all, it shows

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.460
mathematicians as human beings.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.730
They're not portrayed as nerdy
stereotypes, awkward, or

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.760
socially awkward or anything
like that.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.010
They're just guys with a job.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.720
And that's what we are.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.040
We are just guys with a job.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.180
We're good at our job.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.600
What's wrong with that?

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.720
And there are genuine
personalities in there.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.580
You've got the young
mathematician who doesn't

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.820
appreciate what he's got.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.310
There's the Ph.D. student
who's jealous of all the

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.480
attention Will Hunting
is getting.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.620
We've got the professor who is
a regular guy, even though

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.070
he's highly regarded in his
field and he's a very

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.390
important mathematician,
fictional though he is.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.240
He's a regular guy.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.520
He has his own problems.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.700
He has his own weaknesses.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.910
And it does show that
we are human.
