[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:07.730
MARCUS COLLINS: So my
name is Marcus Collins

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.000
and I am beyond excited
to be with you guys.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.380
Just a little bit
more about me, I'm

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.560
a professor at the Ross
School of Business.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.060
I teach in the
marketing department.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.440
Go Blue, absolutely.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.446
We are a warm
audience right now.

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:22.820
But that's actually
the side gig.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.400
The full gig is I work in
advertising in an agency called

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.224
Doner based in Southfield.

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:28.640
Even though I work
in advertising,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.250
I'm not necessarily an
advertiser, by trade at least.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.550
I was an engineer
undergrad then I

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.840
ended up leaving
engineering because it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.580
wasn't that fun for me--

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.560
no offense to an
engineers in the room--

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.770
then went to the music
business before I realized

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.950
the music industry sucks.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.940
So I came back school
to figure it all out,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.199
and then went out
to go work at Apple,

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.990
then went to New York
to work with BeyoncÃ©,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.364
then to the
advertising industry.

00:00:50.364 --> 00:00:52.610
And right now, the
space I work in,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.900
is this notion of
customer connections.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.870
That is understanding the
evolving media landscape,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020
that is the technology
that we uses

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.990
sheds data about ourselves--
which you guys know very, very

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.489
well, obviously.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.210
Understanding the
behavioral sciences,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.700
that is, the
causality based theory

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.020
that guides the behavior
that we take on,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.562
and lastly having a very
close proximity to culture.

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:14.520
Now I've thought about
coming to visit you guys

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.280
and speaking to you today, it's
like what do you tell Google?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.640
What do you talk about
with the folks at Google?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.950
And I figured I'd talk
to you about a very

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.990
simple concrete concept--

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.376
perspective.

00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.750
Now I love perspective, because
we talked about it a lot.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600
And we all have one.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.030
But really, it kind of
boils down to this for me--

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.829
that things aren't
the way they are,

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.120
things are the way that we are.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.610
That is, the way we see
the world often informs

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.290
how we behave in the world.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.540
The lenses that we have
by which you see the world

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.096
influences the behaviors
that we take on.

00:01:47.096 --> 00:01:48.470
And the beautiful
part about this

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.420
is that we could look
at the exact same thing

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.000
from two totally perspectives
and see two totally

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.930
different things.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.000
Here's a way to
tangibilize this.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.376
Take for instance my daughter
Georgia, who I love dearly.

00:01:58.376 --> 00:01:59.791
All right, because
she's the best.

00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.015
Even when she's like
this, I love her dearly.

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:03.110
So Georgia.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.910
Georgia is a fish, right?

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.450
She loves to swim.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.389
And I take full
credit for this--

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.889
my wife's over
there by the way--

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.092
I take full credit for this
because when she was an infant,

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:15.050
we took her to the pool
and I did one of these.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.870
Now, just check it.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.260
So there she goes.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.217
I release.

00:02:20.217 --> 00:02:21.175
She gets some air time.

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:23.915
Check it out.

00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:25.540
I catch her.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.040
Boom.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.564
A perfect dad.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.770
Perfect five, right?

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.020
Now, here's how I saw it.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.790
This was my perspective
as I saw that.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.890
I threw Georgia in the
air, just a little bit.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.080
Nothing alarming,
just a little bit.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.960
Georgia, maybe she saw
it a little bit higher.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.470
My wife?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.550
Marcus!

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.050
You're killing our child.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.277
It's all a matter
of perspective.

00:02:47.277 --> 00:02:48.860
The way you see the
world also informs

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.210
how you behave in the world.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.043
Now I want to talk to
you about perspective,

00:02:52.043 --> 00:02:54.800
particularly about culture.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.650
Now culture is one of those
words that we use often.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.600
We talk about it.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.590
We think about it in
media, celebrities,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.850
like that's culture.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.320
Or if you're
company, you say, we

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.280
have a foosball
table in the office.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.679
We have a great culture here.

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:07.720
We absorb summer Fridays.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.080
We have a great culture.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.430
But those things are
byproducts of culture.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.370
Culture, I think about
it from the perspective

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.420
of anthropology.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.970
Anthropologists describe
culture based on four things.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.650
They are other
beliefs that we hold.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.280
They are the
artifacts that we don,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.460
the rituals, the social
norms that we adhere to,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.550
and the language that we use,
the lexicon, the dialect.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.140
And when these four
things are adopted

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.730
among the populace
of people, it's

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.560
said to represent their culture.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.320
Right?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.510
And it manifests in
tons of different ways.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.080
It manifests in
their nationality,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.140
in their ethnicity, definitely
the religion they subscribe to,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.060
and, oftentimes, the passion
points that they hold dear.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.940
Right?

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.040
And we use iconography
to describe

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.680
and to project the
cultures that we

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.890
are a part of, the cultures
that we've ascribed to.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.530
Much like a peacock
spreads his wings to mate,

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.230
we do the exact same thing
when it comes to the brands

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.265
that we hold dear.

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:03.640
Now, look, you guys are smart,
obviously, so you're like,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.090
look, this is totally obvious.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.760
But the obvious
usually isn't obvious

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.525
until someone points
it out to you.

00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:11.900
For instance, say someone's
going to get some headphones.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.460
I'm going to get
some headphones.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.764
I go into Target.

00:04:14.764 --> 00:04:16.430
There's a long line
ahead of headphones.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.274
All the headphones
look the same.

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:20.149
They all kind of have
the same sort of shape.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.239
Which one are people
most likely to buy?

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:23.364
AUDIENCE: Beats.

00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:24.280
MARCUS COLLINS: Beats.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.980
Right?

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.916
I just met you, but
we know that right?

00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:28.710
Beats.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.340
Now, we know this because
Beats is the silhouette

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.629
of young America, right?

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.670
People don't need to listen
to music using Beats,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.820
it's just an artifact that
we wear around our neck

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.950
to say this is who I
am, these are a cultures

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.150
that I subscribe to.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.650
Now, are the Beats
better than Bose?

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.444
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:04:43.444 --> 00:04:44.860
MARCUS COLLINS:
Yes, you think so.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.920
Someone's a die hard
Beats fan out there.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.750
I would argue no.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.200
Is Beats better than JBL?

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.040
They're my clients.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.790
I definitely say no.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.620
Right?

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.190
In fact, a couple of years ago,
someone dissected apart Beats

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.770
by Dre headphones
about found it only

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.192
takes $17 to make a
Beats by Dre headphones.

00:05:03.192 --> 00:05:05.150
When people see that,
they're, like, excuse me,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.524
what did you say?

00:05:06.524 --> 00:05:07.700
Yes.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.200
Yes.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.010
It's no wonder then why
they dominate the market.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.960
It's not because of the value
propositions of the products.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.640
It's because of the brand's
proximity to culture.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.010
Because culture sidesteps
all the conventional wisdoms

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.880
that we know of or think about
when we think about marketing.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.140
It's more powerful than
my razor's sharper,

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.600
my battery lasts longer,
my car goes faster,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.530
my shampoo has more body, my
deodorant gets you laid, right?

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.230
It's more powerful than all
those things, because culture

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.770
is associated with
your identity,

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.830
the way we see ourselves
and how we want to be seen.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.540
And as Biggie once said, "If
you don't know, now you know."

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.340
How about this?

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.543
Look, what are these?

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:50.520
AUDIENCE: Loutoutins.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.880
MARCUS COLLINS: Christian
Louboutins, right?

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.096
What else are they called?

00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:53.592
AUDIENCE: Red bottoms.

00:05:53.592 --> 00:05:54.584
MARCUS COLLINS: Red bottoms.

00:05:54.584 --> 00:05:55.580
What else are they called?

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.538
AUDIENCE: Bloody shoes.

00:05:56.538 --> 00:05:58.436
MARCUS COLLINS:
Bloody shoes, yeah.

00:05:58.436 --> 00:05:59.424
Look at that.

00:05:59.424 --> 00:06:00.320
Yes.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.480
Bloody shoes.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.900
And we know that because
of Ms. Cardi B. Right?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.140
Ms. Cardi B introduced that
language to us in our record

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.350
"Bodak Yellow," right?

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.990
Which went number
one on Billboard.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.880
Like killed, it murdered
on Billboard, right?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.380
Not only did it
murder on Billboard,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.770
when Cardi B with number
one with "Bodak Yellow,"

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.360
she also saw to 217% increase
in search traffic for Christian

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.620
Louboutins, which was
equated to about $4.5 million

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.030
of media value.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.180
The culture drives commerce.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.319
And if you don't
know, now you know.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.360
Do you guys know this is?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.855
AUDIENCE: Jordan.

00:06:40.855 --> 00:06:42.480
MARCUS COLLINS:
Jordan, right, it's OK?

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.730
You should stop yourself, yes.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.920
It's Jordan, brand Jordan.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.280
But what else is it called?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.334
AUDIENCE: Jumpman.

00:06:47.334 --> 00:06:49.000
MARCUS COLLINS:
Jumpman, right, Jumpman.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.142
And in 2016, who
jumped over Jumpman?

00:06:53.142 --> 00:06:53.809
AUDIENCE: Yeezy.

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:54.683
MARCUS COLLINS: Yeah.

00:06:54.683 --> 00:06:56.810
My man's way in to culture,
back here by the way.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.376
Yeezy jumped over Jumpman.

00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.876
Now for those of
you who don't know,

00:06:59.876 --> 00:07:02.250
let me translate this for you.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.130
Adidas went from being number
three in shoe manufacturers,

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.470
sneaker manufacturer,
in the country and over

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.264
to brand Jordan in 2012,
coming in at number two.

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:13.930
And a lot of this was
attributed to what

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.650
they called the Yeezy effect.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.290
Kanye made the Yeezys and
just dominated things.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.660
This was also a tribute to
Farrel and Stan Smith, right?

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.430
And it just actually Q12,
Adidas overtook Nike.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.100
It was in Q12 sales.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.850
This isn't the first
time we've seen this.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.970
We also saw it with Run DMC.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.000
The impact on culture
drives commerce.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.250
You guys know this guy, right?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.470
Of course, you know this guy.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.915
The most emo rapper ever.

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:43.280
Now I love Drake, he's the best.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.780
The best.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.770
Talks to my soul.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.270
Right?

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.330
And you can't go anywhere
without hearing a Drake record.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.900
Drake is the guy.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.510
And we know that Drake
is very closely connected

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.340
to his beloved city of Toronto.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.730
And just recently,
in fact, someone

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.980
equated the value of Drake on
the economic power of Toronto

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:08.350
that Drake's responsible for
5% of the economy in Toronto,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.130
because there's
the 6 Barber Shop.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.320
There's the 6ix Restaurant.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.520
There's a 6ix nail salon.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.820
All of this language that
was introduced by Drake.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:20.110
That is ridiculously
powerful, unreal powerful.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.420
This is what culture does.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.280
This is the impact of culture--

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.320
the beliefs that we
hold, the artifacts

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.670
that we don, the
behaviors we take on,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.920
and the language that we use.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.440
This is culture
with a capital C.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.802
This isn't just hip hop culture.

00:08:32.802 --> 00:08:34.510
Though, I can argue
that American culture

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.520
is hip hop culture.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.299
Like the ethos of hip hop is I
came from nothing to something,

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.900
and now I'm stunting on you.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.840
That's exactly what
American culture is.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.400
I pull myself up by bootstraps
now I'm stunting on you, right?

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.130
Which it's no wonder why hip
hop music is the number one

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.769
most listened to
genre in the country.

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:55.310
When we talk about culture, we
mean culture with a capital C.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.780
For instance, go back
to 2008, in the middle

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.170
of financial crisis 2008.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.860
And you had an
uprising of people

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.090
who felt like capitalism
was a very, very bad thing.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.612
So much so that they wanted
to be counterculture.

00:09:09.612 --> 00:09:11.320
We're going to be
completely antithetical

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.870
to the capitalistic
culture that we lived in.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.140
And we call these people
affectionately hipsters.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.770
Hipster was all about
pushing against what

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.780
we know of capitalism,
pushing against what

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.300
we know of adorning
ourselves with material.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.120
So we can express
ourselves freely.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.650
They donned artifacts
that were irreverent.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.520
They were ironic in some cases.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.960
You guys bought cars.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.300
They bought ridiculous bikes
and the whole nine, Right?

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.960
Grew facial hair,
the whole nine.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.510
What was the drink of
choice for hipsters?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.420
Adult beverage drink of choice?

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.017
AUDIENCE: PBR.

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:45.300
MARCUS COLLINS: PBR.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.230
PBR, right?

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.660
Now, why PBR?

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.175
Because PBR as a brand is
all about egalitarianism.

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.990
They're all about
individual expression.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.060
The ethos of the
brand was completely

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.420
connected to what the hipster
community, the hipster culture,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.710
was all about.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.800
They found a uniting force
based on the conviction

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.801
that they both shared.

00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:08.800
And everyone who considered
themselves a hipster

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.055
were drinking PBR.

00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:11.680
Now, you can look at
that and say, wow,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.410
that's pretty interesting.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.960
But the impact of PBR's
business was through the roof.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.390
Hockey stick growth at the time
with the rising of this culture

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.480
that we all call hipsters.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.870
So much so, it turned PBR into
a billion dollar business,

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.020
which is ridiculous.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.060
And you can say
that, like, well,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.300
what was the rest
of the market doing?

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.480
Well, I'll tell you with
rest of market was doing.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.830
Everyone else was either
declining or flat lining.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.140
Well, PBR was murdering.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.290
If you don't know, now you know

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.550
We also know this when
we think about proposing.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.050
Right?

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.680
We propose with a diamond.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.540
Right?

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.300
And why would we
propose with a diamond?

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.130
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.347
Why would we propose with
a diamond, question mark?

00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:53.680
AUDIENCE: Diamonds last forever.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.263
MARCUS COLLINS:
Diamonds last forever.

00:10:55.263 --> 00:10:57.330
And who told us that?

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.140
AUDIENCE: De Beers.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.390
MARCUS COLLINS: De Beers, yes.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.930
De Beers said
diamonds are forever.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.980
So if you love her or
you love your loved one,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.290
you better get a diamond.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.290
And you know you better
not propose with a ruby,

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.280
she's like, you'd better get up.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.100
Try again.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.520
Propose with a diamond
because diamonds last forever,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.130
because diamonds are forever.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.830
So much so that as much love
as you have for that person,

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.500
save up three months
of your salary

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.950
to show the love within this
rock that lasts forever.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.700
Well, I'll tell you
why De Beers tells you

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.370
that it lasts forever, because
the resale value for a diamond

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.440
is actually pretty awful.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.780
And they have a monopoly, a
seemingly monopoly, on diamonds

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.720
so they constrict the supply
and tell you it lasts forever.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.290
Don't go and resell it, because
you'll see that this is bogus.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.830
And as a result,
when this campaign

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.890
hit the market in the
1930s, you started

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.365
to propose with a diamond.

00:11:52.365 --> 00:11:54.670
And we see the exact same
thing happen in Japan.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.280
They rolled out
the same campaign.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.080
Brands have an impact on culture
end up impacting commerce.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.390
And if you don't
know, now you know.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.600
We also see this when
you think about smiles.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.740
You ever wonder why
back in the day,

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.430
people were mean
mothers in their photos,

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.457
in their portraits.

00:12:13.457 --> 00:12:15.040
And then today, we
can't stop smiling.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.590
We're all smiles, right?

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.870
Even Kanya has some
issues with this.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.390
Right?

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.430
Now one would says,
well, that's because back

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.980
in the day, people's
photos, those pictures

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.000
were taken via portrait.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.090
And it took a long time.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.270
And you can't hold
a smile that long.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.436
Like their face gets fatigued,
muscles get fatigued.

00:12:33.436 --> 00:12:36.210
And people just kind of
straight looked the whole time.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.800
But even with the
advent of cameras,

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.745
people still took very grim,
grimace looking, photos.

00:12:43.745 --> 00:12:45.810
And this wasn't because
of the technology.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.710
This is because of the culture.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.190
The belief that the time
was that the idea of smiling

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.450
in photos or in portraits
was childlike, was halfwit,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.957
You were last than.

00:12:56.957 --> 00:12:57.790
That was the belief.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.060
Which is why the photo of a
standing president, the dude

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.400
looks like he belongs in
"The Conjuring" or something.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.710
Completely,
completely not happy.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.490
No joy happening there.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.360
And even at the turn of the
century where cameras became

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.160
much more ubiquitous and more
people had access to them,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.850
we still didn't smile
very much in photos.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.790
So if you are a
camera company that

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.340
makes your business from people
buying cameras and buying

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.350
film and taking lots
and lots of pictures,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.150
people think of taking
photos as a serious business,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.710
they're not taking
a lot of photos,

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.530
it's a bad situation for you.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.680
So Eastman Kodak say, we
got to change this up, man.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.290
We have to reposition how
people think about what

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.860
photos are meant to be.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.780
So they introduced the
idea of the Kodak moment.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.120
Taking photos is about
capturing, preserving,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.070
these joyous moments.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.020
It's about preserving
these moments that we

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.340
have with people that we love.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.740
So much so that we say, cheese,
when we smile and take photos.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.220
Completely changed not only
the belief, but the behavior.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.470
And fortunately,
when this rolled out

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.030
at the turn of the century,
it measured very closely,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.880
or lined up very closely,
with a study that

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.810
was done on year book photos.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.110
Well it took yearbook
photos over a century's time

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.350
and measured the curvature
of faces in the photos

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.990
to see how often or how
much people were smiling.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.960
And we saw more and
more were smiling.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.910
This is what we do.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.200
Which is why that guy now
looks like a this kind of guy.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.290
And the results of it was
massive for Kodak's business.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.620
Almost $6 billion dollars.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.550
Kodak closed in 2005.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.230
Unfortunately, they
missed a cultural shift,

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.230
kind of play themselves.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.020
WE know how that can end up.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.580
Right?

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.110
Not so good, right?

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.970
So why does this matter?

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.620
Why does any of this matter?

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.100
I'll tell you why it matters.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.980
It matters because
brands who lead culture

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.530
are more successful
than those who follow.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.960
That is brands who
push culture forward,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.870
brands who contribute to the
culture, are more successful

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:53.920
those who follow.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.100
They contribute to the
beliefs, the artifacts

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.920
we don, the language we take
on, the behaviors we take on.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.844
The brands who lead
that push it forward.

00:15:01.844 --> 00:15:04.010
And people use those brands
to communicate something

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.270
about themselves.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.700
Whether it's Apple, Nike,
Whole Foods, Starbucks,

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.670
people are getting tattoos of
Harley Davidson on their body.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.400
You don't seen
anyone walking around

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.260
with [INAUDIBLE]
tattooed on their body.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.640
Right?

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.020
We use these brands to
communicate our identity.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.950
And when we understand the
impact of culture on commerce,

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.820
we can then superimpose it with
what we know of human behavior,

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.120
then superimpose that on what
we know of people's behavior

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.440
based on the shedding of data
from behaviors we take on

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.690
and allow us to better
connect with consumers.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.880
We know who they really are.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.020
Here's a few examples
of this in action.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.590
So Netflix is one of
our clients at Doner.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.570
And Netflix came to
us and said, hey,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.079
you want to launch into
Season 5 of "House of Cards."

00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:51.620
It's got a lot of
momentum happening.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.600
Things are going well.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.975
But listen, this
is in the middle

00:15:53.975 --> 00:15:59.890
of the most divisive
drama-filled election

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.500
cycle we've probably ever
seen, at least in our lifetime.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.940
So how might we be a part
of this cultural movement?

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.872
How might we be a part
of the conversation?

00:16:09.872 --> 00:16:11.080
So we took on the assignment.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.413
And we said, well, what
cultural thing can we lean into?

00:16:13.413 --> 00:16:14.825
What could we take advantage of?

00:16:14.825 --> 00:16:16.325
And the first thing
we thought about

00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:19.870
was, well, the actual
logo of the show--

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.640
upside down flag.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.759
And what does an upside
down flag signaling?

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:24.550
AUDIENCE: Distress.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.591
MARCUS COLLINS: Distress.

00:16:25.591 --> 00:16:26.710
Exactly, right?

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.440
Culturally, we know
that an upside down flag

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.630
means trouble's a-brewing.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.010
Help.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.640
So we thought what more
opportune time then

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:43.250
to launch the teaser for the
Season 5 "House of Cards"

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.470
new season than here.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.800
So during the inauguration
of now President Trump,

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.120
we launched this little diddy.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:17:21.736
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:21.736 --> 00:17:22.319
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.720
MARCUS COLLINS: So
zero media behind it--

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.710
which I know is not a
good thing for you guys--

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.819
but zero media behind it.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:31.470
We saw 100,000 shares
per hour for the first 18

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.660
hours of launching this thing.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.140
Not because it was so radical,
but because it had a place.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.530
It contributed to the
culture, which allowed people

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:44.509
to communicate how they feel,
which is ridiculously powerful.

00:17:44.509 --> 00:17:46.050
Now you can look at
"House of Cards,"

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.280
and say, well, that's
already culturally relevant.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.995
That's a cheat,
that's a cheat code.

00:17:48.995 --> 00:17:51.701
There's something that's
not as culturally relevant.

00:17:51.701 --> 00:17:52.200
Potbelly.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.580
You guys know Potbelly, yes?

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.700
MARCUS COLLINS: You
guys know Potbelly, yes?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.190
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.760
MARCUS COLLINS: Ah, good.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.509
I appreciate that.

00:17:57.509 --> 00:17:58.080
Great.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.720
So Potbelly, for those who
don't know, who didn't say yes.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.245
Potbelly is a sandwich shop.

00:18:02.245 --> 00:18:03.120
They sell sandwiches.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.735
They sell toasted
sandwiches, hand

00:18:06.735 --> 00:18:10.871
dipped milkshakes, and
daily baked cookies, TM.

00:18:10.871 --> 00:18:11.370
Right?

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.542
So that's Potbelly.

00:18:13.542 --> 00:18:15.000
Now Potbelly came
to us and said we

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.027
want to tell better
stories about the brand.

00:18:17.027 --> 00:18:19.110
We want to move from being
this kind of like culty

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.090
kind of iconic brand
or culty kind of brand

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.799
to an iconic brand,
bring more people in.

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.798
So the first thing we
asked them was like, well,

00:18:24.798 --> 00:18:25.902
what do you believe?

00:18:25.902 --> 00:18:26.610
Why do you exist?

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.430
What's the North
Star that guides you?

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.310
They said, well, you know, we
believe in fresh ingredients.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.820
We believe in
tastier sandwiches.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.700
Like no, no, no, no.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.340
That's what you do.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.048
Why do you do it?

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:36.870
What's the belief?

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.390
Very Simon Sinek
kind of approach.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.210
They said, well, you
know, they don't know.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.850
Had to spend some
time with the CEOs,

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.225
spend some time
with the founder.

00:18:44.225 --> 00:18:46.224
Founder said, basically,
I make these sandwiches

00:18:46.224 --> 00:18:47.180
to make people happy.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.720
And making people happy
making these sandwiches,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.560
that made me happy.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.740
So there's happiness abound.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.320
So we said, well, there is then.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.320
You're not in the business
of making sandwiches,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.510
you're in the
business of happiness.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.239
We need to shift
your perspective,

00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:00.780
the way you see the
world, from being

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.030
in the sandwich business
to being in the happiness

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.120
business.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.520
So we took their communications.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.070
Turned if from being good food,
good vibes, to feed your smile.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.880
Right?

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.300
We don't just feed your
bellies, we feed your smiles.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.660
We're all about happiness.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.710
So the question now became
so who do we go after?

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.030
Who do we target?

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.130
Well, these guys don't
have a lot of money.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:21.870
They just don't.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.120
Whatever currency I have
in my pocket right now

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.120
is probably more than in
their marketing budget.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.459
They have about $20.

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:29.250
Not a lot of money.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.416
So we thought, well, let's
start with the people who

00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:34.650
love you most, the people
who are part of your email

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.470
distribution.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.170
They are the most ravenous fans.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.340
They love the brand.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.446
Who are those people?

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:41.320
And fortunately for us,
they had a list them.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.221
They called them
the Sandwich Board.

00:19:43.221 --> 00:19:44.970
These are the people
they send rebates to.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.240
They test products with them.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.750
Like this is like their people.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.910
So we said give us
those email addresses.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.550
And we took those
email addresses.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.890
And we converted into the
associating Twitter handles.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.630
And the idea was
let's find out who

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.690
these people are beyond
being hardcore sandwich fans.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.780
So with Crimson Hexagon, which
is an AI consumer insight

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.290
platform, we built this
prototype, a networking mapping

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.870
tool, that allowed us to
take those email addresses

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.300
or as Twitter handles,
dump them into the tool

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.640
and see what these
people have in common.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.380
So this is a rendering of it.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.470
So we take these
Twitter handles,

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.547
dump them into the tool.

00:20:22.547 --> 00:20:24.630
And we start seeing the
connectivity between them.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.970
The clusters that you
see are conversations,

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.075
not about sandwiches,
but about things

00:20:29.075 --> 00:20:30.450
that are happening
in their life,

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.430
they're happening in culture
and things of that nature,

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.770
to get a better understanding
of who these people are.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.610
And in doing this exercise,
we saw four things.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.960
Four things that
were disproportionate

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.330
to these people versus
the rest of Twitter.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.340
And here they are.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.154
First, they were
hardcore sports fans.

00:20:46.154 --> 00:20:47.820
And truthfully, we
didn't feel like that

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.400
was very discriminating,
because like a lot of people

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:50.909
like sports.

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:52.950
It's like, ah, we don't
know if we have any right

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.450
to be a part of that.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.410
Then we saw Christians.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.320
And these were like hardcore,
like Joel Osteen happy

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:58.940
Christians.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.200
Which is great, because
it's a happy brand.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.158
But the client, I didn't
want to get into that.

00:21:03.158 --> 00:21:04.080
So we kept it moving.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.366
We saw some tech startup,
some MarTech in particular.

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.240
But we didn't feel like
what we had any right

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.750
to be a part of that.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.750
But then we saw people
talk about music.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.660
Now again, music is not
very discriminating.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:16.660
Everyone likes music.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.260
I've never met someone in
life who said I hate music.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.075
If you meet that person,
they're monsters, stay away.

00:21:22.075 --> 00:21:22.950
Everyone likes music.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.226
So it's not very
discriminating on the surface.

00:21:25.226 --> 00:21:27.600
But when we looked closer to
the things are being shared,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.790
we saw there sharing
SoundCloud files, which

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:37.140
is really small in comparison
to Spotify or YouTube or YouTube

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.780
or YouTube.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.240
I know where I am.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.160
Very, very small.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.868
So that was actually
very discriminating.

00:21:43.868 --> 00:21:45.430
And particularly
SoundCloud, these

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.510
aren't usually signed artists.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.676
They're underground artists.

00:21:47.676 --> 00:21:49.380
This is a way to
discover new artists.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.339
So we felt that music is
probably a good avenue for us

00:21:52.339 --> 00:21:53.880
to get into the
culture, particularly

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.400
because we have live musicians
who play during lunch.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.800
So now we got a way in.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.690
So we came up with some
ideas for the client.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.570
And we pitched the ideas.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.236
They said we love
that, that, that, that

00:22:04.236 --> 00:22:05.340
and give me some of that.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.690
And the idea was, like,
let's go test some stuff.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.850
Now usually, you get a
focus group of people

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.600
to look at the work,
and say, I like that.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.260
And I'll buy that
because I like that work.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.710
Well, typically
they're all lying,

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.100
because self-reported
data is terribly flawed,

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.690
at least biased.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.570
So instead of asking people,
because we didn't have money

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.189
to get it wrong, we decided
to ask their bodies.

00:22:26.189 --> 00:22:28.480
So we partnered with Michigan
State's Media Advertising

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.590
Psychology Lab and we brought in
respondents to look at the work

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:37.390
that we were proposing in a
full Facebook-like environment.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.880
So they saw some regular
content and then the work

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.880
that we were proposing.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.270
So regular content and the
work that we were proposing.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:47.020
And all of these respondents
were then tracking or taking

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.110
their physiological response.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.540
Sweat gland release,
heart cardio activity,

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.220
respiratory activity,
eye tracking,

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.280
zygomatic muscle, which
is the smile muscle.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.779
And we were attributing
what we knew

00:22:59.779 --> 00:23:02.350
of the psychological drivers
to those physiological

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.760
manifestations.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.677
And the work that
performed the best, that's

00:23:05.677 --> 00:23:06.760
what we put in the market.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.290

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.880
- Making great
sandwiches that make

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.660
people really, really happy.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.020
It's Potbelly's mission.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.610
But how do you own that
position in the social sphere

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.520
when your annual revenue is
less than your competitor's ad

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.870
budget?

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.530
We melted data, tech,
and genuine happiness

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.810
to feed smiles across the web.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.050
First, we set our sights on
arguably the most unhappy place

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.790
ever, Twitter.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.090
Through our partnership with
Crimson Hexagon, an AI powered

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:38.440
consumer insights platform, we
identified a hundred sad tweets

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.600
and had Potbelly
musicians respond

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.825
with 100 original happy
songs in real time

00:23:43.825 --> 00:23:45.760
all during one lunch day.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.300
- Turn that frown upside down.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.050
- When we learned
Paula's fish died,

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.420
we entertained her with this.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.550
- (SINGING) I'm so sorry
to hear about your fish.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.500
- @megmoles fell out of a tree.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.480
- (SINGING) Yeah,
you're tweeting today.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.170
I'm glad you're OK.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.900
- No matter the problem,
we had a happy response.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.740
- (SINGING) I'm just going to
tell you you're the very best.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.660
- We flooded Twitter
with smile songs.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.150
And Twitter-- well,
they smiled back.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.280
But the good vibes
didn't end there.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.710
We helped entire cities
in need of happiness

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.810
by creating the smile scale.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.200
A one-of-a-kind algorithm that
synthesizes everything from

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.170
weather and traffic data to
results from major sporting

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.560
events and social media
happenings across key cities,

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.400
then automatically serves
customized pieces of content.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.610
If it's raining in
Dallas, they get this.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.060
If traffic is bad in
Chicago, they see this.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.790
And if Detroit's favorite
baseball team loses,

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.740
we cheer them up with this.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.600
The results?

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.910
10 times more brand engagements,
20 times more Twitter

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.080
followers.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.010
Overall, we spread happiness
to more than 16 million people.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.740
That's a whole lot of smiles.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:57.612 --> 00:24:59.570
MARCUS COLLINS: The more
important part of this

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.350
is that with only $60,000
and the media spin,

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.190
we saw 2.8% increase in
store traffic for the stores

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.370
where we did smile scale
activations, which is

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.600
ridiculously powerful, right?

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.880
It was crazy, crazy powerful.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.950
Taking what we know
of available sciences,

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.020
applying them to what we
know the evolving landscape

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.590
and finding a
vehicle, an access,

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.550
license to be a part of culture.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.660
Now, Netflix, kind of sexy,
Potbelly, not so much,

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.260
but sort of fun.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.900
Let's get really
brass tacks like CPG,

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.800
like this is not
sexy by any stretch.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.680
Let's talk Farmland.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.220
You guys know Farmland?

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.710
AUDIENCE: Chicken and stuff?

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.520
MARCUS COLLINS: So Farmland,
they're a pork manufacturer.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.630
They sale bacon,
awesome, delicious bacon.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.390
Now you look at a pork
manufacturer like Farmland,

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.670
you say, well, there's
nothing cool about Farmland.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.610
So if you saw Farmland
and Supreme together,

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.940
they have no
interaction whatsoever.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.090
A high piece like Supreme
and a pork manufacturer

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.929
like Farmland, like
we don't know about,

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:05.220
what would they have in common?

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.820
Probably like I don't know.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.720
So the question becomes,
then, what do you do?

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.000
Or what could be done?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.770
Typically nothing until a brand
likes Supreme jacks your logo.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.280
So Supreme, notorious for
taking other people's IP

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.560
and conquesting
it for their own,

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.330
they took the logo
of our clients.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.080
And we saw this, like
what are they doing.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.770
This is illegal,
you can't do this.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.729
But Supreme felt like
they can, because they're

00:26:33.729 --> 00:26:35.436
going to do whatever
they're going to do.

00:26:35.436 --> 00:26:37.440
And in those cases,
you have three choices.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.890
You can either litigate.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.640
That is, you give them
a cease and desist.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.931
You could just ignore it,
which is what most people do,

00:26:42.931 --> 00:26:44.980
because Supreme doesn't care.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.872
Or a third, you can join in.

00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:49.080
That's what we decided to do.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.788
I'll let the guys from
StockX explain it.

00:26:50.788 --> 00:26:53.560
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.210
- If imitation is the
highest form of flattery,

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.890
then Supreme is truly
a world class kiss ass.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.680
The legendary streetwear
company has a long history

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.480
of borrowing designs
from other brands.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.210
And last week, they added
another instant classic

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.140
to their legacy.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.260
The Week 1 Horizon hats
dropped without much fanfare

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.910
despite bearing a striking
resemblance to the Farmland

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.620
Foods logo, a Missouri
based pork producer,

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.520
probably be least
HYPEBEAST company on Earth.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.310
That was until Friday when
the agro business giant

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.710
took to Twitter and called out
the apparent forgery causing

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.060
Horizon Hat prices
to immediately pop.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:35.900
The hats went from $70 before
the tweet to as much as $100

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.720
after, a 40% increase overnight.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.850
Proving once again
that streetwear

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:45.160
loves a scandal and controversy
is the cousin of hype.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.315
Turning now to the weekend.

00:27:46.315 --> 00:27:46.898
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:50.210
So we saw them jack our logo
and we responded in a tweet.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.430
And I guess, somewhat
surprisingly, Twitter

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.960
went crazy.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.946
They were like yo.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:58.850
Lots of energy.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:59.930
Lots of excitement.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.250
But we didn't stop there.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.435
Because we knew
that Supreme's going

00:28:03.435 --> 00:28:05.300
to do another drop
the following week,

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.220
we decided to do our own drop.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.200
That is, Farmland opened
up an Instagram handle.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.360
And we created a look book
where we donned our farmers

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.877
in Instagram.

00:28:17.877 --> 00:28:19.520
So our farmers are
out there doing

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:25.490
what they do and, decked
out in Supreme gear.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:30.400
Or as the trades would say,
we out-Supremed Supreme.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.170
This got picked up in "Culture,"
got picked up in the trades.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.700
It got picked up in HYPEBEAST.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.510
Just amazing, amazing stuff.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.735
This is considered one of the
best creative activations that

00:28:39.735 --> 00:28:41.700
was done in the
last couple months.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.060
But this is really
where it's at.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.740
How do we find what we
know of human behavior,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.580
we know of the evolving
media landscape,

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.660
what we know of culture
to connect with people

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.500
in a real meaningful way?

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.680
I think about my
job, ultimately,

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.750
is to translate
culture for brands.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.730
And then translate brands
for the culture in such a way

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.041
that they connect in
real meaningful ways.

00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:05.540
And luckily, I have
a chance do that

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.665
with some of the biggest
brands in the world, which

00:29:07.665 --> 00:29:08.480
has been awesome.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.650
Now, that's me.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.690
But why does that
matter for you?

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.670
I'll tell you why
that matters for you.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:17.120
Because culture allows us to
get much closer to humanity,

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.524
to connect with people in
a really meaningful way.

00:29:20.524 --> 00:29:22.690
And what the literature is
showing us more and more,

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:25.220
the research is demonstrating,
that people care less

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.350
about the product
benefits, they care more

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.780
about emotional connections.

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.700
Our ability to
connect with humanity

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.830
matters more than
how sharp our razor

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.350
is, how long our battery
lasts, how much body

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.180
is in our shampoo.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.750
People care about
human connections.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.740
And it also drives the cash
register, which is pretty good.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.420
But it should also matter
to you individually as well.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.730
I'll tell you why.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.120
You know, especially
for people who

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.530
are just starting
in their career

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:57.900
or are neophytes in their
career trying to figure it out,

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.930
we're constantly trying to
find a way to up our game.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.840
What's our strategic
advantage at work

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.100
so I can rise up the ranks,
so I can be more successful?

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.230
And I would argue that
understanding culture

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.210
is a really powerful
way to do that.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.495
Because I know you're
surprised, but I used

00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:16.650
to get it in back in the day.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.110
The boy, used-- to
I used to get it in.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.990
I was a songwriter for a living.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.010
I released music.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.910
That's why did.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:23.900
I used to perform.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.840
I opened up for 112,
Jagged Edge, Keyshia Cole,

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.580
but like those
days are behind me.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.950
I have a 3 and 1/2
year old, turning four,

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.970
turning 14 it seems like.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:37.617
I and my wife and my daughter,
we live on a cul-de-sac.

00:30:37.617 --> 00:30:39.200
And sometimes we
wear matching outfits

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.120
to get $4 off our sandwiches.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.610
That's where we
are in life, right?

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.318
I got to work really,
really, really hard

00:30:44.318 --> 00:30:45.770
to be a part of the culture.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.296
But for a lot of
you, especially you

00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:49.170
all who now about Kodak
and you did the thing

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.780
about "Bodak Yellow," a lot of
you are close to the culture.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.430
And that becomes
your superpower.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.400
That becomes your differentiator
as you think about your career.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.660
How do you succeed in
the world of marketing?

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.787
You leverage culture.

00:31:01.787 --> 00:31:04.370
Because brands who lead culture
are more successful than those

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.090
who follow.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:07.667
You have that power
right now, especially

00:31:07.667 --> 00:31:08.750
those who are close to it.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.430
You know it, but
you're not using it.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.130
It's like this guy.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.510
You have all the tools
available to you,

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.930
but you're not using them.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.720
If you're close to the
culture, stay close.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.720
Stay close to the
culture and stay curious.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.220
This will be the differentiator
that helps your brands succeed

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.005
by pushing, contributing
to the culture,

00:31:33.005 --> 00:31:34.214
and pushing you forward.

00:31:34.214 --> 00:31:35.130
Hope this was helpful.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.004
Thanks so much, guys.

00:31:36.004 --> 00:31:38.921
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:41.994 --> 00:31:43.160
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.076
I always tried to get
into your class at Ross,

00:31:45.076 --> 00:31:47.920
but I never had enough bitcoins.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.000
Great talk.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.160
I'm curious if you can give
any examples of brands trying

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.860
to be the culture setter, but
then it ends up backfiring

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.027
and it's worse.

00:31:57.027 --> 00:31:58.860
MARCUS COLLINS: I mean,
unfortunately, there

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.250
are more examples of that
than there are good examples.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.590
I guess probably the most
ubiquitous one I can think of

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.049
is Pepsi trying to tap
into a cultural moment.

00:32:08.049 --> 00:32:09.590
And they didn't make
it about people,

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.110
they made it about them.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.000
And it turned into a meme
that was piled on their face.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.500
Right?

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.310
And really, the issue there
is that those people at Pepsi,

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.610
they weren't dumb.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:22.630
Really smart people people,
MBAs from great schools, right?

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:23.710
Smart people.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.490
And it wasn't that they were
dumb or completely oblivious,

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.280
they just weren't
close to the culture.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.480
They didn't understand the
shared beliefs, the artifacts,

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.770
the social norms, the
unwritten rules, the language

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:34.860
that they use.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.230
And it's the lack of
understanding the nuances that

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:39.445
get you out of step.

00:32:39.445 --> 00:32:41.290
If you don't
understand the nuances,

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.060
that's when you play yourself.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.460
So the idea is to stay
very, very, very, very

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.960
close to the culture.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.390
If oftentimes requires you
being a part of the culture as

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.320
opposed to being a tourist.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.110
Back in the day we used to
call the ethnographic studies,

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.200
like getting way, way in.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.960
AUDIENCE: Marcus, I think I
saw an example like a week ago

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.550
of something you're
talking about with Wendy's.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.960
Did you see the tweet
that Wendy's sent out

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.350
where they were kind of
dogging the Nebraska coach?

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.390
His name is Frost.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.730
And they said you have a frosty.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.770
Michigan was beating
them by 40-0 at halftime.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.600
And they put out a
tweet during halftime.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.200
And next thing you
know, it's going viral.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.570
I see it on the actual news.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:25.070
I see it on ESPN and, you know--

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.310
and some Nebraska fans were
not happy because they said,

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.860
we eat at Wendy's too.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.850
And Wendy's on their
official Twitter handle said,

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.530
we're pretty sure
that Nebraskans

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.742
have a sense of humor.

00:33:37.742 --> 00:33:39.075
Some of them were still unhappy.

00:33:39.075 --> 00:33:41.860
And they said, well, we may
start carrying pacifiers.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.971
This goes crazy again.

00:33:43.971 --> 00:33:44.470
Wow.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:47.200
They're not talking about their
food, but then all of a sudden,

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.574
a lot of people are going I'm
going to go eat at Wendy's.

00:33:49.574 --> 00:33:52.270
I just love that they've got
the courage to kind of get out

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.915
there and cause some trouble.

00:33:53.915 --> 00:33:55.540
MARCUS COLLINS: Yeah,
I think Wendy's--

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.623
without being very, very
close to their business--

00:33:57.623 --> 00:34:01.150
I think Wendy's figure they're
number three in this space?

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.310
Why not throw some shots?

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.570
And there entire
strategy at this point

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.120
is pretty much about
controlling everybody else.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.170
It was control.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:09.920
And you know what?

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.090
If feelings get hurt,
come on, laugh it off.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.400
Considering this is a
part of their ethos now,

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.310
people don't-- maybe unless
you're from Nebraska--

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.192
people have pretty
thick skin when

00:34:20.192 --> 00:34:21.880
it comes to that sort of thing.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.449
But they are hugging all the
right nuances of the culture

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.239
they're a part of.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.850
And we see things getting
shared or going viral,

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.460
because people who believe the
same thing that Wendy's does,

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.969
their take on things,
people will share it also.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:33.489
Right?

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.080
It's all about community.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.330
Community is another way of
talking about the cultures

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.880
that we're a part of.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.630
AUDIENCE: You see a lot of
hype around like YouTube

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.090
collaborations,
Instagram collaborations,

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.429
these kind of integrations
that brands are trying to do.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:52.600
I'd be curious to hear your
thoughts on that and whether

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.270
that's actually getting
close to culture

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.774
or if it's sort of counter.

00:34:56.774 --> 00:34:58.940
MARCUS COLLINS: So are you
talking about like as far

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.024
as taking advantage of
a platform to do things?

00:35:01.024 --> 00:35:01.690
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.889
Or more like the collaboration
with the creators

00:35:04.889 --> 00:35:05.680
of those platforms.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.596
MARCUS COLLINS: Right.

00:35:06.596 --> 00:35:07.296
So I'd say this.

00:35:07.296 --> 00:35:09.420
When we think about the
technology, the technology,

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.150
the zeros and ones, if you
will, the zeros and ones

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.080
are the facilitator of networks.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.720
Right?

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.345
Things that would
normally be disparate

00:35:18.345 --> 00:35:22.000
are now connecting things to
data that goes from one node

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.530
to the next.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.310
So rules of the road,
same sort of thing.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.299
And what we find when
we extrapolate that--

00:35:28.299 --> 00:35:30.340
and I'm only talking about
the network of things,

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.910
the network of
people and things--

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.550
was once a network
of people and people.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.270
And things like
Instagram, Facebook,

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:38.710
those social
networking platforms

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.162
are connecting people who
see the world similarly, who

00:35:41.162 --> 00:35:42.370
are homophilically connected.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.935
That is, they share the
same beliefs, social norms,

00:35:44.935 --> 00:35:46.850
unwritten rules and rituals.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.320
So then when brands partner
with platforms, technologies,

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.290
who understand the dynamics
of the network, dynamics

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:57.137
of the culture, they
borrow the proxy.

00:35:57.137 --> 00:35:59.470
They borrow people who know
the culture better than they

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.240
do to get them closer to it.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.010
That's massively powerful.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.870
The idea, though, is
that it's always going

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.220
to be an outsource skills.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.400
It's not in the
capability of the brand.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.720
Capability is about
repeatability and reliability.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.550
If I have to outsource
that, then I really

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.820
don't have it, which
is good, because they

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.030
get a couple at bats to
do something powerful.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:21.310
But it's a challenge for
them, because it's not really

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.630
inside the ethos of what
the brand is all about.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.276
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:36:24.276 --> 00:36:26.275
AUDIENCE: So if you're
not a part of the culture

00:36:26.275 --> 00:36:28.750
that you're trying
to get close to it,

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:31.870
you can run
ethnographic studies.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:35.430
Are there tools that
are available to us?

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.850
I mean I'm actually thinking
of an advertising group

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:41.170
that I work with who
does aftermarket auto.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:45.330
So it's exact opposite gender,
exact different age range,

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.730
different lifestyle entirely.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.230
And I want to get to know them
a little bit more intimately.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.965
So do have ideas for
tools we can tap into?

00:36:51.965 --> 00:36:53.090
MARCUS COLLINS: I know one.

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:53.881
It's called Google.

00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:55.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.297
The thing is this that--

00:36:57.297 --> 00:36:59.130
which is why it's so
important to understand

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.860
the evolving media landscape--

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:05.710
social listening, search
behavior, viewership behavior.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:06.540
We get a sense.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.080
It's a proxy to what people
do, what they believe,

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:10.680
where they go.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.270
They talk about
what they believe.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.380
We know what they wear.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.550
We know the artifacts
they don because there

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.570
are pictures of them.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.610
These things provide a
proxy that we normally

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.830
would have to go live
with the coal miners

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.360
to know what coal miners do.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.790
Instead, we can see
them from a distance

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.810
in a short sort of burst,
but a large representation

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.540
of the population that we
can pull a sample [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.621
and say this is a real thing.

00:37:32.621 --> 00:37:33.120
Right?

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.190
And it's not really
defined by demography.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.750
It's not defined by
psychographics either.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.300
It's defined by
the beliefs that we

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.460
hold, the behaviors
we subscribe to,

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.940
and the language that we use.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.140
In tech, like search,
like social listening,

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.730
those things
provide a bird's eye

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:49.470
view we normally
wouldn't have access

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.300
to without a ton of resources.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.770
I rely on my--

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.700
my Excalibur of sorts is Google
Trends and Crimson Hexagon.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.810
I use it for everything to
better understand people.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.622
I have clients across
a wide spectrum

00:38:03.622 --> 00:38:06.080
who are going after different
cultures, different networks.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.730
It sort of requires me be able
to code switch between them.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.160
And I can't do all that.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.380
I can't be that
close to all of them.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.300
So I can either
use people who work

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.845
at the agency who are
close to the culture or I

00:38:17.845 --> 00:38:20.791
use some proxy via
technologies available.

00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:22.540
AUDIENCE: With the
social listening tools,

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.500
I assume those are like
paid subscriptions.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.260
So I'm more thinking we know
the wealth of Google tools

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.656
that we have at our
disposal, are there

00:38:30.656 --> 00:38:31.822
free social listening tools?

00:38:31.822 --> 00:38:32.340
MARCUS COLLINS: Absolutely.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.449
Twitter Bandsearch.

00:38:33.449 --> 00:38:33.990
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.260
Cool.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.550
MARCUS COLLINS: Super free.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:39.665
It's not as robust as using
Crimson or Google Suite

00:38:39.665 --> 00:38:41.490
or something like
that, but it's free.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.430
It gives you a nice down and
dirty look at what's going on.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:47.130
Super representative
of a sample of people.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:47.910
Absolutely.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:48.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:49.324
MARCUS COLLINS: Yeah.

00:38:49.324 --> 00:38:50.408
AUDIENCE: My question is--

00:38:50.408 --> 00:38:52.865
I know a lot of people have
seen like the Nike "Just Do It"

00:38:52.865 --> 00:38:53.940
campaign, for example.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.730
And so I guess my question
is when making a decision

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:01.050
to launch a campaign like that,
it might be considered-- well,

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:02.940
might not be considered,
some would consider

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.830
it to be culturally polarizing.

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.760
MARCUS COLLINS: Sure.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.560
AUDIENCE: How does
a company make--

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.630
what decision making
goes into that.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.130
MARCUS COLLINS: So
I think it really

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.420
boils down to conviction.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.430
What do you believe?

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.561
Simon Sinek would
say why do you exist?

00:39:18.561 --> 00:39:20.810
People don't buy what you
did, they buy why you do it.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:21.309
Right?

00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:22.910
What do you believe?

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:24.870
And I think the biggest
opportunity for brands

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:26.970
are to tap into
networks who share

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:28.362
the same belief as the brand.

00:39:28.362 --> 00:39:29.820
Because those are
the brands we use

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.070
to communicate this is who I
am, this is how I see the world.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.810
And conviction by
its very essence

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:38.436
requires saying no to things.

00:39:38.436 --> 00:39:39.810
It required doing
things that may

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.226
be divisive to people who don't
see the world the way you do.

00:39:43.226 --> 00:39:44.850
And the fact that
Nike was like, no, we

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:48.310
stand with Kaepernick because
he aligns to our belief system.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.000
And if you don't rock with that,
then you don't rock with us.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.230
And those people who
were burning their Nikes

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:54.771
and saying I'm never going to
buy another pair Nike's, you're

00:39:54.771 --> 00:39:57.220
going to die Nike,
your company sucks.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.714
Well, the people
who believed what

00:39:59.714 --> 00:40:02.130
Nike believes or would stand
with Kaepernick as well, what

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:03.030
did they say?

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.540
Give me two pair.

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.040
Right?

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.539
I want more.

00:40:05.539 --> 00:40:07.950
I'm going to buy more,
because this thing is

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:09.420
a representation of our belief.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:16.530
So it's difficult. It is a
simple idea, but it's not easy.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:20.100
And we often confuse
simplicity and ease.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.500
Like losing weight
is a simple idea.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.905
Don't eat so much and move more.

00:40:23.905 --> 00:40:25.690
Pretty simple.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.200
And it ain't easy.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.070
Right?

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.586
And the same thing goes
with convictions for brands.

00:40:30.586 --> 00:40:31.710
What do you really believe?

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:33.600
If you believe that, will
you stand up for that

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.090
when everyone else
is sitting down?

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:37.590
When everyone else is against
you, will you stand up for it?

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:39.840
That is what conviction
is all about.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.920
And the brands who have very
clear and salient convictions

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.420
not only do people know what
they believe and therefore they

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.420
use those brands, but all their
actions, their communications,

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.565
the people that they hire, those
people come towards the brand.

00:40:53.565 --> 00:40:55.690
That's the idea that brands
should have the vision,

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.356
not just what they
communicate, but also

00:40:57.356 --> 00:40:58.770
within the organization.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.770
So that people who are a part of
the organization, they believe.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.330
And they, too,
preach the gospel.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.210
And they too are
demonstrably representations

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.925
of the brand's conviction.

00:41:08.925 --> 00:41:11.520
AUDIENCE: What happens if a
company does have conviction

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:16.090
but then people start
doing it as appropriation?

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:20.010
MARCUS COLLINS: This is about
the nuances of the culture.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.390
It's a hard one to say.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:25.894
When we pay mind to the nuances,
we feel like it's a real thing.

00:41:25.894 --> 00:41:27.685
If you don't know the
nuances, when someone

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.000
is saying they're just
appropriating, like,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.359
no you don't understand.

00:41:30.359 --> 00:41:32.400
Because the brand has
always been a part of this,

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.358
here are all the
demonstrative representations,

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:36.780
the evidence that shows this
brand's always been this way.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.471
So them doing this
is nothing new.

00:41:39.471 --> 00:41:41.970
It's just right in line with
what they've always been about.

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:43.599
But you got to be about it.

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:44.390
What did Diddy say?

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.720
Don't talk about, be about it.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.590
Right?

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.837
Same thing.

00:41:48.837 --> 00:41:49.420
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.253
MARCUS COLLINS: Hey.

00:41:50.253 --> 00:41:53.300
AUDIENCE: So I'm really big
on like influencer marketing.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.630
So I've known in the past
sophomore year when BeyoncÃ©

00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:00.500
dropped to her little media
formation and she mentioned Red

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.390
Lobster.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.560
And after that, like
sales increased.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.300
And people were
going to Red Lobster.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.270
And then just like last
week, Kylie Jenner,

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:12.270
she'd been on her Snapchat, she
had milk for the first time.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:16.520
A lot of milk brands
were sending her milk.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.520
And she's just like posting
like all these things.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.210
So my question is is should
companies or brands continue

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:27.530
to ride that wave and use
that celebrity or influencer

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.170
to promote their brands?

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:32.540
Or should they try to
tap into other influencer

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.290
in other cultures?

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.956
MARCUS COLLINS: So
I'll start with this.

00:42:34.956 --> 00:42:36.950
I'll answer your question
with a step back.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.210
And then we'll step into it.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.870
So first, is like unpacking
this idea of influencers.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.200
So when we think of like the
Kylie Jenners, the BeyoncÃ©s,

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.420
the Kanyes of the
world as influencers.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.031
And they have influence.

00:42:49.031 --> 00:42:51.030
But the literature will
describe their influence

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.464
as ideological influence.

00:42:52.464 --> 00:42:53.630
That is, we look up to that.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.280
We aspire to that.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.450
But we don't compare
ourselves to it.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:01.130
Like we don't hear Kanye
West talking about wearing--

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.200
in his Bentley, and then
we get in our Toyota,

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.130
like I suck at life.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.870
He has so much money, look at
our paycheck and I hate myself.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:08.660
We don't do that.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.076
We compare ourselves
to people who

00:43:10.076 --> 00:43:12.560
are like us, people who are
part of the same network we

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.300
are a part of, our peers.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.410
So when I think about
influencers at that level,

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.590
they're basically
contextualized media.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.360
They're bright wattage media.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:28.640
But their media isn't what
makes behaviors stick.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.220
It's your people which
makes behaviors stick.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.090
One would say that
culture moves forward

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:34.590
on the basis of one
simple question,

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.298
do people like me do
something like this.

00:43:36.298 --> 00:43:37.550
If the answer is yes, I do it.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:38.780
If the answer is no, I don't.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.880
And we make that decision
hundreds of times a day.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.990
People like me do
something like this.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:45.410
So say, I see Jay-Z
wear a super cool hat.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:46.540
I'm like that's dope.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.870
I got shoes that match it.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:48.960
I'm buying that hat.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.460
Right?

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.600
I go buy the hat.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.220
And I go to lunch
with my friends.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.060
And sit at lunch and they're
like what are you wearing?

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.060
Like do you like my hat?

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.809
You look like an idiot,
take that hat off.

00:43:57.809 --> 00:43:58.731
What am I going to do?

00:43:58.731 --> 00:43:59.730
I'm taking that hat off.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:00.860
And I put it in the closet.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.470
It has never seen
the light of day.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.970
Right?

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.990
Our people are what
makes the thing stick.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.430
Because our people,
are the people

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.007
that we want to be connected to.

00:44:09.007 --> 00:44:11.340
As Aristotle was saying, we're
social animals by nature,

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.798
so do everything
you can to connect

00:44:12.798 --> 00:44:15.165
people who are just like us.

00:44:15.165 --> 00:44:19.140
We ascribe to the same beliefs,
same social norms, same rules,

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.560
and we use the same language.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.380
Right?

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.300
So I think about how we leverage
influence in this way, well,

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.170
we leverage the media that
they provide for sure.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:28.670
Right?

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.010
But we have to make sure that
there is some concurrence.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.930
That is, there's a lot
of visibility of people

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:34.880
like me doing that thing.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:35.660
Right?

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:39.170
Like BeyoncÃ© says, when he
does me good, I take his--

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.970
to Red Lobster.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:40.656
Right?

00:44:40.656 --> 00:44:42.780
And it wasn't till people
were me too, girl, homey,

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.360
you better take
me to Red Lobster.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:44.870
Right?

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.852
That people like me do
this and there like,

00:44:46.852 --> 00:44:48.310
yeah, I'm going to
do this as well.

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.120
And it creates the
cultural weight

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.410
that allows it to propagate
across the network.

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.420
So the short answer is,
yes, absolutely, as long

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.707
as it aligns to what
the brand is all about.

00:44:58.707 --> 00:45:00.290
But what's most
important is how do we

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.960
get it to propagate
across the social web

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.270
to these networks of
people, these communities,

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:07.100
so that the behaviors stick?

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.620
There's a difference between
going viral and being

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.164
culturally contagious.

00:45:11.164 --> 00:45:13.580
They didn't just spread person
to person and kind of peter

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.090
out.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:15.520
But it spreads from
person to person

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.144
and takes hold of
the culture impacting

00:45:17.144 --> 00:45:20.200
our beliefs, behaviors,
artifacts, and language.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.867
Which we'll do in my
doctoral research.

00:45:21.867 --> 00:45:22.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.510
MARCUS COLLINS: Yeah.

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:25.968
AUDIENCE: Marcus, you work with
some very respected brands.

00:45:25.968 --> 00:45:28.500
I'm curious what is
your main criteria

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.690
before you decide to say yes
or no to a client or a project?

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:34.580
MARCUS COLLINS: So I
don't make the call.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.170
Essentially, it's
the scope of work

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.160
that the agency
says is deemable.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.670
But for me to work
on the projects,

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.503
there are things that
come into the building

00:45:42.503 --> 00:45:44.760
that my teammates touch
that I don't touch.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.760
And I'm fortunately, I'm
in a place in my career

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.190
where I can say, no, I'm not
going to touch those things.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:50.390
I try to stay away--

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:53.870
I don't do any tobacco at all.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:56.300
And I try to stay
away from alcohol,

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.070
particularly because
I don't consume it.

00:45:58.070 --> 00:45:58.569
Right?

00:45:58.569 --> 00:46:01.520
And I work with McDonald's
as one of my clients.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.020
It was in the building.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:07.830
While some may have issue
with McDonald's, I don't.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:08.960
Right?

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.280
But I worked on Anheuser-Busch
for years, for four years,

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.600
and I've never tasted
the product at all.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.270
And at that time,
I couldn't say no.

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.103
Where I was in my career,
I couldn't say no.

00:46:19.103 --> 00:46:20.360
Today, I'd say no thank you.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.818
Just because it
doesn't subscribe--

00:46:21.818 --> 00:46:23.410
it doesn't align to my beliefs.

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.460
It doesn't align to
what I like to do.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:28.580
And me, it'd be hard for me to
sleep at night telling people

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.990
to consume more and consume
more and consume more.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.940
Tobacco I'm completely against.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.830
And therefore, I won't
even touch the stuff.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:37.304
But again, it's just me.

00:46:37.304 --> 00:46:39.470
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about what you've done--

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.886
when you've been a part of the
brands and their competitor

00:46:41.886 --> 00:46:42.960
has totally crushed it.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.120
Like you're working
Miller and PBR sales

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.480
are completely skyrocketing.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.090
Is the move usually to
ride on their success

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:53.690
or take the complete
opposite stance?

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:56.820
MARCUS COLLINS: I think it
depends on where the brand is.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.940
So if you're the market leader,
and these guys are skyrocketing

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.400
up, you don't want
to put the spotlight

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.970
on those guys in most cases.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.320
It's kind of like that's the--

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:12.015
that would be the
conventional wisdom.

00:47:12.015 --> 00:47:14.140
I think about it like
remember when Drake and Pusha

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.961
T were beefing out this summer?

00:47:15.961 --> 00:47:16.460
Right?

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.480
Drake is like here.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.780
Pusha T is not as high
as far as the claim.

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.120
Pusha T throws jabs at Drake.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:23.960
Drake responds.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.770
And Pusha T's
record sales go up.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.770
So a lot of times when
you're the market leader,

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.480
your job is just
to save the market.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.480
Your job is to grow the
market, grow the category.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.631
Someone throw shots at you
or someone's rising up,

00:47:34.631 --> 00:47:37.130
just make sure that you keep
the category growing until they

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.140
become too close to call.

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:42.320
In those cases, you find
ways to lower that, sometimes

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.630
acquisition.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:47.294
And then sometimes it's
finding ways to block them.

00:47:47.294 --> 00:47:49.460
AUDIENCE: Have you been a
part of the brand strategy

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.670
that has successfully combating
a major spike in a competitor.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:55.280
MARCUS COLLINS: I
would State Farm.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.740
So State Farm, they are
the market leader by far.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.570
But you see a lot of
market share being acquired

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:06.230
by, particularly, the GEICOs
of the world, Esurance,

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:07.620
Progressive, and Allstate.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.940
So State Farm's like how do
you keep the category growing,

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:16.700
which the category is
sort of self moving,

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.750
because it's obligatory.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:19.291
If you want to drive
in this country,

00:48:19.291 --> 00:48:20.330
you need auto insurance.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:20.570
Right?

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:22.625
But how do you get people to
get home owner's insurance

00:48:22.625 --> 00:48:23.450
and get it with us?

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:25.957
Get financial services
and get it with us

00:48:25.957 --> 00:48:28.040
while these other guys are
coming into the market?

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.210
So we found ways to use culture
to continue to boost the brand

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:35.310
and broaden the aperture
of the category,

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:37.850
particularly doing the Cliff
Paul campaign for State Farm.

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:38.679
Right?

00:48:38.679 --> 00:48:40.220
So instead of talking
about how we're

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.980
better than All State, how
we're better than GEICO,

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.520
we just talked about how great
State Farm is at helping you.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.020
With a magical agent "Like a
neighbor, State Farm is there,"

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.030
agent shows up.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:53.130
Or personified what happens when
you have an agent with someone

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:53.880
like Cliff Paul.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.380
Right?

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:54.890
Chris Paul.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:56.450
All-Star State Farm--

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:59.870
All-Star point guard and
throws assists on the court.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.450
Cliff Paul, All-Star
State Farm agent

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.380
throws an assists to real life.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.540
All these things
to manifest what

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:08.807
the brand is all about so that
we can grow gross presence.

00:49:08.807 --> 00:49:09.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.764
MARCUS COLLINS: You got it.

00:49:10.764 --> 00:49:14.090
AUDIENCE: So I'm kind of
interested in the brainstorming

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.530
and then zeroing in on what
we're going to do process.

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.750
I love the example of Potbelly's
that you just talked about.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.079
And you're gathering data.

00:49:23.079 --> 00:49:25.120
You're trying to understand
what the brand really

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.800
wants to go for, not just
sandwiches, but happiness.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.480
But what does
brainstorming look like?

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.160
And then how do
you say, OK, this

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.070
is what we're going to go for.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:33.180
Because sometimes I
watch a commercial,

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.610
I'm like I can't imagine
someone in a room being like,

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:37.870
OK, this what we're
going to go with.

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:40.370
So I was wondering what it looks
like to brainstorm and then

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:42.620
make that decision on, OK, what
we're going to move forward.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.745
MARCUS COLLINS: So for me,
it's radical simplicity.

00:49:44.745 --> 00:49:47.534
Just radical, radical,
radical simplicity.

00:49:47.534 --> 00:49:49.700
So first question I ask is
why does the brand exist?

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.970
What do we believe is a brand?

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:51.970
How do we see the world?

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:52.906
Because the way we see
the world causes how

00:49:52.906 --> 00:49:54.156
I'm going to behave the world.

00:49:54.156 --> 00:49:55.940
So what do we believe?

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.980
And once you realize
what the why is,

00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.930
what the conviction
of the brand is, now

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.700
we know who to target-- people
who see the world the way

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.300
we do.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:02.800
Right?

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.260
So now we know who we are
and who we're going after.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.376
The next question is what
do we want them to do?

00:50:09.376 --> 00:50:11.000
Because marketing is
one of those words

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.060
that we use full of jargon
and abstractions, buzz words,

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:15.560
right?

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.760
Like what is marketing?

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.950
Asked 10 people, get
20 different answers.

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:21.110
So I think about
marketing as radically

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:23.179
simplistic as possible.

00:50:23.179 --> 00:50:25.220
Oh, and the "Oxford
Dictionary" defines marketing

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.540
as going to market.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.780
Marketing is going to market,
the market being people.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.445
What is the core
function of marketing?

00:50:31.445 --> 00:50:33.540
Get people to adopt behavior.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.700
So we know what we're
all about as a brand.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.010
We know who we're going after.

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.500
Now the question is what
do we want people to do?

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.040
And all the messages,
communications, campaigns,

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.530
products, activations,
they're all

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:48.320
designed to get people to move.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.324
As simple as possible.

00:50:49.324 --> 00:50:51.740
All the other things that we
build on it, the implications

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.630
and what not, we could
get into, but it all

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.086
starts with who
are we, who we're

00:50:55.086 --> 00:50:57.210
going after, what behavior
we want them to take on.

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:57.693
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:50:57.693 --> 00:50:58.193
Thanks.

00:50:58.193 --> 00:50:59.655
MARCUS COLLINS: My pleasure.

00:50:59.655 --> 00:51:00.530
Thanks so much, guys.

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:03.580
[APPLAUSE]
