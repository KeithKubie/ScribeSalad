00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.000
As Francis Scott Key sat aboard a ship, now
officially a prisoner of war, he could only

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.500
watch as the British bombarded American forces
at Fort McHenry.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.430
He had been sent to the British ship HMS Tonnant,
along with John Stuart Skinner, by President

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.650
James Madison himself to negotiate the release
of prisoners of war.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.820
After dining with British officers, it became
painstakingly clear to both Key and Skinner

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.030
that neither they, nor the POWs they came
to rescue, were going to make it back to the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.410
American side anytime soon.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.159
The British were planning an attack on Fort
McHenry and they did not want their visitors

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.620
to report back to the enemy their position
or strength.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.400
The British allowed the Americans to return
to their ship, but under guard, and Key was

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.190
confided to a small cabin.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.640
Key watched the battle rage and “in dawn’s
early light,” he saw victory…

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.949
America’s flag was still there.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.540
It was then that he put pen to paper and wrote
much of the poem that would become the “Star

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.080
Spangled Banner,” finishing the rest at
the Indian Queen Hotel after being released.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.760
Key titled the poem “The Defense of Fort
McHenry,” and showed it to his brother-in-law,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.720
a commander at Fort McHenry.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.460
He thought it fit perfectly with the medley
of a popular drinking song of the time, “The

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.460
Anacreontic Song.”

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.900
The poem, with the new medley, was distributed
to troops and appeared in the newspaper The

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.860
Baltimore Patriot and shortly thereafter was
re-titled the “Star Spangled Banner” by

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.500
Thomas Carr who started selling the lyrics
and sheet music for the song in his shop in

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Baltimore.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.920
Soon, it was printed in newspapers across
the country, establishing its status as a

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.200
wartime anthem.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.690
The song continued to gain popularity, often
being played at parades and Independence Day

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.690
celebrations.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.390
In 1889, the Secretary of the Navy Benjamin
J. Tracy signed General Order #374, declaring

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.890
it the official song to be played whenever
the flag was raised.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.979
In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered
the “Star-Spangled Banner” be delivered

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.960
during all military processions and occasions.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.960
In the fall of 1918, America was in the depths
of wartime – this time, World War I.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.330
World War I had begun four years earlier and
after the bloody violent struggle, it finally

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.780
seemed that America (and it’s allies) would
be victorious.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.670
Patriotism during this time was at an all-time
high.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.170
Major sporting events particularly became
venues for public displays of patriotism and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.340
unity, as they still are to some extent today.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.310
The Star-Spangled Banner had been played during
sporting events dating all the way back to

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.510
the late 1800s, but the song cemented itself
in the sporting world during the fall classic

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.600
of America’s pastime… the 1918 World Series.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.560
The 1918 World Series was significant for
a number of reasons.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.849
It featured a matchup between the Chicago
Cubs and the Boston Red Sox, two of the best

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:46.849
teams of the era.

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.420
Of course, after this World Series, neither
of these teams would win a World Series for

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.599
a combined 181 years.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.790
The Red Sox had a star pitcher on their roster
by the name of Babe Ruth, who, of course,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.260
turned out to be a better hitter than pitcher,
which was saying something given his pitching

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.260
skills.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.580
The war had forced the government to draft
ball players into service during the summer

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.270
and, under the “Work or Fight” order,
baseball was told to end their season prior

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.270
to Labor Day.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.440
Therefore, the 1918 World Series became the
first (and to this day, only) to be played

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.830
entirely in September.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.110
In addition, a bomb – the act of the anti-capitalist
union “Industrial Workers of the World”

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.880
— had blown up the Chicago Federal Building
only days earlier, killing four and injuring

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880
thirty.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.700
Game one of the series was played in Chicago.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.170
Some fans, due to fear and solemnness over
the bombing, stayed away from the ballpark.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.840
Only 19,000 of the available 30,000 seats
were filled.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.250
The ballpark was decked out in red, white,
and blue, the Cubs’ brass trying everything

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.440
to make fans forget the violence of war, both
here and abroad.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.270
As Babe Ruth pitched a masterpiece against
their Cubbies, fans remained silent and subdued

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.440
in their seats.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.120
With the Sox leading one to nothing going
into the bottom of the seventh inning, Chicago’s

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.490
ownership had arranged for a military band
to play the Star-Spangled Banner during the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.810
seventh inning stretch.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.520
As the first notes played, fans began to hum
and, then, sing along.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.569
Red Sox third baseman Fred Thomas, a Navy
man himself, stood silent and gave a military

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.070
salute, prompting other ballplayers to do
the same.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.280
Finally, the crowd came alive.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.750
A cheer erupted from the stands at the conclusion
of the song.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.210
The Cubs would lose the game, but the media
all wrote about how the fans excitement rose

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.010
with the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.150
First the song was taken up by a few, then
others joined, and when the final notes came,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.259
a great volume of melody rolled across the
field.

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.800
It was at the very end that the onlookers
exploded into thunderous applause and rent

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.770
the air with a cheer that marked the highest
point of the day’s enthusiasm.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.759
For the next two games in Chicago, the Cubs
management had the military band again play

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.740
the Star-Spangled Banner during the seventh
inning stretch.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.620
The crowds were delighted and fans began showing
up to the games, wanting to be part of the

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.620
patriotic display.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.020
The World Series moved to Boston and the Red
Sox brass, refusing to be outdone, moved the

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.550
Banner to before the game and used it to welcome
wounded veterans onto the the field who had

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.430
received free tickets to the game.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.199
With that, a sports tradition was born.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.759
The Red Sox would go on to the win the World
Series four games to two and would not be

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.839
victorious for another 86 years – until
2004.

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:24.740
In 1931, President Herbert Hoover signed a
law that declared that the Star-Spangled Banner

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.229
would forever also be known as the National
Anthem.

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.669
But it was the fall of 1918 that the Star-Spangled
Banner and America’s pastime became forever

00:05:33.669 --> 00:06:00.990
linked.
