Superman, Superman, does whatever Kryptonians
can. Spins a web, it is nice. Makes his list,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:24.880
checks it twice. Look out, here comes the
Superman. Look out, here comes the Superman.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.190
Dude, Superman does not spin webs. If you're
going to steal the Spider-man song, at least

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.920
don't steal some of the lyrics by accident
too. I mean, what does that song have to do

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.399
with the movie, after all? It's not even about
Man of Steel.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.760
I didn't say it was about the movie? I just
wrote a song about Superman. Five For Fighting

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.660
did it.
Well, Five For Fighting is a hugely successful

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.440
rock band and you are not. And also they're
hockey fans, which makes them cool.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.329
I'm a hockey fan!
Dude. You're a Predators fan. That's not hockey.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.280
You know, I know about half a million rednecks
that are gonna want to kick your ass for that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.470
comment.
Right, right after they get done kicking your

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.200
ass for calling them rednecks.
You know who probably has a red neck? Superman.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.870
What?!
Think about it. He spends all his time outdoors.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.080
And he's flying, so he's even closer to the
sun than we are. I bet his neck gets sunburned

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.979
like a motherf*cker.
Dude, I mean, he's Superman. Bullets bounce

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.780
off his chest, I don't think the UV rays are
going to hurt him. Come on.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.610
Well, someone obviously haven't seen Man Of
Steel.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.600
I saw it with you!
I thought that was the other you.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.300
He was there too.
Well anyway, I thought it was great.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.440
I'm not surprised toâ€”what? What did you
say?

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.080
Yeah, it was awesome. Dude, Superman action
has never been so freaking exhilarating.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.850
I...
Amy Adams is the perfect Lois Lane. She's

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.730
the best Lois Lane ever, apologies to Margot
Kidder, God rest her soul.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.540
She's still alive!
God can still rest her soul even if she's

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.630
still alive. Lord knows that woman has earned
a f*cking rest.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.989
I'm not really prepared for you to like a
movie this much. You don't like any movies.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.160
Well, now that's not true.
Yes it is.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.200
I like lots of movies.
Dude, what's not to like? Alright, I mean

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.420
Christopher Nolan was obviously a steady influence
on Zach Snyder. Russell Crowe was f*cking

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.450
born to play Jor-El, I mean, damn. And if
that's not enough, I have three words for

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.530
you: Kneel Before Zod. Michael Shannon f*cking
owns in this movie.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.319
I share a lot of these opinions and I am definitely,
definitely not okay with that. That is really

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.450
troubling me.
Well, if you really need to talk to somebody

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.030
about the movie who disagrees with you, why
don't you talk to the other you. He hates

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.540
everything.
No. He loves everything. He's like the opposite

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.650
of you. We're talking about a guy that gave
a standing ovation during the credits of Good

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.709
Day To Die Hard.
What a piece of sh*t.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.440
Yeah, that movie's just terrible.
No, I'm talking about the guy. What a piece

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.720
of sh*t he is for liking that movie.
I'm pretty sure if you polled the audience

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.830
they would say that you're a bigger piece
of shit than he is. I'm positive of that,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.190
actually.
Whatever. Do you want to sing my Superman

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.700
song with me or not?
No. No I do not. I don't.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.040
Dude, I mean, you have to. You owe me a song.
You lost a bet, remember?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.480
No, I don't remember because you roofied me
and then when I woke up you said that I lost

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.569
a bet and had to sing a song with you.
That is what happened! I even have it on tape.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:04:08.090
Here comes the superman.
Dude, what is he even doing here? Isn't this

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.709
like, a you a me thing?
You lost a bet.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.560
How many bets did I lose while I was uncon--
17

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.130
Dude, don't make me hurt you. I will kill
you.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.370
Don't threaten me. I mean, I do have the powers
of Superman.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.310
You don't have the powers of superman. If
anyone has the powers of superman, it's me.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:35.180
Right. I have them. I can prove it. I'll prove
it.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.320
Okay.
