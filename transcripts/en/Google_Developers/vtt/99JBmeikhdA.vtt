00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.500
A recommendation we give 
developers from MercadoLibre as friends

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500
of this event, is that they put all their efforts
into the execution and work capacity

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500
... persistence. Some times we think that an 
idea is everything. An idea, indeed, is important

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.000
however, 90%, specially in a startup, its execution. 
To be really persistent

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and work several hours to make something happen!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.500
Google gives you really interesting tools for developers

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Both, for mobile developers that can use the
Android suite, and for those into backend

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.000
with the cloud tools, from Google App Engine
to Prediction API or Big Query

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.500
what is really interesting is that Google gives
you free tools for small developer groups

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.800
That offers an excellent perspective for startups
that need to start with low costs, and world-class tools

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.500
The awesome thing we, developers in the region, have
is that we're used to scarcity

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.500
we're used to do things without the whole context
nor the elements that developers in the world have

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.200
that is a huge advantage when faced with
creating a new startup and to compete

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.500
because with very little, sometimes we do
what others won't even try

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.466
We invite everyone to participate in the event
I give the Developer Bus a plus one!
