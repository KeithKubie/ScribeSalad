00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.059
We are used to thinking very highly of democracy
– and by extension, of Ancient Athens, the

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.920
civilisation that gave rise to it. The Parthenon
has become almost a byword for democratic

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.500
values, which is why so many leaders of democracies
like to be photographed there.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.779
It’s therefore very striking to discover
that one of Ancient Greece’s great achievements,

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.140
Philosophy, was highly suspicious of its other
achievement, Democracy.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.570
The founding father of Greek Philosophy
– Socrates – is portrayed, in the dialogues of Plato, as hugely pessimistic

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.739
about the whole business of democracy. In
Book Six of The Republic, Plato describes

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.640
Socrates falling into conversation with a
character called Adeimantus and trying to

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.600
get him to see the flaws of democracy by comparing
a society to a ship. If you were heading out

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.530
on a journey by sea, asks Socrates, who would
you ideally want deciding who was in charge

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.480
of the vessel? Just anyone or people educated
in the rules and demands of seafaring? The

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.549
latter of course, says Adeimantus, so why
then, responds Socrates, do we keep thinking

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.159
that any old person should be fit to judge
who should be a ruler of a country? Socrates’s

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.270
point is that voting in an election is a skill,
not a random intuition. And like any skill,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.670
it needs to be taught systematically to people.
Letting the citizenry vote without an education

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.920
is as irresponsible as putting them in charge
of a trireme sailing to Samos in a storm.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.299
Socrates was to have first hand, catastrophic
experience of the foolishness of voters. In

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.090
399 BC, the philosopher was put on trial on
trumped up charges of corrupting the youth

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.399
of Athens. A jury of 500 Athenians was invited
to weigh up the case and decided by a narrow

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.759
margin that the philosopher was guilty. He
was put to death by hemlock in a process which

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.880
is, for thinking people, every bit as tragic
as Jesus’s condemnation has been for Christians.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.150
Crucially, Socrates was not elitist in the
normal sense. He didn’t believe that a narrow

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.870
few should only ever vote. He did, however,
insist that only those who had thought about

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.989
issues rationally and deeply should be let
near a vote. We have forgotten this distinction

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.739
between an intellectual democracy and a democracy
by birthright. We have given the vote to all

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.980
without connecting it to wisdom. And
Socrates knew exactly where that would lead:

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.209
to a system the Greeks feared above all, demagoguery.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.120
Ancient Athens had painful experience of demagogues,
for example, the louche figure of Alcibiades,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.150
a rich, charismatic, smooth-talking wealthy
man who eroded basic freedoms and helped to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.629
push Athens to its disastrous military adventures
in Sicily. Socrates knew how easily people

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.901
seeking election could exploit our desire
for easy answers. He asked us to imagine an

00:02:58.901 --> 00:03:03.739
election debate between two candidates, one
who was like a doctor and the other who was

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.620
like a sweet shop owner. The sweet shop owner
would say of his rival: Look, this person

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.100
here has worked many evils on you. He hurts
you, gives you bitter potions and tells you

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.080
he not to eat and drink whatever you like. He’ll
never serve you feasts of many and varied

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.541
pleasant things like I will. Socrates asks
us to consider the audience response: Do you

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:29.049
think the doctor would be able to reply effectively?
The true answer – ‘I cause you trouble,

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.150
and go against you desires in order to help
you’ would cause an uproar among the voters,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.720
don’t you think? We have forgotten all about
Socrates’s salient warnings against democracy.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.650
We have preferred to think of democracy as
an unambiguous good – rather than as something

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.690
that is only ever as effective as the education
system that surrounds it. As a result, we

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.790
have elected many sweet shop owners, and very
few doctors.
