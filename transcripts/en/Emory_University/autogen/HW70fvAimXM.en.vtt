this program is brought to you by Emory
University

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040
 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.410
I asked my job because I said they came

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420
I asked my job because I said they came
 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.970
I asked my job because I said they came
they basically said to me you're not

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980
they basically said to me you're not
 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.679
they basically said to me you're not
sick you just don't really want to work

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689
sick you just don't really want to work
 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.660
sick you just don't really want to work
and it didn't make a difference that I

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670
and it didn't make a difference that I
 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.999
and it didn't make a difference that I
would sleep all night and get up and

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009
would sleep all night and get up and
 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.290
would sleep all night and get up and
take a 10-minute shower we'd have to

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300
take a 10-minute shower we'd have to
 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.880
take a 10-minute shower we'd have to
sleep another hour but I had to drive an

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890
sleep another hour but I had to drive an
 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.319
sleep another hour but I had to drive an
hour to have to work and that couldn't

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329
hour to have to work and that couldn't
 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.970
hour to have to work and that couldn't
get out the car and they look at you and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980
get out the car and they look at you and
 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.109
get out the car and they look at you and
they say there's nothing wrong with you

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119
they say there's nothing wrong with you
 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.519
they say there's nothing wrong with you
you don't look sick right years old

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529
you don't look sick right years old
 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.920
you don't look sick right years old
therefore you don't want to work so we

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930
therefore you don't want to work so we
 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.350
therefore you don't want to work so we
lost all the resources so I ended up at

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360
lost all the resources so I ended up at
 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.770
lost all the resources so I ended up at
Grady in a time where I was between jobs

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780
Grady in a time where I was between jobs
 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.139
Grady in a time where I was between jobs
when no one else was going to hire me

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149
when no one else was going to hire me
 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.440
when no one else was going to hire me
and I had no more resources so Grady has

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450
and I had no more resources so Grady has
 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.690
and I had no more resources so Grady has
always been for me not only just a

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700
always been for me not only just a
 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.880
always been for me not only just a
safety net but just the support of the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890
safety net but just the support of the
 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.130
safety net but just the support of the
doctors that are here and meeting dr.

clinically but really emotionally and
how the disease meshes together so that

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950
how the disease meshes together so that
 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.859
how the disease meshes together so that
your part and be proactive in your

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869
your part and be proactive in your
 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.200
your part and be proactive in your
healing and you'll recommend you to go

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210
healing and you'll recommend you to go
 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.330
healing and you'll recommend you to go
to support groups and he'll try

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340
to support groups and he'll try
 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.550
to support groups and he'll try
different medications and he's you know

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560
different medications and he's you know
 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.920
different medications and he's you know
very much into the research end of Lucas

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930
very much into the research end of Lucas
 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.860
very much into the research end of Lucas
and so he knows what he's doing I came

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870
and so he knows what he's doing I came
 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.399
and so he knows what he's doing I came
in to the Georgia lupus registry and it

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409
in to the Georgia lupus registry and it
 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.560
in to the Georgia lupus registry and it
was so good to finally understand that

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570
was so good to finally understand that
 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.660
was so good to finally understand that
somebody is actually tracking the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670
somebody is actually tracking the
 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.060
somebody is actually tracking the
numbers of people because for me when I

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070
numbers of people because for me when I
 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.920
numbers of people because for me when I
hear people about lupus the first thing

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930
hear people about lupus the first thing
 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.899
hear people about lupus the first thing
they say somebody mama died of lupus my

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909
they say somebody mama died of lupus my
 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.280
they say somebody mama died of lupus my
cousin thought Luke was my grandmother

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290
cousin thought Luke was my grandmother
 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.930
cousin thought Luke was my grandmother
died so everything was associated with

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940
died so everything was associated with
 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.250
died so everything was associated with
death and I'm like okay here you are

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260
death and I'm like okay here you are
 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.840
death and I'm like okay here you are
having this disease where everybody

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850
having this disease where everybody
 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.480
having this disease where everybody
believes that its death then how do we

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490
believes that its death then how do we
 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.850
believes that its death then how do we
change that so the research that he does

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860
change that so the research that he does
 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.330
change that so the research that he does
really does help us to look at the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340
really does help us to look at the
 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.690
really does help us to look at the
numbers and the data of actually people

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
numbers and the data of actually people
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.160
numbers and the data of actually people
that are living with this disease and

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170
that are living with this disease and
 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.690
that are living with this disease and
then we can do more research and have

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700
then we can do more research and have
 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.940
then we can do more research and have
more drugs and so it's exciting it

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950
more drugs and so it's exciting it
 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.950
more drugs and so it's exciting it
really is and yes so I found my passion

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960
really is and yes so I found my passion
 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.270
really is and yes so I found my passion
when I met dr. Lim and we began dialogue

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280
when I met dr. Lim and we began dialogue
 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.010
when I met dr. Lim and we began dialogue
in and you start telling me some

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020
in and you start telling me some
 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.590
in and you start telling me some
interesting things about the Grady to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600
interesting things about the Grady to
 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.450
interesting things about the Grady to
George Lucas registry and then he

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460
George Lucas registry and then he
 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.669
George Lucas registry and then he
invited me to be a part of the team so

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679
invited me to be a part of the team so
 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.280
invited me to be a part of the team so
in that sense I work with lupus research

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290
in that sense I work with lupus research
 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.789
in that sense I work with lupus research
and community liaison with the doctors I

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799
and community liaison with the doctors I
 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:16.150
and community liaison with the doctors I
get

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160
get
 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.040
get
no what's going on behind the scenes I

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050
no what's going on behind the scenes I
 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.710
no what's going on behind the scenes I
can help patients understand what's

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720
can help patients understand what's
 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.330
can help patients understand what's
really going on because you hear a lot

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340
really going on because you hear a lot
 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.010
really going on because you hear a lot
of diseases but you don't ever hear

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020
of diseases but you don't ever hear
 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.870
of diseases but you don't ever hear
about the lupus research so I'm able to

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880
about the lupus research so I'm able to
 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.070
about the lupus research so I'm able to
connect them and said guys this is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080
connect them and said guys this is
 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.240
connect them and said guys this is
what's really going on this is what

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250
what's really going on this is what

actually getting helped and healed
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.460
actually getting helped and healed
because of all of the information that

because of all of the information that
 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.110
because of all of the information that
I'm around so it's not that lupus has

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120
I'm around so it's not that lupus has
 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.930
I'm around so it's not that lupus has
become my life it's just one factor in

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940
become my life it's just one factor in
 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.330
