I've already got my generator set up, and I imported java.util.Random. I know

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.984
exactly how many times I want to generate a random number, so I'll use a for

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:14.330
loop. I want it to generate 100 numbers, and I want to generate numbers between

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.914
one and six. If I use it this way, it'll give me numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:24.576
So I have to add one. Now I have a die roll, but I don't just want to roll the

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:29.914
die 100 times, I want to count how many sixes there are. So if the value is

00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:33.391
six, I should increment the number of sixes, which means that I had to

00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:38.973
initialize it, and at the time I had seen zero so far. But I better not do that

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:43.555
inside the loop because then I would reset it every time. Now after the loop

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:48.678
completes, I'll print out the number of sixes. If you run this you should get

00:00:48.678 --> 00:00:49.781
17.
