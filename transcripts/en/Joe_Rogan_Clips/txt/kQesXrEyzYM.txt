Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience to criminalize psychedelic about what we did. It came through. Oh my God. I thought you said it didn't pass this morning and said it didn't. 15 months ago. Holy Shit. Denver became the first city in the u s to decriminalize marijuana. Wow. Powerful Denver. Wow. Holy Shit Man. It passed.

Speaker 2:          00:26          Approved, measured, decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms. Congratulations. Amazing. How did we think that you, Jamie? I better information you son of a bitch. They were staying up all night for some reason. They did say son of a bitch. Jamie working with the CIA still on official apparently though, as opposed to it on Wednesday afternoon, ended up pulling 51 pulled ahead this afternoon. That's why this morning it wasn't a head and then they still, they're still counting votes. Provision the provision prohibit the city government for using any resources to impose criminal penalties against adults over 21 years of age or personally his possession. A second psilocybin. Hey, you don't have to talk with you and the end of a commercial. What do you want to do? You have to get it all out just in case. No, no, no. This is not a disclaimer. Something hits us and kills. Nobody knows what the fuck you just said. Yeah, they do. Why are we going where the mushrooms are illegal? Oh, too many people who move into Denver. Man. Too many people means a lot of space. Who many people in move with that? Look it up. Look it up about Denver's problem with our infrastructure. They're hating how many people are coming into their city. Listen Bro, you moved to evergreen. Live in the mountains like a savage. I'll move to bracket [inaudible] album to breakfast. How about asking too many rooms? Coke? Breckenridge is nice. I like brick.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Don't you want to see y'all girls yell at or boyfriends scream out in this treat with naked

Speaker 2:          01:37          mcass we need more money. Is the mushroom legal Allity is that going to be like a doctor thing? Are they gonna like no, it's deep criminal officer. Right? As

Speaker 1:          01:45          does is that you don't go. You Go, you don't go to jail, but you can't sell it legally. It's very squirrely, but it's what it is is step one and that's what we need. We needed step one and then it's also on the ballot in California soon. And when it's on the ballot in California, soon it has a likelier chance here. I think that even in Denver and more so now the real problem is people don't understand what it is. Right? And they think it's just like, oh my God, these kids are going to do, mushrooms are going to drive off cliffs. That's what people worry about. You can do more testing now. Right? Is that sort of what it helps while they've done some tests, Johns Hopkins University had some pretty extensive testing that they did that showed, um, real positive results with people that had terminal illnesses where it alleviated the worry of death.

Speaker 1:          02:33          And um, there's some other studies that had been run on it, but there's so far no one has ever instituted in the United States at least like a real thorough, comprehensive clinic where you can go and they can treat you if you have alcohol addiction, Ptsd, there's a lot of different things they could treat with psilocybin. And it's been illegal because it's a schedule one substance. So all these people, it's one of the best things on earth to fix, like mental barriers and problems that you have, especially if it was done in a controlled clinical environment by people you trusted and you felt safe. And that's what a shaman is supposed to be, right? What a shaman is supposed to be as someone who provides you with the psychedelic substances in a controlled state where they, they let you be in a good state of mind set and setting is always very, very important.

Speaker 1:          03:21          And if we could do that, I mean I really think we have a real good chance of turning a lot of people around. People that are addicted to things, people with psychological problems, people who can't see themselves should have a lot of, a lot of different issues. And it's one of the best tools for that. But like every tool, it could be abused, but the problem is not the tool. The problem is abuse, whether it's with alcohol or pills or food or any of these things. We're talking about sex. People can abuse anything, of course, but doesn't mean that silicide and is in an amazing compound that literally can change humanity. It can. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:57          Yeah. It has. It has, and there's so many other, there's so many other things that we don't even know. We haven't even tapped into the possibilities. That's the other thing was when you limit yourself on the possibilities, it's like, well, we don't, how do we know? How do you know what it's gonna do? What if the chip releases mushroom choose every 15 minutes? A little microdose cheat? Just a little micro dose it. No. It feels your levels when you start getting angry. When the guy cuts me off and I'm like, fuck,

Speaker 1:          04:20          aw, releases and I'm like, a little bit of God.
