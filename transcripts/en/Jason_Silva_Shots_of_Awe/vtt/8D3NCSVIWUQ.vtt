00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.716
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:05.590
This episode of "Shots
of Awe" is brought you

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.980
by the Toyota Prius.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.050
Let's lead the way.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.120
Kevin Kelly used to say
humans are the sex organs

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.170
of technology.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.930
And what he meant by that was
that technology was a living

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.620
organism that was
using us to extend

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.260
its reproductive capacity,
similar to the way

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.430
those pollen flowers use bees
in order to spread their seeds.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.100
The history of
technology highlights

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.560
what's known as bootstrapping.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.660
Essentially, we
use one technology

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.872
to build the next technology.

00:00:41.872 --> 00:00:43.330
And then we use
the next technology

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.420
to build the next technology,
and so on and so forth,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.070
until what we have
is a telescoping

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.190
nature of evolutionary change
in which the nature of change

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.260
itself changes.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.950
And so what we have really
to define the human story

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.510
is what's known as
transforming and transcending.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.750
We use these
technological scaffolding

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.130
to build new
capabilities, bring them

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.120
into our cognitive
arsenal, and then create

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.780
new possibility
spaces for ourselves.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.210
Probing the adjacent
possible, we remix what is.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.990
And we create virtual
models, and we

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.170
actualize those new virtual
models into existence.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.220
Essentially, our
mastery of technology

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.510
has given us new construction
kits for our reality.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.040
And I love this idea.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.360
Eric Davis said it best.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.240
The human design
process will achieve

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.660
a kind of infinite velocity,
where everything becomes

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.320
linked with everything else.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.330
And matter becomes mind.
