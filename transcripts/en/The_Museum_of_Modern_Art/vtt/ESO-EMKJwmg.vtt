00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:12.062
- We are standing in front
of Jose Clemente Orozco's

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:15.243
Dive Bomber and Tank, painted in 1940.

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:17.243
And my name is Lauren Adelman.

00:00:17.243 --> 00:00:20.452
We're right by the escalators
right now, and the kids,

00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:22.444
when they come into the
museum, they kinda like

00:00:22.444 --> 00:00:23.942
come up the escalator and see this,

00:00:23.942 --> 00:00:25.350
whether we're gonna look at it or not,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.912
and I would say nine times out of 10

00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:30.719
kids are drawn to it, all ages.

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.482
Probably starting with
like fourth grade and up,

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.061
they're like, "What is that?

00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:36.535
"I love that, it looks likes graffiti.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:37.769
"Is that graffiti?"

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.066
So students at first
are really interested,

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.631
in like the first point
of entry are these faces.

00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:45.323
And what does it mean that one of

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:47.642
these faces has chains in its mouth?

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:51.149
Does that mean that it's
losing the right to speak?

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.682
And then they often
talk about this one here

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:56.613
that has nails going into the eyes.

00:00:56.613 --> 00:00:58.921
A lot of students connect that to

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.048
losing the ability to see the truth.

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:04.251
And then they talk about
like, this feeling of weight

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.747
that's underneath everything,
and then as we start to

00:01:07.747 --> 00:01:11.334
discuss the top and how there's
actually a lot more space,

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:13.377
a lot of students aren't
interested in saying,

00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:15.084
"Oh, that orange thing is this."

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:17.475
It's like what do they
feel is bearing down?

00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:21.655
What do they feel is keeping
this group of people down?

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:22.932
You know, they talk about slavery,

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:24.813
they talk about oppression.

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:27.582
And then often, like
these legs are brought up

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:29.979
and people are like, "Is
someone getting sucked into it,"

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.299
or, "Is someone getting crushed?"

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.619
I had a group of students
who I was working with

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.743
and they just were so
drawn to the symbolism.

00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:42.262
They would talk about how you
could almost like, feel it.

00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:43.632
Like, it's one of those paintings

00:01:43.632 --> 00:01:45.803
that you could almost feel this weight,

00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:47.254
and you could almost feel like,

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:50.857
these chains in you as you look at it.
