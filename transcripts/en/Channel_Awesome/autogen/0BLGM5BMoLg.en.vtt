I will say this one it's also then done
 

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:47.850 align:start position:0%
I will say this one it's also then done
that's<00:10:46.450><c> why</c><00:10:46.660><c> I</c><00:10:46.690><c> think</c><00:10:46.870><c> the</c><00:10:47.290><c> payoff</c><00:10:47.529><c> is</c><00:10:47.830><c> worth</c>

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:47.860 align:start position:0%
that's why I think the payoff is worth
 

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.650 align:start position:0%
that's why I think the payoff is worth
it<00:10:48.190><c> cuz</c><00:10:48.310><c> when</c><00:10:48.490><c> you</c><00:10:48.580><c> see</c><00:10:48.880><c> what</c><00:10:49.089><c> Apple</c><00:10:49.480><c> went</c>

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:49.660 align:start position:0%
it cuz when you see what Apple went
 

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
it cuz when you see what Apple went

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:52.089 align:start position:0%
through you you get like there is a
 

00:10:52.089 --> 00:10:55.590 align:start position:0%
through you you get like there is a

because of this and I think that's an
 

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:13.170 align:start position:0%
because of this and I think that's an

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.180 align:start position:0%
immense payoff for something that at

immense payoff for something that at

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:14.769 align:start position:0%
least for me I was kind of like I'm
 

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
least for me I was kind of like I'm
tolerating<00:11:15.130><c> this</c><00:11:15.670><c> and</c><00:11:15.940><c> I</c><00:11:15.970><c> still</c><00:11:16.240><c> think</c><00:11:16.450><c> it's</c>

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:16.570 align:start position:0%
tolerating this and I still think it's
 

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.329 align:start position:0%
tolerating this and I still think it's
okay<00:11:16.959><c> but</c><00:11:17.320><c> it's</c><00:11:17.560><c> definitely</c><00:11:17.769><c> some</c><00:11:18.220><c> of</c><00:11:18.250><c> the</c>

00:11:18.329 --> 00:11:18.339 align:start position:0%
okay but it's definitely some of the
 

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:19.769 align:start position:0%
okay but it's definitely some of the
harder<00:11:18.640><c> episodes</c><00:11:19.029><c> to</c><00:11:19.180><c> get</c><00:11:19.300><c> there</c><00:11:19.510><c> because</c><00:11:19.570><c> I'm</c>

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:19.779 align:start position:0%
