00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,060
You are listening to radio lab radio lash

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,950
fromW and y. S. E

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
n n p. R. Three two one.
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm Robert Krulwich. This
is radio lab, the podcast.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,820
And lately we at radio lab have become
a bit robot obsessed and we met a guy.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,530
All right. My name is Latif Nasser,

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,380
he's a Grad student in the history
of science department at Harvard.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,820
And he got us thinking about really
old robots like hundreds of years old.

9
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:37,730
And I, for example, I've heard
rumors whispered by store,

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,090
mostly a about a pooping duck approve. Oh,

11
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:43,100
so the pooping duck is really famous.

12
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:45,320
Actually the duck wasn't
really eating and pooping.

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,490
They had like a store of like
pre pre pooped duck poop.

14
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,500
I don't know what it was.
Look like duck poop maybe.

15
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,260
And you would feed this robot duck and
then watch it actually pool. I mean,

16
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:57,950
all you see is you see sort of this in
and this out and people believed it.

17
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,040
People thought this was a,
this was a pooping duck. Um,

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,670
and so we talked about a bunch of these
ancient robots and most of them were

19
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,504
kind of funny.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,160
But then he told us about one
in particular that was actually,

21
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:12,830
it was kind of haunting.
Yes. Not poopy at all.

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,990
So the year is a 1562
this is 450 years ago,

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,730
not so long after Columbus, Ferdinand
and Isabella, and as a new king of Spain.

24
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,460
Phillip. Phillip. Yeah. And he has
a son, the 17 year old crown prince.

25
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,000
His name is Don Carlos. And one
day he's in the royal lodgings.

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,930
I was walking down a flight
of stairs. He trips, he falls,

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,430
he bashes his head against a door
near the bottom of the stairs.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,640
This is the crown prince, you
say the crown prince of Spain.

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,660
So this is a national clam,

30
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,520
but it is a national calamity because
he's the heir apparent. Right. So, so,

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,830
well at first it doesn't look like it's
such a bad injury. He's still conscious,

32
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,820
but then his head starts to
swell to this kind of crazy size.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,720
He becomes delirious and
feverish. He's struck blind. Oh.

34
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,280
And so at this point the, the king comes
right? This is King Philip the second.

35
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:08,960
So he is at this time, he is the most
powerful man in the world, right?

36
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:12,140
So he basically controls
the, all of the Americas.

37
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:15,650
He controls much of Europe. The
Philippines is named after him.

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,300
He was tight with the pope at this time.

39
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:20,320
The pope and the king were kind
of like, you know, BFF. So,

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,450
so the whole Spanish court is
going nuts. Um, across the country.

41
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:29,280
People are uh, seeing this, reading
this as a kind of sign that uh,

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,210
that God's very angry. Right.
And so they're, they're fasting.

43
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,080
They're doing these kinds of uh,
prayer precessions things like this.

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,041
And according to a lot,

45
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:42,870
if the king calls all the best doctors
in Europe to come to Spain to help his

46
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,030
son and these doctors
are trying everything.

47
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,740
They are drilling a hole in his
skull to relieve the pressures,

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,070
relieve the pressure. They are
bleeding him and blistering him.

49
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:57,810
And they are purging him to the extent
that he has like 20 bowel movements

50
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,160
within just like a certain hours.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,140
They're like smearing all
over the wound. They're,

52
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:07,370
they're smearing like Turpentine
and honey and Pudong Carlos,

53
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,370
even after all of this, um, they
sort of look at each other. They,

54
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,870
they look at him and it's kind of
like, this is, he's going to die.

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,320
It's so he's dying. Yeah.
He's basically on his death.

56
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,793
[inaudible]

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,610
so at this point, according to
lot of the king goes to the son,

58
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,670
Legend goes that he kneels beside his
son at his son's death bed and he makes a

59
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,770
pact with God. The pact is, if
you help me, if you heal my son,

60
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:46,740
if you do this miracle for me, I'll
do a miracle for you. Wow. Let's,

61
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,580
that's uh, it's quite a hubris stick of
a, of a human being to say to God, Oh,

62
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,460
a little Tulsa. Remember
the, he's the, he,

63
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,160
the most powerful men in the world at
this. He is a god among men. Really? Yeah.

64
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,910
You bristly or not? This is,
this is what he says. Yeah. Okay.

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,960
All of a sudden his son just gets better.

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,760
Really within a week. He can see
again within a month. He, he,

67
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:15,594
it's as if he didn't

68
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,773
volatile.

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,320
He just pops right back up.

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,233
Yeah.

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,180
And King Philip must have thought,
well my God, this is exactly is my God.

72
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,080
It's probably exactly what he called
and when his son can finally speak,

73
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:32,250
he says to him, Dad, you know, the
weirdest thing happened when I was out.

74
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,560
I had this dream. Oh, that's a
great story. This is Elizabeth King.

75
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,030
I'm an artist and a professor in
the Sculpture Department at Virginia

76
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,700
Commonwealth University. She's
actually the one that hooked a lot.

77
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,770
Tough on the story. Yup.
In any case, the dream,

78
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:51,771
there are documents of Don Carlo next
morning saying that he had had a dream,

79
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,750
this vision that better
there a figure in a,

80
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:59,490
in a Franciscan habit,
shaved head sharpen,

81
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,760
knows this marvelous monk entered his
room and approached his deathbed holding

82
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,780
across and basically told
him, you're going to be fine.

83
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,800
And that's quite well
documented. Apparently there
was a witness in the room,

84
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,380
in the sick room with him that night,
overheard the prince talking to a ghost,

85
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,640
sort of mumbling things in his delirium.

86
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,970
So Don Carlos has this stream.

87
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,630
Suddenly he's fine in the natural question
that people are asking is who is this

88
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:33,290
monk? Yeah, yeah. I mean is it just a
generic Mongo? Is it somebody specific?

89
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,290
Some Messenger from God
and from his description,

90
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,390
physical description and the shaved head.

91
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:42,350
The point he knows the monks habit
piercing eyes, even though kind of cross,

92
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:45,890
he was using kind of everybody in town,
the king, everyone was like, oh yeah,

93
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,300
like we know exactly who this guy is.

94
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,040
Can only really be one guy kind of local
fryer who died a hundred years before

95
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,660
named a Diego de Alcala, Diego de Alcala.

96
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,360
Who is he?

97
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,360
He is a local holy figure who was
corpse was associated with a number of

98
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:14,200
documented miracles. In fact,
this guy was so holy in this town,

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,980
actually not just in the town.
You want to know something?

100
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,720
There's a bit of trivia ever heard of
San Diego, California you mean? Yeah,

101
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,040
as in the Padres. What does he have
to, is this the same guy? Same guys,

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,490
but he was the patron saint of the
people who found it. San Diego is holy,

103
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,720
so holy in this town.

104
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,400
Then people believed his
corpse is 100 year dead corpse,

105
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,240
had healing powers. And some
people, they're different stories.

106
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:41,300
But some people say that
even they, uh, these,

107
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,870
that unbeknownst to Don Carlos,
that night that he had the dream,

108
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,610
the priesthood and the king
himself according to some
stories went and they got

109
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,390
this corpse out of the
church, out of the crypt.

110
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,420
They carried it through the streets.
They brought it to the bedroom.

111
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:00,560
They literally put it, they sort of
snuck it in bed with a don Carlos.

112
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:05,070
And that's how you healed. They didn't
stick him in bed with this bone. Right.

113
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,940
They just say they brought him into
the room. There's different reports.

114
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,010
There's a picture of him in this
engraving. Oh. Um, and if you can,

115
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,970
you probably can't see it, but
look at this picture right here.

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,130
She had a, uh, a copy of a 16th,

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,370
see roughly of 16th century
woodcut showing you this
scene where you could kind

118
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,720
of see, oh wait, so

119
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,860
he's in bed. The two men in bed together
or about to be, well, they couldn't be,

120
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:38,010
you know, they could be just laying
him down. Okay. Caught in the middle.

121
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,980
Meanwhile, back to our story,

122
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,070
you got Philip the second who
has asked God for a miracle.

123
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:46,880
God came through through this monk
and now fill out the second is like,

124
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,530
oh, I got to deliver King Philip
the second. Oh, he's got a miracle.

125
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,980
Yes he does. And he's,
he's acutely aware of this.

126
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,310
So basically what he does is he
enlists this really renowned clockmaker

127
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,600
a clockmaker. Yup.

128
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,140
Named one Nelo Tory Yana
one Nelo two Riano. Yeah.

129
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,390
A huge band,

130
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,560
upbeat ox of a man described as always
being filthy and blustery and model a lot

131
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:18,144
of fun to beat.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,630
Okay.

133
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,340
But a great, great clockmaker.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,980
Certainly among the best in Spain,
maybe the entire holy Roman empire.

135
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,160
So the king goes to this
guy and he says, look,

136
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:36,140
I want you to make a mechanical
version of Diego de Alcala.

137
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,730
What? A mechanical version of
this 100 year dead holy priest.

138
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,370
Yes. Like a mechanical monk. A
robotic Ponderay. Yeah. Which,

139
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,830
and this I did not expect,

140
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,210
still exist now the monk bodies in the
Smithsonian. Perfect working order.

141
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,240
No Way. I swear, I swear
that since 1977 no. Yeah.

142
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,670
The first time I saw this speaker,

143
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,220
I was drawn to it and then repel.

144
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,180
That's Carlene Stephens. She is a
curator at the Smithsonian in DC.

145
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,210
About a week after I
left the fund I spoke,

146
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,770
we ended up in DC meeting
with her and she showed us.

147
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,280
Oh Wow. Wow.

148
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,800
The monk who lives in a little glass case,

149
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,860
what we have here is an
automaton over 400 years old.

150
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,440
Um, so the first, is this the first
robot that we know of? No, no, no, no.

151
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:35,830
Idiot.

152
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,510
The ancient Greeks had things
that could be considered robots.

153
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,700
Okay. Back to our story, 450 some
odd years ago. Our clockmaker,

154
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,460
what's his name? Tory Yanno Dariano.

155
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,460
He goes into his shop and he does
whatever he does next one gear to another,

156
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:54,220
to another for hours, weeks, months.

157
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,980
No idea how long it takes and
I don't think anybody does,

158
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,280
but emerges one day into the
bright sunshine with luck.

159
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,940
What did you call it? A
robotic Ponderay. Yeah.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a 15 inch high figure made of
wood and iron has the sort of habit,

161
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,660
has it, the sandals, has the rosary,

162
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:15,661
has the cross and poking out at the
top of the habit is a little bald,

163
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,440
hairless head with that sharp
nose, like a, like a razor.

164
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,240
And the rather ferocious,

165
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,960
I like intense or like
a like doing business.

166
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,600
Ferocious like I'm focused,

167
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,980
I'm focused like maybe I'm only 15
inches tall but I am focused on something

168
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:35,410
much bigger than you. You human.

169
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,070
So did you like turn it on or
push something? Yeah, that,

170
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,010
why would I get on a train and go
for three hours? Just look at it.

171
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,120
Obvious question. Okay. Do you wouldn't
mind? Sure. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Do it.

172
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,150
So Carlene takes us out into the
hall, we sit down on the floor,

173
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:51,700
she gives lot tiff a little brass key.

174
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,540
He sticks it into the secret
slot in the, amongst the side,

175
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,400
I think it goes
counterclockwise. You went can,

176
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,670
you would tend to want to do it this way
and lots of winds up the monk turning

177
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:08,671
it counter clockwise and it's surprisingly
sort of taught how much should I

178
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,880
turn. And so if you sort of wind
up this sort of secret spring,

179
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:19,180
I think there's a stop and it'll,
okay. All right. I'm going,

180
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,480
I'm going put it on the ground,
right. All right. You let them go.

181
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,170
Give them a place. Walk very slowly.

182
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,780
One foot after the other coming out
from under the Catholic. In fact,

183
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:31,550
there's actually a
little wheel under there,

184
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,220
but yet you see the teeth coming out.
The head is turning from right to left.

185
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,040
The eyes are rolling in the head and
mouth is opening and closing is if it's

186
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,140
sort of monitoring like a prayer,

187
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,000
the arms are in motion. One arm
is raising and lowering cross.

188
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,120
The other arm is beating the chest. Wow.

189
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,480
A symbolic gesture. Who? Catholic
that is called the mayor.

190
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,420
Kulpa after three or four steps in the
arm holding the cross though something

191
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,140
new,

192
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,610
it moves to different new directions
to bring the cross to the mouth.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,680
And the figure kisses. The clock.
It's bodily. Like mesmerizing.

194
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,913
Yeah. Yeah.

195
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,560
The next thing is doing is it's turning
and moving in a different direction and

196
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:27,760
then walking its paces and kissing
across as we watched it turn once,

197
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:32,380
then twice, then three times, four times.
Let it go back to where it started.

198
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,080
So if you imagine a table with a
number of people sitting around it,

199
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,520
probably it's going to sort of at one
point or another head for you and then

200
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:42,070
turn away and head for someone
else and then turn away.

201
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,500
Why would the king of Spain who
could have, you know, I don't know,

202
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:54,820
built a church or, or taking a crusade
to Jerusalem or done something, you know,

203
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:55,511
he could've done anything.

204
00:12:55,511 --> 00:13:00,511
Why did he decide to commemorate his
son's revival by making a little automatic

205
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,050
doll? Like what was that for? Yeah, lots
of, what was he thinking? Yeah, it's a,

206
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,680
it's a good quote. That's the $64,000
question. It's a great question.

207
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:09,640
It's a really good question.

208
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,110
The truth is there's really no way to
know for sure. As a historian, I gotta,

209
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,280
I gotta rely on the documentation and
this not a whole lot of that in this case,

210
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:20,830
but one interpretation certainly
could be that, you know,

211
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:22,180
the king had this amazing,

212
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:27,040
miraculous thing happened to his son and
now we had a way of sharing that with

213
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,610
his subjects because he's got this
device where it's a, it's an illusion,

214
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:33,970
like the machinery of it. It's completely
hidden. There's no visible man that's,

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,300
yeah.

216
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,810
That's one of the craziest parts that
it's all sort of hidden underneath the,

217
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,010
the robe. So when he put it down
on a table or in a court yard,

218
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,260
people would have seen it move on its own.

219
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,620
They would have been amazed as we
were, and he could have said, look,

220
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:51,910
here is the miracle. Look
what God did for our country.

221
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:55,030
God likes Spaniards. Yeah.
Look at what God did for Spain,

222
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,380
which would have been a useful thing for
a king to be able to say, right? Yeah.

223
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,800
That's, so that's one possibility.

224
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,530
The other is it just on
a more utilitarian level?

225
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,940
This was a machine that was built to
pray and this was a period when you could

226
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,450
by prayer repetition.
So if you had the money,

227
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,140
you could get someone to pray for you
while you go do something else. Oh,

228
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,110
that's, you're cool. You're
covered, you're covered.

229
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,880
And if you think about it
from Phillip's perspective,

230
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,620
he needed to say thank you to God.

231
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,090
And here he had this thing that if he
wound up was an automated thank you

232
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:29,170
machine. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
you. Thank you. Yeah. Can we thank you.

233
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:32,220
Thank you. Thank you. Or it could be,
I love you, I love you. I love love.

234
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,540
It could also be, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. It could be please, please,

235
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,610
please, please, please. But if you need,

236
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,540
but if you think about it more
expansively says lot of like,

237
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:47,860
what did it mean at that time to be a
catholic? Like what did it really mean?

238
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,850
Well then this robot was maybe the
Catholic you could ever hope to be.

239
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,840
What counted his prayer was, was,

240
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,850
was quite specific in the sense that
if you say the right things and,

241
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,530
and do the right actions
in the right order,

242
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:07,430
in the right time and in the
right place, Sorta, that's prayer.

243
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,270
That's when God notice it. So it's about
method, it's about method, it's about,

244
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,090
and maybe this monk he says was like
method embody. That's a good one. I mean,

245
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,730
why not, right? It is in fact perfect.

246
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:25,150
It repeats itself over and over and
over and it replicates the idea.

247
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,840
So it's basically what it is is a
little, a little teaching object.

248
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,680
Like this is what you're aiming for.
Here's how you do it. Like this is it,

249
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,850
this is the perfect prayer.
It's a perfect prayer.

250
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,740
This is doing it the perfect way every
time. And I, because I'm, I'm just this,

251
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,220
you know, lowly, imperfect
human. Um, I'm not,

252
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:50,240
I can only aspire to this perfect piety
that you're making this up or do you

253
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,180
think that this might, the monk
might've actually been seen this way.

254
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,580
It could be true. I don't
think it's so crazy,

255
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,700
especially if you think about what was
happening at that moment and this is

256
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,000
counter-reformation Spain, right?
Not so long after Luther, you know,

257
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,530
is nailing his theses on the wall and
there's this big debate raging about how

258
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:10,070
actually do you get closer to God and
you'll have the kind of protesters with

259
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,100
with Luther who are saying
it's not about you know works.

260
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,230
It's not about saying
something this many times.

261
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:18,560
It's about whether you feel it and then
you have the kind of Catholic argument,

262
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:22,190
which is to say you do these
rituals because these are
the rituals and these are

263
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:25,310
the way you get. This is the way you get
close to God. This is the way you pray.

264
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,070
You pray like this thing
Josh, like this thing.

265
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,070
If you're a Catholic
Kenyan, if God's a Catholic,

266
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,100
you better hope he is and if you're
filled the second you look at the sky and

267
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:42,214
you say, God,

268
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,770
you and me are square

269
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,080
special. Thanks to a lot of
Nasser. Yes. Latte. Yeah.

270
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,670
Graduate Student at Harvard History
of Science Department and to Sarah

271
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,580
[inaudible] production
help on this story. Thanks.

272
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:05,470
Also to the amazing Elizabeth King,

273
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,430
Carlene Stephens at the Smithsonian
end to David Todd. David actually, um,

274
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,420
is himself an expert. Clockmaker he
constructed a, a replica of the monk,

275
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,310
which is actually what we heard because
at the monk itself is very old and you

276
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:24,250
don't want to be winding that
thing. But big thanks to David Todd,

277
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,720
we couldn't have done
this piece without him.

278
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:29,710
And actually he and Elizabeth King
will be publishing a book soon,

279
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:34,240
which is called a machine,
a ghost, and a prayer.

280
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,110
The story of a 16th century
mechanical monk. And thanks.

281
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:42,730
Lastly to Stephen Vitiello, who recorded
clock sounds in David Todd's workshop,

282
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,270
which we used in the piece. Huh?
I'm exhausted from this thing.

283
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,900
I see so much gratitude. And of
course, thank you. Really? Yes.

284
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,990
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.
