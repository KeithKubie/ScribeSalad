00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.642
Alright, let's walk through the solution to this

00:00:02.642 --> 00:00:06.900
assessment. First, we import the pandas module, then

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.300
we read in the csv located at path_to_csv,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.270
using the pandas read_csv function. Then we're going to

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.484
create a new column in the dataframe called

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:19.080
nameFull, which is the concatenation of the nameFirst column,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.460
a space, and the nameLast column. Finally, we're

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.800
going to use pandas to_csv function, to write the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.947
new data frame to a new csv file located at path_to_new_csv.
