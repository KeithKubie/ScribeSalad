00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.530
Determining the optimal transcription factor

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.490
binding site can be pretty difficult.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.060
And usually has to be determined empirically. What that means, is,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.690
we normally have to go to the lab to figure it

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.010
out. But that's not always an easy thing to do. And sometimes,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.900
it's a little faster to do what we call sequence comparisons,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.850
or sequence alignments. What this means is instead of going into

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.430
the lab I am going to take, let's say 5 or

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.490
6 different individuals and I am going to take the transcription factor

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.750
binding inside sequence for this person and that person

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.730
and that person and that person and I am going to

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.130
line them all up together, one on top of the

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.850
other. For instance I have these 6 sequences right here,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.150
hypothetically speaking off course from 6 different individuals. And

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.570
when you line them all up like this, hopefully what

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.510
you notice first off is that there are very few

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.830
differences in the overall sequences. But at any given position,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.050
you can see that there's a dominant nucleotide

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.770
in that column. We call this the consensus,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.680
or the agreement, right, because most of the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.860
letters in that column are one letter or another.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.780
So what I want you to try to do right now is looking at these six

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.180
sequence alignments, tell me what you think the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.880
consensus sequence is for this transcription factor binding site.
