00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.870
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So I'm Pam
Jackson, Director for Center

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.550
for the Book here at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.110
And I welcome you today.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.020
We are part of the national
and international outreach unit

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.060
of the Library, and we're thrilled
to be a partner with you as part

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.040
of our Books and Beyond Series.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.270
We are really excited
about the kinds of authors

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.910
and book talks we get to
have here at the Library.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.560
And we welcome you to learn
more about Center for the Book,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.720
the national and international
outreach, and the Library itself.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.550
And I usually share --
and I will do so now --

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.830
that it is the Library's mission
to provide the American people

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.580
with a rich, diverse and
enduring source of knowledge.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.660
And we care that that source be
something that is relied upon

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.510
by the American people to
inform, engage, and excite folks.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.920
And to do so for a purpose.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.660 position:56%
And the purpose is to stimulate
intellectual and creative endeavors.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.180
And it is the case that we are,
at the Library of Congress,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.320
America's first cultural
institution.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.300
And that is part of
what we see as our role.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.600
Excuse me.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.790 position:56%
It's also part of our vision at the
Library that we're the chief steward

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.440
of the record of knowledge
for America and the world.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.990
And in having that
record it allows us

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.540
to create futures beyond
imagination.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.390 position:56%
Today's author is a steward in his
own right as a recorder of knowledge

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.840 position:56%
and history, and one who's
accomplished remarkable achievement.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.830
And it's an honor to have you
here to discuss your work.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.580
I'll mention that the
Center for the Book,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.660
which includes the Young
Reader Center and the Poetry

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.160
and Literature Center, promotes
literacy and reading books,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.080
libraries, poetry, and
literature for a purpose.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.600
It is our statute.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.880
We are enacted by law in Congress.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.810
We do so, though, for the purpose
of creating engaging societies.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.900
Engaged societies.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.460
Informed and educated societies.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.320
And because we believe that
books and literacy and reading

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.290
and libraries are the best weapons
against ignorance, intolerance.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.620
And those are important weapons
in the war that we fight.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.940
Now one of the things I'd
like to mention is that most

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.880
of us here take literacy
for granted.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.410
And we want to encourage
folks to remember

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.080
that it actually is
almost a silent war.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.100 position:56%
So sometimes when I talk about
weapons in the war against ignorance

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.790
and intolerance, people
miss the point.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.570
You hear kind of maybe a
political conversation.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.290
There's a social one.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.750
The Center for the Book
also administers the Library

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.370 position:56%
of Congress Literacy Awards Program.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.380
And our funder and sponsor is
David Rubinstein, who cares mostly

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.720
that people in America and across
the world get that literacy matters

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.400
and it's something
that is a critical

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.710
and essential part of our lives.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.090
That most of us who are
literate take completely

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.600
for granted and miss.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.680
And we have it as our mission
to promote the cause of literacy

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.350
and to have it be a loud,
proud part of who we are

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.930
as the Library of Congress.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.020
So I share that with you today
to invite you to know that,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.340 position:56%
to visit our site at read.gov,
where we have a lot more information

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.810
about our programs and what we do,

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.900
reading promotion and
literacy promotion.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.140
I can mention also that we are
part of a global conversation.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.980
We have partners from as far away
as Afghanistan and Australia,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.810
New Zealand, Cambodia, Brazil.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.420
And most of those were with
us last month for an event.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.650
So we're part of a
global conversation

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.550
about reading promotion
and literacy.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.900
And I want you to have that
in mind as you sit here today.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.780
It's a very intimate talk
about a particular book

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.270
from a particular man
who is brilliant.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.280
And it's part of a
global conversation.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.870
So let me mentioned before
I introduce our author

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.610
that we are recording the event,
so if you ask a question you are

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.810
on record with that webcast.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.870
Please know that our webcasts are
also available online at read.gov,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.140
and we have hundreds
of them of wide variety

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.120
and range of author talks too.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.760
On subjects of many genres, a lot
of diversity for you to enjoy.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.720 position:56%
I should also mention today's book
is for sale in the back of the room,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.270
so please make sure you take time

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.450
if you haven't already
to purchase a copy.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.830
And that the author will
be available for signing.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.140
Our chief criteria for this
talk for our book series is

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.700
that the work be associated with
or tied to the Library of Congress.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.250
And so in particular,
in this case it's

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.440
that the author has used the
manuscripts and the collections

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.620
of the Library of Congress to
explore and do research that led

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.630
to the book that we're
discussing today, which is,

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.370
"Alexander Robey Shepherd: The Man
Who Built the Nation's Capital."

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.560
And it is by John Richardson.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.210 position:56%
This is a fascinating biography that
tells the story of a self-made man

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.530
who came of age in the Civil War
and made a fortune in the plumbing

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.900
and gas fitting business,
and led the fight

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.590
to establish the physical
infrastructure here

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.530
in the nation's capital.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.180
John Richardson has
become -- its author --

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.770
has been a public servant
and has served 45 years

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.390
in the nonprofit world
in federal government.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.890
And he's a graduate of
Williams College with an M.A.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.520
from George Washington University,
and has a wide-ranging experience

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.860
as President of the American Near
East Refugee Aid and the Center

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.840
for Middle East Policy, and later

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.020
as a Central Intelligence
Agency officer.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.430
He served in Pakistan, Jordan, and
Indonesia, among many other places.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.760
And he also is the author of a
book, "The West Bank: A Portrait."

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.560
Let's welcome John Richardson.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:23.040
[ Applause ]

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.010
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Good afternoon.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.200
Okay, right in front of me is this
sheet, which I will share with you.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.820
Please repeat the question.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.500
So if you ask a question and,
you know as they say in stores,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.940
if you don't get a
receipt you get it free --

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.410
I think something to that effect.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.140
In any event, that's not true here.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.650
But remind me to repeat
the questions.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.950
It's a great pleasure.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.470
I'd like to thank Pam Jackson
and the Center for the Book,

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.060
Library of Congress and all
of you for coming out today.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.890 position:56%
Can you hear me alright, by the way?

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.500
Okay. First I will sing for my
supper and I will say categorically

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.610
that the Library of Congress was
of tremendous assistance to me

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.240
in researching this book over
altogether too many years.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.700
Particularly, I made use
of the manuscript division;

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.870
the papers of Alexander
Robey Shepherd are there.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.740
Also scads of other people
-- William Wilson Corcoran,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.740
who was a very important figure
at the same time in Washington,

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.500
and no friend of Shepherd's after
they had some initial exchanges.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.350
The Wilson papers and
lots of others;

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.420
and previous research back even
when I was in graduate school,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.210
I used the manuscript division
-- it's tremendously helpful.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.620
And also the -- what's it
called, Photography and?

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.920
&gt;&gt; Prints and Photographs.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.490
&gt;&gt; Prints and Photographs Division
was extremely useful and helpful.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:03.110
And the great thing is that most --
many of the photographs are online

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.570
and they are all in the public
domain, so you don't have

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:12.290
to fight the owners for publication
fees and all that kind of thing.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.090
Anyhow, so thanks to the Library
of Congress; couldn't be happier

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.110
to be here with you all today.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:26.540 position:56%
Okay. "Alexander Robey Shepherd, the
Man Who Built the Nation's Capital."

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:33.960 position:56%
This was an 1871 portrait by Henry
Ulke, a German-American portraitist,

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.450
well known, much sought
after in that time period.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.800
This 1871, as I said, when
Shepherd was 36 years old,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:50.750 position:56%
just about to become the senior
person in the territorial government

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.000
of the District of Columbia --
I'll define these terms later on.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.410
But he was at the height
of his powers.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:04.200
He was a co-owner of the
Evening Star for several years.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.900
In fact, right, you can see
-- you can see it, trust me --

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.960
just to the left of his left arm
is a copy of the Evening Star.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.690
And so the portraitist
was sure to include that.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:25.460
Alright, first what I'd like
to do is to talk a little bit

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:31.130
about Washington, D.C. roughly at
mid-century just to remind you;

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.250
many of you are quite familiar
with most of this if not all.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.490
But it was a different
time entirely.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.960
The District of course is, was,
and probably always will be

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.010
under the direct thumb of Congress;
Section 8 of the Constitution,

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.680
I just reviewed it last night.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:56.800 position:56%
It says, "Congress shall exercise
exclusive legislation for everything

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.100
to do with the District."

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.840
I mean, the D.C. City Council, they
can, you know, legalize marijuana;

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.940
they can do anything they want.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.320
But Congress can always,
if it chooses,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.300
veto or certainly modify
legislation.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:16.110
The District of Columbia at that
time -- and this means really,

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.500 position:56%
I'll just say roughly pre-Civil War.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:25.390
In fact, up to Shepherd's
time -- it was not one city.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:31.360 position:56%
It was one District of Columbia,
but in 1846 as some of you may know,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.600
the State of Virginia asked for
that chunk on the Virginia side

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.480
of the river, now Alexandria and
Arlington; they asked for it back.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.590
They said, please give
it back to us.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.730
And Congress, without batting
an eye said sure, take it.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.680
Well, this was George
Washington's sacred creation,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.130
this ten-mile square.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.890
And Congress, I don't even
think they had any hearings.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.170 position:56%
And so they just said sure, take it.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.810 position:56%
And so Virginia got that piece back.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.860
But the rest of what's
left of the District

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:07.080
of Columbia was three separate
legal and political jurisdictions.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.210
One was sort of the core city,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.630
south of now Florida
Avenue; then Boundary Street.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:22.980
Washington City, it was run by a
corporation, had an elected mayor

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:28.290
and two houses -- one was
the Board of Aldermen,

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.260
then the Common Council, the
more popular of the two sections.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.550
But that was for most of the
period I'm talking about now.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.470
Of course the second part

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:43.550
of the District was
Georgetown; ditto, a corporation.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:49.570
It had its own legislative
and tax-raising body.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:54.420
Then the third piece of the
District was that great huge --

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.940
almost like a horse collar --

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.240
called Washington County
that was everything north

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.820
of Boundary Street going
from the far west all the way

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.110
around to the far southeast
of the District.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:14.360 position:56%
And all three sections competed with
each other for pennies from Congress

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.170
for filling potholes, for paving
streets, for doing things.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.720
Because Congress had very
little interest in the District;

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.160
and I'll talk more about that.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.730
Certainly the topography of
the District at the time,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.680
and the man Don Hawkins,
who's a cartographer,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.390
he's a wonderful historical
cartographer.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:43.250
And he has created 3-D,
holographic, various kinds of maps

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:48.190
that have re-created the topography
of the district at the time.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:54.000
Basically very hilly, up and
down creeks, valleys, hills.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.090
Jenkins Hill, now Capitol Hill,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:00.280
was the most prominent
structure, physical structure.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.040
But it was -- and all of the
roads just followed the existing

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.970
topography; so it was
really up and down.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.700
The part, sort of say from the
Capitol up to the White House,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.280
that was pretty flat; it
was near the Potomac River.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.380
But other parts of the District
were quite, quite hilly.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:24.680
As I said, the child of
Congress; nothing was done

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.060
without Congress' approval.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:33.700
And the city was really not
-- it wasn't much to look at.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.490
John Kennedy, when he was
President he made a quip;

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.570
he said that Washington
was best known

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.330
for its northern charm
and southern efficiency.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:50.000
A lot of people thought
that was pretty good.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.790
Just before the Civil War,
the slave trade still existed.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.970
I mean, slaves were -- the
slave trade was abolished

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.740
by the Compromise of 1850.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:05.000
But slaves were owned and held
in the District of Columbia;

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.540
there were roughly some
3800 slaves at the time.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:14.410
There were also 11,000 free
Blacks in the District at the time

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.240
of the Civil War, many of whom,
James Wormley and other figures --

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.690
he was a very known hotelier,
restauranteur and had

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:29.650
against all odds had
created lives and some status

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.460
for themselves and their families.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.930
But it was not a -- it was always
-- anything until the Emancipation

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.760
and even thereafter was
very tough for Blacks.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:47.010
The District competed for dollars
from this miserly Congress;

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.460
the members of Congress
did not think of Washington

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.310
as the national capital;
that's where the Congress met.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.980
And their reference points were
their home districts or home states

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.930
if they were in the Senate.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:06.380
And the boarding houses where they
lived when they came to Washington

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.270
for Congressional sessions.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.680
But they -- and this is really
important to understand the mindset

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.640
at the time -- Congress did not
think it had any responsibilities

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.170
to take care of, to
maintain, to repair,

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.290
to build the District of Columbia.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:29.050
The original plan way back,
1790, '91 was that land sales,

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.370
building lots would provide
somehow a pot of money

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.080
that then would be used for
roads and things like that.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.910
But the lot sales, as
you I'm sure well know,

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.710
were a great failure,
a disappointment.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.950 position:56%
And no legislation was ever
implemented or instituted to provide

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.250
for maintaining the city.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.860
And Congress more importantly,
perhaps even so,

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.100
did not think it had a
responsibility to do so.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.790
And this was reflected always.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.630
So Washington was a
pretty scruffy place

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.300
around the time of the Civil War.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.610
A few public buildings, you know,
the patent office, the post office,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.340
the White House, the Capitol.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.850
But not a whole lot else.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:13.280
And if you see photographs of that
period, you will see that picture

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.740
of Pennsylvania Avenue
was kind of low,

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.720
little one- or two-story buildings.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.460
And then with the Treasury
Building at one end

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.090
and the Capitol at the other.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.650
And also unpaved streets.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.490
In fact, let's see what we've got.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:33.740 position:56%
Yes, this is F Street looking east;
this is the southern front of the --

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.870
of what is now the portrait
gallery of the American Art Museum.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.290
And then this is the Masonic
Building, if any of you know that;

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.710
it's right at 9th and
F; it's still there,

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.010
it's a very handsome building.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.490
And you can see -- above
all I wanted to show this --

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.400
it shows these were
the unpaved streets.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.470
There was one paved street
basically in the district.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.110
And that was between the
Capitol and the Treasury.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:02.850
Most of the other streets, they
were mud and mess in the winter,

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.310
and they were dust and
mess in the summer.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:12.740
And really not a good
way to get around.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:18.500 position:56%
This was just the -- now 14th Street
Bridge, of course Long Bridge, 1861,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.910
showing the Maryland
Avenue start of the bridge

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.740
and looking over toward Alexandria.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:32.800
But the Civil War was a huge
problem for the District.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.870
Thousands and thousands of
soldiers who were bivouacked

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:46.760
and garrisoned here, put in
hospitals by the thousands.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.830
Tens of thousands of
horses tore up the streets.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.250
All the trees were cut down.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:58.690
It was -- they were cut down
for firewood for the bakeries

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.890
in the basement of the Capitol and
for every other use of firewood;

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.340
they were cut down to
make parade grounds.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.980
And of course there were
68 forts around the city;

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.290
they were cut down to
create fields of fire.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:19.640
And the District, of course,
in 1861 was surrounded

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.020
by two slave-holding states.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:28.290 position:56%
It was this little tiny piece in the
middle with Maryland on the north

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.250
and Virginia on the south.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:35.080
And as I said, Virginia
had retro-ceded that piece

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:40.530
of the District in 1846, and
it was for a very brief time,

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.080 position:56%
Alexandria was in Confederate hands.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.510
But the streets were
torn up by the horses.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.410
Buildings -- public buildings

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.080
and other private buildings
were turned into hospitals.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.050
It was a huge military camp.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:01.790
And it pretty much made a mess of
the city throughout the Civil War.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:08.610
But then come 1865 after the tragic
assassination of President Lincoln,

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:14.780
the country at a loss of
600,000 and more men and women,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:20.080
mostly by illness and wounds
that could not be treated.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.290
But more than 600,000
people died from that war.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.900
And the nation, back
together again, bloody;

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.790
the South very unhappy they lost.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.690
But the nation for the first time

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.380
in its history needed a
true national capital.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.160
Not just a place where
Congress would meet

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.460
and where the President
lived in the White House,

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.360
but a true national capitol.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.270
The expansion was going on toward
the west, the vistas opening

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:53.900 position:56%
up for creating the transcontinental
nation that it was to become.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.770
So enter my name, Alexander
Robey Shepherd.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.980
Faint drum roll here.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.720
This is just -- this is more
of the unpaved streets theme.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.680
I don't know the street; if anybody
can spot it by the buildings here,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.510
you're welcome to share
that with me.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.280 position:56%
This is a Library of Congress
picture, but showing troops marching

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.700
on yet another unpaved street
in the District of Columbia.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.240
And then one of my
favorite shots, this.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.410
What's the most interesting feature

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.330
of this picture showing
Union troops on the Mall?

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.330
The Washington Monument, that stump

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.690
over on the left-hand side was
the unfinished Washington --

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:43.290
the Washington Monument, not
finished until 1884 eventually.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:50.330
But Alexander Robey Shepherd, born
into a solid middle-class family,

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:54.030
born at 12th and Maryland
Avenue Southwest approximately

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.840
where the Mandarin Hotel is
now, if you know where that is.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.600
And there's a cut, a railroad
cut that runs through.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.460
And if any of you say House of
Cards, there were a lot of speeded

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.010
up film showing trains
running through a cut.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.450
Well, that's about where
Shepherd's house was.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.660
The place has been gone for years;

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.350
the whole neighborhood
has been totally changed.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:22.160 position:56%
But his father ran a very
prosperous coal and lumbar business.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.290
He had a wharf down at the river
end of Maryland Avenue Southwest.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:33.340
He also had a lumber and coal
yard on the Washington Canal,

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.560
right where the National
Archives is now.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.200
But the father, Alexander
Robey Shepherd Sr.,

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.650
died in 1845 as a young man.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.350
There was money, but
it was scattered.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.780
Money had been left in the will,

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:54.140
actually to help Shepherd start a
business; it would have translated

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.860
into about $4,000 in today's money.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.970
Not a whole lot, but it was --
there was money in the family

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.260
but somehow the estate
was squandered, was lost.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.590
And I've never been able
to find out exactly why.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.300
But the family was
impoverished as a result.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.090 position:56%
Shepherd dropped out of school at
the age of 13; he never went beyond,

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.410
what's that, the seventh
grade or so?

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.150
He was the eldest of
several siblings,

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.230
went to work to support the family.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.390
His mother ran a boarding house

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.490
for several years right near
what is now the FBI Building;

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.740
in fact even I think
on the same location.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:43.990 position:56%
But Shepherd -- let me fast
forward -- by the age of 34 in 1869,

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.300
he was the fourth wealthiest
Washingtonian.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:50.800
He had joined the J. W. Thompson
Plumbing and Gas Fitting business.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.110 position:56%
J. W. Thompson, John Thompson was --

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:58.060
perhaps in some ways became a
substitute father to Shepherd.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.750
He was well-to-do himself.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.390
He supported Alexander
Shepherd who was a very --

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.390
he was a very intelligent,
formally not very schooled

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.840
but a very ambitious,
competent person.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.770
And he went into the Thompson firm.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.460
By 1865 had not only become
a partner but had bought

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.540
out John Thompson and
converted the firm into --

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.820
there were several
variations; Alex Shepherd

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.350
and Brothers, and various forms.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:31.230
But it all was with
Shepherd's firm thereafter.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:36.600
But certainly -- I mean, Shepherd's
achievements were extraordinary.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:42.420
A colleague and supporter
later gave testimony in one

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:46.260
of two Congressional investigations
into D.C. affairs that said that --

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.990
he said that what a lot
of people didn't like was

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.490
that Shepherd was a
mechanic with brains.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.860
And this -- and the snobs from
Georgetown, the cave-dwellers,

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.520
the antiques, these various
names that were used for them --

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.530
a lot of them were Democrats;
they were pro-Confederacy.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.680
And most of them were
very anti-Shepherd.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.200
Of course in Washington,
you think about it,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:15.840
William Wilson Corcoran's -- it
was his father or even grandfather

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:22.730
who had sold bonds for the war, for
the Mexican War; it was his father.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.520
And so old money in Washington
was usually what, a generation.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.540 position:56%
You didn't have to kind of mellow it

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.640
through a whole series
of generations.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.400
And so -- but these people, the
wealthy older Washingtonians,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.520
so-called, looked down on
Shepherd as being a parvenu.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.190
Shepherd was a patriot.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:47.660
In 1861 in April he volunteered
as soon as Lincoln put

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.520
out his call for 75,000 volunteers.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.680
He joined a D.C. militia
called the National Rifles.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.680
He did a 90-day enlistment.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.160
And then was mustered
out in July of 1861.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:07.660
He did join the Union troops who,
at the night of May 24, 1861,

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.600
went across Long Bridge --
you saw the picture of it --

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:16.280
to the Alexandria side where
they took over Alexandria

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:22.850
from a very sparsely-defended
Confederate picket group, really.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:27.010
Then he came back in
the summer of 1861,

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:31.750
ran for the D.C. Common
Council on the so-called

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.550
"unconditional Union ticket."

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.870
He was always -- he considered
himself a Lincoln Republican.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.340
He was -- and I won't go
into it in more detail,

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:44.280
but he was no social progressive
but he did follow the political

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.130
and social main points of
the Lincoln presidency,

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.900
including the emancipation
of the slaves,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.910 position:56%
and later the voting act for Blacks.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:26:00.780
Within two years, by 1863,
Shepherd was the President

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.160
of the D.C. Common
Council at the age of 27.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.100
I mean, this is a man with
a 7th-grade education.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.640
He had become an excellent
writer, speaker,

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.990
a very aggressive political figure.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.700
But also with great skills.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.230
He learned the political game,
how you schmooze in Washington,

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.400
how you wine and dine members
of Congress and others.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.840
You know, Perle Mesta, the great
hostess in the '50s and all said,

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.480
in Washington if you hang
a lamb chop out the window,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.670
she said the whole city
will come to your door.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.330
And so Shepherd understood
the importance of a good meal

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:41.260
for getting political support.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:47.150
In the '60s, Shepherd was
now the boss at this --

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:50.630
had been the J.W. Thompson
Plumbing Firm.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:55.600
But Shepherd really did
have a vision for the city,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.040
and I want to emphasize this.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.800
You know, I said -- I call him the
man who built the nation's capital.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.090
But he had -- but before
the building was the idea.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:10.690
And the idea was that the
city, now the national capital,

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:16.110
it desperately needed to have
an infrastructure, I mean,

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:24.840
so it could build into and become
that functioning national capital.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:32.180 position:56%
And the tripartite, the fragmented
governance of the city, the three --

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.440
Georgetown, Washington
City, Washington County --

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:43.900
this status of the city was
a major obstacle to any kind

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.000
of building of a national capital.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.660
And so Shepherd in the 1860s
really followed a double track.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.910
One track was building his
company and his fortune.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:00.170
As I said, by 1869 he was the
fourth wealthiest Washingtonian

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:04.650 position:56%
after William Corcoran, after George
Washington Riggs, and another man --

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.170
Hess, I think his name was.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:11.420
And at the other hand, he was
building political support

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.010
for what would become
a consolidation,

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.590
a political consolidation
through legislation,

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.340
Congressional legislation
of the district

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.310
and what became the
territorial government.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.300
But -- and I will touch on that.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:30.850
Shepherd was no democrat,
small d. And he --

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:35.360 position:56%
I think his instinct was autocratic.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.300
He didn't -- he was no
supporter of votes for Blacks,

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.490
but on the other hand he was no
supporter of votes for Whites.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.370
So he didn't want anybody to vote.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:52.270
And in fact Shepherd called
for, advocated, lobbied for --

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:57.750
and his supporters did -- returning
to the original form of government

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.620
of the District which
was guess what?

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.850
Three Presidentially-appointed
commissioners.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.650
George Washington appointed
the three commissioners

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:09.140
that ran the government for
several years before it was --

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.940
the form of government was changed.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.830
And so Shepherd wanted an
un-elected three-person

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:22.410
Presidentially-appointed group
to run the affairs of the city.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:26.910
He built in the late 1860s a
movement called the Citizens

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.210
Reform Movement.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:34.440
Which resulted in legislation in
Congress that was passed in 1871

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.700 position:56%
to create the territorial government
of the District of Columbia.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:44.870
It was a brief three-year period of
territorial governance just like,

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:48.180
in many cases like the
western territory --

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.780
you think of the Ohio Territories.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.880
I mean, all of the
western states started off

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.270
as territory governments;
or most of them did.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:59.840
But what the territorial government
form did for the district,

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:06.170
it then -- and it had a
Presidentially-appointed governor,

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.750
Henry Cook, who was the
younger brother of J. Cook,

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.140
the financier whose 1873
Depression and failure

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:19.160
of his whole financial
caused a national depression

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.010
that damaged Shepherd
very badly personally.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:26.320
But the territory government
had an appointed governor,

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.850
an appointed upper house,
and an elected lower house.

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.840
And this may be familiar
to Washington residents.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.600
And a non-voting delegate
in Congress.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.870
Sounding familiar, right?

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:43.540
And so there was limited
representational government.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:50.720
But Shepherd, he had the
backing of the governor

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.130
who supported Shepherd's
role in what became the --

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.100
he became the Executive
Vice President

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.900
of the Board of Public Works.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:04.050
And this became his platform for
building the city's infrastructure.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.310
Shepherd in many ways --
not to close an analogy,

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:11.040
but in many ways was like, or I
should say not unlike Robert Moses

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.080
in New York City, New York State.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.930
Who for years was the czar of
the parkways and the tunnels

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.300
and the bridges throughout
the state, the legislation

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.600
for which he had written himself

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.460
when he was Al Smith's right-hand
man in Albany for a number of years

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.000
when Al Smith was Governor
of the state.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.300
And then Moses came to then later
occupy those key positions for most

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.550 position:56%
of the parkway and bridge and tunnel
commissions; it was just amazing.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.720
And Shepherd did much the same.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.110
He worked through and
developed the legislation.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:53.250
And then he ended up being the man
who implemented these projects.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:59.700
And so the Board of Public Works
was able to arrange financing

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.490
in the amount of six
million dollars, right?

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.870
Six million dollars --
quite a sum for the time.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.040
Vastly more than the
city had ever had,

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.010
let alone asked for from Congress.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:14.920
Three million or so was in
bonds that were sold mainly

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.080
in Western Europe in
some of the states.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:22.360
And about three million in taxes on
adjoining properties of people --

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.850
property owners who received water

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:30.230
and other services
through public piping.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.640
But that was sort of the good news.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:38.120
And the bad news, if you will,
was that Shepherd spent --

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.830
and no one seems quite
sure to this day --

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:45.100
roughly 18 to 20 million
dollars on public improvements.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:52.560
And by the end of 1873, '74 --
I mean, the city was in chaos,

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.450 position:56%
but I'll get to that -- but Shepherd
used this money aggressively.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:00.630
His approach was to tear
everything up all at once.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.420
He was going to build
the whole city.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.470
And so it wasn't just a
neighborhood here or a street there

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:08.010
or an intersection
here or a park there.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.960
I mean, he just tore everything up.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.980
And -- but the -- in
the process of --

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.440
I mean, he started off with
the best of intentions.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.490
You know, sound contracting
principles, careful documentation

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.800
of expenditures and all that.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.510
And then as the pace
of things increased

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:33.900
and as money became more scarce
and as the confusion brought

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:39.960
on by Shepherd's own lack of any
understanding of city planning.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.370
There was not a field
called "city planning"

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:47.480 position:56%
at the time; this is the 1860s, 70s.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:52.600 position:56%
Many things, including the
techniques of paving, street paving.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.010
All these things were in
a developmental stage.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.870
But Shepherd knew what he had
learned from running a business.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.760
And he applied these
principles and practices

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.100
as though he were still
running a business.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:08.680
In some cases it was okay;
other cases it was not.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.430
But so Shepherd, he tore up the --

00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:14.790
as I said, the whole
downtown infrastructure.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.960
The winter of 1871, '72 was
one of the coldest and earliest

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.590
and longest-lasting on record.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:27.560
And there are a couple of
pictures that I will, let's see,

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.930 position:56%
show you that will give you an idea.

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:32.460
This was Bleak House.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.930 position:56%
Not bleak at all but a very handsome
house in what is now Shepherd Park.

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:37.500
Torn down 1916.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.640
This was the out-of-town house

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:44.030
that Shepherd built
for his family in 1868.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:48.880
This was about 200 yards
east of where my wife

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.500
and I lived for some years.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.920
This is the -- if you can see
it, at the top of the building

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.840
in the center of the photograph,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.860
that says Alexander R.
Shepherd and Brothers, Inc.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.890
; this was the building he
built for his plumbing company.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:11.290 position:56%
And this was the parade -- there was
a parade along Pennsylvania Avenue

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.300
right at the foot of the building.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.680
It was at 9th and Pennsylvania
Northwest.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.920
And the parade was for the --
to celebrate the wooden block,

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.510 position:56%
successful completion of the wooden
block paving of Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:29.230
Because asphalt was just being
-- was in an experimental stage.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.870
Concrete was experimental.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:37.010 position:56%
But the gurus of street paving said,
aha, wood block paving is the best;

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:42.070
it's smooth, it doesn't hurt
the horses, it's not noisy.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.310 position:56%
And so Pennsylvania Avenue was paved

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:49.280
with the finest new wood
block paving blocks.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.520
Within three years, the
entire street had been torn

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.290
up because the blocks rotted
out, they were miserable,

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:59.310
they just -- it was a disaster.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:04.000
But -- and this is I think key
to a lot of what Shepherd did.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.510
He started things,
he got things going.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:10.800
He got a lot of it wrong like
some of the paving things.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.390
I mean, sewer lines
would sometimes be put --

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:15.640
watch me; would come
together like this.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.940
Not quite, you know?

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.240
And then they're supposed
to be like this.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.110
And one would be above the other.

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:23.110
I mean -- and they had to
be torn up and done again.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.030
Some streets were paved
before the sewers were put in.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.530
I mean, it was really quite --

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:33.600
it had to do with the pace of
infrastructure development.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:39.130
But also the fact that contracts
were let to all kinds of people

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.520
who had no business
being in the business.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.640
They, you know, they
were bakers or people

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.080
who ran a millinery
shop or something.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.770
And they would get a contract
and they'd usually flip it

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.270
at some profit to themselves.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:55.420
But they had no business
building streets and sewers.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.480
And so an awful lot of the
work had to be re-done.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.280
But the key thing was,
as Robert Moses later

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.250
on understood even better,
that once you start a project,

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:11.380
if the sewer doesn't quite work,
well alright, you don't, you know,

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.560
sod it over and say well, no sewer.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.030
No, you fix the sewer.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.990
And so Congress ended up paying.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.630
And that's where a lot
of the expenditures came

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.140
from of Congress in later years.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:28.970
Paying for replacing a
lot of this shabby work.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:30.770
Anyhow, I won't go on
too much more about that.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.700
But I'll say that there
were a couple of instances

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:39.040
where the results of Shepherd's
paving were quite noticeable.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.220
This is just a photograph
of the certificate

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.260
of President Grant
appointing Shepherd

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.420
as the Governor of the District.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:53.080
He was Governor for only nine
months, from September 1873

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.080
to June 1874 when Congress
cancelled territorial government

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:02.960
after $18 million expenditures;
the city was in an uproar.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:08.070
This was the very handsome
residence that Shepherd built

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.170
at Connecticut Avenue and K
Street Northwest right exactly

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.010
where Farragut North Station is.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:17.550
If you've gone down into Farragut
North Metro Station, that was --

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.470
you're going down into the
area that was the basement

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.310
of Alexander Shepherd's residence.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:25.470
But a very handsome house
designed and built by Adolf Cluss,

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:28.730
who was a German-American
architect who built a lot

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:30.030
of really elegant buildings.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:35.890
The Arts and Industries building
at the Smithsonian, Sumner School,

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.200 position:56%
Franklin School and Franklin Square;

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.060
these were considered really
the top of the line buildings.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.360
And he designed this --

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.800
he also designed one for
himself down the street.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.550
This right -- my favorite
photograph of all.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:52.350
This was one of the results of
Shepherd's grading operations.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:57.050
Because as I said, the city was
naturally hilly and up and down.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.280
And Shepherd level
graded the streets

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.320
for the first time in history.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.320
And a lot of streets, guess what?

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.450
Came down; some were built up.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.120
This is one that came
down about 20 feet.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.170
Look at this, there's
a ladder that goes

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:14.720
up from street level
up to the front porch.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:20.350
And the ladder is at least
as tall as the house is high.

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.240
And Shepherd was an equal
opportunity offender,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.070
in the sense of offending people.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:29.050
There were two senators -- one
from Delaware, one from I forget

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:33.170
where else, who had houses on
Mass Avenue at 15th Northwest.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.680
And they came back after
a Congressional recess

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.080
and found their very
elegant houses perched --

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.870
not quite as dramatically
as this -- but up on cliffs.

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:45.070
And they had to build ladders
to get to their houses.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.980
Other people came home
after a Congressional recess

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:54.700
and found their house down in a
gully and with this road soaring

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.500
over it that had been built up.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.040
And so there was major confusion.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.790
There were two major
investigations of Shepherd.

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:06.960
And I'll emphasize one point on
this, that they were extensive.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.570
One in 1874, one in
1872 before that.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.590
Every opponent of Shepherd with
any kind of a grief or any sort

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:19.130 position:56%
of an allegation, they were all
public, they were all in the record.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:24.640
But no personal corruption
was ever found for Shepherd

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.730
in all the research in the
District and in Mexico --

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.200
which I'll get to in just a minute.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.200
There was -- no personal
corruption was ever found.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:39.580
But in 1874, Congress cancelled
territorial government,

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.880
they basically fired Shepherd

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.180
and the whole territorial
administration.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.450
And instituted temporarily
for four years

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.870
and then permanently
in 1878, guess what?

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:53.230
The three-person
Presidentially-appointed

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.630
commissioner government,
of the original form

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.340
of George Washington's government.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.990
Shepherd was out of
a job, he was broke,

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:05.410
he declared personal
bankruptcy in 1876.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:10.350
He needed a new career.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:14.540
He was broke; he had gotten used
to being rich, not surprisingly.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:19.240
And he -- this is just one
more street grading scene.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:24.260
This is Duddington, the famous --
long torn down, but the famous home

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.440
of Daniel Carroll of Duddington;

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.020
this was their estate
right on Capitol Hill.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:34.330
And you can see this is -- I
mean, this is the wall right --

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:37.220
I'm going right up
to the home itself.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:45.070 position:56%
And that massive cut in the
embankment was to create a new road.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.930
Right, and then this was --
President Grant tried to --

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:53.520 position:56%
he nominated Shepherd for one of
the three commissioner jobs in 1874,

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.080
but the Senate turned it down.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.080
And this figure of Justice
in the doorway is saying,

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.310
well will have no more of this.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.360
Because it shows Grant reaching
down to pick up a newspaper

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.880
that has the name Shepherd on it.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.040
So there was a lot of
unhappiness with Shepherd.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.720
He regained much of his reputation
later on, but not at that time.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.490
So he was broke, he
was out of a job.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:21.060
This -- 1880 he had found
a new course of action.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.240
He raised money in New York to
buy a silver mine in Mexico.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.920
He knew nothing about silver
mining; he had never been a miner.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.850
Never -- he did go to Mexico
in 1879 for an inspection tour,

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:39.310
came back with stars in his eyes
about the prospects for this mine

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:44.510
in this little town called
Batopilas where he took his wife,

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:49.170
seven children, the youngest one 3
years old, the eldest 16 years old.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.460
In 1880 they went down to this
town of Batopilas which is

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.310
in Chihuahua State in the
western Sierra Madre Mountains,

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.820
Copper Canyon; it's
in Copper Canyon.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.260 position:56%
You can't get there by being lost;
you have to know where you're going.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.770
It's like Theseus and the
Minotaur; and with a string,

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:07.850
you have to have a string to find
your way in and find your way out.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:10.870
I spent about 11 days
down there in 2011.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.640
It's a wonderful story, but
the mountains come down --

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.340
and you'll see some pictures here.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.090
Anyhow, so I'm shifting
over to Mexico.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:18.830
This was what they
called the Hacienda;

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.310
this was where they
lived and worked.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:25.440
That's the guard tower to the
left, a very sturdy watch --

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.550
a front gate, administration
building.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:31.170
Very elegant buildings;
they built all these.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:34.730
And you couldn't -- everything
had to come in by mule

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:37.070
and down these zig-zag trails,

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:43.190
5,000 feet down into this narrow
river valley at the very bottom.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:45.450
This is a photograph, that bridge

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:49.650
across the river was built
by Shepherd about 1893.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:52.820
It's the bridge across
the river to this day.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:57.250
He built an aqueduct on the right
along the lower bank of the river,

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:03.380
brought water down three miles,
drove a hydroelectric transformer.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.450
Brought electricity to Batopilas.

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:09.380
It was said that Batopilas
was the second city in Mexico

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.020
after Mexico City to
have electricity.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.320
I mean, Shepherd was just --

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.300
he was a man in some
ways ahead of his time.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.930 position:56%
This was a photograph of the main --

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:23.460
of the whole silver mining
operation administration building

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.060
with the crenelated towers there.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.820
The watchtower would be just in
the far left of the building.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.920
Shepherd, the boss,
admiring his operation

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.930
from a probably somewhat
overburdened horse there.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:38.980
This is more -- just
another shot of it,

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.890 position:56%
of the main administration building.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:45.200
Silver ingots, they took these out
periodically by what they called

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:50.860
"conductas" [assumed]; these
were mule and burro trains,

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.730
highly efficiently organized that
went up over the mountain and up

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:57.240
to the city of Chihuahua,
where they were then shipped

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.340
on to the United States.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.810
The family, the Shepherd
family in Batopilas.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:04.360
You know, you saw that
elegant mansion at Connecticut

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.890
and K. They lived there in a --

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:12.370
it was a one-story
L-shaped adobe building,

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:16.820
which actually was the same
almost exactly as the predecessor,

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.140
the earlier owner of the mines
had lived in with his family.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:25.430
I mean, it was a very simple -- not
prim, but a very simple operation.

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.650
Mrs. Shepherd gushed
at one point about --

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:30.480
she had been away in the States
for the summer and she came back

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.860
and they had whitewashed the
interior of their residence.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:39.410
And she wrote glowingly
of this improvement.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:42.710
I mean, so -- but Mrs.
Shepherd, God bless her,

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:47.930
was a real stand-by-your-man
kind of lady.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:53.210 position:56%
And -- but it wasn't the exotic life
that many people back here thought.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:57.090
This is the administration
building today.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:01.150
When the Mexican Revolution
destroyed the mining operation they

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:02.720
kept -- hung on for a few years.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.480
And eventually closed
it by the late teens.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.720
The villagers stripped
off the roofs;

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.250
they were very good quality roofs.

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:11.880
Once the roofs were stripped
off of all the buildings,

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:17.790
then it was adobe brick, and
the weather just took it down.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:21.700
And this is the Alexander Shepherd
mausoleum in Rock Creek Cemetery

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.200
up by the old Soldiers' Home.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.500
Has anybody been up there?

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:25.800
I'm just curious.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.100
Okay, well several of you have.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.920
Alright, it's a lovely old -- very
gracious old cemetery with lots

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.020
of Washington figures,
well-known figures interred there.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:43.230
And several family members are
interred around the mausoleum.

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:44.660
Okay, just a couple
of quick comments

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.840
and then I'll turn it
over for questions.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.990
What happened in Mexico
was, however,

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.480
is Shepherd's expectations
were never met.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.400
He had planned to go down
there for about five years,

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.140
he said in his letter to his wife

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:59.620
when he was visiting
the mines in 1879.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:03.540
He said, five years down here and
I can basically make it all back.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:08.940
His intention was to come back
to Washington far wealthier

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.240
than he had been in Washington.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.870
He was going to show
all the naysayers,

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:16.830
the people who were critical of the
chaos he'd brought to Washington.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.670
But he did -- he had
built the infrastructure

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.660
of the city in three years.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.510
And that permitted Washington

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:28.660
to become the great national
capital we know today.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.100
But expectations were never met.

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.770
He came back in 1887,
partly to recover --

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.040
mainly to recover from a
near-fatal mine accident.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.250
The people of Washington in October

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:45.300
of 1887 gave him a huge
parade -- huge; sorry.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.690
A very large parade.

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:53.100
I truly apologize.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:48:02.060
And so -- and I think people began
to appreciate more what he had done

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.350
and what an important
contribution he had made.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:06.360
But I just want to close
with a couple of thoughts.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.850 position:56%
I've addressed the corruption issue;

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:11.380
I never found personal
corruption on Shepherd's part.

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:15.270
People around him made money; crony
capitalism, all kinds of things.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:21.700 position:56%
But Shepherd himself, he came out of
public service, public life in 1874,

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.130
territorial government ended.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:27.010
He came out vastly
poorer than he went in.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:32.380
Bankruptcy in 1876, I mean this
is not Boss Tweed up in New York

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:38.500 position:56%
after whom his critics named or hung
that label around Shepherd's neck.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.530
On the corruption thing, I
think he remained true --

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.350
and in Mexico he could have
embezzled from the company,

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.170
but he put all of his
own money back into it.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:51.220
He was counting on rising in
stock prices to make him wealthy.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:56.420
All kinds of issues, the
international silver market,

00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:02.050
exchange rates, the crash of
1893, national crash U.S.,

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.040
all these things thwarted
the ambitions.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.860
I do want to say, though, on
the sort of the assessment,

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:14.910
I personally feel that what he
did to build the infrastructure

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.510
of Washington was worth doing.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:20.080
There was a major cost, and
I don't want to downplay it.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.440
There is a book by Howard
Gillette, a former professor

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.410
at George Washington
University, wrote a book called,

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:28.790
"Between Justice and
Beauty" about Washington.

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:33.200
Justice being social justice
mainly for the Black residents.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:37.580
Beauty being the monumental core,
the lovely city that really sort

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.370
of more formally came out of
the McMillan Plan in 1901.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:45.050
But -- and Shepherd was
hands-down, he was for beauty;

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.600
he was for building the
elegant physical city.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.170
He really didn't care very much
about the issue of social justice.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.900
And I think that, and certainly

00:49:53.900 --> 00:50:00.800
in his mind beauty certainly
triumphed over justice.

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.710
In any event, that's the story.

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:04.010
The book is for sale.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:05.310
And I'll take any questions.

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:08.190
I apologize for perhaps having
gone longer than I might have.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:10.670
And I will repeat the
question, alright?

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:11.970
Yes?

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:13.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I have two questions.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.570
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Quick, quick.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:18.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: One, it sounds like
he was at the height of his career

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.230
in 1873 here in Washington.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:25.910
And I live on Capitol Hill.

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:27.740
Did he have anything to do with
the building of Eastern Market?

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.120
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Well actually,
Cluss designed the Eastern Market,

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.990
which actually I think
was built about 1874.

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:35.450
Short answer is, he himself didn't;

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:37.860
I don't think he was
involved at all with the --

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So he wasn't
dealing with the plumbing

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:41.970
and the sewers in projects?

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:43.270
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: No, he
was doing infrastructure.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:46.530
Sewers, water, trees, gas lights.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:48.200
In particular, paving.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.270
But the -- I think that
the Eastern Market --

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:55.280
and I'm sure you all know
more about it than I do.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.110 position:56%
But I think this was built by public
subscription and by other monies.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:01.410
But Shepherd was not involved.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:02.710
And the second question?

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:04.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And the
second question is,

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:08.560
you had made a reference of him
putting in thousands of trees.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.860
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Yes.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:11.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now,
there's no nurseries

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.460
out in Maryland to
provide the trees.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.760
How did he do this?

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.910
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Well,
okay, the question was,

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:19.960
how did he build the trees,
or where did they come from?

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:27.560
I mean, there were -- in 1960 I
worked for the highway department

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.140
of the District for a summer.

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:32.890 position:56%
And there was right across the East
Capitol Street Bridge there was a --

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:35.520
the tree division had
its headquarters

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.480 position:56%
and there was a small nursery there.

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.020
And so I think -- and
the B. F. Saul family,

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.880
the Saul family owned
vast orchards and farms

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.570
in Washington County just
north of Boundary Street.

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:50.400
So there was an awful
lot of undeveloped land

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.050
where they could plant
and grow trees.

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:55.350
Yes?

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:58.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A pair of questions
that relate to the grading.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.860
What did they do with the fill?

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:03.140 position:56%
Because some of it could clearly
have filled some of the bottom land.

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.440
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Yes.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The other thing is,
I had heard and read years ago

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:12.080
that there were something like
seven hills between the Capitol

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:17.520
and the bridge down there on
South Capitol Street [Inaudible]

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.200
and I heard a lot of that was
graded off and used as clay

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.840
to make the bricks in
building all the buildings.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.620
&gt;&gt; John Richardson:
Well that's interesting.

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Was that
contemporaneous?

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.220
Was that earlier?

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: The question is,
what was done with the fill that --

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.760
when he was cutting down these
streets and making these --

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.500
putting these houses up on cliffs?

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.390
I mean, and awful lot
was used to fill

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:44.530 position:56%
in the low spots; that's quite true.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:48.220
And to be honest -- and
it's a good question --

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:51.020
I don't know where
all the fill went.

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:54.130
My hunch is that there
were plenty of ways to --

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:58.630
opportunities to level things
out literally and figuratively.

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:01.750
But as to -- my hunch
would have been,

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:05.050
is that you wouldn't
have found surface clay

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:06.690
that would have been
suitable for bricks.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:07.990
I think usually -- I think of that

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:10.590
as being sub-surface
and you dig it up.

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:13.590
But I could be wrong about
that; others may know better.

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:17.470
But the fill got used; how's that?

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:18.850
Alright. Next.

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.150
Yes?

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:22.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I thought
one of your photos

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:28.770
of the unpaved streets
actually had automobiles on it.

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:30.070
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: No.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:31.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So I'm
wondering how late did most

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:34.480
of the streets in D.C. get paved?

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.620
&gt;&gt; John Richardson:
That's a good question.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.450
They were of course
paved and re-paved.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:40.290
I mean that's one of
the unpaved streets;

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.400
that's just soldiers
marching; that's Civil War.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And I can see a horse.

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:46.100
But there was a previous photo
where I didn't see any horses.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.500
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Well,
I mean, this is all horses

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.010
and carriages -- buggies.

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:50.310
Those are all buggies.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.610
This is about 1867, I think.

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:53.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So there are
horses, I didn't see them.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.700
&gt;&gt; John Richardson:
Oh, yes; no cars.

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: When were
most of the streets paved?

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.380
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Well, I mean
-- I think by probably by --

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:05.370
and a lot were re-done, I would
say probably by 1876 I would think

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:08.140
that they were paved and
re-paved quite adequately.

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:10.020
Because all the newspapers
were gushing

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.030
about this new
Newport-on-the-Potomac.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:14.120
And, you know, people
could come down in winter

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.240
in Washington instead
of wintering in Newport.

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And do you mean the
streets south of Boundary Road?

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:21.330
Or streets north of
Boundary Road also?

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:23.360
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Well,
Shepherd built out from the core;

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.270 position:56%
he built out from the business core.

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:28.160
He was a businessman; he was going
to take care of business first.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:33.820
But -- and he really slighted
Capitol Hill; trust me, that --

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.170
and developers and residents

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:40.710
of Capitol Hill just
howled to the moon.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:45.100
Because he was focused on sort of
the Connecticut Avenue corridor,

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:47.640
White House up to DuPont
Circle; that's where --

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:51.680
and F Street, G Street,
11th, 12th, 13th, downtown.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.770
But he -- and he moved out.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:57.740
And he didn't get everything
paved in his time.

00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:01.640
But I think it was all
graveled, it was all leveled

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.560
and graveled, if not paved.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So you're talking

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.620
about streets below
Boundary Road, then?

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.220
&gt;&gt; John Richardson:
Yes, but he also --

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.080
he worked on the major
connector roads.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.790
Georgia Avenue, 14th
Street, 7th Street Road

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:15.880
out toward Montgomery County;
because they were important

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.550
for bringing projects in
from Washington County.

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:20.850
Yes?

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: He died
in Mexico, correct?

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:24.990
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Yes; he died
-- but where did he die, and when?

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:26.290
Yes?

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:27.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Can you tell us --

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:31.410
I read that there was quite a
process to get the body back?

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.100
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Mm, it
was pretty straightforward.

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:38.570
I mean, he died of a ruptured
appendix in 1902 at the age of 67.

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:43.870
Two company doctors -- he brought
Americans and internal experts

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:48.020
down to the mines for
professional jobs like engineers

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.340
and doctors in particular.

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:54.140 position:56%
It just so happened that his four
daughters all married -- guess what?

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:57.110
Workers, doctors and
engineers at the mine.

00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:59.050 position:56%
That seemed to work out pretty well.

00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:03.830
But he died of a ruptured
appendix in 1902.

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:08.130
He was interred in a family
plot up on a very steep hillside

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:11.150
above the Hacienda; I visited that.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:15.180
But it was looted decades ago
during the Revolution, I'm sure,

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:19.520
Mexican Revolution, people hearing
about this fabulous of wealth

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.150
of Batopilas and Shepherd.

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:24.090
And so I'm sure that they
were looking for money,

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:27.980
but the sarcophagi are all smashed.

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:34.050 position:56%
It was about a year later that his
body was brought back to Washington.

00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:38.750
And then it was interred briefly
in the Crosby Noyes mausoleum.

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:42.460
The Noyes family owned the
Evening Star for generations.

00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:46.470
And then in 1874 they
completed his mausoleum

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:50.470
and he was re-interred there.

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:51.770
Yes?

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:53.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Did he
live, if ever so briefly,

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:56.410
in Capitol Hill on Mass Avenue?

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:57.710
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: No; no.

00:56:57.710 --> 00:57:00.570
He lived -- that's a good question.

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:07.750
He lived on 10th Street
for a number of years.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:10.730
There is a photograph in
the book but not here of --

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:19.840 position:56%
it was a very nice, standard but
large row house at 1125 10th Street.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.690
And then he lived on, I think,

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:24.600
L Street at Connecticut
for a couple years.

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:29.760
And then about 1873 he completed
the mansion, Adolf Cluss's mansion

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.290
at Connecticut and K
and moved in there.

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:36.450
But then almost -- very soon
thereafter, 1876, he had to turn

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:40.150
over -- he didn't sell it, but
he turned it over to trustees

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:44.430
and it was involved in very
complicated legal processes.

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:50.420
But they always kept Bleak
House, even after his bankruptcy.

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:54.280
And then able to come back
to it in the summertimes,

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.390
and the family would stay there.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:59.700
He never left, as I said,
left Batopilas only twice.

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.150
But the family came back for
schooling and health reasons

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:05.920
and many things in
the intervening years.

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.670
And then of course
he died in Mexico.

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:09.970
Yes? Either one.

00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:14.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Even the pace at which
he was working from '71 to '73,

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:17.950
for three or four years, where
did he get all the workers?

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:19.250
Did he bring people in?

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:23.380
Or was there just a huge
population explosion?

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.790
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Yes; I mean,
there were -- it's a good question.

00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:34.000
There were -- certainly the -- I
mean, there were lots of workers.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.670
There was a substantial
Irish-American population;

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:45.360
many laborers came from that group.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.660
Many Blacks.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.200
I think contractors I'm sure
brought in their own workers

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.050
from Maryland and Virginia.

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:55.910
The short answer is, I
don't know a lot about --

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:58.060
that's more in sort of the
social history side of it.

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.520
And I don't know as much about it.

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.710
But he -- there were issues about
salary scales and wages and all

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:06.010
that that I won't go into.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:10.890
But let's just say
he found the workers.

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:12.190
Yes?

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:14.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: I remember
reading that a lot of --

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:20.490
and you sort of alluded to the fact
that a lot of the development was

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:23.180
up around Conn Circle
and Mass Avenue,

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:24.780
all because he lived up there.

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:29.440 position:56%
But is it the fact that the downtown
[Inaudible] I think I remember

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.580
like 7th Street being --

00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.330
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Oh yes;
it was a major artery; yes.

00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:34.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: [Inaudible]
all of that?

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:35.930
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Yes.

00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:37.230
No, I mean, there was --
this wasn't either/or.

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:40.460
I mean, he was this sort
of do-it-all-at-once;

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:41.760
he certainly favored that --

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.250
what I'll call sort of
that Northwest axis.

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:49.300
But downtown and the Northwest
axis were the main things.

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.280
Pam, I think you want to --

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.580
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: [Inaudible]
close out.

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:53.880
&gt;&gt; John Richardson:
Alright; one more?

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.180
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: One more.

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:56.480
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: One more, tada.

00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.780
Yes, sir?

00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Hi; Shepherd is
remembered today for the heart

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:03.690
of Washington D.C., upper 16th
Street, Shepherd Park neighborhood,

01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:05.120
elementary school, etcetera.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.420
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Oh, yes; yes.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.720
Yes, I lived there; yes.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Why was
that area picked?

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:13.510
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: Well, because
you saw the picture of Bleak House.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:19.840
Bleak House was part of a
230-acre piece of ground

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.810
that Shepherd bought in 1867.

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:27.850
And then they built Bleak
House and they used it as sort

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:29.170
of an out-of-town residence.

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:34.020
But that -- so that's why
-- and there was a long,

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:39.480
winding road that went out to a
guard house or a porter's house.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.080
In fact, if any of you know
James Goode's, "Capital Losses,"

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.530
a wonderful book showing
buildings that no longer exist

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:49.050 position:56%
in Washington and what is there now.

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:52.990
And it shows the porter's
lodge at 7th Street Road.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:56.930
But that, anyhow -- so Bleak House
was part of that 200-acre piece

01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:01.770
of ground where they built it,
north of Walter Reed Hospital.

01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:06.460
And I lived there for 15 years,
very close to Bleak House.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:10.510
Okay, I think, Pam, you want
-- alright; thank you all.

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:16.720
[ Applause ]

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.510
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: So yes, we
would like to say thanks so much

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:23.280
to John Richardson for
his book and his talk.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.010
You certainly have made Mr.
Robey Shepherd come alive for us.

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:32.930
I took away from the talk that this
was a very fierce, determined man

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:35.530
who was committed to
make something happen.

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:38.280
Even if he bungled a little
bit, he was persevering.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.530
So I like to take lessons
away from these folks.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:41.840
So thank you very much.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.070
And just to mention that
if you have more questions,

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:48.850
John has been generous enough to
be over here to sign his books,

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:51.230
which are still available
for sale in the back as well.

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:52.550
&gt;&gt; John Richardson: You can't
leave without buying the book.

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:53.910
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Can't leave
without buying a book.

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:58.080
Matter of fact, he's going to lock
the door until you buy your books.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.730
Let me also acknowledge the
Center for the Book staff.

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:03.430
We've got Ann Bonney and
Deziree Arnaiz with us today;

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:04.890
wave your hands and say hello.

01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:07.490
For supporting and
planning this event

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.150
and helping us, so
thank you for that.

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:14.210
I can mention also that next month,
December 6th at noon we'll be

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:16.330
in Whittall with our
next author talk.

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:20.240
And the book, "Becoming Madison:
The Extraordinary Origins

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.910
of the Least Likely
Founding Father."

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:25.330
So we invite you back
to join us here at noon

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:26.890
in the Jefferson Building.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:29.620
And last but not least,
thank you so much

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.100
for being with us this afternoon.

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.680
Take care, and have a great day.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:39.330
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
