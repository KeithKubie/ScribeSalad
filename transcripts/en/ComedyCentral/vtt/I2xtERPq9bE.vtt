00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.503
All right,
in other political news,

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:06.640
Donald Trump is bad
at shaking hands. Take a look.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:11.378
-♪
-(laughter)

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.052
(laughter)

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:20.687
So, that c...

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.589
How is it going?
Hey, how's it going?

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:23.857
-Hey, how's it going?
-(laughter)

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:25.058
Hey, how's it going?

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.828
-(applause and cheering)
-What? What? What? What?

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.897
-What? What? What?
-Are you okay? -I'm okay.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.566
I'm powerful. I'm strong.
You see how strong I am?

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.268
I'm the strongest man
in the room.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.436
(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.474
-Oh, my God.
-That compilation by...

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.309
-(laughter)
-That's the art of the deal!

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:43.877
-(laughter)
-I'm okay.

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:45.412
That compilation
by VICE News is way better

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.147
than I thought it would be
when I heard

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.516
that there was a video
of Trump (bleep) dudes.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.618
(laughter)

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.420
It's totally different thing
than I thought it was.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.889
So, obviously this arm-wrestling
match... technique is...

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.257
It is some kind...

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.493
I'm sure it's something he read
about in a self-help book

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.628
that also tells you
to drink raw eggs

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:04.097
and visualize your penis growing
every morning.

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.733
-(laughter and groaning) -But
I'm gonna tell you something.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.836
That did not work
on maple-blooded hunk

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.104
and Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau, who...

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.040
-(applause and cheering)
-who...

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.975
He shut that down!

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:16.543
Shut down the incoming tugs

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:19.446
in one swift shoulder seize
this afternoon. Take a look.

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:24.518
Oh, stopped. It stopped.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.587
-Held it.
-(cheers and applause)

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.555
You can't...

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.793
This... Guys,
these hockey players.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.761
You can't...
throw them off balance.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:36.930
-They're used to being
on skates. -(laughter)

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:39.867
"The coach said we had
to shake hands after the game,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.802
but he didn't say
we had to like it!"

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.303
That's what those two look like.

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:45.105
So comedians, Trump's...
since Trump's

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.808
alpha ploy was counteracted
by Trudeau,

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.344
what's a Canadian power move?

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:51.778
Milana.

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.947
Affordable healthcare
for all of their citizens?

00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:55.749
HARDWICK: Oh, okay.
That's very good.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.484
-Points.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:00.020
Can't argue with that.
Tom Lennon.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:03.257
(in Canadian accent): Uh, hey,
USA, you don't think

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.792
that we already have
a sleeper cell inside of you?

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:07.561
(laughter)

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.196
Guess what. Give us one reason,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.798
and we activate
the Barenaked Ladies.

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:13.834
-(laughter) -HARDWICK:
All right. All right, points.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.470
-(applause and cheering)
-Very good. Oh, no.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:18.071
I can al...
I can almost hear that now.

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:21.909
The attack signal is...
♪ It's been...

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.544
(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:25.045
-♪ Chinese chicken...
-(laughter)

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.047
HARDWICK: ♪ Chickity China
the Chinese chicken ♪

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.049
♪ You have a drumstick
and your brain stops tickin' ♪

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:30.384
LENNON: I don't want
that song in my head!

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:31.752
I don't want
that song in my head!

00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:33.720
-We can't afford. We can't
afford it. -We can't afford it.

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:35.822
-We can't afford the (bleep).
-HARDWICK: And this one.

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:39.493
-And that's sad.
-All right, great. -(laughter)

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.862
Like Harrison Ford,
you're getting frantic.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.030
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:44.298
LENNON: Just speak it.
Just speak it.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.700
HARDWICK: Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Kyle, Kyle.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:51.638
-They got a whole city up there
called Regina... -(laughter)

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:54.575
...and we're not supposed
to laugh when they say it.

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:55.909
(laughter)

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:57.711
(applause and cheering)

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:57.811
HARDWICK:
Points for Kyle Kinane.
