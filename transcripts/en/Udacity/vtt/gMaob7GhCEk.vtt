00:00:00.255 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Alright Charles can you work out these numbers?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.260
&gt;&gt; I can. So the first one is pretty easy because

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.570
we did that once when we were talking a couple slides back.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.970
&gt;&gt; We did.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.400
&gt;&gt; We just look at the case where a storm is set to

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.911
be true. Those are, those two mega rows there and those are .25 and

00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:17.200
.4. We add that up and we get .65. We're pointing out that

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.474
since we know that S is .65, we know that not S is .35.

00:00:21.474 --> 00:00:21.906
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:25.330
&gt;&gt; Okay. Although that table really has two numbers in it, we only need one

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.560
of them.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.720
&gt;&gt; Right. Yes. Very good point.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.220
&gt;&gt; because it's constrained by needing to add

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.810
up to one. Then we do something similar

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.100
with lightning. We look at the cases where

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.340
lightning is true. And s is also true.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.544
&gt;&gt; Yep. There's just one case like that. Huh?

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.280
&gt;&gt; Huh, there is only one case like that.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.890
&gt;&gt; Right, but what we really want to know is

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.520
what's the probability that lightning is true given that storm

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.540
is true. So we need to think about both cases where storm is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.640
true and say of these, what's

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.720
the probability that storm...that lightning is true.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.997
&gt;&gt; And it's .25 over .65.

00:01:00.997 --> 00:01:01.565
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:04.349
&gt;&gt; Which is .385 rounded up.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.379
&gt;&gt; because you're a cowboy.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.010
&gt;&gt; Which means that... The probability of it, of

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.681
not L given S is one minus that or .615.

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.120
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.770
&gt;&gt; Okay. So we do the same

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.610
trick with probability of L given not S and we find the case where lightning

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.450
is true but storm is false and that's .05, or we have to do it out of

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.247
both cases where S is false and so it's .05. Divided by,

00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:35.548
point .05 divided by .35 which is, 1 7th. And 1 7th is

00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:40.810
approximately .143, rounded up. And so not L given

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.866
not S is .857.

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:45.620
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nicely done.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.840
&gt;&gt; I use subtraction in my head.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.754
&gt;&gt; In your head yeah, but it was like with carries and stuff

00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:53.560
that was nice. And right, so let's see. And, does these sorts of things

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.470
make sense. Of not a storm, it's kind of unlikely that we'll see

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.090
lightening. Or, if there is a storm,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.740
it's moderately common that we'll see lightening.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense. Okay, good. So, now we

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.850
do the same trick again with thunder. Except now, instead of

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.720
looking at L and S, we look at Thunder and, and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.200
lighting, so we need to look a case where thunder is true

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.890
and lightning is true, so that would be, point, that's all the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.436
cases where lightning is true, so it would be .2 divided by .25

00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:24.280
&gt;&gt; Alright and why are we looking at the case where storm is true?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.010
&gt;&gt; Why are we doing it? Because it's conditionally independent of storm.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.418
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter.

00:02:28.418 --> 00:02:31.190
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Information, so it doesn't matter which rows we look at.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.800
What matters is we look at a case where thunder and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.920
lightening are both true, and we compare that to thunder is false

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.770
and lightening is true. So that's this number. Those add up to

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.390
the 0.25, we get 0.2, over the 0.25, which is 0.8. Right.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.270
&gt;&gt; So it's very likely to hear thunder if you see lightning.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.490
&gt;&gt; That makes sense. And there's only a 20%

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.770
chance that you don't hear thunder when you hear lightning.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.560
&gt;&gt; It's lightning not thunder, yup. Mmhmm.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.500
&gt;&gt; And so we do the same thing in the case

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.330
where we have thunder and there's not lightning. So we find that row.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.630
&gt;&gt; Okay. Not lightning and there is thunder. There's one.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.128
&gt;&gt; Right and we do the same trick we did before and we get,

00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:12.334
.04 over .4. Which I think we did last time, actually, and we get .1.

00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:13.870
&gt;&gt; We did. So, if it's, if there's not

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.140
lightening out, it's very unlikely to hear thunder. Alright.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.400
&gt;&gt; Alright and just to drive this point home.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.690
That was great. Just to drive this point home.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.420
What if it was the case that it mattered what's

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.560
value storm had, how would we fill in this table.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.210
&gt;&gt; Well we'd have to look at a lot more rows.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.180
&gt;&gt; Well in particular we couldn't draw this kind

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.710
of belief network if that were the case, right?

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.840
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.520
&gt;&gt; Because it wouldn't be conditionally independent. So we'd have to draw

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.190
basically another edge. Here, and what that represents is that thunder, to work

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.494
out to what the probability of thunder is, you have to look at

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:47.005
storm and lightning, all the joint combinations of those to make it work.

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:50.250
&lt;&lt; And that grows exponentially as you add more and more data. &lt;&lt;

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.320
And that's right, and that's something that threw me when I started to look

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.910
at this, because the picture looks a lot like a neural net. Right? In

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.950
a neural net, you've got these nodes, you've got arrows going into the nodes,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.280
and when you have a bunch of arrows going into the same node,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.510
you just end up like adding all

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.570
those different influences together, weighted by what's,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.830
what it has on the weight. This

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.210
belief network representation is an entirely different

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.280
animal. In particular, now, what we're really saying is, to work out the value

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.950
of this node, you need to know what's going on

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.380
in all combinations of what the inputs are. And so,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.779
as you pointed out, so astutely, that grows exponentially as

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.030
you have more variables coming into the node. Higher in degree.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.980
&gt;&gt; Hm. So this is not just a network. It's

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.610
a graph. And so we can talk about parents and children

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.040
right? So, basically, the number of numbers you have to

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.850
keep track of is exponential in your number in your parents.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.310
&gt;&gt; I mean it's a, yes.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.270
Though it's not exactly a tree. Doesn't have to be a tree so the parents

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.120
relationships are kind of weird. Like in particular,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.850
if you use parent terminology in this graph,

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.650
what you're saying is that lightning has

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.150
one parent which is storm and thunder has

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.430
two parents which are storm and lightning. So

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.040
it's, storm is it's own grandfather and parent.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.990
&gt;&gt; So let me ask you a quick question, Michael. So earlier on when

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.460
you were describing this, this graph, I

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.870
noticed you used the word dependencies. You said

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.180
we're going to capture the dependencies.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.620
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.300
&gt;&gt; So if you erase the red line between storm and thunder,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.680
&gt;&gt; I'd be happy to.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.090
&gt;&gt; So you erased that, should I read

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.180
this as storms cause lightning, and lightning causes thunder.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.330
&gt;&gt; You can do that, but you would be wrong.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.060
&gt;&gt; Oh okay.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.740
&gt;&gt; You can not infer that there is a cause of relationship

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.910
just because there is an arrow between them. These arrows are just telling

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.250
us about the relationship between the probabilities and

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.470
not anything about the physically processes that underlie them.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.960
&gt;&gt; Okay so let me make sure I understand, what you are saying is, it

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.650
would be very natural to look at a belief network or a Bayesian net or a

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.570
Bayes Nets or graphical model. And read

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.310
the arrows as causes, and therefore read them

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.620
as talking about dependencies. But actually what's happening

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.700
here is that these things represent conditional independencies.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.670
So, it is not true that lightening is

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.680
dependent on storm and thunder is dependent on

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.080
lightening. So much as is the case that

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.720
storm and thunder are conditionally independent given lightning.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.708
&gt;&gt; That's, that is a good point. I guess I never really realized

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:08.730
that dependence. You use the word dependence.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.440
Sometimes it means a physical dependence. Like,

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.070
in the real world it's dependent.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.145
Here I'm just talking about statistical dependence.

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:17.860
It's really just talking about the fact that we can derive numbers from other

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.440
numbers, and not that You know things cause other things. So yeah, that's a

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.820
really good point. It seems like that was an easy place to get slipped up.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.820
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cool.
