00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:04.003
<i>- Welcome to Hickory,
North Carolina.</i>

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.463
Let me show you around.

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:07.215
Got my leg vise.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:10.510
Got it for Christmas
from my father a few years ago.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.679
Recently I transitioned
to propane.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.223
This is a triple burner,
like what we have on the show.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:18.518
It's the exact same forge,
brick-lined and everything.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.311
We've got
a hundred-pound anvil here.

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.856
It's nothing fancy,
but it gets the job done,

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.357
and what's really cool
about it,

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:27.152
it was in 1880
that it was made.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:29.696
Plenty of history behind it
as well.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.865
This is my triangle of death,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.159
just a continuous
circle of life,

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.078
always forge, anvil, vise,
forge, anvil, vise.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.371
Stay down.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.497
You know I'm gonna try
a little dancing.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.207
Might get hurt.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.668

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:47.714
I still work out of
a little garden shed,

<i>here in Alexandria, Virginia.</i>

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.010
I've got
a small homebuilt forge.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.845
I have a really nice hydraulic
forging press.

Simple little grinder.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.560

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.689
and we're here in
Bend, Oregon,

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.191
and I'm gonna show you
my home forge.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.776
This is where most of
the forging takes place.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.903
I have my bigger
Damascus forge here

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.113
and a couple little forges
that I'll move around.

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:13.782
So this is
a pretty simple forge.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.283
I just--it's configurable.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.952
So it's just a various mix
of fire bricks.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.913
So I use hard fire brick
for the base

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.748
and the first layer inside,

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.541
and that also gets hot
and holds the heat.

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.752
And then soft insulating fire
bricks for the rest of it,

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.712
'cause they're just
not structurally sound.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:29.088
Anvil's here.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:30.256
Big post vise.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.800
Brass wedge block.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.845
And that's pretty much
where most things happen.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.222

<i>in Turlock, California.</i>

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.229
I am a little bit limited
on what I have,

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.398
<i>since majority of my tools
are all farrier tools.</i>

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:48.858
So we've got my anvil,

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.860
which goes with me
pretty much everywhere.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.029
This is my forge.
I absolutely love it.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:54.531
It's a little
horse-shoeing one.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.324
I mean, it's
not anything crazy,

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:57.826
but it gets the job done.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.619
Stole the grinder from my dad.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.162
I also stole this from my dad.

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:03.790
He'll get 'em back
eventually maybe.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.251
And then I have
my welding set-up.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.418

Welcome to my shop in
Middlefield, Connecticut.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:19.222
The pros of having my forge
right in my backyard

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.599
are that I have
a 90-foot commute to work.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.602
I can come home for lunch.
You know, it's great.

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:28.857
The cons are that my boss is
kind of a jerk and he makes me

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.359
work all the time, even
in the middle of the night.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.070
It's a personal problem I have
to deal with.
