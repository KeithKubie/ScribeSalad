00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.520
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.820
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.120
My name is Nicholas Brown.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.460
I'm a music specialist
in the Music Division.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.100
Very pleased to introduce
you to Steven Isserlis.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:40.200
[Applause] Steven is, of course,
one of the world's great cellists

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.820
and he's a British extraction,
and we are very pleased

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.890
to have him return
here to the Library.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.570
He's performed here
several times including

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.620
at the living legend
award presentation

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.980
to Marta Casals Istomin pretty
recently, and he's also a mainstay

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.360 position:56%
on the DC concert circuit whether
he's with Washington Performing Arts

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.600
or Kennedy Center or
here at the Library.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.530
You have proven to him that
you love him, so we're pleased

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.830
to capitalize upon that tonight.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.750
So we're just going to have an
informal chat here from Steven

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.910
about his experience with the
repertoire that's being performed

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.900
today, also about his time at the
Library, and then we'll open it

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.260
up to your questions, and Steven,
what has your day been like?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.120
I know you had a chance to see
some of our manuscripts earlier.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.230
Can you share some
thoughts about those?

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.530
&gt;&gt; Steven: No.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.830
[Laughter]

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.130
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Okay.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.430
&gt;&gt; Steven: No, they were wonderful.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.730
They were wonderful.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.940 position:56%
Some interesting cello music, Karini
and some other less known figures.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.740
That was interesting,
but, of course,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.140
I suppose the highlight
was the Schelomo by Bloch.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.080
It's lovely to touch, but
the best thing was the Brahms

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.550
and Schumann manuscripts,
and they touched this paper.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.990
They wrote on this paper.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.790
It's like being in
touch with the gods,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.400
and somebody was standing there who
works here says, "It never fails

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.380
for us, that feeling, as well.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.000
It never lessens."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.700
So that was exciting.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.000
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Were there any-

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.060
&gt;&gt; Steven: And I had a roast
beef sandwich for lunch.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.360
[Laughter]

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.660
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Very good.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.230
Were there any kind of insights
in the scores and manuscripts

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.670
that you saw in terms of
things that are different

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.970
in the published editions?

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.270
&gt;&gt; Steven: No.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.780 position:56%
I noticed there wasn't at all in the
Bloch, the piece I've played most.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.690
What is very hard to
read, the Schumann,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.990
but that was very interesting

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.680
because the piece they showed
me was the [inaudible] piece,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.780
which I have actually played in
the Piatti arrangement for cello,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.200
[inaudible], and so
many crossings out.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.530
There's almost another piece there.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.430
I'd love to have a really sort
of true Schumann scholar go

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.780
through that and make a new edition

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.890
because that would be
very interesting, I think.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.270
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Speaking of scholars,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.740
you have written a recent
book, correct, on Schumann?

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.140
&gt;&gt; Steven: "Correct on
Schumann," it is not called.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.370
No. [Laughter] Yes, I have, but
they're not speaking of scholars

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.670
because I'm not a scholar.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.060
I'm just an enthusiast, and, yeah,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.800
it's coming out in
America, which is nice.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.100
September.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.700
It's basically-Schumann wrote,
he wrote a book of advice

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.980
for young musicians, and I read
it many times over the years, and,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.990
well, a few times over the years,
and thought it was very nice.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.110
Lovely, of course,
Schumann, but it sort of--

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.060
I started writing little bits
of advice for young musicians

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.520
on my sort of official
Facebook page,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.350
and I was amazed by the response.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.300
I mean, I just wrote something
on the train last week, and I,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.820
over 1400 people liked
it or whatever.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.730
I mean they, musicians, young
musicians are really eager

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.340
for advice, and I think some of
them don't get it, I have to say.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.470
So, of course, what Schumann
says makes such perfect sense,

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.260
but it was in a very antiquated
translation, and also he's speaking

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.310
to a sort of person
who hardly exists now.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.580
So, what I did, I sort
of-it said, "Revisit."

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.180
The title is "Robert
Schumann's Advice

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.830
for the Young Musicians
Revisited," by Steven Isserlis,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.810
and I sort of just
updated everything I could.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.110
It's a huge commentary.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.970
I suppose 75 percent of the
book is by me commentating

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.030
on Schumann's wisdom and just
sort of making it, I hope,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.640
more relevant for what we call
the YouTube generation, and just,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.570
you know, trying to
reinforce his message in a way

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.470
that I hope young musicians today

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.400
and all the musicians
might understand.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.800
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Are there any specific
themes in his overall message?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.020
&gt;&gt; Steven: Well, it's-I
mean, I suppose what shines

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.970
through the book most is his
absolute deep, pure love of music,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.640
and that's what I try and reinforce
and say it's not about the career.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.380
It's not about being a success.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.680
It's not that.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.980
It's about the music.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.280
It's about the music.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.580
It's about the music.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.220
You just have to love music
and never let go of that, and,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.240
of course, many more specific
things, but that is, I think,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.830
the overriding message that I got
from my teachers over the years

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.260
and I get from Schumann,
and I try and pass on.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.870
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: You've also
written some other books.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.170
&gt;&gt; Steven: I have.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.470
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Can you
share those with us?

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.770
&gt;&gt; Steven: No.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.600
No. [Laughter] All right.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.430
Mind you, you did promise me a
cup of tea, which has not arrived,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.860
which for an Englishman is torture.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.160
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: I know.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.460
I'm sorry.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steven: Trying to convince myself

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.180
that it's actually the afternoon
still even though I just called my

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.640
girlfriend in England, and
she was falling asleep.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.080
It wasn't a good reminder for my
body, but actually it's midnight.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.450 position:56%
Yeah, I wrote two books for children

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.360
and which have actually never
have been published in America,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.190
although one could get them here,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.780
and one is called "Why
Beethoven Threw the Stew,"

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.020
and the other is called "Why
Handel Waggled His Wig,"

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.970
and they're both books
are about six composers,

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.580
and it's just really telling the
lives of the composers for children

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.340
but trying to do it as
accurately as I can, as I could.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.390
They were originally written
for my son, I suppose,

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.500
but then it became something
bigger and just, you know,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.850
without distorting the facts.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.410
You don't have to.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.570
Composers were such
fascinating people

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.610
who had such fascinating lives.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.490
You don't have to exaggerate
or distort or fantasize.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.790
It's all there.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.720
They had amazing lives, and,
you know, one of my purposes is

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.320
to introduce to get the children
interested in these people

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.950
and therefore in their
music, and, as I say to them,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.350
they'll have friends for life.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.330
You know, great music
never lets you down.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.450
It can always be with you
no matter where you are,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.250
no matter what's going
on in your life,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.240
if you have music,
it's a life saver.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.320
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Are there any specific
masterworks that you reference

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.660
in those books for the children?

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.670
&gt;&gt; Steven: Well, you-it's
sort of made up, first of all,

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.660
I do the life, and I do
specific, there's another thing

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.370
where there's little bite
sized stories from their life,

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.230
and then there's a little bit
about the music at the end,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.370
and I suggest what
the children might

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.170
like to listen to,
and I was very happy.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.620
Once in Cleveland, Ohio,
somebody came up to me and said,

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.130
"Every night we listen to one
of the pieces you recommend."

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.690
I thought, "Yes, that's
what I want."

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.990
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Awesome.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.290
&gt;&gt; Steven: Awesome.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.590
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: I'm from Boston.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.890
Sorry.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.190
&gt;&gt; Steven: Oh, don't worry.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.490
My son went to the
American School in London.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.260
Then he went to the
university over here.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.870
I hear the word "awesome" a
lot, but it's a nice word.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.170
It's positive.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.470
It's better than "like."

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.770
I hear that as well.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.150
I was in a taxi today, and
it said "rate you ride."

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.250
Isn't that "rate your ride?"

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.090
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Well, they
probably gave up and were

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.200
like this way they can't
say it's the wrong "your."

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.880
[Laughter]

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.810
&gt;&gt; Steven: I guess.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.030
Interesting point of view.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.330
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Optimism, somehow.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.630
I don't know.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.930
Too long in the government.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.510
Awesome. The repertoire
this evening.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.810
&gt;&gt; Steven: Yes.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.110
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: What are
your thoughts on kind

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.410
of the connections
between the works?

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.710
&gt;&gt; Steven: Well, if I'm honest,

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.990
there are fewer connections
than I would have liked.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.460
I did originally offer a
program all from Paris,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.620
and you said you already
had two of the pieces,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.010
so we couldn't play them.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.590
Not placing blame anywhere.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.680
[Laughter] However, for the rest of
the tour, which is like two weeks,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.730
we're doing a Parisian-based
program, but it's slightly sort

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.890
of watered down tonight in
that way only by the fact

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.840
that we're including Shostakovich's
sonata because we did just play it

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.980
in Belgium a couple of weeks ago.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.880
So that's what we start.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.180
Anyway, it's a masterpiece.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.740
I have no objection, but it does
take the central sort of theme

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.200
of the program away, but
then, you know, Shostakovich

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.790
and Martinu together
within ten years--

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.320
actually within about
five years of each other.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.530
So that I think has gotten an
interesting sort of mixture,

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:57.620 position:56%
and Shostakovich, which is much more
ironic and Martinu knew much more,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.560
sort of, all out dramatic
and traumatized.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.490
I mean, Martinu's sonata
was written at a time

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.450
when his homeland was being
overrun by the Nazis, and also,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.280
which I only discovered
comparatively recently,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.470
when he was having a torrid
affair with his gorgeous student,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.920
Kapralova or [inaudible].

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.910 position:56%
I don't know which, and he was about
to run away to America with her.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.160
I didn't know that until after I'd
recorded the sonatas, [inaudible].

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.890
At least I got to write
it in the sleeve notes.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:31.810
So I think both outwardly and
inwardly, Martinu was having

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.780
such a traumatic time, and you
really feel it in the sonata.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.140
I think it's an incredible
master-They're both incredible

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.820
masterpieces, and then
after the interval,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.840
we do two very little
pieces by Renaldo Hahn,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.370
but I find them charming.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.900
They're called "Improvisations
on Irish Melodies."

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.390
I wouldn't have called
them improvisations.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.690
They're really just settings

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.920
of the Irish melodies,
but I love Renaldo Hahn.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.440
He's sort of mostly remembered now

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.650
because he was Marcel
Proust's boyfriend,

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.690
but he was a lovely composer.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.480
In fact, Jeremy Dink, with whom I
played when I first played here,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.640
he introduced me to the
music of Renaldo Hahn.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.940
It's wonderful.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.280
It has just actually
been republished,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.220
this and his variations for cello.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.160
I wrote the introduction for it.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.550
It's, you know, as I said, it's
really tiny, but it's lovely,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.320
and there and for me
the greatest, well,

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.820
one of the two greatest
twentieth century cellists

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.350
and artists we're playing.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.650
It's by Faure.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.760
Gabriel Faure is number two.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.240
You're not going to ask
me what the other one is.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.540
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: [inaudible]

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.840
&gt;&gt; Steven: Yeah, [inaudible]
is number one.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.420
Faure, I'm an absolute
Faure nut myself.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.540
He's named Gabriel partly
because of Faure and, you know,

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.540
Faure I just think is underrated

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.330
and these sonatas are not often
played still, and for me they are,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.500
you know, of course, I love
the pieces in the first two.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.550
I adore them, Martinu and
Shostakovich, but Faure is just

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.520
on the highest level of music
for me, the second sonata.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.740
I hope we can convince
you tonight of that,

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.090
and actually Marta
Casals is coming tonight

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.390
and I had dinner with
her last night.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.550
I said, "Your husband
didn't play sonatas."

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.850
She said, "Yes, he did."

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.560
"I don't think so," I said,
and she looked very guilty

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.650
as well she might even though
she wasn't anywhere near born

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.560
at the time he might
have played them.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.020
I think that is astonishing.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.920
His music never touches the ground.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.660
He was completely frail, old,
stone deaf when he wrote them,

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.340
and yet his music just
flies in the air.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.340
It's got this ecstatic feel, and
the slow movement is gorgeous.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.890
It was originally written actually
for Windburn to mark the centurial

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.860
of Napoleon's death, but it
goes beautifully on the cello.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.910
It's a bit like his famous
eulogy for cello, but to me,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.590
much more moving because it's
got more contrast and it's more

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.690
of a-even more of a
story to it, I think.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.830
I just-this music, I play Faure
sonatas as often as I possibly can

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.260
because it's like a mission
for me to convince people.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.840
So don't worry.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.810
People can be honest with
me afterwards and tell me

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.800
that they don't like them,
but I'll just commit suicide,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.930
but don't feel bad about it.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.500
[Laughter] And then finally we
finish with Mr. [inaudible] piece,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.790
which I'll probably introduce
from the stage because I quite

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.360
like doing that, and that also
is an extraordinary piece,

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.650
and the Paris connection
there is, that last move,

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.220
is the can-can, can-can macabre.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.520
He's amazing, Tom.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.800
I mean he just-he takes
things from everywhere.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.620
He adores Faure like I do.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.610
I thought that was one of
the first bonds between us.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.490
That's partly why we became
friends because of our love of,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.940
shared love of a late
Faure, but he takes it

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.930
from everywhere-[inaudible],
Janocek,

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.480
from jazz, from pop, everything.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.970
He'll take anything, and it
comes out as his own language,

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.540
and that's an extraordinary
gift for a composer.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.180
I think he just got it.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.890
Some people have it,
and he does, I feel.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:04.540
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Is his musical
voice the same as operas

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.650
versus his instrumental
chamber music?

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.330
&gt;&gt; Steven: It's not the
same, but there are elements.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.630
There's definitely shared DNA.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.450
I haven't heard-of course, the
new opera premiers in London.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.750
I know was in Salzburg already,

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.390
but it premiers the night we
play his piece in San Francisco.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.080
So, of course, I can't go.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.380
I was just offered half
price tickets for it

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.190
in London, and I can't go to them.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.610
I'm suffering deeply.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.730
[Laughter]

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.130
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Great.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.050
What would be one of the
musical surprises this evening?

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.180
Is there a moment in any of the
pieces that we should all-- ?

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.030
&gt;&gt; Steven: I could get lost, or
like you're playing incredibly

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.770
out of tune, or maybe
that's not a surprise.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.530
I don't know.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.070
Well, I think every piece actually.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.700
I mean there's only
really one famous piece

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.300
on the program, which
is Shostakovich.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.090
I mean, when I say famous, I
mean played very, very often,

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.890
and that's the first piece.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.740
So I think for most people here,
I'm probably right in saying

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.530
that they'll be least-Well,
I don't believe anybody

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.180
who tells me they've
heard the Renaldo Hahn

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.830
because I think it's only been
played once in the past, you know,

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.510
75 years, and that was by me,
and I made a wrong entrance.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.310
So it hasn't really been played.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.970
So tonight's sort of the premier.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.530
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Yeah, there you go.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.370
Earlier you were mentioning
your-some thoughts

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.240
about the relationship
between artists, the audience,

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.370
and the industry, that kind of
thing, and some opportunities

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.020 position:56%
for growth in the musical community.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.320
&gt;&gt; Steven: I was?

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.620
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Yes.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.920
&gt;&gt; Steven: What did I say?

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.220
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: You said that
we need more listeners.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.520
&gt;&gt; Steven: Ah, we do.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.210
No, I mean, I said we need more
listeners than we do players.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.540
That's true.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.840
I see, in that other interview.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.140
Yes, that's right.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.900
We do. We need a thousand listeners
for every one player really

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:52.410
or one soloist anyway, and yes,
I mean, it's a-I also said-

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.470
and I say this repeatedly
in the book.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.770
It's not about being a soloist

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.780
because I don't consider
myself particularly a soloist.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.250
I consider myself a chamber
music player, and I play a lot

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.260
of concertos because, you
know, and that is chamber music

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.140
on a large scale, and that's what
I encourage all the people who pass

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:12.490
through my evil hands to consider
themselves, you know, you know,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.640
and my sort of younger
brother, Joshua Bell,

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.530
he also considers himself
a chamber music player.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.580
I mean it's just you have
to play louder, of course,

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.360
when you play with orchestra,
but it's still the same thing.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.070
It's passing from one
voice to another.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:30.380
It's conversation, and that goes
all through music, and yeah,

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.790
I also said that some of the
greatest musicians I know,

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.260
in fact a lot of them,
are not soloists.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.560
They're teachers.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.860
They're in orchestras.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.160
They're a chamber music
player, you know,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.280
as in an established chamber
ensemble, and even listeners,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.490
some listeners I know who
understand so much about music,

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.350
actually even Connie, Connie Shih,
the pianist I'm playing with,

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.560
she's got this adorable
6-year-old daughter, Amalie,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.320
and she was listening to the
rehearsal today as she often does.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.620
There's no babysitter.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.180
She just sat on the stage
and did some things,

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.710
and then with her hands she was
describing the music we were

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.890
playing perfectly.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.810
You know, it's not about career.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.110
It's not about anything.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.410
It's about music.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.110
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: So if you
were approaching someone

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.960
who has never stepped
into an art music concert,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.390
how would you engage them and
try and get them in the door?

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.380
&gt;&gt; Steven: Well, I wouldn't
call it art music for sure.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.680
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Well, classical.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.960
We're trying to move
on from that one.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.260
&gt;&gt; Steven: No, no.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.560
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Good music.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.860
How about that?

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.160
&gt;&gt; Steven: I'd say you're going

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.460
to hear stories basically,
I mean, especially.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.760 position:56%
Actually, it's a good thing to start
with a Shostakovich because it's

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.190
like a ballad, the first
particularly, but the whole piece,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.670
it's like a collection of stories,

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.730
and I mean that actually
goes for every piece tonight.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.560
Perhaps in a way the Faure a little
bit less, but it's different.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.240
It's more sort of a portrait of
nature, the [inaudible] ones, but,

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.220
yeah, I would say you're
going to hear humor

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.250
or you're going to hear drama.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.620
You're going to hear
exquisite beauty.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.250
I mean in the music, not
the playing, I would say,

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.670
and you're going to hear a range

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.350
of voices telling you this
very, very different story.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.250
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Do you have any
upcoming recording projects?

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.740
&gt;&gt; Steven: I've got a recording
coming out of Haydn concertos,

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.690
which is the first time I've
ever directed an orchestra

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.590
for a recording.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.840
So I hope that's all right.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.370
[Inaudible] orchestra
and Haydn and CP Bach,

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:29.670
I just think extraordinary piece,

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.740
and then little pieces
by Bacharini and Mozart.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.360
So I hope that's coming out.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.790 position:56%
That's the next one to come out, and
then I've got with Connie actually,

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.340
first recording with Connie,
with whom I do more concerts

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.690
with than any other pianist.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.450
We, I think probably next year
we've got a recording coming

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:49.180
out of First World War music
and including some little items

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.420
at the end, which I
played on a trench cello,

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.960
which is this little box.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.190
I think it's called a
holiday cello originally,

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.910
and then this soldier took it
into the trenches and played it,

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.210
and there's an inscription inside

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.290
from a famous poet whose
name I always forget.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.590
It wasn't [inaudible].

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.040
It wasn't [inaudible], and
it wasn't Rufus Wainwright.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.370
It was somebody.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:14.960
[Laughter] One of those
First World War figures,

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.640
and it's this beautiful
little sound.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.270
A friend of mine, Charles
Baer, who I'm sure you know

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.850
because he's the world's leading
expert on string instruments,

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.150
he just told me about this thing.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.100
I said "I've got to see it," and
I went and tried it and this sad,

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.930
soft little sound came
out, and I loved it,

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.800
and so I thought I'd record on it.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.200
So we're doing normal, first of
all, more rapid Frank Bridge,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.560
Debbie [inaudible], Veburn,
and Faure Number One,

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.960 position:56%
and then four little pieces like our
First World War pops, popular song,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.010
and a hymn, and "The Swan."

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.720
That was quite ambitious
for this little cello,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.220
but I haven't heard it yet.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.090
I hope it comes off because
it's lovely, this little thing.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.390
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Neat.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.530
We actually just opened a big First
World War exhibit, which has a lot

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.440
of items from both
the music collections,

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.090
more on the American side.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.630
So like "Over There,"
the George Cohan song,

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:12.810
and even a German soldier's
helmet, which is kind of intense,

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.910
and propaganda posters
and that kind of deal.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.210
So I encourage all
of you to check it

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.710
out upstairs during
the regular hours,

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.570
and we also have a
wonderful digital presentation

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.070
of the exhibit including
some footage

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.650
from World War I, video footage.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.660
&gt;&gt; Steven: Prepare us for
the upcoming World War III.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.960
[Laughter] Sorry.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.260
I don't mean to cast a
pawl on this evening.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:40.460
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: On that note, we
will open it up to Q and A.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.040
So if you have a question
for Steven,

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.030
if you wouldn't mind just raising
your hand, and my colleague, Jay,

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.980
will bring a microphone to you.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.380
&gt;&gt; Audience: Hi, Steven.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.680
&gt;&gt; Steven: Hi.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.030
&gt;&gt; Audience: So I was wondering
when you are approaching a piece

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.670
for the first time
and say it's something

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.530
with piano or-I don't know how
if you're a piano player as well,

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.090
but how do you study
the classical scene?

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.040
So I always have this problem of-I
focused on my part, but then I kind

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.010
of forget what's going
on at the piano,

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.740
and a lot of your musical
advice, I think, to all musicians,

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.950
and you're always emphasizing that
like the story that's going back

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.250
and forth between those things.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.470
So I was wondering how you if
you're coming into something cold,

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:30.000
how you kind of integrate
kind of both voices?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.670
&gt;&gt; Steven: Well, I deal
with that in the book.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:36.030
I say that every musician
really should play the piano

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.600
because you have to
know the whole score.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.570
You have to know the
piano part and, you know,

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.460
how ever many parts there are,
you have to know them all.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.830
Otherwise you're like an actor
only knowing one part in a play,

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.370
and so you're not going
to get the story.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.440 position:56%
So, yeah, I work a lot at the piano.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.740
It takes me hours often.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.820
I just play, and it
makes such a difference.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.120
Well, it makes all the difference.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.850
I couldn't really learn
a piece without.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.350
Occasionally if it's a
[inaudible] modern score

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.590
and it's just too complicated,
then I unwillingly have to listen

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.940
to a recording, but
I'd much rather not.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.020
But no, absolutely.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.320
Go to the piano with songs.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.710
Absolutely, go to the piano.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.220
Yeah. Understand the harmonies

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.550
because that's what the
composer was thinking about,

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.910
and ask yourself first of
all what has he written?

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.970
You need a good edition always,
and that makes a huge difference,

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.210
and then why has he
written or she written it,

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.850
written it, written that?

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.220
Every marking there's a reason.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.490
The composer's hands don't just
twitch and they write a piano

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.410
or an [inaudible] or
an accent or whatever.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:37.860
They mean it, and, yes, it's fun
to get the sort of little messages

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.080
from the gentleman behind the
screen there, Mr. Beethoven.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.380
Hundreds of years.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.850
Every marking he puts
makes such a difference

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.590
if you actually look at it.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.950
Try to think what he wrote.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.830
As my friend Olli Mustonen
says, "These are messages

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:55.710
from one good musician to
another," and I like that.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:02.450
He also came out with
a great-Oh, yes.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.910
[Applause] Thank you.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.380
It's got whiskey in it.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.990
[Laughter] Yeah, Olli also
came out with a brilliant thing

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.290
which I hadn't thought of.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.800 position:56%
He said, "People who say they're
scared to come to classical concerts

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.990 position:56%
because they don't know enough about
it are like people who are scared

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.250
to go for a walk in the forest
because they don't know enough

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.950
about botany," which
I think is great.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.800
I love that.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.950
That was slightly off topic,
but anyway, so the piano.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.250
Yeah, everybody should
play the piano.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.230
I play the piano very badly
but enough for my purposes.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.950
&gt;&gt; Audience: Could you tell us
something about your instrument?

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steven: Yeah, the instrument I'll
be playing tonight is the Marquis de

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:48.020 position:56%
Corboron Stradivarius of 1726, which
was owned for all of her career

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:54.670
by Zara Nelsova, and so she
probably played here, I presume.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.700
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Probably.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.420
&gt;&gt; Steven: [Inaudible]
Yeah, it's my great uncle.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.480
[Laughter] No, I love
this instrument.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.400
You know, it's not the
only instrument I play.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.770
For some music because
I have, of course,

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.240
my beloved old style gut
strings on it, which are perfect

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.520
for most music, I think, including
Shostakovich, which, of course,

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.230
would have been written
for gut strings.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:27.860
The Shostakovich sonata, but
if I really want steel strings,

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.370
which is as it sounds,
a harder steely sound,

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.120
then I have another cello that
I have with steel strings on it,

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.510
but this is the cello I use
most because it's an aristocrat.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:24:20.120
[ Inaudible question ]

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.130
First question, I can't think

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.950
of a better expression
than classical music.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.620
It's very limited, but I think
it's probably less off putting

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.720
than art music.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.190
I don't know.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.070
Of course, nowadays the
boundaries are blurred anyway,

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:41.290
but I mean I'd love it if somebody
came out with a better expression.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.680
I mean, art music.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.800
It could-I think that
sounds a bit precious.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.540
I think classical music is
slightly better than that,

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.990
but it's not perfect, and as
for women composers, well,

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:56.030
there are now many
wonderful women composers.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.560
In the past I think
it was a social thing

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.750
that they were discouraged
from studying it.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.100
They were discouraged from
performing, and through performing,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.850
of course, you became
more confident.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.680
You tried things out.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.010
They were discouraged from playing
with famous people, you know,

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.310
because they couldn't perform.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.610
They couldn't play
with famous people

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:15.910 position:56%
who could have influenced them well.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.830
So I don't-- I can't think
of any great women composers.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.130
I know some fine ones.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.120
I think Laura Schumann
wrote beautiful music.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.710
Fanny Mendelssohn, too, and of
course in the past, Hilda Bingen

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.020
and Chaminade, and there
are a few actually.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.280
French ones who wrote some
really beautiful music,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.940
but I think it's changed finally
or it's changing very much now,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.890
finally, as it is with conductors,

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.670
and now finally we're getting
some really great women conductors

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.910
and composers just
because of social things.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.060
There were always great women
players, I think, but, again,

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.790
they were-we don't hear so
much about them, you know,

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.270 position:56%
history books because they were
discouraged from performing so much,

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.360
and that's just an
unfortunate fact of history.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.780
I would have loved to have
heard [inaudible], for instance,

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.920
who only played so beautifully than
she who didn't write the Sicilian,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.930
which is her most famous
piece, but she didn't write it,

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.060
but I think you hear a few
descriptions of people,

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.790
but they played in private.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:21.930
So I think that's the reason, but
it's-I'm glad things have changed,

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:26.360
and certainly, you know, I think
isn't it 50/50 now with players?

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:34.090
And soon will be with
conductors and composers, I think.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.010
&gt;&gt; Audience: One of the very
best concerts I have attended

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.950
in the past few seasons was the
one that you and Robert Levin did

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.940
of Beethoven music at the
Kennedy Center a few seasons back

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.590
with Robert at forte
piano, and then, of course,

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.210
you issued a wonderful CD
set with all the cello music.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:50.510
I was just wondering-

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.810
&gt;&gt; Steven: I like you.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audience: If you and he have
discussed doing any other repertoire

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.430
with forte piano accompaniment
because it was just so wonderful.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.830
&gt;&gt; Steven: Thank you.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.980
Yeah, we have a bit,
but then, I don't know.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.820
It's just endless.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.990
I think that's my-if I had to
choose one favorite thing I do

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.060
in concerts these days, it's that
cycle where we do the whole cycle

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.620
with forte piano, and I sort
of don't feel like moving

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.970
on because I just, I want to do
it again and again and again, but,

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:21.320
having said that, last Saturday,
the week before, I gave a recital

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.790
at [inaudible] on an 1847
Stryker piano, and we did Chopin

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:32.030
and friends, and that was
a beautiful instrument,

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.450
and I love to do a Mendelsohn
with that instrument.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.550
I love to do Schumann with
that instrument, Chopin.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.180
Hopefully later this year we're
recording the Chopin sonata

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.410
with Chopin's own piano, one
of his players, and so yeah,

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.470
and then in fact the next
year I'm going to come back

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.340
to Washington the harpsichord
with Richard Egarr,

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.110
who I think is wonderful.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.410
He's great.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:56.220
I remember once in the rehearsal,
I said, "It would be nice

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.520
to have a crescendo here

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.820
on the rising sequence,
but you can't do it.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.520
You can't do it because you're
on the harpsichord, can you?"

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.100
And he took me and said a word
I won't repeat here, [laughter]

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.720
and he did a crescendo
on the harpsichord.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.020
I still don't know how he did it.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.540
I remember I asked him this
recent, "How did you do that?"

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.490
He said, "You have
to believe in it."

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.720
[Laughter] It's like Schroder with
his black keys just painted on.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.950
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: We had
Richard here in January.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.640
He did a recital, which
was really spectacular.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.370
&gt;&gt; Steven: He's a good lad.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:28.670
He's fun company, too.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.350
That is very important when you
travel with people, you know.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.650
I travel with Joshua.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:36.850
I travel with Connie and Amalie,
whom as you see I adore, and Bob.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.690
Bob, who, I mean, he's
just a fount of knowledge.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:44.360
I've asked him to leave
me his brain in his will.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.880
[Laughter] I do have to
say a rather naughty story.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.420
I adore him.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.190
He's amazing, but his facts pour.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.530
I think he wakes up at 7:00 in the
morning and facts start pouring

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.940
out of him, and then we had
been touring for two weeks,

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.840
and then the orchestra,
the Age of Enlightenment

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.690
in London advertised this talk
he was giving to raise funds

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.770
for the orchestra, and they
charged 1000 pounds for a seat just

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.390
for a talk, and they sold out,
and I said, "God, that's amazing

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.080
because I would actually
pay 1000 pounds

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.560
at this point to stop him talking."

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:20.210
[Laughter] That's said
with great love.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:31.600
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Just one
second for the microphone.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.840
&gt;&gt; Audience: Last month we had a
wonderful symposium in Washington

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.870
on Shostakovich and Vineberg.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.170
&gt;&gt; Steven: Oh, yes.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:42.260
&gt;&gt; Audience: Vineberg wrote a
lot of music for Rostropovich,

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.000
and I was just wondering, he's
a good composer to most of us.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.830
Are you familiar with
him, and if you are,

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.110
do you make recommendations?

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.490
&gt;&gt; Steven: Well, I've never
played any, but I'm friends

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.960
with Gidon Kramer, and I don't
think Gidon plays anything other

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.260
than Vineberg these days.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.640
He's obsessed with him.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.990
So I've heard him play a lot of it.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.050
It is very fine music, isn't it?

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:06.000 position:56%
And whether it's as great as
Shostakovich, I'm not yet convinced,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.240
but now I was sort of thinking.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.210
My friend, I've got an
Armenian cellist friend called

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.570
Alexander Chaushian.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.870
He said, "You must learn it.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.170
You must learn it."

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.470
I said, "Well, you play it,"

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.110
and in fact he has recorded
it, excellently, I'm sure.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.650
Yeah, I'm always-my
completely unknown composer,

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:24.980
actually I haven't
played him for years,

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.090
but I'm going to again,
is Carl Fruhling.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:31.830
Very different kettle of fish, but
he was a-oh, he lived in Vienna

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.570
for most of his life, and
he's sort of post-Brahms.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:38.040
We recorded with Michael
Collins and Steve Huff years ago,

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.110
we recorded his clarinet chair,
and it's a gorgeous piece.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.410 position:56%
I mean, nothing to do with Vineberg.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:49.030
Sorry. Just going on unusual
composers, unknown composers,

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:53.080
and such touching music, Fruhling,
but Vineberg, yeah, he's major

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.790
and I'm pleased he's got such a
sort of resurgence, and of course I

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:00.100
like to play contemporary
music occasionally

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.100
because I love working
with composers.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.400
Of course, I've worked
with Tom Ades.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.700
I've worked a lot with Kurtag.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.220
I just premiered a new piece
by Kurtag, but, oh, sorry,

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.340
but with different composers
such as John Tavener and hoping

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:16.870
to do a recording of John's
late works, and, yeah,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:22.130
but it's absolutely it's great that
Gidon has this mission for Vineberg

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.490
like I do for Faure, but anyway.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:31.210
&gt;&gt; Audience: You so beautifully
expressed your sentiments

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.980
of the music speaks for itself
and it's all about the music.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.280
&gt;&gt; Steven: It is.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.950
&gt;&gt; Audience: What's your sentiments
about the showmanship that has kind

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:43.210
of crept in in the
last 20 or 30 years?

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:49.810
&gt;&gt; Steven: I don't mind people's-I
think people's emotions will show

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.200
on their face, but
it's, to me, so obvious.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.440
So often it's just fake.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.040
I like to feel something
comes from deep,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.160
deep inside like when I
hear Radu Lupu for instance,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.160 position:56%
just to pluck one name out of the
hat, but he's a very extreme example

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.750
of somebody that music
comes from deep inside.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:12.480
Of course, it shows on his face,
but he's not putting anything on.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.850
It's absolutely genuine,
and that's fine.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.720
You know, I-showmanship
in itself is not bad.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.530
Some music is showman
like, and that's fine,

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:28.730
but it's got to be genuine, and I
think so much now is not genuine.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:32.350
I can't imagine [inaudible] sort of
throwing himself around the stage,

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.110
or, you know, when every time
I play here, I think Segeti

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.410
and [inaudible] played here.

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.350
That's one of the great
recordings of all time.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.990
I bet they didn't throw
themselves around the stage,

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:47.200
and they didn't pose for record
covers in bikinis and things.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.660
I just don't think so.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:54.540
[Laughter] So, yeah, I think it's,
there is a little bit-I refuse

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.290
to use the two words "music"
and "business" together,

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:02.960
but I'm not fond of the times
when they are used together.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.890
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Last question
over here.

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:07.570
&gt;&gt; Steven: I should practice.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audience: Could you tell us three
or four of your desert island disks?

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.730
&gt;&gt; Steven: Well, I did
desert island disks.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.100
I'll tell you all eight
that I chose,

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.400
which I wouldn't change
now, of course.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.700
There are only eight.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.560
Should be thousands.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.610
Schubert Fantasia in F
Minor for Piano Duet,

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.600
[inaudible] Lupu, and
then what do I have?

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.010
The Beethoven the Late
Quartets, which is shocking.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.600
I really don't know that well,
played by the Bush Quartet, Faure,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.570
of course, Choral Pieces sung
by the Chorale Gabriel Faure,

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.060
Schumann's Symphonies,
conducted by [inaudible].

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:44.200
What was the fifth classical
one, or is that five?

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.030
Of course, "St. Matthew Passion."

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:51.810
That was my one I would take, and
then I had three other records.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:56.600
"The Importance of Being
Hoffnung," which is a series

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.580
of interviews he gave
with Charles Richardson,

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.930
which is one of the funniest-it is
the funniest record I've ever heard

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.740
and then Monty Python.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:10.250
One of their songs actually, "I'm
so Worried," was the one I chose

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:14.880
by my friend Terry Jones, and
then the last one was a tribute

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.180
to my son.

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:20.050
It was "I'm Only Sleeping"
by the Beatles,

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.050
which was a rather
pointed tribute to my son.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.870
I would still choose the same,
still dedicate it to my son.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:29.610
Yes.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.180
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Which recording
of the St. Matthew Passion?

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.280
&gt;&gt; Steven: Well, it
was by my friend,

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.530
Philippe Herreweghe, Herreweghe.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:38.830
I don't know.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:42.980
I'm still to be convinced
by-completely by anyone recording.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.440
I think there are many
wonderful recordings.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.040
Nowadays I think I'd
probably choose [inaudible].

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.410
I'm going straight back
from this tour to play

00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:53.100
for his seventieth birthday.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.340
I think I'd choose the
recording by John Butt,

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.700
who is a fantastic musician
and a great friend of mine,

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.070
and he's an alive,
genuine, wonderful musician.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.870
So I think I would choose his now.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:07.170
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: Great.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.470
He's fantastic.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.480
&gt;&gt; Steven: He's great,
and he's completely mad,

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.960
completely mad, but he's wonderful.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.260
[Laughter]

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.130
&gt;&gt; Nicholas: If you've never
read any of his scholarship

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.450
on Butt, go out and Google that.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.400
It's pretty interesting.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.700
Wonderful.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.930
So thank you, Steven, for joining
us in here, and before we go,

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.230
I just want to let everyone know

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.330
that Steven will kindly be signing
CDs following the conclusion

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.630
of the concert.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:32.820
Our colleague, Andresh, will be
making some merchandise available

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.240
for you when you go
into the concert.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.370
So feel free to stop by and check
that out, and we will look forward

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.390
