00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.210
Looks like we can add “living next to a
highway” to the list of things that will

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.620
kill you!

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.590
TERRIFIC.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.619
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and when you’re
looking for a place to live, there are a lot

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.199
of things you probably consider: neighborhood,
nearby schools, proximity to work - but what

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.779
about highways?

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.730
Most people might not wanna live near a highway
because of the noise - but what if I told

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.099
you, it could actually give you a heart attack?

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.960
Well, according to a new study - it might.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.239
Research published this week in the journal
Circulation, has found that living close to

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.750
a major road or highway - may actually increase
a woman’s risk of sudden cardiac death.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.040
Terrifying, right?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.390
Researchers at Harvard Medical School studied
data from over 100,000 women taken between

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.070
1986 and 2012.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.670
After adjusting for factors like age, race,
cigarette smoking, physical activity, and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.750
diet - they figured out where each woman lived,
and then calculated the distance from their

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.280
home to the nearest roadway.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.699
What they found, is that living within 50
meters of a major roadway, increased a woman’s

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.620
risk of sudden cardiac death by 38% - compared
to women who lived at least 500 meters away.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.960
What’s more, is that for every 100 meters
closer to a roadway a woman lived, she increased

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.070
that risk by 6%.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.200
According to researchers, proximity to nearby
roadways is AS important a risk factor as

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.100
smoking, diet, or obesity.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.649
Keep in mind, though, that this study didn’t
account for every possible risk factor.

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.270
All of the participants were women, and most
of them were white, middle-aged to elderly,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.840
and of middle- to upper-socioeconomic class.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.720
So more research is definitely needed, and
especially research that looks at both men

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.079
and women of different ages, races, and income
levels.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.420
Even so, it’s pretty hard to deny a correlation
here - and it certainly isn’t the first

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.979
study that explores this link.

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.229
Previous research has also found that living
near a roadway increases your risk of developing

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.530
coronary heart disease.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.979
Although scientists still aren’t sure why
that is.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.770
The leading theory is that air pollution could
be what’s causing it.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.010
So the next step, researchers say, is figuring
out exactly what’s behind it.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.940
Especially since, according to the EPA, 35
million Americans live within 300 meters of

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.940
a major road.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.940
What do you guys think?

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.430
Any wild theories as to what could be causing
this?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.670

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.520
Otherwise, thanks for watching!
