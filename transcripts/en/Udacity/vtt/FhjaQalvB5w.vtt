00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.760
And now we're back to the final project, and this

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.930
is the fun part. So this is where you should

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.850
go through your app, to find opportunities for contextual awesomeness,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.463
and then, keep searching for inspiration. This may mean researching Google

00:00:14.463 --> 00:00:18.242
Play services more or checking out the repository of awesomeness.

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:20.925
But once you've figured out something out that you think you

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:22.766
can do that you really add to your app, add

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.552
call outs to your prezzy that will help other people understand

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:29.420
what that awesomeness is. And of course, you must obey

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.020
the two prime directives, which are to always be purposeful and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.630
respectful. Just because a feature exists doesn't mean you need to

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.770
put it in. And of course, don't be creepy. Good luck.
