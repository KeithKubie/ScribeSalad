QUIM GIL: This
year Summer of Code

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.900
was very special because we
went from 9 students to 19.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.990
And that was great, but at the
same time we were a bit scared.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.770
Can we handle that?

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.590
But the results
were pretty amazing.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.120
When you do this big
jump, basically doubling

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.850
the number of projects
you're taking,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.540
you really need to get
organized in a different way.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.610
You need to be more systematic.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.680
You need to rely on a lot more
on the mentors themselves.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.000
Each team must be
more autonomous.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.919
But we kind of managed.

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:58.210
BRADLEY KUHN: Looking at our
organization, The Software

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.330
Freedom Conservancy, we have so
many different member projects

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.000
in so many different areas
of free software development.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.580
The mentor summit
is the place that I

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.560
can come to see all of
them because they never

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.410
go to the same conference except
for this one, because GStock

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.050
has done such a good
job at bringing together

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.850
all these different
free software projects

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.890
and getting them to talk
to each other in ways

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.770
that really no other
program today does.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.170
ROSE ROBINSON: We found
an incredible amount

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.250
of just science projects,
humanitarian projects,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.430
a lot of server projects,
which were really

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.130
cool because a lot of
sisters are actually

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.510
into those type of technologies.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.510
So I think they would
be very excited to see

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.608
that for next year.

00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:43.300
QUIM GIL: Just after few weeks,
our Summer of Code students

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.680
were not Summer
of Code students.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.720
They were just regular
members of our community

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.410
using exactly the same
channels as the rest of us use.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.810
And also we are very happy
about the small detail, which

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.420
is important, which is
seven of those students were

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.842
women, which was very different
scenario of any previous years.

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:01.300
HARLAN STENN: Google
Summer of Code

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.380
has helped us to bring to
fruition several projects that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.820
were just big in scope.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.552
And it's also helped us
with a number of projects

00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:11.510
where we just needed
somebody for a few months.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.790
And they can sit and
punch something out

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.956
and focus on it for a while.

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:17.050
MICHAEL DOWNEY: So our goal is
to save the world, essentially.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.600
And GStock has really been
able to give us the opportunity

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.630
to do that and to help
our students do that.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.600
And so we're looking
forward to continuing

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.850
that mission in years to come.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.933
KAREN SANDLER: And I think
free software generally

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:29.680
is indebted to Summer of
Code, both for helping

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.930
how it has with the
outreach program for women,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.660
and both in sponsorship and
in organizational inspiration.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.220
And then also with
Summer of Code

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.780
generally, because we've
had so many great newcomers

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.630
from Summer of Code, I can't
even begin to tell you.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.880
We've had so many
great students come

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.430
in that have become invaluable
members of our organization.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.440
I was talking to one
of our board members

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.656
a couple of months ago.

00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:55.780
And he was telling me that.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.520
And I asked him, how did
you get involved with GNOME?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.200
And he said oh,
well, Summer of Code.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.200
And I had no idea.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.930
He is essential to
the GNOME community.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.180
And we would never have had
him if not Summer of Code.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.530
