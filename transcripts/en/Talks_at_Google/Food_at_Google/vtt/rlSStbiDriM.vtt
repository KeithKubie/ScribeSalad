00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.150
SPEAKER: Jennifer Jane, Eduardo
Garcia, and Phillip Baribeau,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.780
thank you for coming to Google
today for a "Talks at" session.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.310
Let me begin by
introducing you properly.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.520
We have Eduardo Garcia,
subject of the film "Charged"--

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.720
documentary, rather--

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.360
Jennifer Jane, his longtime
friend, subject of the film,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.860
as well.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.510
And actually, they're
both co-founders

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.800
of Montana Mex food company,
a Bozeman, Montana based

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.690
specialty foods company.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.620
We also have Phillip
Baribeau, who

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.550
is the director of "Charged,"
and previously the director

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.980
of "Unbranded,"
another critically

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.170
acclaimed documentary, which
is available on Netflix.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.270
So, thank you for coming today.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.260
And you know, a little
context is that I actually

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.600
met Eduardo and Phillip at an
event run by the San Francisco

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.150
49ers Foundation in
Lake Tahoe recently.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.614
And you had a
group of people who

00:00:57.614 --> 00:00:59.280
are used to seeing
inspirational things,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.420
including a cadre of former and
current professional football

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.930
players, people who are not
moved easily by emotion.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.900
And everyone I spoke to
afterwards to the person

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.640
were incredibly
inspired and moved

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.560
by what they saw with Eduardo.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.230
And I think what's incredible
is that you've taken something

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.060
that might have
crushed other people

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.226
and actually turned it
around to make it a positive.

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:21.680
And you were motivated to go
out and inspire the world.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.995
So let me begin by saying, and
asking, what actually happened

00:01:24.995 --> 00:01:25.700
to you that day?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.670
Give us a little bit
of background story.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.036
You went out on a hunting
trip, if I'm not mistaken,

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:33.825
a backwoods trip, and your
life completely changed.

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:34.700
EDUARDO GARCIA: Yeah.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.210
Hunting is part of my core, you
know, it's part of my passion,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.980
growing up in the
hills of Montana.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.890
So it's not uncommon that
you'll find me totally

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.330
off grid and off service from
September 1st to November 31st.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.660
And you know, I was
hunting for elk,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.200
and came across a dead
baby black bear, which

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.124
is about as bizarre as
you can make it, you know?

00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:05.265
And not knowing that that
dead bear was on 2400 volts,

00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:07.140
I took a knife out and
put it in my left hand

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.380
to just investigate,
and received

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.410
a shock that ended up resulting
in, you know, 48 days of ICU

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.842
and nearly taking my life.

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:20.300
SPEAKER: So Eduardo,
one thing that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.000
really makes me
stop and think here

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.690
is that you're a person, both
now and before the injury,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.110
before the incident, someone
who really depends on your body,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.740
right?

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.280
As a chef, as an outdoorsman.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.270
And so you went from
zero to 60, being

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.730
able to depend on a
fully capable body,

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.800
right, to not being able to
do that in a split second.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.550
So what did that teach
you about yourself?

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.091
And I think, more
importantly, if you

00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:47.135
were to be able to go
back in time, right,

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:51.179
would you choose to have
let that happen now, or not?

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:52.970
EDUARDO GARCIA: If I
could go back in time,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.470
I think there's other things I
would change, quite honestly.

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.480
You know, it's quite
interesting, you know.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.660
I think we rely on the
things that come natural

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.170
and our primary skill sets.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.007
Whether they're physical or
psychological or emotional,

00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:15.090
you know, we go to those
things that we know best.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.320
And so when you lose
your latissimus dorsi

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.800
and they just basically
remove it from your hip

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.350
and wrap it around your torso
to make up for the obliques

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.060
and pectoral
muscles that I lost,

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.750
you no longer have that
latissimus anymore.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.376
But I have to tell you
that, once that's removed,

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:36.042
you find out quite
quickly that you have

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:37.320
all these submuscle groups.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.050
And it's just a metaphor
for life, right?

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.820
You have all these
subgroups of smaller muscles

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.400
that are just waiting
for their day in the sun.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.310
They're just waiting to get out
and kick some ass, you know.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.040
So when you call on them and
you say, OK, little guys, it's

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.450
time to step up and,
like, flex, they do.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.364
And so for that, my life
is much richer, you know?

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:00.280
You take that down to
the other parts of life,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.050
and through this injury there's
a huge, huge stroke of humility

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.640
I've been dealt, and
then a phenomenal fount

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.730
of understanding about
myself, my friends, my family,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.230
and maybe even my
purpose, you know?

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.730
SPEAKER: You know, one of the
things that I think about when

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.370
I think about your journey
is that, as strong as you

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.747
are, it's not about you, right?

00:04:21.747 --> 00:04:23.580
It's about the community
that surrounds you.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.990
And I'm looking at some of
them in this room, people

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.031
who have dedicated a large
portion of their lives

00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:28.539
to helping tell
your story, right?

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:29.580
None of us are an island.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.330
So what did you learn about
the importance of friendship

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.410
and people going
through this process?

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.466
EDUARDO GARCIA: Yeah.

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:41.250
It's interesting, the
mind of a patient,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.900
right, everybody is
giving you everything.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.420
Well, hopefully.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.705
You've got everyone from
your surgeons to your nurses,

00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:49.330
and then to your
friends and community,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.820
like you mentioned, Phil.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.130
But it's all coming this way.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.310
And at some point, I think
there's a Eureka moment that

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.162
hits where you realize, like--

00:04:58.162 --> 00:05:00.370
you kind of, like, look at
Jen, and you're like, so--

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.953
remember, there's a
scene in the film,

00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:04.210
for anyone that hasn't
seen it, where Jen's

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.030
been sleeping for 48 days
in this recliner that's

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.010
spring-loaded.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.350
So you lean back, it kind of
pops into a reclining position,

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.130
but if you take any pressure
off it, [THUNK], right?

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.020
So in her sleep,
she would doze off,

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.127
and then it would just
launch her forward.

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:19.710
JENNIFER JANE: It
wasn't heavy enough.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.335
EDUARDO GARCIA: It
wasn't heavy enough.

00:05:21.335 --> 00:05:24.660
And Jen filmed a lot,
all of the ICU stay.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.870
And so there's a scene where
Jen put her camera on a tripod

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.710
and filmed this jerry-rigging
MacGyver moment where she's

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.520
taking her carry-on
bag and using her belt

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.270
and rigging it to the
back of the recliner

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.100
so that it lays flat.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.355
And she caught beautifully
just raw footage of me saying,

00:05:43.355 --> 00:05:46.480
geez, you've been
doing that every day?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.320
So at some point, the patient
switches and you realize, like,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.350
what it takes to be a caregiver,
what it takes to be a friend,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.130
you know?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.370
And that's oftentimes
even harder, really,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.144
than the patient, because the
patient's getting everything.

00:05:59.144 --> 00:06:01.560
SPEAKER: Which is actually a
good segue in that, you know,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.976
Jennifer, correct
me if I'm wrong,

00:06:02.976 --> 00:06:07.045
but you had been partners
with Eduardo previous

00:06:07.045 --> 00:06:08.670
to the accident, had
actually gone back

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.830
to England to
continue your life,

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.744
and came back to
actually take care of him

00:06:12.744 --> 00:06:14.160
and help him through
this journey.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.810
JENNIFER JANE: Yes.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.050
SPEAKER: And to
capture it on film.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.530
JENNIFER JANE: Mhm.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.030
SPEAKER: So, why
did you do that?

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.254
What motivated you?

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:20.670
JENNIFER JANE:
Well, there's a lot

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.070
of answers to that
question, I guess, but the--

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.840
so for anybody that
hasn't seen the film,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.390
Eduardo and I had a very
turbulent relationship.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.140
And about-- I think it was
about 10 days before he

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.370
was injured I was like, you
know what, I'm gonna go.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.870
And I did.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.149
And I flew back to England.

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:36.690
And so I was actually
in England when

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.720
I got the phone call
that he had been injured.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.575
And I got on the plane--

00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:43.950
actually, just before I got
on the plane, I spoke to him,

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.241
and we thought it could be
the last conversation, which

00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:47.830
was obviously very emotional.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.830
And then I got on
this plane, and he

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.110
went into his first
surgery, and I had

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.875
zero way to contact the ground.

00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:55.890
So I had eight hours
just sat on this plane

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.430
hoping that he would be OK.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.014
And during that time
was when I got to think.

00:07:00.014 --> 00:07:02.430
You know, in a way it was good
to have that time to really

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.870
think about who he is to me.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.557
You know, I still
love him very much,

00:07:05.557 --> 00:07:07.140
even though we weren't
together and we

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.760
had had this type
of relationship,

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.960
and wondering if
he would survive,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.170
and thinking about filming.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.120
And that was where that kind
of whole moment happened.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.030
And we landed, and luckily
he was still alive.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.980
And you know, it was
an awesome moment.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.160
And then I got to the hospital,
and then it was really

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.230
that he continue to survive.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.420
And that was-- you know,
I just stayed there

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.650
throughout the whole
thing, because really,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.370
at the very beginning,
when I first went,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.407
I had no idea what
was going to happen.

00:07:32.407 --> 00:07:33.990
And then once you're
there, obviously,

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.406
when you love someone, you
don't want to leave their side.

00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:37.320
And I just stayed.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.419
And together, we got through it.

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:40.460
SPEAKER: But why film it?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.422
Like, what was that
crystallized moment

00:07:42.422 --> 00:07:44.630
you decided this is something
that I want to capture?

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.670
And did you want to capture it
for yourself, for each other,

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.520
or for the world?

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.870
JENNIFER JANE: Sure.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.120
There was a couple of reasons.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.610
So we'd just been filming,
Phil, Eduardo, and I,

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.457
for a television show
that Eduardo and I

00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:55.290
had been working on.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.531
So I had a camera.

00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:57.780
I was used to filming Eduardo.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.310
So that was one side of things.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.700
Another side of it
was I was listed

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.260
as one of the signers for him.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.340
So when he was in operation,
I could sign things away.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.640
And I was worried that
he was on so many drugs

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.690
that afterwards he
wouldn't remember what he'd

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.250
been through, and maybe
on the other side of it

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.081
be why-- you know, why did that
happen, why did this happen.

00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:19.580
And it would be good to have
footage and photography to say,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.440
hey, this is what
your hand looked

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.795
like before it had to be
removed, and things like that.

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:26.836
So it was a little bit of
personal documentation,

00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:29.690
a little bit because we
were used to filming.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.090
And as it transpired
while we were in the ICU,

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.780
we learned that so many people
don't get out the other side

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.169
because they're so
unmotivated for rehabilitation

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.922
and learning from the doctors
and nurses during that time

00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:43.880
that showing other people
how to get through it

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.970
would be beneficial.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.057
So we just continued and
turned it into a documentary.

00:08:48.057 --> 00:08:49.640
EDUARDO GARCIA: And
I should add, too,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.797
we had a lot of support.

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:52.630
JENNIFER JANE: Huge.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.290
EDUARDO GARCIA: We were working
with a production team called

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.240
Citizen Pictures
out of Denver who

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.850
were quick to arrive
and lend some gear.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.050
And we were in touch with
Phil, who, as Jen mentioned,

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.450
you know, had just filmed
a trailer for a TV concept

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:05.980
we have.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.290
And Phil was also incredibly
supportive in just

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.542
the very early days
of, yeah, document it.

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:14.250
I mean, that's the
power of storytelling,

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.980
you know, is don't
know-- sometimes,

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.938
you don't know what you're
going to do with it,

00:09:17.938 --> 00:09:20.486
but you just go out and
you just start capturing.

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:21.860
SPEAKER: Doesn't
always work out.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.486
I'm sure that most documentaries
that start don't get finished.

00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:25.360
JENNIFER JANE: Right.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:25.880
And--

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.370
SPEAKER: So Phillip,
is that true, right?

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.910
And I guess the second thing is,
you're a critically acclaimed

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.180
documentary filmmaker.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.430
You just released "Unbranded."

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.513
You're doing other things.

00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:37.130
What kind of drew
you to this project?

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.171
How did you get involved?

00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:39.290
How did it come together?

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.248
PHILLIP BARIBEAU: Sure.

00:09:40.248 --> 00:09:43.490
Yeah, like they mentioned,
it started with this trailer

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.510
for a TV show.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.390
So Ed, Jen and myself, we
all live in Bozeman, Montana.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.857
And they approached me with
this idea of outdoor cooking

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:54.190
and making these meals in the
outdoor while being active

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.494
and surfing and
skateboarding and climbing,

00:09:56.494 --> 00:09:57.410
all these cool things.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.076
So we spent six months
to a year working

00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:01.570
on that, put together
this awesome trailer,

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.770
Citizen Pictures went
out and pitched it.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.425
Almost sold within five
days of the Food Network,

00:10:06.425 --> 00:10:08.000
and he got his injury.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.770
So put a complete halt on that.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.390
And that's where
Jen was explaining

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.080
she decided to film the
entire stay in the ICU

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.690
with this incredible footage.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.920
Really raw, emotional--
just footage

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.550
that you don't really see in
survival stories or films,

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.910
or anything like that.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.580
And then when Ed
got back to Montana,

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.350
we just kept filming
all these stages.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.320
So him getting back into
the outdoors, into life.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.860
And we got to a point where
we kind of all sat together--

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.110
Dennis Aig, producer
that's also here--

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.220
and decided what do we
do with this archive.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.180
Like, once he started
recovering physically,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.710
we started to see
the both of them

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.190
having these effects on people,
on kids, in a positive way.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.052
So let's use this story on a
bigger level and make a film.

00:10:54.052 --> 00:10:55.760
SPEAKER: You know,
listening to all this,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.960
one thing I walk away
with is the importance

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.990
of, again, people--

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.260
I want to go back to
that-- and advocacy.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.785
And I'm delighted to let
everyone know today we actually

00:11:04.785 --> 00:11:06.020
have Erin Hattersley with us.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.720
Erin is the interim lead
with the Googler Disability

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.721
Alliance, which is at GoDA.

00:11:10.721 --> 00:11:13.220
And for those of you who aren't
familiar with the disability

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.190
alliance, it
advocates on behalf of

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.520
and helps thousands of
Googlers around the world who

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.016
have disabilities that are
either known or unknown.

00:11:22.016 --> 00:11:23.390
So it's one of
the most important

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:27.350
what we call ERGs, Employer
Resource Groups, here.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.270
And when I have gotten
to know some people who

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.904
are part of the
Disability Alliance,

00:11:30.904 --> 00:11:32.320
quite often they
have an advocate,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.100
whether it's someone at
home, right, or someone here

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.860
at Google, their manager, a peer
who really makes their lives

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.318
better, and kind of makes their
professional life at Google

00:11:39.318 --> 00:11:40.170
possible.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.440
So I have a two-part
question, really.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.860
Eduardo, people find themselves
in a situation like yours,

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.944
right, or a medical
situation, how important

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:52.610
it is to have an
advocate, both in terms

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.540
of getting your
life back on track

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.210
and I would also
posit actually helping

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.590
navigate the medical
industrial complex,

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.340
where you have doctors
all over the place?

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.480
So can you give us
some advice there?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.470
Because everyone, at
some point or another,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.650
finds himself in a situation
not exactly like yours,

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.858
but in a situation like that.

00:12:06.858 --> 00:12:08.449
What would you recommend?

00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:10.490
EDUARDO GARCIA: Yeah,
that's a really good point,

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.430
and a great question.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.810
And actually, for
me, to that point,

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.250
that was the genesis
of my turning point

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.040
to say, yeah, I'm
gonna go all in

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.110
and sort of reveal this
very private, exceptionally

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.750
intimate part of
my life, and that I

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.910
think this can be a tool and a
resource for a lot of people.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:35.660
And you know, when Jen and
I, when we were in ICU,

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.717
we spent quite a bit
of time googling.

00:12:37.717 --> 00:12:38.550
JENNIFER JANE: Yeah.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.860
A lot of time googling.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.818
EDUARDO GARCIA: We did.

00:12:40.818 --> 00:12:43.010
It was a best friend, truly.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.880
Just put yourself
in this position,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.870
and this is the power of
sharing information, which

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.480
is I think what we're doing
with "Charged," you know,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.470
is we're sharing
information also.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.080
So we're kind of
in cahoots, right?

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.950
We're in business together,
in that I just lost my hand.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.620
You wake up and you're
completely rewriting who

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.060
you are, what do you do?

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.850
I mean, I think you start
researching very quickly.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.987
How do you surf with one hand?

00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:07.820
How do you fly fish?

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.486
How do you cook?

00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:10.050
How do you do all these things?

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.750
What does the term
prosthetic mean?

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.850
You know, who is
the best upper body,

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.960
you know, prosthetician
in the United States.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.510
And you start looking into it.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.890
And you're in a scrambled
frenzy to understand

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.060
where you're going to find your
way back to being, like, whole

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:26.960
again.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.750
And so really, with
this film, you know,

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.880
I think you need to
have an advocate.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.480
You need to have-- and we found
mentors in Salt Lake City,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.295
because I was at the University
of Utah, other amputees that

00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:40.670
were really doing what we're
trying to do with "Charged."

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:46.750
They survived insane injury, or
were congenital-based amputees.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.370
And then I could
look at their story.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.220
You know, there's a chef,
Michael Caines, in the UK.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.220
And I remember watching a
YouTube video of him cooking.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.430
And you know, all
respect to that chef.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.640
I remember watching and it
was, like, one of the first--

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.140
it was, like, one
of maybe two times

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:10.460
where I truly erupted in
just total grief and loss,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.250
because I'm watching a chef
cook with a prosthetic, which

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.320
is phenomenal to think of.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:21.740
But at the same time, I'm
watching a dance and a movement

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.500
I used to know by
heart, and I'm seeing

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.220
it done in a way
that just seemed

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.820
like you had muck
boots on your hands,

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.820
and you're trying to do
this dexterous movement.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.780
I'm thinking like, oh, I gotta--

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.950
you know, that-- it crushed me.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.720
But at the same time,
it's impressive.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.570
So it gave us--

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.829
I mean, having
other examples was

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:42.620
that light at the end
of the tunnel to say,

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.502
OK, you're an amputee,
but it's not game over.

00:14:46.502 --> 00:14:47.960
You know, look at
this guy fishing,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.810
look at this person
wakeboarding.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.160
There's folks all over
the world painting,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.300
doing amazing things
without their limbs.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.720
You know, I think if
the brain and the spirit

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.780
and soul and the heart are
intact, like that's square one.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.780
SPEAKER: So it kind of
makes me think-- and this

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.080
is sort of a question
for all three of you,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.205
because sometimes it's hard
to see yourself, right?

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:07.670
You have your own experience,
and then your experience

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.170
is shared by others
who are watching

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.500
you go through the journey.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.600
So what about you was the
physically hardest thing

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.024
to do when this was done?

00:15:16.024 --> 00:15:17.440
What were two or
three things that

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.600
just were rote memory
beforehand and afterwards

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.710
were incredibly hard?

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.940
And what did that teach you?

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.520
And having watched
Eduardo through this,

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.599
like, what did you see?

00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:28.640
And also, how do people
react to you differently,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.000
right, before and after?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.300
And I'm sure you'd have
thoughts on that, as well.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.520
JENNIFER JANE: I remember
opening jars became a team

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.040
effort, you know?

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.520
Like I'd hold the jar, and
Ed would unscrew the jar.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.300
That was one of the
first little things

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.425
that I think I noticed in
terms of physical change.

00:15:42.425 --> 00:15:44.758
PHILLIP BARIBEAU: I mean, the
biggest thing-- he says it

00:15:44.758 --> 00:15:47.840
in that scene that you saw with
the Challenged Athletes-- is Ed

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.540
and I, we hunt together, we
hike together, all these things.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.800
He tackles the physical.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.260
He puts his head down and
he gets it done, learns--

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.270
the first day fly
fishing, he had it down

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.590
and he was catching fish.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.780
It's incredible.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.120
But it was the emotional journey
that was the most difficult. So

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.890
going through that
with him, and I

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.700
knew we had to document that
process of, once he got back

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.230
to all the things--

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.720
cooking and the stuff
in the outdoors--

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.680
I saw his biggest
challenge was when

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.610
he tackled everything
that happened to him,

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.514
recovering things
in his relationship

00:16:18.514 --> 00:16:20.180
and his family and
everything like that.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.152
So by far I saw that as
the biggest challenge.

00:16:23.152 --> 00:16:24.860
SPEAKER: And speaking
of which, you know,

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.284
Montana I would kind
of view as a character

00:16:27.284 --> 00:16:28.950
in this documentary,
right, in that it's

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.000
an entity unto itself.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.690
So what role did
Montana in general,

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.170
and nature in particular,
have on your therapy

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.680
and your recovery?

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.090
EDUARDO GARCIA: I could get
lost down a serious tunnel here.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.460
And I tend to be wordy
if I'm given a leash,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.360
or not given a leash.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.150
SPEAKER: I'll cut
you off, don't worry.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.390
EDUARDO GARCIA: OK.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.560
SPEAKER: Great.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.310
EDUARDO GARCIA: No,
I'll keep it succinct,

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:55.370
because it is quite simple
that Montana, for me,

00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:01.730
is just a super,
super true example

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.900
of just, like,
simple perfection.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.079
It's nature abounds.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:11.390
You have landscapes and sort of
viewscapes everywhere you turn.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.140
And when you are at square
one starting over and trying

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.869
to re-imagine, you know,
what better place than

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.760
to-- and maybe communicate
with nature on some level,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.660
and to sort of just open
yourself up to dream big

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.365
and say, OK, I'm gonna see
how far I can walk today, or--

00:17:30.365 --> 00:17:37.660
you know, it was just an
awesomely inspiring setting

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.040
to start rewriting my story.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.250
And then there were some
more subtle parts, too.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.030
And for me, you know, I spend
a lot of time, if I can,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.290
in the woods hiking or on the
river fishing, or generally

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.550
just outside.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.600
And if you look at what we do
here, what we do with our mind

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.100
and what we do with our hands,
we're striving consistently,

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.330
I think, for some
type of perfection

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.090
or some type of
repeatable perfection.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:11.180
And mother nature,
I don't think--

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.400
perfection is very
different in mother nature.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.320
It's consistently
different from one leaf

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.870
to the next on the same branch.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.200
And in that, I think I started
to see an example of, OK, I

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.390
mean, that tree is
beautiful, even though it's

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.530
got a limb snapped off it.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.507
And it's different.

00:18:25.507 --> 00:18:26.090
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.560
EDUARDO GARCIA: You know?

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.240
And I started to see
sort of like, hey,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.700
well, I'm nature-made,
and I'm different.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.910
But it doesn't mean that this
can't be beautiful still,

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.590
you know, how I view myself.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.299
SPEAKER: So, you know,
Eduardo, one thing

00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:40.464
that kind of blew me away
was the fact that you were

00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:42.557
in the hospital, you were
recovering from this,

00:18:42.557 --> 00:18:44.390
and you found out at
that same point in time

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.750
that you were suffering
from testicular cancer.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.970
So, you know, at what point
in your recovery journey

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.700
were you there, and how did
that affect you going forward?

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.603
EDUARDO GARCIA: It's
fairly inconvenient.

00:18:58.603 --> 00:18:59.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.470
I mean, if you would call it,
it was one of those things where

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.640
you--

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.160
and I say we, actually,
because it was a team.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.580
When you have 21 surgeries
ahead of you, or in totality,

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.620
to accomplish, you need to
stop halfway through those

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:22.046
and go tackle three months
of chemo, it's strange.

00:19:22.046 --> 00:19:23.670
You know, I honestly
feel like I didn't

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.210
have much of an opportunity
to be even scared by it,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.520
because I was in
something that I

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.160
felt had far more
grave consequences.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:39.260
And it took years for me
to come around and actually

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.900
own up to the fact that
I'm a cancer patient,

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.110
I'm a cancer survivor.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.610
You know?

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.250
But I really just kind of took
it on, did the chemotherapy,

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.210
shelved it.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.200
Jen reminds me often.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.700
She's like, hey, don't always
just put on a brave face,

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.770
it was horrible.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.135
You know, like you were
ill and sick and in pain

00:19:55.135 --> 00:19:57.440
and felt awful a
lot of the times.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.210
And I think there's
a part of my brain

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.146
that tends to try and
forget about that,

00:20:01.146 --> 00:20:03.020
and that it was just
this three-month chapter

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.490
that I shelved
and then went back

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.010
to kind of reconstructing
my scalp wounds

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.400
and some of my other injuries.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.820
So really, I think
where I own it today

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.910
is in trying to work with cancer
support and cancer awareness

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:17.690
groups.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:21.490
Like First Descents does
a phenomenal job taking--

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.540
I think their program
is open for 20-year-olds

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.660
through 40-year-olds, to put
them in a community to say,

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.477
hey, it's OK to own
cancer in whatever level

00:20:30.477 --> 00:20:32.060
you're at, whether
you're in treatment

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.995
or you're surviving
or, you know,

00:20:33.995 --> 00:20:37.100
if you're in a
terminal situation,

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:42.980
and still access your
limitations, like go big.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.700
Surf, climb, kayak,
all their programs.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.600
So for me, it was a
hiccup that has further

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.950
just engaged my recovery.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.580
SPEAKER: So Jen,
you know, anyone

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.246
who's been through a
situation like this

00:20:56.246 --> 00:20:58.352
knows that the caregiver,
they're giving care,

00:20:58.352 --> 00:20:59.560
but their life is continuing.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.590
JENNIFER JANE: Mhm.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.506
SPEAKER: Life beckons.

00:21:01.506 --> 00:21:04.320
You have to make money,
get a job, get stuff done.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.890
So what were your
greatest challenges

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.782
in taking care of Eduardo
during this period

00:21:08.782 --> 00:21:10.240
and actually running
your own life,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.906
and getting your own
life back on track?

00:21:11.906 --> 00:21:12.790
JENNIFER JANE: Sure.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.820
I think we were actually
very fortunate in the sense

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.590
that we co-own the same company.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.540
So while we were
in the hospital,

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.460
we'd still be working
on the company.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.320
You know, I had the
laptop out in my chair

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.010
next to his bed just, you know,
running as much as I could do.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.010
So in the sense of me
working and earning money,

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.940
we were fortunate
in that situation.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.670
But I think one of
the toughest things

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.290
is remembering to
look after yourself,

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.810
and then finding joy
in the small things.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.120
Like, we definitely tried
to watch stand-up comedy

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.160
and dance and do all these
little things that we

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.430
could to keep ourselves lifted.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.130
And then I think yeah,
it really is just

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.890
accepting what you've
lost as you've lost,

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.959
so we were very much,
OK, the hand is gone.

00:21:51.959 --> 00:21:53.500
There's nothing we
can do about that.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.100
However, there's many other
things that we've still got.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.810
Let's not lose our
house, let's not lose

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.650
our business, let's focus
on everything we still had.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.080
And I think that helped both
of us get through everything.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.270
SPEAKER: Team effort.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.103
JENNIFER JANE: Yeah.

00:22:07.103 --> 00:22:08.930
SPEAKER: So Phil, as
you kind of like--

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.260
as a documentary filmmaker,
and you know, here

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.880
in the audience we have people
who tell stories for a living--

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.713
some communications
folks, marketing people,

00:22:15.713 --> 00:22:19.750
as well-- so you have a
multi-layered story here

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.720
with a lot of emotion, a lot of
different concurrent and hard

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.160
events, right?

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.977
So how did you bring together
a cohesive narrative,

00:22:26.977 --> 00:22:28.810
a story that actually
resonated with people?

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.768
PHILLIP BARIBEAU: Sure.

00:22:29.768 --> 00:22:31.240
SPEAKER: So what's
the story there?

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.080
How do you do it in
an hour and a half?

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.090
PHILLIP BARIBEAU: Yeah.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.236
I wish our editor Tony Hale
was here to help explain that,

00:22:37.236 --> 00:22:39.610
because he had to go through
hundreds of hours of footage

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.600
to pull this together.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.660
But you know, when
we sat down when

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.520
we had all this
footage to decide what

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.220
are we doing with this, is
this just a half-hour survival

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.770
show, what's the bigger picture,
and as we started diving

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.916
into it, learning more about
the relationship, his past,

00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:56.290
his family, different things
with his father, we're like,

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.450
there's a bigger story here.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.930
And really, we needed their
trust to be able to dive

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.450
into that, to expose
some mistakes that

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.230
were made in the past
to show where he's come,

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.040
where the both of
them have come, today.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.470
So that was our greatest
challenge was getting there.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.176
And I remember we had a talk
about I didn't want to do this

00:23:16.176 --> 00:23:17.800
if it was going to
ruin our friendship,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.510
because later on
they can watch it

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.070
and say, like, oh, you made
me look terrible there.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.082
SPEAKER: Right.

00:23:23.082 --> 00:23:25.040
PHILLIP BARIBEAU: Like,
you know, I've seen it.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.767
It's tough.

00:23:26.767 --> 00:23:28.100
But really, that's not our goal.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.587
Our goal is to show all
this, to be vulnerable,

00:23:31.587 --> 00:23:33.920
to show what they came through
to get to the other side.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.490
So it was amazing that they
trusted our team to dive that

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.790
deep into the whole journey.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.230
SPEAKER: And so I'm thinking
about your relationship, right.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.100
So Eduardo, Jen, what
was your relationship

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.680
like before this
happened, and what

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.180
is your friendship like now?

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.290
And how has that changed?

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.312
How has what happened
to both of you, really,

00:23:55.312 --> 00:23:57.520
how has it impacted your
friendship and relationship,

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.980
way of working together as
co-business owners today?

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.027
It must be complicated.

00:24:01.027 --> 00:24:02.110
JENNIFER JANE: Mhm, it's--

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.484
EDUARDO GARCIA:
To say the least.

00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:04.360
JENNIFER JANE: Yeah.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.180
I think when you go
through something like this

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.920
with someone, it
definitely forces

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.370
you to shift the less
important stuff to the side.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.630
I think maybe if Eduardo
hadn't been injured,

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.440
we would have probably gone
our separate ways maybe more

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.400
quickly.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.985
But you develop--

00:24:19.985 --> 00:24:22.360
I think they call it a trauma
bond, is what they call it,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.800
is when you're really with
somebody the whole time.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.790
And I think our friendship
blossomed through that,

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.000
because our relationship
before was extremely

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.170
intense and turbulent.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.100
And I think the
injury was just like,

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.310
OK, I definitely care
about this person,

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.090
and I definitely want him
to be OK, and to be there.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:40.840
What do you think?

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.780
EDUARDO GARCIA: Yeah,
no, I agree with that.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.980
I think, you know,
life or death seems

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.150
to be the great
equalizer, right?

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:55.030
And not saying that all mistakes
are forgiven should you survive

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:59.330
something, but it just
levels the playing field,

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.780
only just a little bit,
to-- for me, you know?

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.960
And individually, whether you're
the patient or the caregiver,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.530
to say, OK, well tomorrow, you
know, who will I decide to be?

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.410
You know, how am I
going to rewrite this?

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.170
Whether it's my own
journey or my journey

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:18.850
as a friend with Jen, or
others for that matter.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.300
And you know, I think it's--

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.870
when someone has impacted
your life as Jen has,

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:32.660
you know, being there in such
a crucial part of my life,

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.640
it's a really terrific
feeling, to be honest,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.690
to wake up and kind of know
how high the stakes are.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.750
I mean, sometimes it's nice
when the stakes are high,

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.170
because you feel more
driven to purpose.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.082
SPEAKER: You know, when
I think about this,

00:25:47.082 --> 00:25:51.680
I guess a question I have is
is optimism a choice, right?

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.710
And is it a choice you have to
make each day and each minute?

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.210
Because looking at what you've
gone through, what all of you

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.140
have gone through, I think there
must have been moments when you

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.180
were ready to kind of throw in
the towel, just say screw it,

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:02.570
I don't want to do it.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.070
I don't want to do
the film, I don't

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.830
want to recover anymore, I just
want to go home and watch TV.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:07.330
Right?

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.780
So like, what
would you recommend

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.270
to anyone who's gone through
any type of a trauma,

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.760
a physical trauma, psychological
trauma, relationship

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.520
trauma, in terms of getting
their life back on track?

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.260
And you know, is it a decision?

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.196
How do you do it?

00:26:20.196 --> 00:26:21.320
And how do you go about it?

00:26:23.689 --> 00:26:24.980
EDUARDO GARCIA: Is that for me?

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.813
SPEAKER: All of you.

00:26:25.813 --> 00:26:27.890
JENNIFER JANE: Yeah.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.140
I was going to
say, I think what's

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.960
interesting is obviously
what we went through was,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.610
without a doubt, a huge thing.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:38.090
But the reality is that,
in a burn trauma ICU,

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.680
life is very tough.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.550
You're surrounded by people that
are dealing with insane things.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.040
And so I think that's when
you really kind of take it in

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.950
yourself and say, OK, you
know, this is our little room,

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.240
this is our moment, what
do we have [INAUDIBLE] OK,

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.140
he's fortune.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.010
In his case, he's
only lost one hand.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.910
He still has a hand.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.820
We met a lot of people who'd
lost both arms and both legs.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.120
We were meeting people who
had been burned to their core

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.620
and, you know, they
were going to be

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.480
in a bed for the next
five years, at least,

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.500
if they make it through.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:11.150
Like, you definitely have to
take into yourself what are we

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:11.930
dealing with.

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:15.410
And we tried to find the
positives as much as we could.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.230
And I think, by doing that,
we did actually do very well.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.931
And it's incredible
what people go through,

00:27:20.931 --> 00:27:21.930
and what they deal with.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.030
SPEAKER: You must have met
some pretty amazing people

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:23.770
through this process.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.270
JENNIFER JANE: Amazing people.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.400
SPEAKER: Do you keep
in touch with them?

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:25.760
JENNIFER JANE: Yes.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.000
SPEAKER: You do?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.370
EDUARDO GARCIA: Oh, yeah.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:26.740
SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:26.960
JENNIFER JANE: Yeah.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.366
SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:27:27.366 --> 00:27:28.241
EDUARDO GARCIA: Yeah.

00:27:28.241 --> 00:27:30.280
Yeah, that's--
Phil, you should--

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.902
you want to say
something towards--

00:27:32.902 --> 00:27:34.610
PHILLIP BARIBEAU:
Well, I would say, one,

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.920
it didn't, unfortunately,
make the film,

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.380
but a big reason we decided--

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.240
you decided-- to tell your story
was we went back to the ICU

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.430
in Salt Lake City and met
up with doctors and nurses.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.330
And basically, in
the trailer where

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:55.910
you see Eduardo said to
me, I would never go back.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.510
And that's something he's
only heard a couple times,

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.990
and through all of his patients.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.990
So it's like going back seeing
the effect, and on both ways.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.690
He's inspired to
talk to his doctors,

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.277
but they're also inspired
to see him come back,

00:28:10.277 --> 00:28:11.360
and where they've come to.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.890
So.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.640
EDUARDO GARCIA: That's Dr.
William Morris in the film,

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.360
who was the surgeon on
call when I walked in,

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.400
quote unquote, in his words, a
bag of bones with a heartbeat.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:28.220
And in that day, you know,
he whispered in my ear,

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.209
it's so good to see
you again, following

00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:32.000
kind of a powwow in
the hallway with nurses

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.490
that were on our team
and on our care team.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:45.240
And I swear, I felt so much
emotional pain come out

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.910
in those words, for
everyone he's never saved,

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:54.070
for every patient that he was
not able to keep on earth.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.671
And I also felt
like he was saying--

00:28:57.671 --> 00:28:58.920
because a lot of them give up.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.250
A lot of people give up
when the going gets tough.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.600
You know, the question from
Phil was about optimism,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.030
and whether that's
a choice or not.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.090
And that is a
choice, but it's also

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.562
a choice on whether we
share that or not, right?

00:29:12.562 --> 00:29:15.460
You know, we can keep so many
of these beautiful things

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.180
that we have ownership right
here, and never let them out,

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.100
you know?

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.340
Something happens on the street
on our way out of this building

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.580
today, and someone
bumps into you,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.620
we have a choice on whether
we turn around and scowl

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.950
or whether we just give a human
benefit of the doubt of just

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.680
that was someone's shoulder on
my shoulder, good to be alive,

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.180
you know?

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.240
And rather than bounce
that negativity out.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.400
And so I think when
Dr. William Morris,

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.740
in that moment with him,
I felt like, what am I

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.000
doing hiding this recovery?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.730
It's true, you know, I survived
something I should probably--

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.720
I should not have lived through.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.400
And maybe there's
a responsibility

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.150
in sharing that with others.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.080
And in turn, maybe through
this film, through "Charged"

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.630
and through this
documentary, there's

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.800
some story that supersedes
my story, you know,

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.980
and kind of affects
others that then others

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.070
can, in turn, take and
pass on and pass on,

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.990
which is-- you know, it's
first you've got to dream big,

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.770
and then with that dream you've
got to act on those dreams,

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.740
and be optimistic
about our own ability

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.164
to overcome almost all
obstacles, to a point.

00:30:23.164 --> 00:30:25.330
SPEAKER: So this is a
question for all three of you.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.210
Like, you know, in doing this
and going out and telling that

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.170
story, you've built a community
of, you know, injured veterans,

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.850
I would presume, right,
like children who have lost

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.320
their arms-- we saw the video--

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.390
people who have been
through really, really hard

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:38.540
stuff, really,
really hard times.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.610
So if you look
through all of them,

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.235
if you had to kind
of draw a narrative,

00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:43.390
like a couple common
points between all of them

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.598
in terms of what they've
done to rebuild their lives,

00:30:45.598 --> 00:30:47.410
what are those two
or three things

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.077
that you've seen with people
who've actually done that thing

00:30:50.077 --> 00:30:52.660
and actually are successful in
recovering, or on that journey?

00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:00.160
EDUARDO GARCIA: Unending
belief, ownership--

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.860
you know, be true to yourself--

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.670
SPEAKER: What does
that mean, ownership?

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:03.550
I've got to ask.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.670
EDUARDO GARCIA: It means
knowing or pretending

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.310
that I have my left hand, right?

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:13.300
It means being very proud of who
I am every day when I wake up,

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.280
and just this is me.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.700
This is me out of
the closet, you know?

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.430
And then relying
on others, right.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.040
Responsibly relying on others.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.030
Being like, hey
Phil, I'm challenged

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.030
by you wanting to film me
tomorrow, but let's talk about

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:32.710
it, you know, rather than
just letting things happen.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:37.690
Share the process
with your team.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.030
That's how the team
develops, you know?

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.500
JENNIFER JANE: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.270
I think perseverance
is the one thing.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.700
You know, if I said to you,
go and learn the violin

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.209
and you practiced
it three times,

00:31:47.209 --> 00:31:48.500
then you wouldn't be very good.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.430
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:51.250
JENNIFER JANE: [INAUDIBLE]
learn the violin

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.770
and you practiced every single
day for hours, by this time

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.876
next year, you might not
be too bad, you know?

00:31:55.876 --> 00:31:57.250
And it's the same
thing, I think,

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.560
from meeting these
people are getting

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.810
used to using prosthetics
and those things.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.910
It's literally trying
not to get angry

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.150
and just accepting and just
doing those little tiny things

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:09.790
every single day, and
then building on that.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:13.609
And a year later,
it's manageable.

00:32:13.609 --> 00:32:16.150
PHILLIP BARIBEAU: The thing I
noticed, just the simple thing,

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.302
is just the
appreciation for life.

00:32:18.302 --> 00:32:20.260
Like with that Challenged
Athletes group and we

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.490
filmed this triathlon.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.180
All of them had that same thing,
and treated every single day

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:25.840
as a gift.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.824
And so that was
really neat to see.

00:32:29.824 --> 00:32:30.740
SPEAKER: So what can--

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.050
tell us about the
documentary itself,

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.240
meaning that, you know,
what are your plans with it?

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.070
How can people in the audience,
how can people watching this

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.450
on YouTube, what can
they do to actually help

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.950
get that story out,
and where do you

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.790
want to bring the
story from here?

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.126
Where can people see it?

00:32:43.126 --> 00:32:44.000
EDUARDO GARCIA: Sure.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.190
So the "Charged" film is in the
middle of its festival process

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.690
right now.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:52.890
So we are touring the country
showing in select theaters

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.440
in festivals around the nation.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.960
If you go to our
website, chargedfilm.com,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.180
or follow us on Facebook--

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.150
and we update it constantly,
our festival schedule.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.530
We are looking and
hoping for distribution,

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:10.470
so that anybody in the world can
get online and watch the film.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.710
And so fingers crossed
that's upcoming.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:15.560
And then, you know,
for me personally,

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.950
I hope to use it as
a tool to continue

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:23.120
to keep me present with
this process, you know?

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.570
And I think it is my
calling to say something

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:30.800
like that, that is to
use this as an example,

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.190
to remind me every day and to
just share with others what

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:35.720
surviving can really look like.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.165
You can thrive.

00:33:37.165 --> 00:33:38.540
AUDIENCE: I had
the immense honor

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.660
of seeing this film at Telluride
Film Festival last year.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.250
And it was met with immense--

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:46.340
I mean, people just
were blown away.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.080
One of my favorite
scenes from the film

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.970
was when a young boy at a high
school you were speaking at

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:54.410
comes up and kind
of very vulnerably

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.940
comes and talks to you about
his brother who went through--

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.960
I think he was a burn
victim or something.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.490
I'm curious what that's like
for you, being on the receiving

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.860
end of people seeing you so
vulnerable on the screen,

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.815
and then coming up and
sharing their own stories.

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:11.690
EDUARDO GARCIA: Yeah.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:16.310
I feel like it's a tithe, right?

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.570
And it's interesting
when there's

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.639
sort of a reciprocal figure
eight that happens between you

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:26.679
and me in that exchange, in
that I need to continually feel

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.659
purpose with this project.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.280
And it's not even a project.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.730
It's part of my life,
is sharing this film.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.850
And just, like, feeling
that emotional release

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:40.179
from my surgeon in the
hallway basically charging me

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:42.219
and saying, what are
you doing with this?

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:45.280
Why aren't you using this
for good in the world?

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.040
And then if-- if we
can share this film

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.639
and somehow access a
part of someone that

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.800
is not Eduardo Garcia,
but is somewhere

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.370
inside of that other person
where then they open up

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:00.190
and they own an experience
that is like a splinter,

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.560
and they allow it to come
out, they become empowered

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.560
with their own voice and
with their own emotions

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.740
and their own strengths
to be vulnerable, right?

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.650
And then-- so when I
get that, it just, it

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:18.210
puts a big, big smile on my face
and in my heart just to say,

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.926
yeah, this is working.

00:35:20.926 --> 00:35:22.550
This is what needs
to happen, you know,

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.090
sharing this joie de vivre, you
know, like this joy of life,

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.135
in any form.

00:35:28.135 --> 00:35:30.260
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that you wouldn't change

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.970
what happened to you, but
that you would have done--

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.470
if you could go
back, you would have

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:35.928
done some other
things differently,

00:35:35.928 --> 00:35:37.770
or you would change
some other things.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.632
So I was just kind of curious
what you meant by that.

00:35:40.632 --> 00:35:41.840
EDUARDO GARCIA: I think the--

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.690
that's a question I get
asked a lot is, hey,

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.360
if you could go
back to that day,

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.130
would you do it differently?

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.860
And I mean, I would--

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.070
that day, I was just being me.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.760
I was hunting.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.160
It was an accident,
and an injury

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.060
that no one ever
wishes on anyone.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.370
And it's really-- it's just
unfortunate for me that

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:11.660
the other decisions I've made
in my life that have affected

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.650
others--

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.640
lying, cheating,
stealing-- you know,

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.470
those I'm not proud of, right?

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.770
Those are moments of weakness
where I really stepped outside

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:24.770
of that true person that I
would like to be in this world,

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:28.280
and for whatever reason
digressed into a person

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.440
that, you know, I
don't particularly

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.980
want to lead with every day.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.480
So I think that's
what I mean by it,

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.700
is I want to wake up and
be an honest man every day.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.460
And the day I was out
in the woods hiking,

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.770
it was a very honest situation.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.330
And therefore, I hold no
angst towards that day.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.700
AUDIENCE: I'm curious,
as both a company,

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.250
as Google, and then
as individuals,

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:54.680
how we can be most
helpful in propelling

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.870
your story or your
mission or whatever.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:59.240
If you were to have an ask
of us, what is that ask?

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.615
SPEAKER: That's
a great question.

00:37:00.615 --> 00:37:01.636
Thank you.

00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:05.130
You have 70,000 Googlers
who can help, so, please.

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.380
JENNIFER JANE: Yeah, I think--

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.120
oh, you want to answer that?

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.840
EDUARDO GARCIA: Yeah, great
question, how can others help.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.640
This is an independent film.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.120
You know, this is
something that we

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.140
did because, as-- collectively,
as a filmmaker, as participants

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.500
and subjects, we said this
is a message worth sharing.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:30.050
And yet our bandwidth is
like a cocktail straw, right?

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:31.620
And we are not distributed yet.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:36.410
So the help that we need
is to go watch our trailer,

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:39.260
read our bios, and
understand kind of more

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.290
about film and our message.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:43.310
And then share it.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:47.180
Share it, and share it, and
share it again, because I do

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:53.060
believe that there is a value
to sharing this joy of life

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.110
with others.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.440
And "Charged" film for me
is very much just that.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.830
It's an example of what
really living charged can be.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.710
And I think it's probably
a really terrific time

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.850
in our world to get that
message out in a big way.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.030
SPEAKER: Here, here.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.759
Well, Phillip,
Eduardo, and Jennifer,

00:38:09.759 --> 00:38:11.300
thank you for coming
to Google today.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.889
And rest assured, we are going
to do all we can to help you.

00:38:13.889 --> 00:38:14.930
JENNIFER JANE: Thank you.

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.490
EDUARDO GARCIA:
Thank you for all.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.840
[APPLAUSE]
