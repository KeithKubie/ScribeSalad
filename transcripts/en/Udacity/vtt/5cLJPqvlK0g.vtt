00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.130
Let us make this example a little bit more complicated, complicated enough that

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.260
it cannot be proven simply by applying one instance of modus ponens.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.240
Imagine that when the robot found that,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.930
imagine that the robot proved to itself that this box is not liftable.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.780
And the humans in the factory,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.500
who are trying to make fun of the robot said to the robot,.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.590
Well the reason it's not lift-able is not because it's not movable, but

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.890
because the batteries aren't working.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.750
So, now this situation is more complicated, the robot must also check it's back.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.430
So, now the robot begins a slightly different knowledge base, so

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.030
suppose that the knowledge in this knowledge base is.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.280
Cannot move, and battery full means it's not lift-able.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.380
It finds from its percepts again it cannot move.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.850
So it checks its battery, and it checks its battery, and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.300
finds that the battery is full.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.300
So there are two new sentences that get written in the knowledge base.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.490
Now, the knowledge base contains three sentences.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.030
As earlier, in resolutions you're improving, the agent must convert all these

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.720
sentences in its knowledge base into a conjunctive novel form.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.930
That means that these sentences can, can contain a literal or

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.770
a disjunctional literals, or a conjunction of disjunctional literals.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.410
So, if we begin by removing the implication from sentence one,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.410
because an implication cannot occur in a conjunctive normal form.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.280
So when we remove implication from the first sentence, we get this sentence.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.470
When a sentence is not yet satisfactory it is not a conjunct to normal form.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.120
Because this is a dis-junction of conjunctions, and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.530
what we want are conjunctions or dis-junctions.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.660
So we apply the deMorgan's law, and now we get the following sentence.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.700
We're simply taking the negation inside, which flips the conjunction into

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.670
a disjunction, and now we have three literals connected with this junction, and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.460
this is a conjunctive novel form, this junction of literals.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.350
So, now we have in the knowledge base three sentences.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.610
All three of them in the conjunctive normal form, either literals or

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.720
disjunctional literals.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.400
Recall that the robot wanted to prove not lift-able.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.560
So it takes the negation of that, this is,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.050
again, proof by refutation, so it considers lift-able.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.970
So now this knowledge base has four sentences, these four sentences coming from.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.230
The negation of what it wants to prove.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.470
Once again, the reasoning begins by the literal that it wants to prove,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.460
in this case, liftable.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.900
And it finds a sentence in which the negation of literal is true.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.810
So once again,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.930
we begin with the sentence S4, because that is what we want to prove.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.460
And we find a sentence in the knowledge base, which contains a lift-able which

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.140
is a negation of lift-able in the sentence s four that we want to prove.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.480
We resolve on this because they both cannot be true and

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.889
resolution here is to be subtract that we drop them.

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.240
Now in the sentence S one that is under consideration currently we have

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.790
two lift-ables.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.030
We can begin with either one of them.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.750
Let us begin with not battery full.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.170
We'll try to find a sentence,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.890
which contains a negation of this particular clause.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.860
It is a sentence, S3, which is the negation of this, so we resolve on this,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.710
battery full and not battery full because they both cannot be true.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.980
We'll drop them.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.660
Now in sentence, S1, we're left with just one literal, can move.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.500
We can try to find a sentence in knowledge base which can Here it is.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.190
And so we can resolve on them, and we dissolve on them.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.230
We drop them.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.390
And once we drop them then we have a null condition, which stands for

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.690
a contradiction.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.830
So you reached a contradiction.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.300
Therefore the assumption that this was lift-able cannot be

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.940
true therefore not lift-able is true, and

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.960
we have just shown that resolution in this case proves what wanted.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.850
One important point to note here is that a focused of

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.420
because of the conjunctive novel form.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.830
One important point to notice here is the focus of attention.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.460
Often, when the problem space is very complex.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.640
For example, when the number of sentences is very large,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.510
the sentences are very complex,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.930
it can become really hard to the logical agent to decide what to focus on.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.130
But, because we have converted at a conjunctive normal form, and

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.130
because resolutions [INAUDIBLE] is making use of resolution.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.000
Therefore, at any particular time,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.070
the logical agent knows exactly what to focus on.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.060
You always began with this literal.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.240
You always try to find a sentence which contains this negation.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.880
You always resolve on that.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.030
You take out the remaining literal in this sentence and proceed forward.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.910
This focus of attention,

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.410
this computational efficiency of resolution theorem proving, is arising because.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.690
Or what are called Horn Clauses.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.430
A Horn Clauses is a disjunction, it contains at most one positive literal.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.320
This is happening is S1,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.660
this is a disjunction that contains at most one positive literal.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.760
This is a negative literal, this is a negative literal.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.810
And the fact that it contains just one positive literal is a very powerful idea,

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.680
because that's where the focus of attention comes from.
