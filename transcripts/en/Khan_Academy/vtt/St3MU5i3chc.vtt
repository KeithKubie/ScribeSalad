00:00:00.702 --> 00:00:02.883
- [Voiceover] So what
we have here is a circle

00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:05.400
with the center at Point O,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.457
and then we have a tangent
line to the circle.

00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:09.431
Let me actually label this line.

00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:11.776
Let's call this Line L.

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:15.066
And we see at Point A is the point

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:18.469
that the tangent line
intersects with the circle,

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:20.120
and then we've drawn a radius

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.130
from the center of the circle to Point A.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.268
Now what we want to do in this video

00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:28.865
is prove to ourselves that this radius

00:00:28.865 --> 00:00:33.370
and that this tangent line
intersect at a right angle.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.879
We want to prove to ourselves

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.774
that they intersect at a right angle.

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:40.174
And the first step to doing that

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:41.477
is we're going to feel good,

00:00:41.477 --> 00:00:44.497
we're going to prove to
ourselves that Point A

00:00:44.497 --> 00:00:48.438
is the closest point on Line L

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:51.168
to the center of our circle.

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:53.333
So I want to prove,

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:57.677
prove that Point A

00:00:57.677 --> 00:01:01.845
is closest, closest point

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:06.268
on L to Point O.

00:01:06.268 --> 00:01:08.010
To Point O.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.580
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.893
and see if you can prove that to yourself.

00:01:12.893 --> 00:01:14.607
Well, to think about
that, just think about

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.592
any other point on Line L.

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:19.109
Pick any other arbitrary point on Line L.

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.615
It could be this point right over here.

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.172
It could be this point right over here.

00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:23.458
It could be this point right over here.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:27.162
And you immediately see that
it sits outside of the circle.

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:28.792
And if it's sitting outside of the circle,

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:30.071
I'll pick this point here,

00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:32.810
just so it'll become a little
bit clearer on our diagram,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.227
if it's sitting outside of the circle,

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:37.918
in order to get from
Point O to this point,

00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:41.244
I'm going to call this
Point B right over here,

00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:44.792
you have to go the length of the radius,

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:46.939
you have to go the length of the radius,

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.123
and then you have to go some more.

00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:52.049
So this length, the length of Segment O B,

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.077
is clearly going to be longer
than the length of the radius,

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:56.511
because you have to go to the radius

00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:58.630
to get to the circle itself

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.348
and then you have to
go a little bit further

00:02:00.348 --> 00:02:02.645
for any point that sits
outside of the circle.

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:04.652
So Point A is the only point,

00:02:04.652 --> 00:02:06.292
by definition this is a tangent line,

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.660
it's the only point
that sits on the circle.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.860
Every other point on Line L
sits outside of the circle,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.581
so it's going to be further.

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:17.507
So Point A, hopefully
this makes you feel good,

00:02:17.507 --> 00:02:18.645
because you pick any other point,

00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:19.805
it's going to sit outside of the circle,

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.663
so you have to go to the
radius and then some.

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:24.420
So hopefully this makes
you feel good that Point A

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.247
is the closest point on L
to the center of the circle.

00:02:29.897 --> 00:02:33.039
Now, we're not done yet, we
now have to convince ourselves

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.884
that if we have a point and a line,

00:02:35.884 --> 00:02:37.862
that the segment connecting the point

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:42.440
to the closest point on the
line, to that original point,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.362
that, that's going to be
perpendicular to the line.

00:02:45.362 --> 00:02:47.919
So let me give ourselves some space here.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.862
We want to prove, we want to prove

00:02:51.862 --> 00:02:55.095
that if we, that the segment,

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:59.022
segment connecting,

00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:03.940
connecting a point off the line,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.305
off the line,

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.916
and closest point on the line,

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:12.580
closest point on the line,

00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:15.485
is perpendicular,

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:19.772
is perpendicular to the line.

00:03:21.102 --> 00:03:23.239
So what we want to do,
is we want to say, hey,

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.204
if we have some line here,

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:27.326
if we have some line here, L,

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:30.888
and if you were to take
a point off the line,

00:03:30.888 --> 00:03:33.829
so let's say, so you wanted
a point off the line,

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.246
so let's say that, that's
this point right over here,

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:39.423
Point O, and you want the
segment connecting the point

00:03:39.423 --> 00:03:42.984
off the line to the
closest point on the line.

00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:45.861
So the closest point on the line,

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:49.407
so let's say that this is the
closest point on the line,

00:03:49.407 --> 00:03:52.594
we want to feel good that
this segment connecting them,

00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:54.710
so let me do this in a new color,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.211
that the segment connecting them

00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:58.758
is going to be perpendicular to the line,

00:03:58.758 --> 00:04:00.947
that it goes just straight down like that,

00:04:00.947 --> 00:04:03.761
that it's going to be perpendicular.

00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:06.184
And I'm gonna prove this by contradiction.

00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:07.984
I'm going to assume that
it's not perpendicular.

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:10.573
So assume,

00:04:10.573 --> 00:04:13.811
assume that the segment,

00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:16.322
segment connecting,

00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:19.151
connecting, this is kind of wordy,

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:23.536
a point off line

00:04:24.183 --> 00:04:27.283
and closest point to the line,

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:30.159
closest point to line,

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:35.877
is not, is not perpendicular

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.480
to the line.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.536
So how can I visualize that?

00:04:41.536 --> 00:04:44.592
Well, I could draw my
line right over here.

00:04:44.592 --> 00:04:47.136
So that's Line L,

00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:51.118
and let's say I have my
Point O right over here.

00:04:51.118 --> 00:04:54.630
Point O, and let's say the
closest point on Line L

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.570
to Point O, let's say that it's not,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.902
so let's say it's over here,

00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:00.783
that if I were to
connect these two points,

00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:03.035
that it's not perpendicular to Line L.

00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:04.405
So this is the closest point,

00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:06.364
let's call this Point A,

00:05:06.364 --> 00:05:08.514
and let's say that the
segment connecting these two

00:05:08.514 --> 00:05:11.580
is not perpendicular to the line.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.580
So let me get, so let's assume
this is not perpendicular.

00:05:16.618 --> 00:05:19.358
So this angle, this angle,

00:05:19.358 --> 00:05:24.327
this angle right here, is
not, is not 90 degrees.

00:05:25.217 --> 00:05:26.672
So if we assume that,

00:05:26.672 --> 00:05:28.940
the reason that this is going
to be a proof by contradiction

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.474
is I can show that if
this is not 90 degrees,

00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:34.477
that I can always find a point
that is going to be closer,

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:37.288
another point on Line L
that is going to be closer

00:05:37.288 --> 00:05:40.120
to Point O, which contradicts the fact

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.158
that this was supposed
to be the closest point,

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:44.937
A was supposed to be the
closest point on Line L to O.

00:05:44.937 --> 00:05:47.646
And how do I always find a closer point?

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:49.823
Well, I construct a right triangle.

00:05:49.823 --> 00:05:52.519
I can construct a right triangle,

00:05:53.456 --> 00:05:55.323
just like this.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:59.991
I can construct a right
triangle like that,

00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:01.826
and we see that this distance,

00:06:01.826 --> 00:06:04.194
let's call this distance
right over here a,

00:06:04.194 --> 00:06:07.143
and we could call the
base of this triangle b,

00:06:07.143 --> 00:06:08.814
let me do this in a different color.

00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:13.738
So a, b, that's the base
of the right triangle,

00:06:13.738 --> 00:06:17.127
and the hypotenuse is
the distance from O to A.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:19.038
We could call that c.

00:06:19.038 --> 00:06:21.655
We know from the Pythagorean Theorem

00:06:21.655 --> 00:06:24.511
that a squared plus b squared,

00:06:25.111 --> 00:06:26.807
plus b squared,

00:06:26.807 --> 00:06:30.013
let me do this, plus b squared,

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:32.440
is going to be equal to c squared.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.566
Is going to be equal to c squared.

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:37.150
And so b squared,

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.347
if we have a non-degenerate
triangle right over here,

00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:43.065
this is going to be some
positive value over here,

00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:45.939
and so a is going to be less than c.

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.827
So this gets us to the conclusion,

00:06:48.827 --> 00:06:51.491
because if this is some
positive value here,

00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:53.070
and a and c are positive,

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.626
everything are positive distances,

00:06:54.626 --> 00:06:57.245
then this tells us that
a has to be less than c.

00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:59.522
That a non-hypotenuse
side of a right triangle,

00:06:59.522 --> 00:07:01.080
of a non-degenerate right triangle,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.539
assuming it has some area,

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:04.413
is going to be shorter
than the hypotenuse.

00:07:04.413 --> 00:07:06.573
The hypotenuse is the longest side.

00:07:06.573 --> 00:07:10.497
So a is going to be less than c,

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:12.816
which would tell us, if a is less than c,

00:07:12.816 --> 00:07:14.693
that we've found another point,

00:07:14.693 --> 00:07:16.242
let's call this point, I don't know,

00:07:16.242 --> 00:07:17.574
I've used a lot of letters here,

00:07:17.574 --> 00:07:18.889
let's call that Point D.

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:21.072
D is going to be closer.

00:07:21.072 --> 00:07:22.821
D is closer.

00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:27.560
D is closer.

00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:30.137
So we've just set up a contradiction.

00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:34.406
We assumed A was the closest
point on Line L to Point O,

00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:36.568
but we assumed the segment connecting them

00:07:36.568 --> 00:07:38.277
is not at a 90-degree angle.

00:07:38.277 --> 00:07:40.100
If it's not at a 90-degree angle,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.358
then we can drop a perpendicular
and find a closer point,

00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:45.266
which is a contradiction to the fact

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:47.927
that A was supposed to
be the closer point.

00:07:47.927 --> 00:07:50.565
So this leads to a contradiction.

00:07:51.155 --> 00:07:53.457
Contradiction.

00:07:53.457 --> 00:07:56.911
Contradiction.

00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:58.927
Because you can actually
find that this is not

00:07:58.927 --> 00:08:01.860
the closest point, you can
always find a closer point,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.724
so therefore, the segment
connecting a point off the line

00:08:04.724 --> 00:08:08.872
to the closest point to the
line must be perpendicular.

00:08:08.872 --> 00:08:11.216
Must be perpendicular.

00:08:11.216 --> 00:08:15.039
So the segment connecting
a point off the line,

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:17.676
to a closest point on the line,

00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:21.239
that must be perpendicular to the line.

00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:23.599
Must be perpendicular to the line.

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:26.985
And just like that, we hopefully
feel good about the idea

00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:28.681
that if you have a radius,

00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:30.566
and the point at which it intersects

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:32.890
a tangent line to the circle,

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.884
that, that forms a 90-degree angle.

00:08:35.884 --> 00:08:38.999
The radius and the tangent line.
