00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.890
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, would you please
welcome Patrick Mork.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.890
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Patrick Mork: Thank you.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.890
It's great to see everybody today.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.620
Welcome to the marketing session of apps marketing
101 for developers for Google Play.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.360
Delighted to see everybody here.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.110
It's been a pretty amazing day, at least to
say it's been a surprise, it's been full of

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.240
surprises even for some of us on the marketing
team.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.789
It's been really exciting.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.009
20 billion app downloads, of course, on Google
Play.

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.859
One and a half billion downloads every single
month.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.970
And, of course, the source of a lot of those
revenues, as you've seen from some of the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.249
previous sessions, in application billing,
of course, being on a tear.

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:36.251
We're going to talk to you about marketing
today, spend a couple of minutes on how we

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:40.059
market the store and your apps to consumers,
which I think could be of interest to a number

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.309
of you, and then talk about app marketing
in itself, what is app marketing all about,

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.359
how should we do it?

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.090
What kind of frameworks can we share with
you and what kind of tools can we share with

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.090
you?

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.309
Let's think about marketing for a second.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.559
And probably some of you out there in the
audience have heard of the famous four Ps.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.360
Who's heard of the four Ps?

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.360
Okay.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.929
A couple people.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.460
Well, let's talk first of all what the four
Ps are not.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.850
Please, please, please, please download my
application.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.840
Please, please, please buy my app.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.990
Yes, you can do marketing that way, of course,
it's not the most effective.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.160
But we're going to talk about all the tricks
in the books that have to do with marketing,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.440
including the real four Ps which we'll get
to in a minute.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.890
One of the things I want to share is a little
bit our friendly neighborhood checklist for

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.409
what it is to do marketing when we're talking
about apps.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.829
So if your eyes do kind of start glazing over
at this point, it is 4:00 in the afternoon.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.180
It's been a very exciting day.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.180
Don't worry.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.130
The presentation is going to be available
offline.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.430
And we'll have versions for you to download,
especially of this particular slide.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.710
What we're going to talk about is basically
our apps, our business models, how to promote

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.560
applications, and how to distribute applications.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.409
And what we've done, actually, for all you
developers in the house to make this even

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.130
easier is we've kind of color-coded everything.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.200
So, basically, if you're a new developer or
you're a developer who don't potentially have

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.950
a lot of experience developing or marketing
applications, then there's a lot of this is

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.229
going to be new to you, especially the stuff
in blue, which is the basic stuff on marketing

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.879
that you should be looking at.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.950
If you're already a little bit more advanced
or an intermediate developer with some basic

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.720
marketing experience, you're going to want
to look at all the things that are highlighted

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.720
in green.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.140
And, of course, for those of you who have
been really successful, or some of the larger

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.640
developers who are making some money on Android,
which is always great news to hear, then a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.510
lot of the color coded stuff in red is advanced.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.920
But before we go into the actual nuts and
bolts, let's play a little video which gives

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.790
you a good idea of how we actually market
apps to consumers.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.440
This is gears and premiers exclusively at
Google Play.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440
[ Video.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.489
]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Suppose you buy an app on your computer

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.769
to send to your smartphone.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.349
You might need a cable to transfer it from
one to the other.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.930
And if you want it on your tablet, you need
to transfer it again.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.870
Suppose you used Google Play.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.190
You can buy an app on your computer and send
it to any of your Android devices instantly,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.690
with no cables.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.450
Because Google Play makes your apps available
anywhere, so you can enjoy them everywhere.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.800
Google Play, your entertainment all simply
here.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800
[ Video concludes.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.620
]
&gt;&gt;Patrick Mork: So this is kind of a little

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.879
bit just an example of how we're actually
getting out there and really starting to market

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.189
applications on your behalf and going out
and talking to consumers.

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.610
I think it's also worth sharing a little bit
what are the other kinds of things that we're

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.040
doing to market Google Play.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.430
In particular, one of the things that's worth
sharing with all of you in the room and all

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.200
of the people in our international audience
who are live streaming this today, is just

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.870
how much effort is going into marketing the
store.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.599
In the first six weeks of launch alone, we
did over 5 billion impressions to consumers

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.700
all over the world.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.230
Not to mention a lot of the other advertising
that you may have seen, for example, seeing

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.290
Google Play available on the nav bar across
all our Google properties.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.280
Or a lot of the emails in CRM that we've been
doing or a lot of the work that we've been

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.659
doing with partners.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.910
The advertising effort on behalf of the team
at Google Play and the marketing team has

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.770
been nothing less than spectacular over the
past couple of months and is only going to

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.770
grow and accelerate over time.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.250
More importantly, though -- and this is really
kind of, like, a big callout to all of you

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.190
in the room and to awesome of the developers
who have supported us, as Hugo said in his

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.860
keynote -- is there's been a lot of love from
the developer community, there's been a lot

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.390
of support from all our content partners,
whether that's game developers, app developers,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.080
books publishers, music labels, and movie
studios.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.510
Really, kind of the feedback that we've gotten
from the community, from all our partners,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.540
has been tremendous.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.260
And has really also helped accelerate the
awareness of consumers of what Google Play

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.450
is and as a destination to get all the things
content for their devices.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.390
So this has been amazing, and we really thank
you for that.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.700
But let's get to the nitty-gritty.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.330
Let's get to the stuff that we're really interested
in and excited about.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.890
And that is, how do we actually market apps?

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.750
Well, one of the ways that we look at things
at Google, and we encourage our partners to

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.080
do the same, is really this very simple matrix
that our CMO, Lorraine Twohill, has come up

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.100
with, which really guides the essence and
philosophy of marketing at Google.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.490
And that is really understanding users, building
magical experiences -- which in this case

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.840
is you guys building magical applications
-- and then really connecting the two.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.620
So let's take a really kind of bizarre but
fun and specific example of how that works

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.650
in reality when we talk about apps.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.210
Let's say that you're a carpenter.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.880
Or you're doing DIY in your house.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.180
And you're fixing chairs and you're hanging
frames up on your wall and you're maybe adjusting

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.310
beams, you know, in your house and you're
doing all sorts of work in your house.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.380
Well, how cool would it be if when you're
putting that frame up on the wall, the one

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.100
that you kind of like have to ask your wife
to sit 50 meters behind you to tell if you

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.060
it's crooked or straight, how cool would it
be if you had a little application that could

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.050
do that for you?

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.350
Like Ben Zibble's bubble app.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.850
I could fire up my bubble app and place my
phone on top of that frame and see if the

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.270
frame is perfectly aligned or not.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.130
Saves me a lot of time.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.230
Makes my life easier, and to some extent as
well, it's kind of a magical experience.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.550
The point is that applications are either
enhancing our lives or making our lives more

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.430
productive, or they're entertaining us.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.000
And they do it in such a way that really has
a magical quality and component to it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.490
And our role as marketers and your role as
marketers is, how do we connect those two.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.000
How do we connect the magic of the apps that
we build with, essentially, an entertaining

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.160
experience for a consumer or a productive
experience for consumers?

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.630
But, really, before we actually get into the
nuts and bolts of the four Ps themselves,

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.440
let's talk about research for a minute.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.250
Because when you talk about users, it really
starts with research.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.280
Before you even write that first line of code,
you really have to understand who your consumers

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.800
are, what they're doing, how they download
apps, where they download apps, and how they

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.480
consume and use those applications.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.240
And, really, it's a lot simpler than would
you think.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.450
People always think, oh, research.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.720
They think about IDC or they think about Nielsen
or they think about tens of thousand of dollars

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.120
spent on research.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.840
It's really not that complex or that expensive.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.150
The way we break it down, for example, is
we look at quantitative versus qualitative

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.150
research.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.620
At its very basic level, your quantitative
research is basically when you go out and

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.370
you do extensive questionnaires and you survey
thousands of different consumers or hundreds

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.370
of different consumers.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.160
And you're asking the basic questions that
you're trying to get answered.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.620
How often does this consumer download applications?

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.110
What kind of handsets are they using?

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.370
How much per month are they spending downloading
applications?

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.150
How long are they spending in an application
session?

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:02.030
You're really trying to understand kind of
the macro, broad picture of consumer demographics

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.610
and habits and consumption to guide the development
philosophy for your application.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.470
Then, of course, as you start building your
application, you get near that famous milestone,

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:16.910
that first milestone of having a beta or an
alpha, then, really, it's about qualitative

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.250
research.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.720
And qualitative research can take a lot of
different forms, like focus groups, for example.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.240
Or screen focus groups, or just sitting down
with a bunch of people that you may or may

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.320
not know that well around pizza and beers
and trying to understand what they think of

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.380
your app.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.210
And this is really the in-depth part of the
market research, which is where you're really

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.770
trying to understand how's the consumer using
my app?

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.490
How quickly does my app load?

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.580
What kind of features do they like?

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.000
How easy is the UI to navigate?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.330
And what kind of features could enhance the
application?

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.270
Or better yet, what features should I remove
because the consumers simply don't either

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.810
get the features or they don't really use
the features?

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:01.140
The best news about research and its ability
to guide our development philosophy, as I

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.080
said earlier, is that it's neither that expensive
or that time-consuming.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.050
You can start right now and you can do research
online.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.920
You can go, for example, to google.com/insights,
put together three simple questions, survey

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.490
1500 consumers and get answers in three to
four days at less than $1,000.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.070
On the quantitative side.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.500
And your focus groups -- again, this is something
you just need to know enough people that you

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.260
can get together groups of people and spend
an afternoon brainstorming and getting feedback.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.880
It's really not that hard and there's a lot
of tools available to do that.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.690
And now introducing the real four Ps.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.880
So how did the real four Ps influence our
marketing and our thinking around app marketing?

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.740
Well, of course, when we talk about the real
four Ps, we're talking about product, which

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.060
is our app.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.860
We're talking about price, which is our business
model.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:59.140
We're talking about distribution, which ends
up being how many devices are we covering?

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.820
What operating systems are we developing on?

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.260
And what channels within those operating systems
are we distributing on?

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.750
And lastly, we're talking about promotions,
which can be anything from the type of assets

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:15.230
that we build, the thumbnails, the screen
shots, the assets, the videos, our banners,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:21.170
search ads, all the kind of tools that we
would use to promote our applications.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:26.620
So talking about product, and I love this
analogy, and it's actually even better to

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.090
use this analogy at 4:00 in the afternoon,
because by that point, I know most of you

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.940
people have eaten, so you're not starving,
and you won't just run out of the room when

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.260
you see all this stuff that's on the slide.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.150
But truth be told, the way I look at it is
it's about snacking versus feasting.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.590
Right?

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.470
So around 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon, like
right now, you might have a little hunger.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.220
You might want a little something to snack
on.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.270
So you grab, you know, a Snickers bar or you'll
grab a bag of chips.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.120
And you open that bag of chips, and you will
push your hand into the bag, and you will

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.270
take out one or two chips.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.550
But you're not going to put your hand in and
take all the chips out of the bag and stuff

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.550
them in your face.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.650
Well, some people might, but you probably
won't.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.460
It's really something that you do just to
kill the hunger at that particular point in

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.630
time, versus, of course, feasting, which is
what's going to happen around 11:00 or midnight

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.960
tonight after you've been hearing Paul Oakenfold
and you're starving and you need about five

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.020
courses.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.160
Totally different experience.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.590
Why am I using this example?

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:34.570
Mobile app usage and mobile app consumption
is all about snacking.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.110
It's not about feasting.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.860
If you look at the research, the research
that we see and the research that's publicly

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.580
available will tell you that on average, consumers
are spending probably around an hour and a

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.700
half per day using apps.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.480
So what does that tell us?

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.330
Well, that tells us that if they're spending
about an hour and a half per day using apps,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.390
and they've got maybe 30 apps on their phone,
of which they use ten frequently, well, they're

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.460
probably going to use your app no more than
nine or ten minutes a day.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.460
Sounds obvious.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.090
But what's the implication for product development?

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.970
There's a couple of implications.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.010
The first implication is that if I'm -- as
a consumer, I'm using my favorite app, and

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:20.180
I'm using it for five minutes a day, if I
get a notification from you that says that

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.410
I need to update my application, activate
my Wi-Fi, and download two gigabytes of files

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.900
-- well, maybe with smart apps, now that's
going to be easier.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.220
But that still kind of goes against the philosophy
of snacking.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.760
Why am I going to spend five minutes downloading
a file when I'm using the app maybe nine minutes

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.640
every single day?

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.970
It has implications in terms of the load speed;
right?

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.560
If I'm getting on a bus and I've got two stops
and I want to check my sports scores or I

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.980
want to see what the weather's like in London
-- we know what the weather's like in London

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:56.540
-- but if I want to see what the weather is
like in London, I don't want the application

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.700
to take 20 to 30 seconds to load.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.901
I want to dip my hand into the experience,
dip it out, get my information, thank you

00:13:02.901 --> 00:13:05.270
very much, and I'm done.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.280
And it has lots of other implications as well.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.280
Right?

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.020
It has implications in terms of how easy is
the application to use.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:17.630
Let's say that I am on that bus in London
and I've got about 15 minutes' commute.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.410
Well, am I going to spend five minutes of
those 15 minutes actually reading through

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.350
all, like, you know, the options that are
available in the app and trying to read and

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.360
understand how the app works?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.360
Probably not.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.010
I really want to get into the experience quickly,
which means I need an intuitive UI, I need

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:39.000
very easy-to-use features, I need to be able
to dip in and dip out very quickly.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.130
So understanding your users and understanding
that people snack has direct implications

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.540
for how you develop content.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.500
So let's talk for a minute about great applications.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.270
And there are thousands of great applications.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.400
And, of course, we can't possibly cite them
all.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.730
But this is an old-school example that I like
to use.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:02.440
eBuddy is a Dutch developer that's been around
since 2005, 2006, started originally developing

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.130
J2ME apps.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:09.890
I remember that fondly, because I started
my career in games trying to sell J2ME games

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.120
to carriers five years ago.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.730
And hence the first slide about please, please,
please.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.700
You probably get the rest of the picture.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.120
Needless to say, obviously, you know, these
guys have been around a very long time.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.300
And they do a lot of things really, really
well.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.950
So what we did was we put together a handy
little checklist together for these guys for

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.339
what we think they do well.

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:33.589
A couple of things.

00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:37.620
First of all, the product really solves a
clear and present need.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.430
As I mentioned earlier, at the beginning of
my speech, you're either entertaining or you're

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.350
addressing a specific issue or making the
person's life easier.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:51.921
eBuddy does that basically by aggregating
five or six different IMs into one easy to

00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:55.370
use client where you can be logged into all
your instant messengers and be chatting with

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.810
your friends anywhere in the world no matter
what instant messenger they're using.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.750
They saw the need.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.080
They had excellent device coverage.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.620
One of the things that amazes me about developers
is that sometimes we'll see these great apps,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:16.280
and they'll be, like, 500 megabytes in size
and have a black list of 1200 devices.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:23.150
Well, one of the ways that you basically get
noticed in the apps market is through virality.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.740
And virality means reach.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.279
And reach means device coverage.

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:32.120
These guys have a very simple app that works
very quickly, it's easy to use, it loads quickly,

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.470
the UI is super intuitive and they're available
across lots of different devices.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.740
As a matter of fact, they're available on
nearly every device from Android 1.5 and up.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.830
Now, I'm not telling you guys need to go back
and develop on 1.5.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:51.000
But what I'm saying is, you need to be available
on as many devices as are relevant to maximize

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.810
your virality.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.170
Of course, the other thing that's important
with this application which goes without saying

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:02.670
and also helps virality is parity of features
across operating systems.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.000
If I have a great application that I get on
Android and it's got these cool features and

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.110
I tell my friend about it and he's got an
iPhone, he goes out and downloads it and it

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:14.029
doesn't have the same features, that's kind
of a crummy experience for him.

00:16:14.029 --> 00:16:15.120
Right?

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.540
Likewise, if the opposite happens that somebody
gets a great application on iOS and then tells

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.280
their friend and their friend downloads the
Android version and it's a port, that's not

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.390
a really cool thing to do, either.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.589
And, as a matter of fact, when you talk about
placement and getting featured in the Google

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:34.860
Play Store, that is a sure way not to get
featured in the Play Store.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.940
Right?

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.000
We want to make sure that Android consumers
have the best possible experience, and, if

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.490
possible, a better experience than on other
platforms.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:48.290
And lastly, continuously upgrading the application,
making sure that you're constantly fixing

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:53.670
bugs, constantly removing features that are
out of date, constantly improving on new features,

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:58.210
and making sure that the quality of your application
isn't just good when you launch, but it's

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.000
continuously and consistently good across
all your revisions.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.470
And if you look at eBuddy, they have a 4.3
rating across 155,000 reviews.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:16.050
And they have done 10 to 50 million downloads
on Google Play, which is actually a lot more

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.939
than some of the better-known apps than we
know here in the Valley.

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:24.040
So a lot of different things to (indiscernible)
over on our checklist.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.860
So you've heard a lot with productive from
me, but I'd like to turn it over to a video

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:34.320
from one of our top developers to talk about
their experience on product.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.639
[ Video.

00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:44.891
]
&gt;&gt;&gt; My name is Perry Tam, I'm CEO and cofounder

00:17:44.891 --> 00:17:45.891
of Storm8.

00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:48.660
&gt;&gt;&gt; And I'm Vatsal Bhardwaj, product manager
for growth initiatives here at Storm8.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.000
&gt;&gt;&gt; At Storm8, we make social games for mobile.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.480
In the past three years, we have created 30
titles, and they have been downloaded more

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.820
than 300 million times on more than 100 million
devices.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.990
&gt;&gt;&gt; When we look at marketing and marketing
strategy at Storm8, it actually starts with

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.920
the product concept.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.650
So when we are thinking about what game we
are going to build next, that's when marketing

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:10.650
starts.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:17.030
So we do a lot of rigorous market research,
surveying of our users to understand what

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:25.770
kind of games, what kind of features, game
mechanics will deliver the most fun.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:30.010
&gt;&gt;&gt; So to deliver high-quality product for
our users, there are really three things which

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.010
go with that.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.050
The first is a very strong focus on the target
consumers.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.770
The second piece is a solid product and product
management process.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:42.040
And then the third piece is add Analytics
and data capabilities.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:49.510
We pay a lot of attention to who are our target
users, where are they located, what kind of

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.679
Android devices they are using.

00:18:52.679 --> 00:19:01.179
&gt;&gt;&gt; There was a time that we did, like, 40%
of pricing to test out what would that drive

00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:05.080
the effect of, you know, our users' behavior.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.010
We also did maybe drop the price to 99 cents
for a limited time period.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:17.020
And from those tests, we collect a lot of
data as to whether they convert more free

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:23.610
users to paying users or actually could be
detrimental to us down the road.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:29.540
&gt;&gt;&gt; We pay a lot of attention to packaging
of our games.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.140
So it includes things like the screen shots,
the app icon, the description.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:40.490
And we want to make sure that it's well optimized
so that users who love that game can easily

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.490
discover it.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.960
We have a very strong data and analytics team.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:49.990
And throughout the process, we make sure we
do regress analysis and measurement to, again,

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:54.120
create the game that's going to be most fun
for our users.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.390
[ Video concludes.

&gt;&gt;Patrick Mork: Great.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.700
So there you have a little bit from Storm8.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.880
But as I hope you noticed, research, rigorous
development process, really iterating and

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.210
really understanding the data, right, critical
to getting the product right.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:15.780
But, of course, although we like to make great
apps and games, you know, if we can't pay

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.090
the water bill at the end of the month, it
all becomes a little bit hairy; right?

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.799
So no conversation would be complete, you
know, without talking about business models.

00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:26.550
I'm not going to spend a lot of time here,
because, of course, many of you just sat through

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.950
a session on monetization with Kenneth Lui
and his colleagues.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.100
I think they did an excellent job of describing
the various models out there.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.910
What I will try and do is add a little bit
my two cents and experience based on how to

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.650
look at each one of these individual models
and some of the unique variables that affect

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:42.650
each.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.980
So, you know, you've heard about freemium,
you've heard about the march of freemium and

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.250
how well that's doing.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.150
As Chris mentioned, it's over 50% of our revenue
now which is exciting.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:55.059
And we've seen a huge takeoff in freemium
over the last months.

00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:57.980
That's not to say that it's the right model
for you.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.940
That's not to say that it's going to make
you super competitive against the other apps

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.350
on your system.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.920
As we see, freemium works better in some categories
versus others.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.290
We really have to understand what the right
price points are when it comes to freemium.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.870
What's going to be the way to engage with
consumers?

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.590
How often do we provide notifications to consumers?

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.200
What kind of notifications do we provide and
at what price points?

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.960
So it's really about testing, testing, re-understanding,
changing the pricing, looking at price elasticity,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.530
and really measuring and analyzing what works.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.590
More importantly, I think one of the questions
I want to address directly is talked about

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.640
paid applications.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.510
Because many of your applications out there
will still be paid apps.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.640
And as mentioned earlier, freemium might not
work for you.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.299
So let's spend a minute talking about paid
applications.

00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:46.960
And I really wanted to talk about two things
when it has to do with paid apps.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.430
Because even though we're in the world of
smartphones and Java is long gone from now,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.160
well, there's still a lot of things that don't
change.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.690
There's still a lot of constants that remain
the same.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.150
One of those is the challenge around pricing.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:05.220
So the myth around the 99-cent price point
or the 99-cent dilemma as I call it, here's

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:10.530
the dilemma: The dilemma is that if you look
at a curve and you look at the number of applications

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:15.000
available on the Android platform or on iOS
for that matter, you'll see the left side

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.050
of the curve where the majority of the apps
lie are where most of those apps are at 99

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.050
cents.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.790
And here's the problem with that.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:30.700
Well, the problem is that if you price your
app at 99 cents from the get-go, how do you

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.710
discount?

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:37.230
If you want to put your app on sale, where
do you go from 99 cents?

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.230
You can't.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.420
It's a lot harder.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.980
And one of the rules of marketing, you'll
hear several of those today, is very simple,

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:53.160
and it's this: It's always a lot easier to
take your price down than to raise your price.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.830
In any product, in any category, in any supermarket,
in any industry, it's always the same case.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.300
So our recommendation there is, if you are
going to have paid apps, always start at a

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.180
slightly higher price point, because it gives
you flexibility to discount and make offers

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.179
on your application.

00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:13.179
The other reason why we believe pricing at
99 cents is a risk is because, ultimately,

00:23:13.179 --> 00:23:16.500
most of us, when we go to make a purchase,
let's say we're buying a pair of sneakers

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:23.040
or buying a pair of jeans or we're buying,
I don't know, a plane ticket, having a lower

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.410
price tells us a certain thing about the product
that we're buying.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:30.510
And in many cases, low price equals cheap.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:34.130
So the question to you, then, is, is that
the kind of message that you want to pass

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:35.200
to your consumer?

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.370
The person that's seeing your app for the
first time?

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.410
That maybe sees your app side by side with
five other competitors, and you're the cheapest

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.320
app?

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.940
That sometimes works for consumers who are
really price-sensitive.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.970
But for other consumers, they'll look at that
and say, "This app basically does the same,

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.100
so it's probably not as good."

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.260
And that does happen.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.910
More likely what we like to did is we like
to encourage you guys to really think about

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.430
the price life cycle of your application.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.940
What we've done is build kind of a theoretical
model on what that looks like.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:09.520
In this particular case, an app developer
launches an app or game at 2.99 and they get

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.880
a certain number of installs.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.179
The first month, it's 50,000.

00:24:12.179 --> 00:24:13.980
The second month, it's another 40,000.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.100
The third month, it starts to drop.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:21.070
And at that point, because they priced at
2.99, they're able to able to drop the price.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:26.540
So they drop the price to 1.99, and they get
a whole bunch of new users who go, "Oh, yes,

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.540
great.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.540
An offer.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.540
I'm going to get this app now."

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.720
And they share with their friends, and they
say, "You know, I was a cheap bastard before.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720
I didn't want to buy it at $3.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.200
But now it's at 2.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.200
I'm in."

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.200
So they buy the app.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.090
And the friends start piling in and you get
a little bit of virality because they're getting

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.090
a great deal.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.650
What do you do?

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:43.950
You raise the price.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.110
Once you start getting that volume build and
that momentum, you raise the price.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:51.740
A lot of consumers who may have heard about
how great your app was, they don't necessarily

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.000
realize the price is no longer discounted,
so they still buy it.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.470
And you can basically get the difference of
what you were charging before versus after.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:05.140
And you can do that in cycles over time, until
you get to the end of the life cycle, or maybe

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.340
12 months or eight months out or whatever
your product plan is, you decide you're going

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.580
to phase out that app and launch a completely
new one.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:17.390
What do you do, since you priced at 2.99,
you're going to drop the price to 99 cents,

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.830
that's a great bargain.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:23.410
You can do that because you're at the end
of your price cycle and you're going to introduce

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.110
another app anyway.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.730
There what I'm saying is theoretical model
but encourage you to think of what is the

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:35.370
price life cycle of my app, how do I manage
it over a time and how do I give myself enough

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:40.880
flexibility with my price point that I can
move and pivot and change my price if I have

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880
to?

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.560
Let's talk about ads.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.270
So this chart was taken from a Kleiner Perkins
presentation by Mary Meeker.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:54.900
Some of you guys may read Mary Meeker on occasion
when she publishes material on the Internet

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.010
specifically and about mobile Internet.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:03.580
And the thing about ads is this: There's some
good news and there's some opportunistic news;

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.580
right?

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:09.040
The reality about ads is that ads today in
terms of ECPMs, which is the effective cost

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.680
per thousand or what you're getting paid for
your ads, is the ECPMs on mobile are significantly

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.750
lower than on desktop.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.200
No surprise; right?

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.090
Desktop's been around ten years, has a different
user base.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:24.190
They spend perhaps more time on desktop, so
the value of ECPM is higher.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.510
Mobile is still a lot lower.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.592
But the good news is, when you look at this
graph, you'll see that the yellow bar, the

00:26:29.592 --> 00:26:34.880
bar on the left across all of these different
types of media, that's the amount of time

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.960
spent by consumers.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.170
So what do we see here?

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.450
Well, we see that on average, consumers are
spending about 10% of their time on mobile,

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.900
which is huge.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.610
That's massively encouraging for every single
one of us in this room and every single one

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.600
of us around the world who is developing great
content.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:56.480
The challenge is, only 1% of the ad dollars
are flowing into mobile today.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.179
But that means a massive opportunity.

00:26:59.179 --> 00:27:00.799
Why?

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:02.419
Simple.

00:27:02.419 --> 00:27:06.820
Dollars always follow eyeballs.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.590
That's just the way advertising works.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.810
There's always a lag.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.290
Which means, essentially, if you have a great
product and you really understand how to monetize

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:18.840
through ads, it's a question of time before
that gap closes and before the ECPMs either

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.299
get close to or match what we see on desktops
and enable you guys to really maximize the

00:27:23.299 --> 00:27:28.039
monetization of your apps through ads.

00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:31.370
I think the last point I want to make -- well,
two more points on monetization before moving

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:35.310
on -- is, use hybrids.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.310
We saw that earlier.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.110
We talked -- we saw paymium.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.180
We saw a combination of different business
models.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.130
And this is really exciting stuff because
what we're seeing is more and more developers

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.160
are starting to do that and it's starting
to pay dividends.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.200
And it also reduces your risk as a developer.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.900
So if you have in-app payments, that's great.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.669
Why not throw in app ads if it makes sense,
and you can potentially monetize from both

00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:58.270
or you can see which works better than the
other.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:02.320
Having a hybrid and a combination of different
business models gives you more flexibility

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.790
and maximizes your ability to monetize your
apps.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.070
Last point on monetization.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:13.480
We live in a global world.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.919
Apps are being downloaded every single second,
all over the world, on all sorts of different

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:18.919
devices.

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:21.929
So what are the implications for you as app
developers?

00:28:21.929 --> 00:28:22.929
Simple.

00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:28.760
Different business models will work differently
in different countries.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.179
So if you've got a great game in the United
States where you know that a lot of consumers,

00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:38.110
may be 60% plus of consumers are on contract
and have higher-end smartphones, chances are

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:43.900
those consumers are more willing to pay for
your app, therefore, a paid app or in-app

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.940
payments might make more sense for you.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:52.090
But if you're trying to distribute and monetize
your apps in India, where, potentially, 90

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:58.040
to 95% of consumers are on prepaid cards and
they're still in the process of rolling out

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:03.120
3G networks where data is expensive, then
perhaps that business model doesn't work as

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.790
well and you need to think of maybe I should
monetize through ads.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:12.590
The reality there is, try and look at your
market globally and see how you can monetize

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.130
your app using different business models in
different regions.

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.690
Be creative.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.820
So once we've built this great product and
we know how we're going to monetize it and

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.169
keep all the lights on at the end of the day,
well, then we start thinking about, aha, how

00:29:26.169 --> 00:29:28.049
do I promote my app?

00:29:28.049 --> 00:29:29.640
Where should I spend my money?

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.080
Where should I spend those hard-earned VC
dollars that are going to enable me to get

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:44.520
more users, yay, another rule of marketing,
rule number two numero uno, don't invest behind

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.860
a weak product.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.470
It goes behind saying.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:53.100
But you see people do this all the time, and
not just in our business, but in tons of businesses.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:58.169
If you invest behind a weak product, you're
basically creating a negative consumer perception

00:29:58.169 --> 00:30:02.100
of your product and of your brand, if that's
what you're trying to build.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.480
You should go back to the drawing board and
rework your application until you're sure

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.120
that you have the best possible experience.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.640
If you're not excited about your application
or you're not convinced you would pay, do

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.860
you think a consumer is because they're going
to see an ad that you're seeing on AdMob or

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.570
somewhere else?

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:18.770
Probably not.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.340
Once you're really sure that you have a great
product, then there's a number of great frameworks

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:26.940
we can suggest to you that are going to help
you put together your marketing plan.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.049
The first of these is STP.

00:30:29.049 --> 00:30:30.049
Knowing your users.

00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:36.120
It's all about segmenting, targeting, and
then positioning your app properly.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.760
The second one is once I position my app properly,
I know who I'm going after, what's the message

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.030
I'm giving the consumer?

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.570
What is my one liner?

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.169
What are my points of difference?

00:30:46.169 --> 00:30:48.020
Why should a consumer care?

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.070
Third, once I have all my messaging down and
I've properly positioned my app and I know

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:56.070
where I'm going, it's, well, how do I build
a structured marketing plan?

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.630
What needs to go into my marking plan?

00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.080
What kind of activity should I do?

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.080
Lastly, what is my media strategy look like.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.520
The good news is I'm going to go through each
one of these in detail and explain in detail

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.809
a little more clearly.

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:12.020
Let's look at our audience.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:18.330
So let's say, for example, I'm a game developer
and I've seen this great case study from Kenneth

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:23.450
Lui at Google I/O, I've decided, you know
what, that's it, dude, I'm going for in-app

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.780
payments.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.990
I'm going to do in-app payments with, like,
funky furry animals at different price points.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:33.080
I'm going to get a ton of downloads to get
consumers to basically pay me a the lot of

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.710
money.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:39.159
If you are going to do in-app payments on
games, then probably what you need to do is

00:31:39.159 --> 00:31:47.150
really segment your target audience properly
and look at how you target those people.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:53.350
Excuse me.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.740
So if I'm using in-app payments for game,
there's two axis probably that I'm going to

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.740
look at.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.460
I'm going to look at available time.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.679
I need people to have available time to play
my games.

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:04.310
And then I'm probably going to look at disposable
income.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.970
Because if a person is 13 years old and has
tons of available time but no income, I'm

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.600
not going to make much money from them.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.159
I segment my audience this way.

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:16.549
I come up with all these different segments
that I have.

00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:23.230
Upscale adults, techies, middle income families,
soccer moms, whatever it happens to be.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:28.120
And when I look at my matrix, I think, okay,
the right target audience is probably these

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.120
guys.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.410
Young adults 24-35 years old, no kids, right?

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.299
So they have disposable time and they have
income.

00:32:37.299 --> 00:32:38.299
That's my target audience.

00:32:38.299 --> 00:32:41.860
Then it's a question of, okay, how do I position
my app?

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.390
What's my one-liner to those people?

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:49.090
What am I going to tell those people to click
and install my application?

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.110
Which takes us to the next step.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.570
How do I develop convincing messaging?

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:58.800
What's the one line that I'm going to tell
people about my sports application that is

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.850
going to get them so excited that they are
going to want to download it?

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:05.030
Is it that I have realtime instantaneous scores?

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:09.210
Is it the fact that I'm the only application
that has social engagement and built-in hangouts

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:10.740
into it?

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.870
Is it the fact that I have this application
that runs on all sorts of different platforms

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.059
and backs up my data on the web?

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:17.210
What's your one liner?

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.679
What's your positioning statement?

00:33:19.679 --> 00:33:23.350
After that, what are the two or three key
points of difference that are going to go

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.850
into my product description?

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:29.520
So that when people land on my page, because
they have searched or clicked an ad, they

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.890
read these three or four great things about
the application.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:35.200
Not the bug fixes, but the stuff that really
matters.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.110
They think, this app is really cool because
it has Android beam and I can do all this

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:44.530
crazy stuff like play multiplayer games without
activating Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:45.530
That's wicked cool.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.950
I'm going to get that instead of that other
application.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.679
And lastly, what's my call to action?

00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:59.100
When you start doing Get Creative, we see
app developers do ad campaigns, online stuff,

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.470
banners, they advertise their little logo
with a little dragon and it doesn't tell me

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.650
anything about what I should do next.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:12.029
Okay, so you've got me all excited about your
little furry animals and I can get these collectable

00:34:12.029 --> 00:34:13.779
items, what do I do?

00:34:13.779 --> 00:34:15.319
Where do I go?

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.809
Where can I find this app?

00:34:17.809 --> 00:34:19.269
Clear calls to action.

00:34:19.269 --> 00:34:22.579
On the right-hand side -- actually I thought
it would be fun to share this.

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:29.119
Kushagra, who is working with us right here
on the Google Play team and actually is the

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:32.440
one who really was responsible for a lot of
this material as well as the interviews, so

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.960
I owe him a huge debt of gratitude on that.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:40.929
Kushagra put together an amazing promotion
at the end of last year around apps.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.049
Some of you guys may have seen it.

00:34:42.049 --> 00:34:44.499
In December, we hit 10 billion downloads.

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:46.210
We did a promotion called 10-10-10.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:50.759
I really need a beer.

00:34:50.759 --> 00:34:56.280
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Patrick Mork: Water just doesn't do it.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.280
Anyway.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.309
We put together this promotion called 10-10-10.

00:34:59.309 --> 00:35:05.239
That was to celebrate 10 billion downloads
and that now seems like a long time ago, right?

00:35:05.239 --> 00:35:07.160
20 billion now, great stuff.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.520
We put together this promotion called 10-10-10.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.989
We had three key things we want today communicate
to consumers.

00:35:13.989 --> 00:35:22.420
10 days, 10-cent apps, 10 apps a day.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.420
Really simple.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.660
Yet, even though it was so simple, as you
can see going from top to bottom, we went

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.450
through several different versions of creative
material to get to the right creative.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:36.210
You are not even seeing all of it because
it wouldn't fit on the slide.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.460
We went through version after version after
version after version after version of getting

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.910
the creative right.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:46.510
And the point here is whether it's your thumbnails
or your video or your text descriptions, you

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:50.299
iterate, iterate, iterate, iterate until you
get it right.

00:35:50.299 --> 00:35:54.579
And you test and test and test and test until
you get it right.

00:35:54.579 --> 00:35:56.549
Just like you do with your product.

00:35:56.549 --> 00:36:02.940
Creative is an iterative process, but it can
be so effective if you do it right.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.739
That brings us to the marketing plan.

00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:06.619
How do we build a plan?

00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:09.460
The way we look the marketing plans is quite
simple.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.810
Awareness.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:12.160
Trial.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.510
Purchase.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.780
And repeat.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:19.440
It has to be generally in that order.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.540
Why?

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:25.450
Because if I basically start jumping into
purchase, it's kind of like I met this pretty

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:29.069
girl at the Paul Oakenfold party tonight and
I say tomorrow morning, let's get married.

00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:30.380
Uh, no, you're weird.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.950
I am not going to call you again.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:37.089
It's basically, you have to go through the
steps of the process so that you can convince

00:36:37.089 --> 00:36:40.849
the consumer to get to the point where they
are going to consider a purchase.

00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:41.849
You start with awareness.

00:36:41.849 --> 00:36:44.259
Talk to them about what your product does.

00:36:44.259 --> 00:36:45.259
Where they should get it.

00:36:45.259 --> 00:36:46.259
Why it's unique.

00:36:46.259 --> 00:36:47.259
How it's different.

00:36:47.259 --> 00:36:49.510
There's a couple tools you can do here.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.359
This is not exhaustive, of course.

00:36:52.359 --> 00:36:53.359
Good PR.

00:36:53.359 --> 00:36:56.539
One of the most underused things I see in
this industry.

00:36:56.539 --> 00:37:03.059
Talk to the press, become their friends, make
sure that you send them their APKs, get them

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:05.420
to your studio to see what you are working
on.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:10.260
It can be one of the most effective marketing
tools you can do and one of the cheapest is

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.499
to get these people to write about your apps.

00:37:12.499 --> 00:37:16.410
I'll give you another tip.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:23.180
Getting people to write about your apps has
a direct influence on your search rankings

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.089
in the play store.

00:37:25.089 --> 00:37:27.589
It's called web anchoring.

00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:31.609
It means that the more people kind of like
click on a link externally outside the play

00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:36.569
store and come to your page, because they've
read about you, the better you will index

00:37:36.569 --> 00:37:39.559
in the search rankings.

00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:42.049
Social.

00:37:42.049 --> 00:37:43.190
We talked about virality.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.020
Have a blog.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.289
Invite people to comment on it.

00:37:46.289 --> 00:37:47.739
Post your APKs on it.

00:37:47.739 --> 00:37:48.739
Create discussion.

00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:49.880
Get people to talk about it.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.900
Of course, other basic tools.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.589
Search ads, mobile ads.

00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:57.710
If you get to the point where you have the
available cash, well, TV or above-the-line

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:58.710
media.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.680
Then we talk about trial.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.089
What can we do for trial?

00:38:03.089 --> 00:38:05.599
We talked about some of the business models
earlier today.

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:07.109
We can have a free trial version.

00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:10.119
A version where I can use the app for 30 days.

00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:12.400
And then it's great because I don't have to
pay pour it and I can really figure out if

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.759
I like it.

00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:15.430
Why is trial so important?

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.640
Very simple, guys.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:23.180
It's very important because essentially many
consumers out there have never experienced

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.450
content before.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:29.190
Many consumers out there are getting a smartphone
for the first time and they will think this

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.400
content stuff is marvelous.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:36.729
Are they going to shell four five bucks or
euros if they have never tried content before?

00:38:36.729 --> 00:38:38.369
Probably not in some cases.

00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:42.960
By providing a free version of your application,
you generate that comfort level.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.170
When I was in the soft drinks business -- I
worked at Pepsi for many years.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:50.029
When we would launch a new drink in the market,
we would go out and give hundreds of thousands

00:38:50.029 --> 00:38:51.210
of cans to people.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.440
We'd have these pretty girls in mini skirts
and walking down in the middle of traffic

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.190
and they would knock on your door, how about
a can of Pepsi max?

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.609
Why did we do that?

00:39:00.609 --> 00:39:01.609
Trial.

00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:03.839
We want to make sure that the consumers love
the product.

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:05.119
Hopefully they like the girls, too.

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:06.829
But they love the product.

00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:09.259
So that when they go to the supermarket, they
have had it, tried it.

00:39:09.259 --> 00:39:10.729
Yeah, yeah, this is pretty good stuff.

00:39:10.729 --> 00:39:12.859
I think I'll buy a six-pack.

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:15.799
Same thing goes for apps and games.

00:39:15.799 --> 00:39:17.210
We move on to purchase.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.759
Purchase, of course, there are other things
we can do.

00:39:19.759 --> 00:39:23.359
We can do direct response campaigns where
we are pushing people to download the app.

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:24.359
They have heard about it.

00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:26.069
They have read about it on Tech Crunch.

00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:27.890
They have read the blogs.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:29.299
Talked to their friends about it.

00:39:29.299 --> 00:39:30.609
We can do notifications.

00:39:30.609 --> 00:39:34.739
We are saying, hey, guess what, you have now
been playing my game for 30 days, it's time

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:35.739
to pay up.

00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:37.329
They may or may not do that.

00:39:37.329 --> 00:39:40.150
But, of course, at least they have had the
opportunity to try it because you have gone

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.270
through step two.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:45.420
Lastly, repeat.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.829
Third rule of marketing.

00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:53.720
Always easier to get money from an existing
consumer than a new consumer.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.920
Makes sense but a lot of people don't follow
that rule?

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.440
How do we keep the consumer interested.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.569
We heard about it in monetization panel.

00:39:59.569 --> 00:40:00.569
Right?

00:40:00.569 --> 00:40:02.200
You give them more don't.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.890
You upgrade your app frequently.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:05.799
You introduce new features.

00:40:05.799 --> 00:40:08.640
You give them new reasons to pay for this
stuff.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.420
You provide updates.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.019
You have CRM campaigns because you've actually
been talking to your consumers for the past

00:40:14.019 --> 00:40:19.989
three years and you have an email database
of 150,000 loyal fans who have downloaded

00:40:19.989 --> 00:40:21.289
your app.

00:40:21.289 --> 00:40:24.640
That's all about repeat.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:30.740
But we do have a pretty good idea already
of what kind of stuff works.

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.729
So when I was talking about research earlier
in the session, we did this over the last

00:40:34.729 --> 00:40:36.019
couple of weeks.

00:40:36.019 --> 00:40:42.380
We put out a couple of questions on google.com/insights,
paid about a thousand bucks, whatever, basically

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.569
asked people, what influences your decision
to install an app?

00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:48.789
U.S. only consumers, granted.

00:40:48.789 --> 00:40:53.039
We got about 1500 responses which is statistically
significant.

00:40:53.039 --> 00:40:55.359
And here's what they told us.

00:40:55.359 --> 00:40:58.479
I'm influenced by user reviews.

00:40:58.479 --> 00:41:00.440
Top apps lists.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.020
User ratings.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.020
And screen shots.

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.020
Those are the top four.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.749
Now, obviously, it doesn't mean that they
are not influenced by the rest.

00:41:06.749 --> 00:41:10.769
But they are influenced by a lot of stuff
that you guys control.

00:41:10.769 --> 00:41:15.269
You control the user ratings because you can
control how good your product is and how frequently

00:41:15.269 --> 00:41:16.339
you update it.

00:41:16.339 --> 00:41:20.579
And how many cool features you build in and
how many crap features you take out.

00:41:20.579 --> 00:41:23.319
You control the text description.

00:41:23.319 --> 00:41:26.269
Because you read the great marketing slides
that talk about how important creative is

00:41:26.269 --> 00:41:30.880
and you built killer text, great assets and
super powerful video that have gone totally

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.619
viral on YouTube.

00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:36.209
So you control a lot of that stuff.

00:41:36.209 --> 00:41:42.160
And search, you don't control that directly
but you do control it indirectly.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.599
Why?

00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:50.549
Tip number two: The other thing that affects
your search rankings in the Google Play store,

00:41:50.549 --> 00:41:53.119
is the number of installs.

00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:57.200
The more installs you have, the higher you
are on the search rankings.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:05.579
However, caveat, the more uninstalls you have,
the lower your search rankings, which is why

00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:07.750
you have to be careful when you use marketing.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:12.170
Because if your product is not good enough
and you get a lot of installs and then more

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:17.260
uninstalls than installs because people figure
out your app was not good, it is going to

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.239
penalize your search rankings.

00:42:20.239 --> 00:42:24.880
The last one on the list is paid advertising
or search.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.710
Paid search, AdMob ads.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.249
That stuff can be very effective at scale
but isn't necessarily the primary things that

00:42:30.249 --> 00:42:32.529
drives interest from consumers.

00:42:32.529 --> 00:42:34.009
Wow.

00:42:34.009 --> 00:42:36.859
Lots of stuff.

00:42:36.859 --> 00:42:37.989
It's time to advertise.

00:42:37.989 --> 00:42:43.239
It's time to get out there and spend my hard-earned
dollars advertising to consumers.

00:42:43.239 --> 00:42:44.540
What do I do?

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.510
Well, we typically break this down into two
different components, if you will.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:52.549
One component is, of course, brand awareness
or brand advertising.

00:42:52.549 --> 00:42:56.719
Many consumers are very familiar with this,
typically bigger brands do this.

00:42:56.719 --> 00:43:00.819
But also developers who aspire to really build
a long-lasting presence on mobile are starting

00:43:00.819 --> 00:43:01.979
to do this.

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:05.289
And the thing that we're starting to see after
three or four years now on the smartphone

00:43:05.289 --> 00:43:12.700
app space, you are starting to see the emergence
of the world's first mobile brands, which

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.700
is really cool.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:14.700
Right?

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:19.839
These are apps that have basically built their
reputation and built their brand on mobile.

00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:25.319
Angry Birds, massive brand started on mobile.

00:43:25.319 --> 00:43:29.049
Lookout Mobile Security, security app, started
on mobile.

00:43:29.049 --> 00:43:33.700
Uber, some of you guys, little more niche,
started on mobile.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.099
We're seeing more and more mobile brands and
brands being built for the first time through

00:43:37.099 --> 00:43:38.099
mobile.

00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:43.749
When we tuck about brand advertising, that's
stuff like if I come up with a cool video

00:43:43.749 --> 00:43:46.719
for my app and I promote that through YouTube.

00:43:46.719 --> 00:43:51.619
I might not necessarily get a ton of people
to buy it but I create a lot of awareness.

00:43:51.619 --> 00:43:52.619
Why?

00:43:52.619 --> 00:43:56.690
Because a picture is worth a thousand words
and a video is worth a thousand pictures.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:57.920
That's brand awareness.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.339
That's brand advertising.

00:43:59.339 --> 00:44:04.240
TV, outdoor, YouTube, videos, that's brand
awareness.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.319
How do you measure that stuff?

00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:07.869
You might ask, why on earth would I do this?

00:44:07.869 --> 00:44:09.470
I need to be able to measure this.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:12.660
If I do an AdMob campaign, I can measure the
clicks.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.839
That's true, but you can measure brand.

00:44:14.839 --> 00:44:16.880
It's a different way of doing it.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.700
Essentially what you need to do is you run
what's called a brand tracker which can be

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:25.459
very simple exercise of asking three to four
questions to your base of consumers every

00:44:25.459 --> 00:44:27.079
single month.

00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:31.019
And you ask them questions like, for example,
among the following kinds of sports apps,

00:44:31.019 --> 00:44:32.700
which have you heard of?

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.519
You list all the apps, yours and your competitors.

00:44:35.519 --> 00:44:37.759
That's aided brand awareness.

00:44:37.759 --> 00:44:41.950
You can ask another question which is, which
sports apps have you heard of in general?

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:43.890
That's unaided brand awareness.

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:48.170
You can ask questions, for example, of in
the next four weeks, do you intend to purchase

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:49.869
a sports app?

00:44:49.869 --> 00:44:51.140
That's purchase intent.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.849
So there are a lot of ways to measure brand
awareness.

00:44:53.849 --> 00:44:57.489
Most of your time, however, is probably going
to be focused on the second bullet which is

00:44:57.489 --> 00:44:59.880
all about direct response.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:06.059
And in that case what you're looking at is
stuff like search, mobile ads, incentivized.

00:45:06.059 --> 00:45:13.380
So tip number four: Search at least for us
when we are promoting the Google Play store

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:18.680
has been one of the most effective ways to
actually advertise.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.500
Why?

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:24.170
First of all, because the click through rate,
which our colleagues previously mentioned,

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:27.349
is higher on search generally than any other
medium.

00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:28.519
Why is that?

00:45:28.519 --> 00:45:31.489
Because search is an active advertising form.

00:45:31.489 --> 00:45:35.430
Search basically provides a request, provides
information to a consumer who is already looking

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:38.140
for something specific.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:43.609
Therefore, the odds are that that person is
more interested in that result because it's

00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:46.259
specific to what they are looking for.

00:45:46.259 --> 00:45:50.160
If I do a search on sports apps and I see
your app and I'm interested in sports, the

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.059
probability is higher that I'm going to download
that.

00:45:52.059 --> 00:45:56.640
That's going to be more cost effective for
you and higher probability that that person

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.569
is actually going to install your application.

00:45:59.569 --> 00:46:03.880
Typically, what would you expect from a good
mobile search campaign?

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:09.660
For us, we see good search result -- a good
click through rate on mobile search through

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:14.969
3, 4, 5% click through rate, or at least 2%,
somewhere around there.

00:46:14.969 --> 00:46:20.039
Ads you can use and are a great way to scale
your marketing efforts but are typically going

00:46:20.039 --> 00:46:22.099
to be a little bit less effective?

00:46:22.099 --> 00:46:23.099
Why?

00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:26.579
Because ads essentially are a passive means
of advertising.

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:30.990
The consumers playing a game on a web site
somewhere and they see an ad and basically

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.319
it's a passive experience.

00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:34.309
I'm either interested in or I'm not.

00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:37.759
But I'm not specifically making a proactive
search for it, so I'm probably not looking

00:46:37.759 --> 00:46:39.079
for your application.

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:45.829
Web site typically a good response rate for
Mobile ad campaign can be .5, .6, .7, .8%

00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:50.099
CTR, vastly different from what you would
get on search.

00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:56.309
Perhaps more targeted in certain cases and
perhaps we can get more scale but, again,

00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:59.099
different results.

00:46:59.099 --> 00:47:03.470
So here we're going to actually run another
video where we interviewed another one of

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:09.930
our top developers, this case it was Pocket
Gems telling us about their experience marketing

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:13.559
and what worked for them.

00:47:13.559 --> 00:47:21.839
[ Video ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Arjun Dayal, Android product leader

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:22.839
for Pocket Gems.

00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:26.869
&gt;&gt;&gt; And Michael Dawson, I lead business development
in Pocket Gems.

00:47:26.869 --> 00:47:32.410
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pocket Gems is a Mobile gaming focused
company that was founded in 2009 and is backed

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:33.410
by Sequoia Capital.

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:37.690
Our titles have been downloaded 60,000 times
and on Android specifically we've had five

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:40.309
titles released in the past nine months.

00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:45.109
Marketing in Pocket Gems allows us to inform
our community about our new unique experiences.

00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:50.599
What we found is that by focusing on creating
unique experiences applied to the broadest

00:47:50.599 --> 00:47:55.459
audience what we're able to do is get the
most engagement out of our user base.

00:47:55.459 --> 00:47:58.829
&gt;&gt;&gt; For us the goal is to get our games in
front of as many people as possible.

00:47:58.829 --> 00:48:05.099
Google Play has been the most important for
that with by far the largest audience.

00:48:05.099 --> 00:48:08.869
&gt;&gt;&gt; For marketing messages a lot of the data
is really centered around engagement.

00:48:08.869 --> 00:48:14.460
And for that -- we're able to engage the effectiveness
of messages and how connected our community

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:20.420
and population is based on the amount of time
they spent in the app and the number of times

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.769
they looked at different aspects.

00:48:23.769 --> 00:48:26.940
&gt;&gt;&gt; We take a multichannel approach.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:33.510
The most important channel is cross-promotion
for us but we layer on to that and PR, paid

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:38.549
advertising channels, as well as work to start
word-of-mouth campaigns.

00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:45.250
We love talking to game writers and tech writers
as well as Android-specific bloggers.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:50.790
&gt;&gt;&gt; We have a lot of fun with the creative.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:55.630
We take our iconic characters, we put them
in simple backgrounds and then create a bunch

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:58.619
of versions of those and then we AB test that
creative.

00:48:58.619 --> 00:49:04.190
So as an example with Top Dragon Park, we
took our little baby dragon Nixon and we tried

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:08.499
him in different colors and found people loved
blue the best so we made blue the icon in

00:49:08.499 --> 00:49:09.930
a lot of our ad-creating.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.779
&gt;&gt;&gt; So in Tap Zoo and Tap Dragon Park over
the last couple months, we've had a number

00:49:13.779 --> 00:49:18.391
of different special promotions and specialized
requests that have allowed our users to get

00:49:18.391 --> 00:49:23.220
creative.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:27.359
&gt;&gt;&gt; We look to get the word out about our
games right before they launch, so this can

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:32.769
either be pure mouth of friends telling friends
or it can be in the games telling people about

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:33.769
new games we've launched.

00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:36.859
&gt;&gt;&gt; When we're about to launch an app, we
create a number of different assets, including

00:49:36.859 --> 00:49:42.480
app icons, feature graphics, future graphics,
promotional graphics, viral videos and descriptive

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:46.959
screen shots that allow users who have not
download the game yet to understand what it's

00:49:46.959 --> 00:49:50.989
like to actually play the game.

00:49:50.989 --> 00:49:56.440
[ Video concludes ]
&gt;&gt;Patrick Mork: Cool, that's about advertising.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:02.160
The last thing I really wanted to talk about,
the last P of the four Ps, is, of course,

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.000
distribution.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.479
So you guys may remember I said at the beginning
of the presentation that I was a Pepsi guy,

00:50:08.479 --> 00:50:12.450
that I had blue blood that flows throughout
my veins.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:16.949
And I was one of these freaks that would not
drink a vodka Coke because it had Coke in

00:50:16.949 --> 00:50:21.290
it so I'd just drink the vodka.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:25.449
So it does pain me to say this but why is
Coke still it?

00:50:25.449 --> 00:50:27.449
Why does Coke still beat Pepsi?

00:50:27.449 --> 00:50:28.619
Distribution.

00:50:28.619 --> 00:50:33.559
It's not necessarily they have a stronger
brand.

00:50:33.559 --> 00:50:37.249
It's certainly not that they have better advertising.

00:50:37.249 --> 00:50:43.440
Coke today is available in more countries
of the world freely and accessibly than bottled

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.160
drinkable water.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.819
That sounds like a joke.

00:50:48.819 --> 00:50:52.989
It is very true.

00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:57.680
The thing that built Coke distribution muscle,
and some of these pictures prove it.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.190
You can find Coke anywhere.

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:02.990
I have found Coke the most outrageous places
possible and, of course, it pissed me off

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:06.749
because I wanted Pepsi.

00:51:06.749 --> 00:51:12.219
The same kind of thing needs to influence
your decision when you think about distribution.

00:51:12.219 --> 00:51:17.690
Your distribution does not end when you go
live on the play store.

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:22.809
Maybe it does on iOS but not on the play store.

00:51:22.809 --> 00:51:28.420
Our goal is virality and virality means reach.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:32.059
So how do we tackle distribution, is that
developers, all the first stuff, of course,

00:51:32.059 --> 00:51:37.410
is device coverage, we look at all those devices,
we look at the market, we anticipate the new

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:41.530
devices coming out on the market, and we think
to ourselves, what devices do I need to be

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:45.450
on, what are the legacy devices that still
have a lot of attraction, what are the new

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:49.329
devices that are still hot that I need my
game to be on?

00:51:49.329 --> 00:51:53.989
The more devices that we're on, the more people
are going to talk about our great products

00:51:53.989 --> 00:51:57.130
and it's going to go viral and I'm not going
to have to worry if the user has the phone

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:00.180
or not because I have the app for it.

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.999
The second step is channel coverage.

00:52:02.999 --> 00:52:06.559
Of course we're thrilled you guys use Google
Play and we think Google Play is going to

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:10.000
be your main distribution channel for a long
time to come.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.140
But that doesn't mean it's the only distribution
channel.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:20.170
And the fifth tip of the day is distribute
your application on as many distribution channels

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:23.380
as makes commercial sense for you.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:25.770
Wherever that might be.

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:31.349
If you go, for example, to WIP connector.org
which is a site run by the wireless industry

00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:35.979
partnership which is a nonprofit geared toward
helping developers there's a whole section

00:52:35.979 --> 00:52:42.459
on that site that talks about app stores and
app distribution channels cross all the OSs,

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:43.719
not just Android.

00:52:43.719 --> 00:52:47.559
So in that respect, do yourselves a favor
and distribute on as many channels as makes

00:52:47.559 --> 00:52:48.660
sense for you.

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:53.550
Whether that's carrier portals or carrier
freeloads or third-party app stores, if it

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:59.269
makes sense and you can reach more people
and you can get more viral, go for it.

00:52:59.269 --> 00:53:04.910
The third step, of course, is in line with
our thinking about virality and that's OS

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:06.190
coverage.

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:09.650
And consumers have a great experience on an
Android app, but if they have a lot of friends

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:15.380
who, God forbid, have iPhones, well, why should
those people not be able to get your app as

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.380
well.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.539
It all helps you go viral, right?

00:53:18.539 --> 00:53:23.849
So have your app available, again, on as many
OSs as is commercially viable, as makes business

00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:26.170
sense for you because it's going to drive
your virality.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:30.089
When we look back at the case of e-buddy,
these guys were available on every single

00:53:30.089 --> 00:53:33.549
platform known to man, including, for example,
Mobile web.

00:53:33.549 --> 00:53:39.039
And lastly, of course, analyze, optimize,
prioritize constantly.

00:53:39.039 --> 00:53:43.500
Look at your distribution channels, look at
your downloads by installed devices, look

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:48.420
at your downloads by channel and then reprioritize
every quarter, look at the data, analyze.

00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:50.110
Rinse, repeat, and start over.

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:55.269
Lastly, of course, you're always going to
need a little bit of luck.

00:53:55.269 --> 00:54:00.799
Cross your toes, cross your fingers, hope
it all works.

00:54:00.799 --> 00:54:03.420
So we've been through a lot of stuff today.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.479
People are probably tired.

00:54:04.479 --> 00:54:06.640
People are probably thirsty.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:10.519
We have a really cool fireside chat coming
up which I hope you guys will stay for.

00:54:10.519 --> 00:54:13.519
The other thing I wanted to point out is there's
going to be a great session on day three,

00:54:13.519 --> 00:54:16.940
11:30 a.m, about measurement, it's going to
go into a lot of detail, helping you guys

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:20.269
analyze how your performance of your campaigns
are going.

00:54:20.269 --> 00:54:21.970
Today we've covered a lot of stuff.

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:24.239
We've talked about our product.

00:54:24.239 --> 00:54:26.530
We've talked about our business models.

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.680
We've talked about our promotions and how
we advertise and promote our apps, the kind

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.269
of assets we've built.

00:54:31.269 --> 00:54:33.539
We've talked about distribution.

00:54:33.539 --> 00:54:34.979
All the different ways that we can go viral.

00:54:34.979 --> 00:54:37.989
And, of course, we have our great checklist.

00:54:37.989 --> 00:54:42.930
So we really have a lot of stuff for you guys
to sink your teeth into.

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:49.309
But before we go, a little gift for you guys,
it's a detail on the grand scheme of things

00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:51.619
that you're getting.

00:54:51.619 --> 00:54:55.900
So we really want you guys to build great
stuff.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:03.319
We really want you to play and work hard and
when you work hard we want you to play even

00:55:03.319 --> 00:55:04.319
harder.

00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:07.689
So we have a couple of tee shirts.

00:55:07.689 --> 00:55:09.749
These tee shirts are pretty special to us.

00:55:09.749 --> 00:55:10.880
Simple reason.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.700
These tee shirts were created, there were
only a couple hundred created, and they were

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.519
only created for members of the Google Play
team when we launched Google Play as a brand.

00:55:17.519 --> 00:55:20.779
That's part of the big celebration we did
three months ago.

00:55:20.779 --> 00:55:26.420
These are pretty much the last five that are
left that have not been given out to consumers.

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:30.249
So I'm going to ask you a couple of questions
to see how much of this stuff you absorbed.

00:55:30.249 --> 00:55:35.000
See how fired up we are about marketing.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.459
Are we going to do research and know our users?

00:55:38.459 --> 00:55:39.459
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:55:39.459 --> 00:55:41.049
&gt;&gt;PATRICK MORK: What?

00:55:41.049 --> 00:55:42.049
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:44.289
&gt;&gt;PATRICK MORK: All right.

00:55:44.289 --> 00:55:47.919
Are we going to develop some really magical
kick-ass Android apps?

00:55:47.919 --> 00:55:48.919
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:55:48.919 --> 00:55:49.919
&gt;&gt;PATRICK MORK: What?

00:55:49.919 --> 00:55:50.919
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:55:50.919 --> 00:55:52.989
&gt;&gt;PATRICK MORK: All right, that's better.

00:55:52.989 --> 00:55:58.400
And lastly, are we going to build som awesome
bad-ass marketing plans to connect those users

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.650
with our magical properties?

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:00.650
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:01.650
&gt;&gt;Patrick Mork: What?

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:02.650
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:03.650
&gt;&gt;Patrick Mork: What?

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:04.650
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:05.650
&gt;&gt;Patrick Mork: All right.

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:06.650
Thank you very much.

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:07.359
Have a great time at I/O.
