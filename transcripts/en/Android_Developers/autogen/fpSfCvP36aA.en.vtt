application well for this you would use
 

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.570
application well for this you would use
themes so for example here we're setting

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:47.580
themes so for example here we're setting
 

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.210

definitely not a scalable solution

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720
definitely not a scalable solution
 

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.110
definitely not a scalable solution
because you will have a lot of languages

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120
because you will have a lot of languages
 

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.640
because you will have a lot of languages
to support and it's pretty hard to

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:56.650
to support and it's pretty hard to
 

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.190

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.790
we added custom fallback builder to the
typeface class it enables you to create

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800
typeface class it enables you to create

language use case here we create a

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.070
language use case here we create a
 

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.910
language use case here we create a
builder and for each of the languages we

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920
builder and for each of the languages we
 

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.070
builder and for each of the languages we
create a font family and add the related

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:34.080
create a font family and add the related
 

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.340
create a font family and add the related
forms into them and this will also show

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:37.350
forms into them and this will also show
 

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.310

working with edit text you actually
 

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.510
working with edit text you actually
interact with three different processes

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520
interact with three different processes
 

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.500
interact with three different processes
the first one is your application the

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:57.510
the first one is your application the
 

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.170
the first one is your application the
next one is the soft keyboard named

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:00.180
next one is the soft keyboard named
 

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.350
next one is the soft keyboard named
input method service and then the third

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360
input method service and then the third
 

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.510
input method service and then the third
one is the system process that

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520
one is the system process that
 

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.420
one is the system process that
orchestrates loves to and because this

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:08.430
orchestrates loves to and because this
 

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.180
orchestrates loves to and because this
is an inter process communication you

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:11.190
is an inter process communication you
 

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.310
is an inter process communication you
might see in some cases a slight delay

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320
might see in some cases a slight delay
 

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.740
might see in some cases a slight delay
between key events entered in the UI and

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:15.750
between key events entered in the UI and
 

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.850
between key events entered in the UI and
then showing up in the app so visually

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:19.860
then showing up in the app so visually
 

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.670
then showing up in the app so visually
any text has the following components

selection handles the background cursor
 

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.420
selection handles the background cursor
and handles the colors for these are

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:35.430
and handles the colors for these are
 

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.730
and handles the colors for these are
updated when you set the color secondary

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:37.740
updated when you set the color secondary
 

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.160
updated when you set the color secondary
in your application theme they're

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:40.170
in your application theme they're
 

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.320
in your application theme they're
actually just drawables that use color

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:42.330
actually just drawables that use color
 

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.480

be updated using related attributes but
 

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.590
be updated using related attributes but
probably the one you want to set the

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600
probably the one you want to set the
 

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.280
probably the one you want to set the
most is edit text background finally

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:04.290

the color of the other three apart from
 

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.110
the color of the other three apart from
these attributes just like text view

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120
these attributes just like text view
 

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.300
these attributes just like text view
edit text has its own default style

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:17.310
edit text has its own default style
 

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.790
edit text has its own default style
which is the edit text file attributes

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:19.800
which is the edit text file attributes
 

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.070
which is the edit text file attributes
and this can report it to your own

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080
and this can report it to your own
 

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.130
and this can report it to your own
custom style so use this attribute to

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140
custom style so use this attribute to
 

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.990
custom style so use this attribute to
change any edit text view attributes

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000
change any edit text view attributes
 

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:37.970
change any edit text view attributes
such as text size or text file

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:37.980
 
 

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.090
 
as you all know edittext has support for

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:42.100
as you all know edittext has support for
 

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.749
as you all know edittext has support for
compound troubles and sometimes we see

00:26:45.749 --> 00:26:45.759
compound troubles and sometimes we see
 

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:47.970
compound troubles and sometimes we see
those compound robos are being used as

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:47.980
those compound robos are being used as
 

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.070
those compound robos are being used as
action buttons on the edit text such as

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080
action buttons on the edit text such as
 

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.700
action buttons on the edit text such as
a clear action however using the robos

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:53.710
a clear action however using the robos
 

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.649
a clear action however using the robos
as buttons comes with a lot of

00:26:55.649 --> 00:26:55.659
as buttons comes with a lot of
 

00:26:55.659 --> 00:26:57.720
as buttons comes with a lot of
constraints and it definitely negatively

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:57.730
constraints and it definitely negatively
 

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.409
constraints and it definitely negatively
impacts the final user experience things

00:27:01.409 --> 00:27:01.419
impacts the final user experience things
 

00:27:01.419 --> 00:27:05.100
impacts the final user experience things
like when you add an action button you

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.110
like when you add an action button you
 

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.259
like when you add an action button you
will probably want to show the ripples

00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:07.269
will probably want to show the ripples
 

00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:09.480
will probably want to show the ripples
on touch maybe animate the icons have

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:09.490
on touch maybe animate the icons have
 

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.850
on touch maybe animate the icons have
more than one icon on each side and then

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:11.860
more than one icon on each side and then
 

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.259
more than one icon on each side and then
you will also have the accessibility

00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:13.269
you will also have the accessibility
 

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:15.840
you will also have the accessibility
requirements all of these features are

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:15.850
requirements all of these features are
 

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.879
requirements all of these features are
already supported by the existing Riven

00:27:17.879 --> 00:27:17.889
already supported by the existing Riven
 

00:27:17.889 --> 00:27:19.680

layout system and therefore we would

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:19.690
layout system and therefore we would
 

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.430
layout system and therefore we would
suggest to use them instead

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440
suggest to use them instead
 

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.379
suggest to use them instead
apart from being convenient at first I

00:27:25.379 --> 00:27:25.389
apart from being convenient at first I
 

00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:27.659
apart from being convenient at first I
believe that there might be two reasons

00:27:27.659 --> 00:27:27.669
believe that there might be two reasons
 

00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:30.239
believe that there might be two reasons
why people would like to choose to go

00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:30.249
why people would like to choose to go
 

00:27:30.249 --> 00:27:32.609
why people would like to choose to go
that way and use it the robust one of

00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:32.619
that way and use it the robust one of
 

00:27:32.619 --> 00:27:35.310
that way and use it the robust one of
them is having the same edit text look

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.320
them is having the same edit text look
 

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.830
them is having the same edit text look
and feel over the whole group and the

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840
and feel over the whole group and the
 

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.230

other one is being able to contract and
 

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.810
other one is being able to contract and
expand the editable area based on the

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:42.820
expand the editable area based on the
 

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.350
expand the editable area based on the
visibility of the button you should

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360
visibility of the button you should
 

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.149
visibility of the button you should
definitely use text input layout and

00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159
definitely use text input layout and
 

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:49.889
definitely use text input layout and
that will cover a lot of use cases

00:27:49.889 --> 00:27:49.899
that will cover a lot of use cases
 

00:27:49.899 --> 00:27:52.499
that will cover a lot of use cases
however if you have application specific

00:27:52.499 --> 00:27:52.509
however if you have application specific
 

00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:54.299
however if you have application specific

requirements that are not supported by
text input there you should create your

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:56.470
text input there you should create your
 

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.999
text input there you should create your
own view group and layout and in order

00:27:59.999 --> 00:28:00.009
own view group and layout and in order
 

00:28:00.009 --> 00:28:02.159
own view group and layout and in order
to address the issue of having the same

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:02.169
to address the issue of having the same
 

00:28:02.169 --> 00:28:04.230
to address the issue of having the same
look and feel you can set the edit text

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240
look and feel you can set the edit text
 

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.619
look and feel you can set the edit text
background to now and use the exact same

00:28:06.619 --> 00:28:06.629
background to now and use the exact same
 

00:28:06.629 --> 00:28:08.909
background to now and use the exact same
background that is already in the system

00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919

for the view group the only thing we

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:11.230
for the view group the only thing we
 

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.710
for the view group the only thing we
have to do is in order to respond to the
