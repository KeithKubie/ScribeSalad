00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Prof Frenkel] Can I ask you a question Brady?

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.300
[Prof Frenkel] What is the most difficult way to earn a million dollars?

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.800
[Brady] Making Youtube videos.
[Prof Frenkel] *laughs*

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.560
[Prof Frenkel] Well, you probably know much more about that than I do.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.680
[Prof Frenkel] One of the most difficult ones is to solve one of the Millenium Problems in Mathematics,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.620
which were set by the Clay Mathematical Institute in the year 2000.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.800
One of these problems is called "The Riemann Hypothesis".

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.260
It refers to a work of a german mathematician, Bernard Riemann,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.560
which he did in the year 1859.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.280
This is just one of the problems.
In fact, there are seven.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.820
And one of them has been solved so far.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.780
And interestingly enough, the person who solved the problem has declined the one million dollars.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.520
So...

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.660
It just shows that mathematicians work on these problems, not because they want to make some money.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.780
I think it is now the most famous problem in mathematics.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.480
It took the place of Fermat's Last Theorem,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.820
which was solved by Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor in the mid-1990s.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.940
[Brady] But that wasn't a Millenium Problem.
[Prof Frenkel] That was not a Millenium Problem.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.380
[Prof Frenkel] The most essential thing here is what we call the Riemann Zeta function.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.140
And the Riemann Zeta function is a function, so ...

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.260
A function is a rule which assigns to every value some other number.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.580
And the Riemann Zeta function assigns a certain number to any value of s,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.900
and that number is given by the following series:

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.220
1 divided by 1 to the power of s,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.020
plus 1 divided by 2 to the power of s,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.860
plus 1 divided by 3 to the power of s,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.440
4 to the s, and so on.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.080
So, for example, if we set x = 2.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.200
Zeta(2) is going to be 1 divided by 1 squared plus

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.080
1 divided by 2 squared,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.000
plus 1 divided by 3 squared,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.220
plus 1 divided by 4 squared,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.460
and so on.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.720
So, what is this?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.120
This is one.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.840
This is 1 over 4.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.440
This is 1 over 9.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.800
1 over 16...

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.380
So this is an example of what mathematicians call a convergent series,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.800
which means that, if you sum up the first n terms,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.620
you will get an answer
which will get closer and closer to some number.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.400
And that number to which it approximates
is called the limit.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.940
But the limit here is actually very interesting.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.420
And it has been a famous problem in mathematics to find that limit.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.280
It is called the Basel problem,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.000
named after the city of Basel in Switzerland.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.280
And this Basel problem was solved by a great mathematician: Leonhard Euler.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.860
And the answer is very surprising.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.400
What Euler showed is that this sums up to pi squared over 6.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.940
So you may be wondering.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.040
What does this sum has to do with a circle?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.240
Why would pi squared show up?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
But Euler came up with a beautiful proof.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.560
I'm not going to explain it now, but it's something that you can easily find online.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.980
This series is just one example of this Riemann Zeta function,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.780
but you can try to do the same for any other value of s.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.440
So, for example, if you take s=3, you will get the reciprocals of all the cubes,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.160
and you sum them up, and so on.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.820
So this will, again, be a convergent series, and you can wonder what that answer is.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.080
That would be zeta(3).

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.980
You can also try to substitute negative numbers.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.740
And this is very interesting, because if you substitute... if you just substitute —

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.040
If s = -1, then what are we going to get?

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.920
So you will get 1 divided by...

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.380
1 to the 1 to the -1,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.360
plus 1 to the 2 to the -1,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.840
plus 1 over 3 to the -1...

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.860
If you take the reciprocal of something,
which is the inverse of something,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.380
then you will get that thing.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.080
So this will be 1,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.600
this will be 2,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.320
this will be 3,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.620
this will be 4...

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.460
[Prof Frenkel] Does it look familiar?
[Brady] Yes, I have seen that before.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.660
[Prof Frenkel] We have arrived at the famous sum of all natural numbers:

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.240
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ...

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.800
But, you see, now we obtained in the context of the zeta function.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.020
So this is what we call a divergent series.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.640
There is no obvious way how we could possibly assign a finite value to it.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.240
This sum is infinite, it does not converge to any finite value.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.560
But, this context...

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.920
If we put this value, this infinite sum, in the context of this function,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.440
there is actually a way to assign a value to s=-1.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.140
And this is what Riemann explained in his paper.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.720
And so what Riemann said is that, actually, we should allow s to be, not just a natural number

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.120
— for example, 2, or 3, or 4, when the series is convergent —

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.080
but we should allow also all possible real numbers.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.320
And not only real numbers, but also complex numbers.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.300
The way you get complex numbers is by realizing that, within real numbers,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.100
you cannot find the square root of -1.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.900
Then what to do?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.700
One way is to ban the square root of -1 and say,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.140
"This doesn't exist, we cannot use it"

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.440
But, in mathematics, we have understood, a long time ago, that actually there is a much better way to treat this.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.800
the square root of -1.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.060
We can simply adjoin it to the real numbers.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.300
Think of real numbers as points on a line.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.040
Here is 0,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.280
and here is 1,

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.640
and here is 2,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.680
and then you can mark your favorite fractions.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.600
For example, one half is exactly in the middle way between 0 and 1.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.480
And say,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.380
1 1/3 would be a third of the way between 1 and 2.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.620
But then, you also have things like square root of 2...

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.120
For example, somewhere here.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.300
And then, there is pi, which is just to the right of 3.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.380
So all the real numbers live here.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.380
Square root of -1 cannot be found anywhere on this line.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.360
But we don't give up. We say, "You know what?"

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.840
"Let's actually draw a plane, let's draw another coordinate system"

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.140
"And let's mark square root of -1 on this new coordinate axis."

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:03.300
You see, if we do that, then every point on this plane becomes a number.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.200
So that would be 2 times square root of -1,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.620
3 times the square root of -1, ...

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.780
But more than that, let me find a number
which is on the intersection of this line.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.060
I can draw a vertical line which goes from 2

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.120
and I can go... can also draw a horizontal line.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.780
Then there's this point of intersection.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.460
So this point also would represent a number,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.160
which would be 2 plus 3 times square root of -1.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.460
So, in other words, a general number is going to have what we call a real part,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.560
that is the projection onto this axis;

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.280
and the imaginary part, that's the projection on the vertical one.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.060
The notation is a little bit clumsy.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.320
Instead of square root of -1, they write i.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:50.260
So then for example: instead of writing 2 + 3 square root of -1, we'll just write 2 plus 3i.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.700
It's an imaginary number, we imagine it.
We cannot find it on this real line.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.620
So we have imagined it, and then we have adjoined it in our imagination.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.560
Real numbers comprise all points on the real line,
on this axis;

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.820
and complex numbers comprise all the points
on this brown paper,

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.680
if you could extend the brown paper all the way
to infinity.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.300
Right?

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.520
So let's go back to Riemann.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.960
What Riemann's insight was is he said "look, let's think of this argument of the Zeta function, this number s...

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.700
Initially, we thought that s could be 2, 3, 4, and so on.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.340
But then we realised that actually any real number to the right of number 1...

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:32.260
not including number 1, because actually in this case you cannot assign a value, it's a divergent series,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.020
so it goes to infinity.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.960
But anything to the right, and then drawing and marking it with red...

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.620
For all of them, this function is actually well defined.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.160
So... But then he said '"We can actually do more... We can think of s as being a complex number."

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.520
So instead of thinking of s as just being a point on this line, we can take s anywhere.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.360
It will be convergent if it is to the right of this line.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:05.460
So you see if this is the line, which sort of to the right of this line... live all the complex numbers

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.840
whose real part is greater than 1.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.720
So, it turns out — and it's very easy to show — that anywhere in the shaded area, except for this line —

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.580
so to the right of this line.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:23.120
Now, for any value of s in this area, this function converges to something.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.800
—So if I put 6 + 9i into the Riemann Zeta function,
I'll get a convergent series...?

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.740
—That's right. You get a convergent series.
It will converge to something,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.360
which is not going to be a real number.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.180
It's goint to be a complex number, because you're
going to add up infinitely many complex numbers.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:43.180
But there will be a certain number to which — which will be a closer and closer approximated

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.620
as you go along summing up the series.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:51.360
—So far, basically everything to the right of this line...
—Gives us a bona fide value

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.880
—will come out to play.
—will come out to play, and will give us a bona fide value.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.300
—Can the imaginary part go in negative?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.140
Yeh, but the imaginary part... yes. The imaginary part is okay — can be negative or positive.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.900
But the real part has to be greater than 1.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:11.500
But, now, you are in the context of a theory of...
functions with complex arguments.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.780
And it is what we call a holomorphic function.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.100
So it has some very special, very nice properties.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.820
So one of the properties that this kind of — what we call holomorphic — functions enjoy is what we call

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:27.000
analytic continuation. So we can extend the definition, i.e. the domain of definition of the function.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.740
There are methods which allow — which enable us —
to kind of push the boundary,

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.440
and kind of... go and expand the domain
in which the function is defined.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.460
And in his seminal paper, Riemann did precisely that.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:46.000
He explained how to extend this function
to all possible values, except for one.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.220
So there's only one value
where there is nothing you can do;

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.220
and somehow it will be undefined.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.600
And this is what we call a 'pole' or a 'singularity'.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.280
And what is that value? That value is actually s = 1.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.420
So this is somehow... this is a bad point in some sense.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.640
This is a point where we cannot extend....

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.220
— And i and 0 are components? There's no imaginary components.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.200
—That's right. So this is a point which is actually a real number.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.940
So it's funny, because you would think that 1 is in some sense easier and better than i.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.620
But, at i, this function will be perfectly well defined.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.280
But at 1 it will not be well defined; it will have a singularity.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.820
But, luckily, it's the only singularity.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:30.280
So, what it means in particular, is that there is a way to assign a value to -1

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.740
In other words, there is a value Zeta of -1,

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.340
where by Zeta we now mean this extended function.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.940
A function analytically continued to the whole complex plane.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.400
And that value will be — you guessed it — -1/12.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:45.900
—Okay.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:51.640
—It is in this sense that people say that you could regularize the sum 1+2+3+4...,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:57.740
and assign to it the value -1/12. Because it shows up as the value of the zeta function where, naively,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.660
you are supposed to get 1+2+3+4...

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.500
But, now, you are getting this value
by a much more sophisticated procedure.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:11.740
By starting with a function of a complex argument,
and extending it beyond the initial domain of definition.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:17.520
—So no matter what number I pluck from here or here, or here, or here or here, and feed it into the function,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.700
I'll get a number of some sort...

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.600
—You will get a well-defined number — uniquely defined number.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.060
And you can calculate it on a computer, because this number can be represented by some integral for example.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.060
There is a explicit formula for it. Okay? So... and...

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.000
you will calculate, I will calculate — will get the same result. There is no ambiguity.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.360
The only point where it's not well defined is the point s=1.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.520
—This is like the Achilles' heel or the weak...
—It's an Achilles' heel — that's a very good way to put it.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.540
It's an Achilles' heel of that function.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.780
But it's very important; it's responsible for a lot of things that's happening to it.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.000
So it's a very important point.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.640
So Riemann's hypothesis is the following:

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.020
it's about the zeros of the zeta function.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:12:02.720
In other words, it's a question about — for what values — for which s we have zeta(s) = 0.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.840
That is the one million dollar question.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.400
For which value of s do we have — does this function equal 0.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.380
And so... Riemann...

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.480
Here there is one point that one has to make, which is that

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.400
there are some sort of obvious zeros.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.240
So it just so happens that the value at -2, for example, is equal to 0.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.200
-4 is equal to 0.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.080
So, in other words, all the even negative numbers,
for some reason — it just so happens —

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.220
and you can see it for example from the function equation easily —

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.100
that the value is going to be 0.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.720
So there's some obvious zeros so to speak, which we already know.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.320
The question is what else — where else are the zeros — where are there other zeros...?

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:58.780
And it's actually very easy to see... that all other zeros have to be concentrated in this one strip.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.700
So, on one side of this strip is the vertical line — is the vertical axis.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.820
And on the other side of this strip is this line, when real part is 1.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.480
And so, let's... So this is called the critical strip.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.900
These are all the complex numbers for which the real part is between 0 and 1.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:21.920
And so, inside this critical strip, there's a middle line, for which the real value is 1/2.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.100
And we look at all the numbers for which this is a real part.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:31.360
For example, half plus five i will be a point somewhere here..., so it will be on this line.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.060
And what Riemann suggested —

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.200
the number of zeros is the minimum possible;

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.940
they all concentrate along this critical line.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.900
According to Riemann's hypothesis, which still hasn't been proved.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:50.740
His hypothesis is that all the zeros to his function lie on that line, except for these ones.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.320
—Exactly.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.680
—All the zeros lie on that line.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.360
—On that vertical line, which goes through the point 1/2.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.380
That is exactly the statement of Riemann's hypothesis.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:06.180
—So one way to disprove the hypothesis would be to find a zero somewhere in that blue shaded area.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.400
—Exactly. We know that all of them are going to be in the blue shaded area.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.540
The question is whether they are on this one specific line

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.760
And believe me, a lot of people have been looking for a counter example.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.940
By the way, one wins a million dollars if one proves the Riemann's hypothesis, or disproves it.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:32.560
So if somebody could find a point in here — which is a 0 but is not on this line — will also win one million dollars.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.880
So, a lot of people have been searching, but haven't been able to find.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.840
—Have a lot of zeros been found on the line?
—Yes, a huge number.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.420
I don't remember, but I think trillions of numbers.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.120
So all the zeros that have been found are on this line.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.560
And there's constantly a search going on for more and more.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.140
The way I explained it, it sounds like an esoteric problem.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.280
But actually, in this case, there is more to this, that meets the eye.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:06.200
Because Riemann in that amazing paper that he wrote in 1859, he also explained that this behaviour

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.160
of his zeta function, which is now called after him — Riemann Zeta function —

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:17.940
and more specifically, the behaviour and location of the zeros of that function,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:23.380
has a direct bearing on the distribution of prime numbers.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.900
And prime numbers are incredibly important.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.220
So prime numbers are, you know, something that people have been studying for millennia, right?

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:36.440
So Riemann was able to connect the properties of this function to the distribution of prime numbers.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:43.040
And he obtained a beautiful formula, which tells you  how many prime numbers there are,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:50.440
say between 1 and 100, between 1 and 1000, 1 and 1 million,... any n — between 1 and n —

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.440
using his Zeta function.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.340
Which is absolutely astonishing because if you think about the Zeta function...

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.520
something has to do with complex numbers, and with analytic continuation, and so on so forth...

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.040
So it's a particular branch of mathematics which is called complex analysis.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:11.220
But prime numbers live in a different branch of mathematics; in number theory.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.200
And it is a big surprise that actually the two things are very closely connected.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.800
But this relation, that Riemann found, is predicated on the Riemann' hypothesis.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.260
It's predicated on knowing all the zeros are located on this critical line.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.580
That's why this Riemann hypothesis is so important.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:38.040
Because it is only if we know that Riemann's hypothesis holds that we can obtain all those deep results about

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.000
the distribution of prime numbers.
