the war in Vietnam and that kind of
transformational moment is I think I

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:31.530
transformational moment is I think I
 

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:36.410
transformational moment is I think I
hope about to happen again because I

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420
hope about to happen again because I
 

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.310
hope about to happen again because I
think we're entering some kind of

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320
think we're entering some kind of
 

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.540
think we're entering some kind of
experiences that are like the Vietnam

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:44.550
experiences that are like the Vietnam
 

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.590
experiences that are like the Vietnam

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600
War and what the civil rights movement
 

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.280
War and what the civil rights movement
was against so we're seeing I think in a

was against so we're seeing I think in a
 

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:56.420
was against so we're seeing I think in a
very visible way and obviously I don't

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:56.430
very visible way and obviously I don't
 

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.010
very visible way and obviously I don't
have time and don't have the inclination

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:58.020
have time and don't have the inclination
 

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.870
have time and don't have the inclination
at the moment to spell this out in

00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880
at the moment to spell this out in
 

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.970
at the moment to spell this out in
detail but I think we are seeing in

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:03.980
detail but I think we are seeing in
 

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.980
detail but I think we are seeing in

in attitudes and so on
the kinds of things that prompted the

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:12.960
the kinds of things that prompted the
 

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.130
the kinds of things that prompted the
resistance to this and the efforts to

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140
resistance to this and the efforts to
 

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.560
resistance to this and the efforts to
try to change the world in the 1960s and

started law school and that was really

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:16.570

out here and

which I haven't been to in 50 years I
 

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.230
which I haven't been to in 50 years I
figured that out on the way over today

there were always tables and groups of

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.110
there were always tables and groups of

in Vietnam and I would inevitably be
 

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.510
in Vietnam and I would inevitably be
drawn to that table and I wouldn't tell

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:48.520
drawn to that table and I wouldn't tell
 

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.450

often treated poorly as that so I didn't

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:56.410
often treated poorly as that so I didn't
 

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.650
often treated poorly as that so I didn't
want them to know but I would question

00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:58.660
want them to know but I would question

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:08.830
and sometimes these encounters ended up
 

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:13.260
and sometimes these encounters ended up
in nice long ish discussions and

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:13.270
in nice long ish discussions and
 

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.299
in nice long ish discussions and
sometimes they didn't but that was my

sometimes they didn't but that was my
 

00:31:15.309 --> 00:31:18.180
sometimes they didn't but that was my
first exposure and so I started to

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:18.190
first exposure and so I started to
 

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.820
first exposure and so I started to

because there was a sense that what was

because there was a sense that what was
going on was devolve into something that

going on was devolve into something that
 

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.510
going on was devolve into something that
wasn't working and somehow we see it

00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520
wasn't working and somehow we see it
 

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.770

again again from what Mike was just

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020
returning soldiers were kind of caught
 

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.690
returning soldiers were kind of caught
in the crossfire of that and one of our

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700
in the crossfire of that and one of our
 

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.460
in the crossfire of that and one of our
veterans says that coming home from

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:07.470
veterans says that coming home from
 

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:10.309
veterans says that coming home from
Vietnam was almost as traumatic as the

00:35:10.309 --> 00:35:10.319
Vietnam was almost as traumatic as the
 

00:35:10.319 --> 00:35:12.470
Vietnam was almost as traumatic as the
war itself and if you think about it

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480
war itself and if you think about it
 

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.290
war itself and if you think about it
which we have for a long time we imagine

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.300
which we have for a long time we imagine
 

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.940
which we have for a long time we imagine
those of us who haven't been in combat

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:16.950
those of us who haven't been in combat
 

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.530
those of us who haven't been in combat
that war is about the most traumatic

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540
that war is about the most traumatic
 

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.530
that war is about the most traumatic
thing can possibly imagine so the idea

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540
thing can possibly imagine so the idea
 

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.420
thing can possibly imagine so the idea
that the Welcome Home that didn't happen

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:23.430
that the Welcome Home that didn't happen
 

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.760
that the Welcome Home that didn't happen
and the way that returning soldiers felt

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:25.770
and the way that returning soldiers felt
 

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.859
and the way that returning soldiers felt
was almost as traumatic as the war is a

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:27.869
was almost as traumatic as the war is a
 

00:35:27.869 --> 00:35:30.020
was almost as traumatic as the war is a
profound thing to think about and I

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:30.030
profound thing to think about and I
 

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.120
profound thing to think about and I
think also that Mark's experience now

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:32.130
think also that Mark's experience now
 

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.540
think also that Mark's experience now
and adds another aspect to this which is

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:35.550
and adds another aspect to this which is
 

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.809
and adds another aspect to this which is
hugely important which is that in the

00:35:38.809 --> 00:35:38.819
hugely important which is that in the
 

00:35:38.819 --> 00:35:40.309
hugely important which is that in the
early days of the Vietnam War it was

00:35:40.309 --> 00:35:40.319
early days of the Vietnam War it was
 

00:35:40.319 --> 00:35:41.420
early days of the Vietnam War it was
staffed with people who were

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:41.430
staffed with people who were
 

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.450
staffed with people who were
volunteering you did see this as a cause

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:43.460
volunteering you did see this as a cause
 

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.579
volunteering you did see this as a cause
later on the draft came and I mean the

00:35:46.579 --> 00:35:46.589
later on the draft came and I mean the
 

00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:48.170
later on the draft came and I mean the
draft was always there but it was a it

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180
draft was always there but it was a it
 

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.450

became a more contentious thing one of

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460
became a more contentious thing one of
 

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.550
became a more contentious thing one of
the things we learned among many things

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560
the things we learned among many things
 

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.609
the things we learned among many things
not to blame the the veterans is that we

00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619
not to blame the the veterans is that we
 

00:35:55.619 --> 00:35:58.099
not to blame the the veterans is that we
created an all-volunteer army and what

00:35:58.099 --> 00:35:58.109
created an all-volunteer army and what
 

00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:59.630
created an all-volunteer army and what
that does is it takes the American

00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640
that does is it takes the American
 

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.170
that does is it takes the American
public skin out of this game and and

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180
public skin out of this game and and
 

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.870
public skin out of this game and and
that's an unfortunate thing and we can

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880
that's an unfortunate thing and we can
 

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.819
that's an unfortunate thing and we can
talk about a draft or national service

00:36:07.819 --> 00:36:07.829
talk about a draft or national service
 

00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:09.410
talk about a draft or national service
and I think these are really important

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420
and I think these are really important
 

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.690
and I think these are really important
things but we have to really understand

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700
things but we have to really understand
 

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.589
things but we have to really understand
that we now have a military community 1%

00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599
that we now have a military community 1%
 

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:17.630
that we now have a military community 1%
of the population that suffers its

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640
of the population that suffers its
 

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.300
of the population that suffers its
losses apart and alone from the rest of

losses apart and alone from the rest of
 

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.900
losses apart and alone from the rest of
us and therefore there is no exertion of

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:23.910
us and therefore there is no exertion of
 

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:27.050
us and therefore there is no exertion of

polity against continuing on with the

polity against continuing on with the
 

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.000
polity against continuing on with the
war and that permits this intolerable

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.010
war and that permits this intolerable
 

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.339
war and that permits this intolerable
unconscionable war crime of having

00:36:37.339 --> 00:36:37.349
unconscionable war crime of having
 

00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:39.550
unconscionable war crime of having
people go through seven or eight or nine

people go through seven or eight or nine

world war and you're in for the duration
 

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.040
world war and you're in for the duration
I get that but when you have a kind of

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:46.050
I get that but when you have a kind of
 

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.109
I get that but when you have a kind of
perpetual war because you can have a

perpetual war because you can have a

rectified one aspect and created perhaps

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280
rectified one aspect and created perhaps
 

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.880
rectified one aspect and created perhaps
an even bigger problem I think is

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:55.890
an even bigger problem I think is
 

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:56.990
an even bigger problem I think is
something that we ought to be addressing

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000
something that we ought to be addressing
 

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.100
something that we ought to be addressing

I was and helping them it's this it's
 

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.950
I was and helping them it's this it's
not rocket science it's not a new

00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960
not rocket science it's not a new
 

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.130
not rocket science it's not a new
technique it's probably as old as as the

technique it's probably as old as as the
 

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:22.770
technique it's probably as old as as the
human race and warfare but it really

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:22.780
human race and warfare but it really
 

00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.650
human race and warfare but it really
helped me to reach out I think the army

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:25.660
helped me to reach out I think the army
 

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.990
helped me to reach out I think the army
does and the other military branches do

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000
does and the other military branches do
 

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.290
does and the other military branches do
much better job at treating that's with

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:31.300
much better job at treating that's with
 

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:36.420
much better job at treating that's with

some some bets suffer more than others
 

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:48.810
some some bets suffer more than others
so that's my thought on that I think

00:59:48.810 --> 00:59:48.820
so that's my thought on that I think
 

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:52.590
so that's my thought on that I think
what the the line that really strikes me

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:52.600
what the the line that really strikes me
 

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.650
what the the line that really strikes me
from that clip is that everyone came

00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:55.660
from that clip is that everyone came
 

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:58.680
from that clip is that everyone came
home alone yeah in a sense right there's

00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:58.690
home alone yeah in a sense right there's
 

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:01.770
home alone yeah in a sense right there's
no finality to it I mean there ended up

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:01.780
no finality to it I mean there ended up
 

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.320
no finality to it I mean there ended up
being a very dramatic end to the Vietnam
