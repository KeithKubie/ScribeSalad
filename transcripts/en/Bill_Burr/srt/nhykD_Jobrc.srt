1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,050
B. Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,880
What's going on to,
Oh

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,850
yeah,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,330
it's Bill Burr. It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,860
August 29th, 2080 oh, happy baseball
champion. Pappy baseball championship.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,720
Why am I in such a good mood?

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,160
Why do I want to walk down the street
with a fucking bass drum kicking my

8
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,630
fucking feet up in the air?

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,800
Because your 2018 Boston Red Sox,

10
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:35,920
once again are world series champions.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,870
Do you believe it?

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,260
Yeah.

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,420
I think I speak for all the New England.
When I say fucking okay.

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,770
Unbelievable.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,200
Unbelievable.
I remember after 2003 thinking,

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,850
all I want to do is just see these
fucking assholes. Just one fucking time.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,690
Have a clutch fucking
moment in your fucking life.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,660
You Red Sox were in con
stats where I was at.

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,803
All right,

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,570
and the very next year they went in and
I was like, you know what? That's it. I,

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,870
you know,
I'm in such a good mood.

22
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,570
I don't give a fuck that my phone
is making noise in the background.

23
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:15,770
That's what's all,
what a great mood on mint.

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,570
All I wanted to see was
just some win at once.

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,500
Now only to get to see them when
it wants now, twice, three times,

26
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:25,690
four times the one buying the patriots.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,470
So all you haters out there, just in
case you lost count in this century,

28
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:36,471
we won five super bowls for world series
titles and Nba Championship and his

29
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:41,710
Stanley Cup and one of those soccer
championships, mls, whatever, they,

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,400
but when did championships and stuff,
I don't even give a fuck about.

31
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,693
All right.

32
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,600
And for all you guys are doing,
does it get old after a while?

33
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,120
Don't you get tired of it?

34
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,063
No.

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,980
Fucking awesome.
It's fucking awesome.

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,553
You know?

37
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,440
And you know,
if it doesn't happen to us,

38
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,250
I hope it happens to you someday
unless you're in fucking New York or in

39
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:08,630
Montreal or a Laker Fan. Other than that,
I, I got no fucking problem with anybody.

40
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,230
Um, unbelievable. Uh,

41
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,680
I didn't know what to say.
You know, what's this? I know.

42
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,340
We don't know if Jackie
Bradley Jr or JD Martinez,

43
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,430
one of them said after game three that I
was at, can't believe I was at the game.

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,863
MMM.

45
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,710
He said,
I've never seen a take a team get,

46
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,300
just get punched in the face and then
just get up. Like nothing happened.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,790
Like this team, something like
that. I know I'm butchering it,

48
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,530
but it was just perfect.

49
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:40,930
MMM.

50
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,990
They will just never out of it.
I have not seen a team score.

51
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:48,991
This many fucking runs with two outs be
down this much since the 1998 New York

52
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:53,640
Yankees, which is probably
the best team I've ever seen.

53
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,293
MMM.

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,620
The only other team in my lifetime,
and I vaguely remember them,

55
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:04,150
was maybe the big red machine.
Um, I mean, that team,

56
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,590
that team was fucking incredible. That
was just another team that was just like,

57
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,610
they would just stack. All right.
You know what I'm going to, I'm not,

58
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,290
I'm lying a little bit that,
that phone thing is gonna bug me here

59
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,550
if this continues to
happen here. All right. Uh,

60
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,470
oh fuck.
Am I supposed to talk about that shit too?

61
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,650
Um, anyways, um, congratulations
to the Dodgers, man. Jesus Christ.

62
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,600
See another great season.
You just came up short.

63
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,940
All I can tell you
having been through that.

64
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,163
MMM,

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,990
yeah. No, it just makes it all the more
sweeter when you finally went it. But uh,

66
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,650
you know, so we went to game three.
What a fucking great stadium by the way.

67
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,430
And not only is a great stating that
the Dodgers have like the stadium just

68
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:51,630
considering when it was built and
there was so many of those soldiers,

69
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,770
cookie cutter,
um,

70
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,050
baseball stadiums that they made.
They were multipurpose.

71
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:01,110
Basically all of them were asked to
design so he could play football and

72
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:02,130
baseball back there.

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,210
A very like forward thinking,

74
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,860
money saving environmentally
friendly thing that we did.

75
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,780
And then we all decided like, you know
what? Fuck these stadiums. They're old.

76
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,740
Why fix them up? I don't understand
why you just can't fix him up.

77
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,520
They're made out of metal and concrete.
They're not going anywhere.

78
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,850
That's like any,
any fucking car you have.

79
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:31,470
The fucking engine block is made out of
steel. As long as you take care of it.

80
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,160
It's gonna. It's gonna run forever.
Everybody just throws shit out.

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,850
So they knocked down all of these fucking
stadiums and then rebuild. Not One,

82
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:42,030
but two more stadiums.
We will,

83
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,030
I want my own stadium.

84
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,640
Yeah.

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,310
I don't want to share
it. Although, you know,

86
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:52,900
I did boomer Esiason show
boomer in and was it Gino?

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,000
And uh,

88
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,300
he was talking about what
it was like to play for

89
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,780
the Cincinnati Cincinnati Bengals
in the same in riverfront stadium.

90
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,640
He said down these to cover a home
plate with a piece of wood and then just

91
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,480
through astro turf on top of it.
So if you get tackled on it,

92
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,570
basically it's like you
laid it on somebody's tree
fort. So I guess, you know,

93
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,130
maybe that's a reason,

94
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:18,830
but I was what I thought they could've
come up with some sort of technology

95
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:19,760
where they didn't have to fuck it.

96
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:24,200
That was just basically cause it
was astro turf. Right. I don't know.

97
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,250
I don't pretend to understand,
but um, me and my buddies,

98
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:32,120
we went to game three and,
uh, I didn't wear any red sox.

99
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:36,020
Shit's still almost got into
a fight fucking west coast.

100
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,090
Stele almost got into a fight.
Unfucking believable. You know,

101
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,570
there was like what killed me was we
went to the game and there was so many

102
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:49,280
empty seats because stub hub just
gouged the shit out of every,

103
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:52,430
they were charging like 700 bucks.
I was at the top of the stadium.

104
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,700
Those tickets were over $700.
And you know,

105
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,790
I guess stubhub was can to
be like, well, you know,

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,450
we'll make it four times the fucking
face value of the ticket. What, what,

107
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,750
what do we give a shit if every,
you know,

108
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,560
three out of every four seats is empty
almost, you know, it wasn't that bad,

109
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:14,270
but they were big giant swaths of
fucking rows that were, were just,

110
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,250
nobody was there, um, from the
bottom all the way up to the top.

111
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,760
And you know, people got flat screen
TVs, they don't need that shit.

112
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,560
They would come home,
they'll see the fucking replay,

113
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,250
they'll know the pitch count, they'll,
you know, all that shit rather than,

114
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,320
than being like me trying to figure out
the scoreboard with my fucked up eyes at

115
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:35,300
this point. Um, so anyways, my buddy,

116
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,160
you know, he was having a few
beers and when he was finishing,

117
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,890
we just setting them up in the row behind.
He said it was like basically empty.

118
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,660
So there was a guy behind there and you
know, all you had to say was, hey guys,

119
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,180
do you mind just keeping your empties
on your, in your row? Just cause uh,

120
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:51,030
you know, me and the kid, my wife and
the kid won't try to get by here and wow,

121
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,710
sorry, I do it. No problem. That's how
would have gone down. But instead is,

122
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:57,980
he's a west coast guy, you know, they're
still fucking laid back out here.

123
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,280
He immediately just says to my buddy,
this is how we entered the conversation.

124
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:03,440
He goes, he's like, hey buddy,

125
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,870
is there something wrong with the
underneath your chair? I went,

126
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,820
Fred turns around, looks at him immediate
with that look on his face. Like, wow,

127
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,110
I'm about ready to get into a
fight. And he's like, what? He goes,

128
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:17,810
there's something wrong
with the underneath party
of chair. And he's like, no.

129
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,740
He goes, why don't you put, she
empties there? And he goes, oh,

130
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,590
there was nobody sit there.

131
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:26,591
And then it fucking in like literally
like fucking flash paper escalates to this

132
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:32,660
level. So I'm sitting there, so I just go,
you know, I've been out here long enough.

133
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,670
I'm a veteran.
Like I know this is going to happen.

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,550
Like you could literally go to the game
fucking eh dressed like Jesus or Santa

135
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,550
Claus, whatever the fuck you're into.
And still somebody is going to be like,

136
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:46,250
you know, a fuck it, Eh, a Whitey.

137
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,040
You think you cannot have your fucking
beard blowing over your shoulder block

138
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,970
and half the fucking feel like
something's going to happen.

139
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,130
A Santa why she sued red? What are
you a fucking cardinals fan? You know,

140
00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:59,060
and all of a sudden you're into it.

141
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,600
So I just turned around and looked at
both of them. I just go, ladies, ladies,

142
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,620
ladies. Which usually diffuses it.
Somebody saying, ladies, all right,

143
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,850
then you realize I go, alright, I'm acting
like I got a fucking Tampon on, right?

144
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,930
I go, we're at the world series game for
how? Come on, let's have a good time,

145
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:18,380
right? So I got to shake the guy's hand
behind me and he leaves me hanging.

146
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,730
So now I'm fucking mad. I
don't say anything to the
guy. And then I just, he goes,

147
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,920
get just fucking sit us.

148
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,921
We sit down and then I fought for fucking
hitting and loudly talking about what

149
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,770
the level of fucking asshole fans,

150
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,820
fucking asshole fans that are out
here on the fucking west coast.

151
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,600
It's just like they go to the game
to get into a fight. It's just like,

152
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,620
so after eating half of
that, I'm like, dude,

153
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,500
do you really want to keep doing this?
And it's like, no, I don't. So I get up,

154
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:51,740
I go down and get a beer and I'm coming
back and I'm on some walking up the

155
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,220
aisle. This fucking guy is sitting
mean mugging me. Now this guy,

156
00:08:56,221 --> 00:09:00,390
he's gotta be like fucking 50 pounds
over fucking weight. This four of us,

157
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:02,760
there's one of him not granted,
he's in the row behind us.

158
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,870
I guess maybe he could fall on
us and do some fucking damage,

159
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,920
but if we wanted to, we all probably could
have picked him up and thrown him up.

160
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,330
We were the second to last row,

161
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,120
literally just thrown him off the back
of the fucking stadium. All right.

162
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,110
And when you're dealing with people
from Boston, that is, uh, that is, uh,

163
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,650
there's a chance that there's that
level of fucking anger involved.

164
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,110
It wasn't us, but I'm just saying,
and this guy could give a fuck.

165
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,250
So he's fucking

166
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,250
Deron at me.
As I'm walking up,

167
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,360
he's with his wife and kid and
he's fucking staring at us like,

168
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,150
like fucking William Wallace staring
at me, I should say is I'm coming up,

169
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:43,940
so I'm lily, my eyes are fucking
bad at this point. So I'm like,

170
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,340
is this guy staring at me?
So when you're fucking old,

171
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,180
you got to eat this squint or you kind
of look away and then look at bet,

172
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,800
look back at something. So I had to
look away to focus on something else.

173
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,950
And then I looked back at him. I'm
like, yeah, he is staring at me.

174
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,010
And I just looked away. So he probably
thought that was a moment of weakness.

175
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,430
So now he's probably air. It is. He's
going extra hard with his face now

176
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,010
when it got, so it just got up there
and I don't know what happened.

177
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,430
All of the anger, all this shit, it
just went away. I was just like, buddy,

178
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:13,250
we really gonna do this man. Come on.
I respect the Dodgers ever respect you.

179
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:15,860
We were trying to, I apologize for
that stuff. So I've got a facility,

180
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:20,510
I see his face finally relaxed. I go to
fist bump. The Guy, he's so fucking macho,

181
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,360
he can't even like stick his
hand and he makes the fist,

182
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,150
but he has his hands still near his body.

183
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,810
It's like my daughter when I went to my
first bike was like teaching her how to

184
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,720
wave and she wouldn't like
lift her hand or her arm up.

185
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,140
She just like open and close her
hand while it just rested on a leg.

186
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:40,310
It was like adorable. But with this guy
it was just so, I don't know what it was.

187
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:42,170
It was just like, wow, this
guy has got a lot of pain.

188
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:45,140
I don't know what the fuck happened
to say. Fist bump. Long story short,

189
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,790
by the end of the game,
even though his Dodgers are losing,

190
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,620
we're like friends or friendly anyways,
diffused the whole fucking thing.

191
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,930
Am I anchor my angry fucking uh,
Italian Boston guy and what? He's like,

192
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:03,290
dude, how the fuck did you do that?
How to find, I just said to him,

193
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,330
I was just like, dude, I go,
I'm fucking done with it.

194
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,560
Um, I'm, I'm not, I'm not
fucking doing this anymore.

195
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,400
I'm not going to fucking go
to a fucking baseball game.

196
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,330
And then almost getting as a
50 year old bald fucking dude

197
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,070
almost get into a fight

198
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,900
over an empty fucking bud lite beer
can and where it was placed within this

199
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:29,800
concrete structure. I'm Jen, I'm just not,
I'm not fucking doing it anymore. Right.

200
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,050
I had already almost gotten into a fight
with my wife and I diffuse that because

201
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:39,820
we had pregame at my house and evidently
my wife didn't feel like she was

202
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:44,800
invited. I don't know why we were in
the house. She's always been invited.

203
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,540
But what Ha,
you know what happened?

204
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:51,541
I came off the road and I was under the
gun where I didn't have a lot of time

205
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,180
between getting back to the house,
given her a hug and a kiss,

206
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,740
checking in with my kid and then making
sure I had beer for people coming over

207
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:05,410
to go to the game because the game
starts at five and I didn't get back from

208
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:09,250
Phoenix until, uh, you know,

209
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:13,930
one o'clock didn't get home til
like two. Right. So, you know,

210
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:16,630
they're coming home, they're coming
back. I'm sorry. I got home at like one,

211
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,550
one o'clock and my friends
are coming over too. So I,

212
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:25,360
I barely hugged and kissed my wife
and then asked her to go out and uh,

213
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,060
and get some beer for the guys, you
know, which is something I never do.

214
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:34,330
I usually handle everything. You know,
she's always got the honey do list for me,

215
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:37,030
but I never have anything for her, so I
can get, can you walk and get some beers?

216
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,490
And she's looking at me like,

217
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,240
I just asked her if she could
fucking walk on water or something.

218
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,510
So a half hour goes by
and I'm looking at like,

219
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,020
are you going to go out and get the
beer? And she goes, are you serious?

220
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,200
I didn't know you were being serious.
And I was like, yeah, I'm being serious.

221
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Like why, why would I say that is a
joke? And she goes, well cause you know,

222
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,870
I'm just sort of sitting here, you
know, hanging out and fuck it. You know,

223
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,840
it's one, it's one of those, you know,

224
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,490
it's just one of those things in our
relationship where it like one person is

225
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:14,330
going to ask somebody else to do something
that they never do themselves or, or,

226
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,910
or,
or vice versa or something like that.

227
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,680
So I don't know if she could
get her fucking head around it.

228
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,120
So then she goes and she gets the beer,
you know,

229
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,540
she pulls up and of course
when she pulls up she's like,

230
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,600
can you come out here and help me bring
the beer in? Cause that's what the fuck.

231
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:29,710
They can never just fucking do something
for, they still get a draggy in. Right.

232
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,070
And I missed that text and my friends
went out and helped her out and then she

233
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,500
was fucking pissed at me,
a whatever.

234
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,890
So we're driving to the game and she's
like texting me about what a jerk I am.

235
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,150
So I fucking diffuse that.
I go to the fucking game,

236
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,990
I diffuse the fat fuck behind us.
That's all I did the whole fucking day.

237
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,270
Diffuse and shit. As I watched the red sox
then go down, you know, four to nothing.

238
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,530
And after that crazy
fucking game and game three

239
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,920
where we used our starting,
you know, game for pitcher.

240
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,260
I mean what I mean, how great a game did
a, what's his face? Uh, Bueller pitch.

241
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,230
I feel like people forgot
about that with the Dodgers.

242
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,490
Winning was all about that guy
hitting the home run. And I apologize,

243
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:18,820
I got a kid now. I don't know
anybody's fucking names anymore.

244
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,440
I watch the games while I fucking switch
back and forth between the game in

245
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:27,670
puppy dog pals. Every time I switched
from puppy dog pals back to the game.

246
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:32,140
My daughter just points at
the TV goes, oh, oh dog, dog,

247
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,440
dog.
And I got

248
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,780
my just a second Mimi Mau,
Mimi Mau. So I was like,

249
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:44,130
she's speaking like Chinese or something.
She's saying Minnie Mouse, Mimi Mau,

250
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,640
maybe Mao, Mimi Mo. Um, anyways,

251
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,420
so I don't even know who
hit the fucking home run.

252
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,240
The whole thing was such a blur.
I've been so goddamn busy.

253
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,050
Somebody hit a fucking home run for the
red sox to make it treated. Nothing.

254
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,250
I mean four to three, then
we scored another run, then
we fucking loaded them up.

255
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,490
And then that whole analytics shit that
taking guys out that are doing a good

256
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,410
job of, Gee, I don't fucking understand.

257
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,370
I mean analytics when in those situations
sometimes I swear to God it's like,

258
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,640
it's like baseball's version of the
fucking prevent defense where like,

259
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,250
I am sure on paper this
fucking makes sense,

260
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,270
but why? You know, stop
watching the fucking pitch
count. What is this guy doing

261
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,720
to the opposite team right now? Oh, he's
key sees. She's fucking killing them.

262
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,140
Buddies.
Up to 27 pitches and,

263
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,300
and the juxtaposition for tis ball and
socket joint out fucking shoulder to his,

264
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,420
his,
his juggler.

265
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,560
We need to take them out during the 28th
and a half fucking pitch right there

266
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,800
doing that shit. So anyways,
we ended up coming back.

267
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,781
I think we won that.

268
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:55,340
We were winning the game like nine to
four and then Kimberly comes in, you know,

269
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:58,430
you know how he closes it gave me, lets
up a comb, run in a fucking double,

270
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,170
you know, I know he's coming off
injury. God bless the guy. Whatever.

271
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,410
We scared the fucking shit out of me.
And uh,

272
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,800
we won the game and then it was great.
I got to walk onto the stage.

273
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,500
I didn't have any problem. I shook
the guy's hand behind me and you know,

274
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:15,770
I know I saw a bunch of people
wearing red sox shit there. Um,

275
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,780
I guess what I'm saying,
I'm just too old to do it.

276
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,840
And my favorite fucking part about going
to an opposing team stadium rooting for

277
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:28,250
the other team is when I'm not wearing
my own gear and I go into the bathroom

278
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,060
and I don't have to worry that five guys
are going to push me in the back when I

279
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,610
go to take a fucking piss.
You know what I mean?

280
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,920
Cause their teams lose it and the the,
the,

281
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,350
the fucking bathroom with
all of that porcelain,

282
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,240
all of that tile and none of that,

283
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,700
none of the fucking security
in his urine on the floor.

284
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:46,190
It's just the fucking worst and that's,

285
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,470
that's where it goes down and to just be
able to walk in there and just not have

286
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:55,820
a fucking problem. I wasn't being a
dick when the red sox were scoring runs.

287
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,850
I was definitely cheering,
but I did it in a respectful way.

288
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,110
I didn't do that shit. I always see
that when I'm watching games, you know,

289
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:05,990
any game, any game I watch and
I'll see the opposing team's score.

290
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,450
When they cut to the crowd,
you'll always see one douchebag,

291
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,130
not only standing up wearing
fucking everything he could
possibly be wearing for

292
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:16,400
the other team.
He's turning around facing the crowd,

293
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,790
you know, like he's fucking, you know,

294
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,360
Steven Seagal and marked for death and
he's going to beat up a whole fucking

295
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:27,860
section though, is some fucking
fat, bloated drunk jackass.

296
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,540
And every time I see it,

297
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,690
I always just think like somebody
should beat the fuck out of that guy.

298
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,320
Somebody shouldn't.
But you know,

299
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,240
you never watch the discovery channel. You
don't know how nature works. Like what?

300
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:46,110
Yeah, just no fucking, I
don't know what, no. Uh,

301
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,680
no respect for like your own wellbeing.
Like the fuck,

302
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,490
why the fuck would you do that? So
anyways, that's just not how I did it.

303
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:56,490
So then I got home and it was late at
night and we would just sit in there like,

304
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,950
can you fucking believe this shit?
It was like we were down four to nothing.

305
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:03,810
I wasn't even nervous cause I was thinking
even if the Dodgers tied this series

306
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:06,870
up, we're still going to win it. Like
that's how much does the psychology,

307
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,940
and I'm talking about the
fucking Boston red sox.

308
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,360
I never thought I would
have this feeling about him.

309
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,920
I just knew these guys
were going to come back.

310
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:15,660
I didn't think it was going
to happen in that game.

311
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,510
And we won that game and I just
couldn't fucking believe it.

312
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,860
And I didn't talk one ounce
of fucking shit. None of
that stuff. I just, you know,

313
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,270
I wanted my team to win. They
won. That was good enough for me.

314
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,370
I don't need to fucking start walking
around being a cunt about it, but like,

315
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:36,600
that's really, um, it just really is
just sort of spot part of the, uh,

316
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,530
sports culture.
And what's funny is,

317
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,980
is how people don't see that their
own fans of their team do it too.

318
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,830
Like I know when the red
sox were playing New York,

319
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:51,750
New York for whatever stupid fucking
reason in the locker room after we won it,

320
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,970
it was all these Yankee fans.

321
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,450
No real clear to you. I could tell
you this with the Yankees win.

322
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,430
Last thing we'll be doing is thinking
about the red sox. It's like, yeah,

323
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,264
you will be.

324
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,050
Yes she will be because you took the time
to go on Twitter to fucking comment on

325
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:09,740
that.
You took the time to find out about it.

326
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,650
You obviously on the in in
the red sox threads to see it,

327
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,930
you know, and then they all real
classy Boston like and just like, hey,

328
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,320
you're really forgetting that your fan
base through a bear in the face of our

329
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,470
reliever is he came out of the bullpen.
You're going to forget you chanted 19,

330
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:28,020
18 at fucking old ladies.

331
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,950
If they had a red sox hat on for the
better part of a fucking century, man,

332
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,470
come on, grow the fuck up. It's
not something that I would do.

333
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:38,310
I think it's dumb to do that
cause it just, uh, you know,

334
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,330
gives the other team more
incentive or whatever. But, uh,

335
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,080
personally speaking,
um,

336
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,700
all I give a shit about is my
team. And like, now I'm out of,

337
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:53,280
the big thing is I'd love to
see the red sox winning again.

338
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,670
So then we would be in double digits in
Champions Championships in two different

339
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:03,390
professional sports,
basketball and um,

340
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,310
and a and baseball. And I think we would
be the first city that ever did that.

341
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,040
Um, not to mention, here's another
stat if you into fucking stats.

342
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,050
I also believe that the red sox,

343
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,550
other first professional sports franchise
to win a championship this same year

344
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:25,270
in two different centuries. Huh? Am I
going fucking Billy Ball on you here?

345
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:29,850
A little nerd enough
for you. Um, and lastly,

346
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:32,490
but not leastly I can't remember cause
I had to start this podcast again cause

347
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,950
my record recorded was filled up.
If I didn't, I don't give a shit.

348
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:38,880
I'll apologize to again,
my apologies to David Price.

349
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,033
Jesus Christ

350
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,010
not have been more wrong and there's
going to be a bunch of people out there

351
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,140
being like, dude, I fucking set in.

352
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,260
I know what never doubted that
guy about they are full of shit.

353
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,020
You're full. I'm, maybe
you're not. But I did.

354
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,380
I 100% thought I actually thought
we weren't going to win it in.

355
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:59,620
The problem was going to be
that David Price was a headcase,

356
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:01,570
couldn't beat the Yankees,
couldn't win the big game,

357
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:06,520
couldn't win fucking October. I 100%
thought that. Um, and I was like,

358
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:10,180
you know, you need the one
two punch. She need, you know,

359
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:13,510
you need to monster shut it down.

360
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,060
Pictures to win a seven game series.

361
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:20,200
Now that's how it is with all the free
agents seemingly piling on six different

362
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:24,220
teams. And I was 100%
wrong. I actually thought,

363
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,481
you know,

364
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:30,130
price should have been the MVP considering
all of that fucking chatter that was

365
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:34,990
in his ear and considering, you
know, he won both his starts,

366
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:38,950
he came in during the pitch relief
and eat up some meetings and he just,

367
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:40,750
he just crushed it and uh,

368
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,500
couldn't be more happy for that guy and
couldn't be more happy that I was 100%

369
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:47,830
wrong, 100% wrong. And I loved his,

370
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:51,640
when his press conference afterwards,
when he was going, you know,

371
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:55,210
you guys had that card on me and
you played it, you played it well,

372
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:59,350
but you don't have it anymore. He goes,
I have the Trump card and it feels great.

373
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,790
And I just pushed one of those
sports writers in there, you know,

374
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,920
they never fucking own up when they're
fucking wrong, you know, aren't released.

375
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,440
Not Enough. They should,
one of them should have been
like, Hey David, how feel,

376
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,180
how good does it feel to stare at all
of us who fucking doubted you and wrote

377
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:20,020
all that bad shit about you,
myself included. You know,

378
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:24,760
why don't they ever say that?
You know? So anyways, um,

379
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,350
I dunno, but getting back to that
stuff, I would not have played New York,

380
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:32,510
New York. I would not like,
why would you do that? You,

381
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,570
you fucking kicked the Yankees ass,
you know, you gotta be above that Shit.

382
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,010
But I guess there's always that stuff.

383
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:43,120
You go to a rangers game and the
range is still chant. Pod Van Sucks.

384
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,770
I go to an avalanche game, but
at, at, at, at that red wig suck,

385
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:51,400
you just have your fucking rival.
Um,

386
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,850
and I guess I understand it because
Yankee fans were such conc for so goddamn

387
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,500
long. Um, I guess I understand,
but, uh, I'm always,

388
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,373
I'm always,

389
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,600
I always think it's way better to score
the touchdown and just hand the ball to

390
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:10,330
the ref.
You do some stupid dance.

391
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:15,310
All it does is fucking make
the guy covering you. I Dunno.

392
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,080
Just want to fucking play that much
harder if you just do it like it wasn't

393
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:24,010
shit. I just feel like it's
just way more defeating.

394
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,170
But what do I know?
You know,

395
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,580
when was the last time bill you
played a game and fucking gym class?

396
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,040
I'm trying to think. The last
time I played, other than hockey,

397
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:37,060
I played hockey in three years, so I
hurt my back and then I had a kid, so I,

398
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,710
my hockey stuff has been sitting there
every time I walked by. I was like,

399
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:43,270
I have not. I remember September of 2015
I haven't skated in three fucking years.

400
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,350
Pathetic. Um, but anyways, uh, so
congratulations to the red sox.

401
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,550
Congratulations to the Dodgers, man.
I know with fucking brutal, but, uh,

402
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:57,500
it will be all the more sweeter when
you finally a pushed through and, um,

403
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,550
you know,

404
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,410
getting past all this fan shit like I
really do like all of those organizations

405
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:05,250
that we played, including
the fucking Yankees. I mean,

406
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:08,270
you can't get mad the most successful,
you know,

407
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,930
you can't be a fan of sports in that
respect. What the fuck they'd done a,

408
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:16,880
I know that. That's it. I'm done talking
about the Patriots. Got The bills tonight.

409
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,290
Hey, did Lewis Hamilton wrap it up
yesterday? Did He, I imagine he fucking,

410
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,490
he's always on the podium.

411
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:25,980
I think all he needed to do was just get
into like fourth and fifth place and he

412
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,800
would've had it wrapped up.
Let's see. Louis Hamilton. Oh,

413
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:33,860
by the way, thank you to
everybody that came out to, um,

414
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,020
why does it always go to f?
How come it always goes to Wikipedia?

415
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,700
Is that because I always go to Wikipedia?
What did I already be up there?

416
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,320
Wins 70 ones, Burns it, Duh, Duh,
Duh. Where's championships? Yep.

417
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,040
You just want it 2018 he wanted again.
Congratulations.

418
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:58,560
Congratulations. Um, so Lewis Hamilton,

419
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:03,561
when's the f one championship and
mock mock Perez one the moto GP race.

420
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:07,710
And I want to thank everybody that is
helped me along as I've gotten into both

421
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:11,460
of those sports and I'm absolutely
obsessed with them. Although I, you know,

422
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:13,920
like I said with the Kiddo,
I don't have as much time

423
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,573
mmm.

424
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,620
To watch them the way I want
to, but they are on my DVR. Um,

425
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,530
what was it was in Brazil.
I was Mexico.

426
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,320
That's one of my favorite races where
they drive to the old baseball stadium.

427
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,813
MMM.

428
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,130
I might go to that one next
year. Who knows? Who knows?

429
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:36,850
All I know is it's Halloween this weekend
I'm in town and I were having this

430
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:40,750
little kid Halloween party,
you know,

431
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:44,140
you know nightclubs that like, you know,
21 and older. I think this is like,

432
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,240
it's like 18 months and under.

433
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,700
So it was going to be a bunch
of little kids running around.

434
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:49,840
It's going to be hilarious.

435
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,260
My wife is like totally decked out the
house and everything. Oh, by the way,

436
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,460
when I came home after the game,

437
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,000
she was still upset with me and I
didn't know that she was still up.

438
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:01,420
So we were outside smoking cigars and
Shit, and she texts me. She's like,

439
00:26:01,421 --> 00:26:03,760
where are you? I'm like, up
downstairs, the back porch.

440
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:06,730
And she got all fucking mad at me.
Like she wasn't invited.

441
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,160
So I went upstairs and I got tight.

442
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,920
She was so trying to have a fight with
me and I just wouldn't have a fight.

443
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,440
It was like, listen, I don't
want to fight with you.

444
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:18,760
Just tell me what the problem is. I
love you. You're awesome. I love you.

445
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:21,880
You love me. We're not going anywhere.
I want to go to bed angry at you.

446
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,050
What did I do that upset you? And like,
how can we, how can we work this out?

447
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,050
And just, you know, stop yelling at
each other. I don't want to yell at you.

448
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,970
She says, uh, okay. Uh, she had to
go through that, you know, for one,

449
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:37,070
she was being the baby,
you know,

450
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,710
so that's my new thing. I'm just, I,

451
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:44,190
I don't know what happened
somewhere in that dodger game.

452
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,060
I want to thank that guy who was
standing by me. The absurdity of it,

453
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,370
it just finally hit me. It's just
like, I'm not fucking doing it.

454
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:54,900
I'm just not doing this anymore.
Jesus Christ.

455
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:58,320
I just saw a fucking letter for this week.
I'm copying and pasting it right now.

456
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,760
It just said girlfriend
wants to bang my brother.

457
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,400
Now that that's just, I refuse to believe
that that's a true thing. Whatever.

458
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:09,360
I'll read that in a minute here.

459
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,900
I got to do the advertising was probably
not a good thing to tease right before

460
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:17,520
I'm going to read advertising.
Um, advertisements. Um,

461
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,200
all right, where the hell
is it? Oh, Indo Chino. Uh,

462
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:25,320
talk about stressful.
Talk about,

463
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:29,010
she'd say how stressful it is knowing
you have to go to an event in his suit

464
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:32,530
that doesn't fit. Oh yeah, that's
the worst I had to go to. Why?

465
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,360
The reason why I didn't see any,
a game clinching red sox game yet.

466
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,440
Cause I had to go to a wedding and we
had the after the after party for season

467
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:44,010
three of 'em efforts for family.

468
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,090
We had a great time.
We actually went bowling and a,

469
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:50,090
so I kind of do like
double duty last night.

470
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,050
So I was watching that whole thing
on my phone. Um, but anyways,

471
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,140
I love going to weddings now.
Now that I'm married and I have a kid,

472
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,140
it's like all the pressures over I did it.
Okay.

473
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,790
I committed to somebody I
procreated, you know, fuck off.

474
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,110
I imagine it's the same feeling
David Price has right now. Okay.

475
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,940
I did it. I got a ring. Go Fuck Yourself.

476
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,090
I am the David Price of wedding
wedding guests right now. Um,

477
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,950
anyways, what it was Indochino

497
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:48,280
I've made it the fucking kitchen
counter. All right. Zip Recruiter.

498
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,740
That's actually not true. I'm actually
in good shape right now, but you know,

499
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,240
it's always good to have a big sport
coat hanging around for when you're,

500
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,570
you're going through your fat months, you
know, the holidays. Anyway, Ziprecruiter,

501
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,440
you know what's not smart job sites that
overwhelm you with tons of the wrong

502
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:04,750
resumes,
but you know what is smart zip

503
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,720
recruiter.com/burr. Unlike
other jobs sites, uh,

504
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,590

right candidates to apply.

512
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,310

is rated number one by employers in the

513
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,140
US.
Um,

514
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,260
this rating comes from hiring sites
on trust pilot with over 1000 reviews.

515
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,870
Okay, look at them. They're backing
it up. A little footnotes there.

Let's read some fucking,

522
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,950
let's read some fucking questions here.

523
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,100
Let's read some questions here.
Then when I get off this thing,

524
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,260
I got to go do that. The honey, the
honey do list, right? And you know what?

525
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:33,310
I'm gonna do it with everybody.

526
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:36,870
I'm going to do it with the fucking
smile on my face and I'm not,

527
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,470
I'm not going to, uh, yeah, I'm
done dude. I am. I'm done fighting.

528
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,790
I've had, I'm just gonna keep saying it
out loud. So I make it a real thing. I'm,

529
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:51,430
I'm done with it. What is the fucking
problem? What I really need to say?

530
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,690
I'm sorry. What is the problem? But I, I,

531
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,650
the only place I've graduated to right
now is what is the fucking problem?

532
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,830
All right?
If I can take the fuck out of there,

533
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,920
get some of the angry tone out of my
voice, I think I'll be doing even better.

534
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,990
All right. Granted, I'll probably run
out of material that's beside the point.

535
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:12,640
Speaking of material, big guys here to
Patriot Patriot on announcement here.

536
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,520
Why? Uh, by popular demand,

537
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:19,660
people have been asking for more con
content where they can donate, et cetera.

538
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,060
Um, all right. The what, why, what, and
all of this shit. All right. I have a new,

539
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:27,940
I'm going to have a,
I'm launching a Patrion page.

540
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,610
It's going to go live on November 5th.
All right?

541
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,950
Um, and this is what you're going to
get all this extra content. All right.

542
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,300
Patrion spelled p. A. T. R. E. O. N.

543
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,190
You're going to get two episodes of the
uninformed podcast with me and old Joey

544
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:50,200
roses. I'm bringing it back.
You get extra video contents.

545
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,900
Citio Tor city tours, backstage
footage, helicopter rides,

546
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,620
whatever the fuck I'm doing. How
much is it? It's five bucks a month.

547
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,220
Jesus Christ. Lay off on a couple
of fucking cartons of eggs and you,

548
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,500
and you got yourself all this other
content. All right, November is content.

549
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:13,090
We'll go live November 5th. Uh,
I have, uh, I videoed a podcast,

550
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:17,500
it's a live podcast from Phoenix that
was a good podcast to full video of the

551
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:20,340
show as well as downloads to MP3,

of other fucking, you know,

554
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,240
bizarre behind the scenes shit at my
shows and all that type of stuff. Um,

555
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:32,501
you know,

556
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:35,800
it's funny they say that and you have a
patrion page and they don't even tell me.

557
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,000
I guess you go to Patrion and you
just try to look up my name, whatever.

558
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,870
I'll keep promoting, I'll promote
it. And again, speaking of which, uh,

559
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:47,470

it this week, November 3rd,

560
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:50,280
Paul Versey standup special,
uh,

561
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:54,910
on comedy central is coming
out and it was done by my,

562
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,800
uh, my company that I started with
Al Madrigal, all things comedy.

563
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:02,860
This is our first special that is coming
out. We're very excited. And it would,

564
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,020
bu it would be huge this Thursday
night if you guys could, uh,

565
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,200
is that what it is? No, no, no,
no. It's not Thursday night.

566
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,120
Looking at the wrong thing.
Sunday night, Sunday, Sunday.

567
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:17,750
Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah. No,
that's the wrong one too.

568
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,470
Why is it in, may I swear to God,
don't let, don't even listen to me.

569
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,910
Here we go. I'm sorry. This
Saturday night, November 3rd,

570
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,060
Paul [inaudible] standup
special on comedy central.

571
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:36,560
I think it comes on at midnight.
Um,

572
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,770
yeah,
I'm just really proud of them.

573
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,500
This is just one of these guys who should
have got a special a long time ago and

574
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:47,000
did not. And with the company that I
started with, Al Madrigal add matter,

575
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,070
Myalgia go being the
driving force behind it,

576
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,720
we're able to get ourselves in position.

577
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:54,980
We actually made a deal with comedy
central and we're producing, um,

578
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,640
for one hour specials for them for
the next year. This is the first one.

579
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,950
And we're gonna be picking
all these comics that we
love and I'm so please check

580
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:06,050
that out if you can. All
right, let's, let's read.

581
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,640
Let's read a little less
questionnaire. Corvette. Hey,

582
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,410
Billy Bean ball bag.
Uh,

583
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,440
needed advice on a car I would
love to purchase next year.

584
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,360
I'm looking to try at trying
to get a c seven corvette,

585
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,590
the latest model
Corvettes. A C seven. Okay.

586
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,200
Or is that the BOT? Is that the body type?
Oh, what did we do now? Look at that.

587
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:31,340
I can't fucking hear myself.
What just happened?

588
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,780
Gravity happened. I got to sit
there and literally hold this thing.

589
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,620
I literally have my thumb
down on the connection here.

590
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,130
Like one of those bad action movies
where the guy comes walking and going.

591
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,310
If I take my thumb off his pit,
we all go up.

592
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,880
I got to do that for the rest
of the podcast. Evidently. Um,

593
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,910
so anyways,
so I imagine that's fucking cut.

594
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,430
Jesus fucking Christ.

595
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:04,590
They'll go to a radio shack and just by
what the fucking IED set at dealing with

596
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:09,300
this every week. Fucking
moron. Hey, you know what?

597
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,250
I'm also done getting mad
inanimate objects. Jody, Rosetta,

598
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,340
great bit about that. And I remember
listening to it going, you know what?

599
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,910
I really should learn how to do that
and I haven't. And as far as I can tell,

600
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:23,430
he hasn't learned how to not do it either.
Anyways,

601
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,790
it's the latest model of Corvettes.
I'm currently 23 years old,

602
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,460
married to an absolute fucking gym,

603
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,450
have a house with her and pay for
everything we want. Slash half. Dude,

604
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,520
you're fucking killing it. Uh, not
trying to pat myself on the back,

605
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,070
but I'm happy with where
I am in life anyways.

606
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,060
Do you think it would be good or dumb
idea to get a corvette next year and I'm

607
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:47,820
going to be a little bitch
and get an automatic.

608
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,480
I want to be able to have my mom
drive it since that's her dream car.

609
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,300
Otherwise I would just
get a manual anyways.

610
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,250
Don't go fuck yourself and
keep on keeping on. Um, dude,

611
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,820
if you know you're married to a gem
and you're living within your means,

612
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:06,750
if you can afford to get a corvette, get
a corvette, you know, here's the deal.

613
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:08,820
I don't know if they
make it in a stick still.

614
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:12,390
It seems like everything is
just the paddle shifting. Um,

615
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,080
if you still can get it in a stick and
we'd be a great way to teach your mom how

616
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:19,800
to drive a stick. She grinds the
gears on your brand new corvette.

617
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:24,210
Probably a dumb idea. Sounded good in
my head until I fucking said that. Um,

618
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,360
although I tell you one of the big things
then in the future that I want to do

619
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,490
with my daughters,
I want to teach her how to drive my truck,

620
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:34,380
which is three on the column.
And um, I think that, yeah,
how bad ass will that be?

621
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,820
That she,
you know that someone born in 2017,

622
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,050
we'll know how to drive a 1968
Ford f 100 and she's a lady.

623
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,560
Yeah, my kid's going to be a bad ass.
She's going to know how to do shit.

624
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,140
She's not gonna be when these fucking
pretty girl sitting at the bar link.

625
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,100
I'm just going to pretend
I don't know things. Um,

626
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,210
anyways. Yeah, I think that's a great
idea. If you want to get it, you know,

627
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,010
if you know, she, she seems like he
kind of also doing it for your mom,

628
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:06,720
which is a great thing. Um, and cars,

629
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:09,990
you know, I don't know when
people are like car people,

630
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,790
it really means a lot when they, they get
the one that they've always wanted. Um,

631
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:20,220
you know, I dunno, I bought,
I bought a car, you know,

632
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,270
I bought the car and my wife wanted
and I saw the look on her face so I can

633
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:26,460
imagine, you know, and that's
the woman that I married,

634
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:27,950
so I know what that feeling's life.

635
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,870
I can't imagine if you
get it for your mom in,

636
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,780
you're able to pay her back like that.
Yeah, absolutely. I would fucking do that.

637
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,770
Um,

638
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,030
why don't you go buy a
shitbox in the meantime,

639
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,140
that's a stick and go teach
your mom how to drive, drive,

640
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:48,520
drive a standard transmission,
be great together time.

641
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:53,140
You'll laugh your asses off and uh,
you know,

642
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:56,800
and that's great for, you know, somebody
who's older to learn something new.

643
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,680
It's a lot of options here,
man. They're all good.

644
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,300
Glad you're life is in that place that
that email actually made made me happy.

645
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:08,260
Believe it or not, somebody killing it
like that. See that? I got it. Good.

646
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,190
All right, girlfriend wants
to bang my brother. Ah, we,

647
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:14,410
I tease this earlier in the podcast.

648
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,370
Girlfriend wants to Bang

649
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,170
my brother,
Jesus Christ.

650
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,080
I would love to hear Joel
Olsteen read this fucking thing.

651
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,880
I mean cheese wants your girlfriend
and bang your brother. Hey Bill,

652
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,360
I'm sure this happens.
This has happened to you before.

653
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,550
I said a long over a roundabout way of
saying that I'm not a good looking guy.

654
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,180
Uh,

655
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,960
but how should I handle my girlfriend
wanting to bang my brother more than me?

656
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,410
Thoughts?
She said it three times in one night.

657
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,760
What?
Why you still in this relationship?

658
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,140
Would you still be in the relationship
if you said that about our sin?

659
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,770
A listened Sweden. Not to say you
don't have a nice rack, but like,

660
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,980
I mean you, you got to
agree with me. I mean your,

661
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,060
your sister's tits are ridiculous.
D now bad.

662
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,100
I want to stick my dick between
the two of them. You know what,

663
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,240
what you told me?

664
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,290
Um, um, anyways,

665
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,530
she said it in one night,

666
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,220
three times in one night and that
he is better looking at Cetera.

667
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,260
So she's either going to fuck him or
she's just trying to get under my skin.

668
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,990
I told her after the third time to go
fuck him then and she tried to act like I

669
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:41,770
was an asshole. Yes, of
course. Of course she did.

670
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,030
I feel like this cross the line
and it's all I can think about.

671
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,180
Oh two I got to taste center right now.

672
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,990
Not only do you say
that you fucking dumper

673
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,150
too for her to fucking say
that to you is so out of line.

674
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,420
And that is just the tip of the
fucking iceberg of the mind.

675
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:05,840
Games of fucking asshole. Like this is
going to play with somebody. All right,

676
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:11,010
dump this person and this is the thing
she's gonna have actually fucking respect

677
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:14,860
you because she obviously doesn't respect
you enough that she's saying that shit

678
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,660
to you.
So if you fucking dumper,

679
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:21,550
you know what's going to actually
make her want to do is fuck you more.

680
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,840
And this is what you do. This is
the jet I level. You know what?

681
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:27,520
When she wants to fuck
you more after that,

682
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:31,330
you know what you do yet dumb fucker done.

683
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,740
Yeah. Done. It's over.

684
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,570
That's one of those things like,

685
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:43,270
I don't know what kind of a fucking
jerk off you think I am like that.

686
00:41:43,271 --> 00:41:46,100
That's basically what she's saying to
you that she thinks you're a fucking jerk

687
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:47,990
off and you have to show
her that you're not.

688
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:52,340
I would dumper and then that is
fucking it. That is fucking it.

689
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,570
And when she fucking,
um,

690
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:00,380
does all of those women manipulating
things and fucking turns on the sex vibe

691
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:03,560
and all that dude, you fucking,
you like go you nothing.

692
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,810
You give her nothing.
That's it.

693
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:11,090
I don't need to read the rest
of this. I will though. Um,

694
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,530
if it was a friend of mine, she thought
was more attractive, I wouldn't care.

695
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:18,920
You should care. She shouldn't
be saying that, dude. This is,

696
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,250
this is why you don't fucking say that.
Let me ask you this.

697
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,810
Could you do any of this to her?

698
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,740
Could you say that one of her
girlfriends is more attractive than her?

699
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,860
Three times in one
night. Anyways, he said,

700
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:35,840
but I hate the fact it's my baldheaded
fuck of a brother. What should I do?

701
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:40,100
Anything I think about,
I get more angry. Uh,

702
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,800
thanks and wear a hat next.

703
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:49,070
I like how you're taking your
anger out on me. Um, yeah, dude.

704
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:51,710
You're dating somebody that has crossed
the line that you're not going to be

705
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:55,730
able to get past. Okay. Pass. Sorry.
I really going to save my voice, dude.

706
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:59,810
I've been screaming and yelling every
weekend doing my act and been watching the

707
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:03,010
red sox through the playoffs.
So I apologize for my son.

708
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,680
I'm going through puberty here. Um,
yeah, do that as a no fucking brainer,

709
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,700
you know, uh, just dump
her. And it's another thing.

710
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,630
Don't tell your older brother or younger
brother, whoever your brother is, don't,

711
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,210
don't tell your brother why you dumped it,

712
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,240
because one day he's going to get drunk
and he's going to bring it up and then,

713
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,300
you know, like an asshole and then you
guys are gonna get into a fight. Okay.

714
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,460
And it's all because of this.

715
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,430
This client who is trying is driving
a wedge into your family. This is,

716
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:34,260
this is the kind of person you're going
to bring this person in your family tree.

717
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:39,570
Huh? You're going to dump your fucking
seat into that. I don't think you are.

718
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,600
Walk away. Walk away.
And you know what, dude?

719
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:47,670
You got off fucking easy. If you
dumped this woman right now, you,

720
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,260
you got off fucking easy.
Jesus Christ.

721
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:56,470
God bless the poor fucking bastard
that she's going to fucking marry right

722
00:43:56,571 --> 00:44:01,400
there. Um, anyways, uh,
deer hill, Billy Buck tooth.

723
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,810
Uh, I'm in a bit of a pickle.
I'm 23 lines, a lot of,

724
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:09,800
lot of emails from 23 year olds this week.
Evidently a 23 year olds.

725
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:13,550
I have have a, a little
difficult fuck dammit. Um,

726
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,680
deer hill, Billy Buck tooth. Uh, I'm
a bit of a m and a bit of a pickle.

727
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,670
I'm 23 and want to break up
with my girlfriend of two years.

728
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,360
We're long distance. I'm
a kiwi. She's a Yank.

729
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,890
Ah, what's a Kiwi again? Is that
fucking New Zealand? I can't even,

730
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:35,640
I can't even keep up. Um, anyways.
Uh, now I gotta look it up.

731
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:40,380
I don't want you guys to sound
ignorant like me. Here we go.

732
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,460
Key.
We pee.

733
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,250
So

734
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,900
Wikipedia,
once again,

735
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,960
Kiwis nickname used for international
internationally for people from New

736
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,910
Zealand as well as being
relatively common self reference.

737
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,620
Unlike many demograph Leyva, it's usually
is not considered offensive, rather,

738
00:45:02,621 --> 00:45:06,430
it's generally viewed as a symbol
of pride and an endearment from,

739
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,210
for the people of New Zealand.
The name derives from the Kiwi,

740
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:15,040
a native flightless bird,
which is a national symbol of New Zealand.

741
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,680
It's a flightless bird.
Many you guys aren't leaving the island.

742
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,750
Is that what it is?
Until the first world war,

743
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:23,620
the Kiwi represented the country and
not the people. However, by 1917,

744
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:27,910
New Zealanders were being called
Kiwis supplanting other nicknames.

745
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,460
So that's cool. That's great. That
eventually it didn't become offensive.

746
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,870
Usually after a while it does.

747
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,850
Are you saying that my dreams
will never take flight?

748
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,800
Oh yeah.

749
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:44,720
Um, anyways, uh, I'm a
kiwi each. She's a Yank.

750
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:46,990
Uh,

751
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:48,820
sure. Blocker on Facebook. Okay.

752
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:52,210
I'm 23 and want to break up with
my girlfriend and two years. Okay,

753
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,190
well you just sit down. He just say,
listen, we have to talk. All right,

754
00:45:57,191 --> 00:45:59,800
this is something I wish somebody
just told me. This is what you say.

755
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:03,910
You just sit down and say, honey,
listen, we have to talk something wrong.

756
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,320
And then you just say yes,
I'm just, I'm not happy.

757
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:13,010
Okay. I don't think you're a bad
person or anything, but I'm just,

758
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,360
this just doesn't feel right.

759
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:19,823
You know?

760
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,600
It feels right in that I like you,

761
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:26,920
but it doesn't feel like I like you to
the point that I'm going to marry you.

762
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,510
And then they just stopped talking and
then she'll start fucking crying and blah

763
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,343
, blah, blah, blah.

764
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:38,410
And she's crying because she's sad and
that is a normal emotion and you have to

765
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:42,770
be comfortable with that. And
just you, you just said it.
No, I did you say yeah, no.

766
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,990
And, and I, I, I think we need to, uh,

767
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,290
end this relationship now, I think,
and we need to end this relationship.

768
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,150
That's it. You said it, I'm not happy.

769
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,430
I'm not feeling like you're
the person I'm gonna marry.

770
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,230
We need to end this relationship,
bom, boom, boom. We need
to talk. I'm not happy.

771
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,630
Yeah, you just fucking, that's it.

772
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:05,500
And you just get it all out and it's
going to be another two fucking hours,

773
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,270
but you don't waver. You don't go
back and then, then you're out.

774
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,243
That's it.

775
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:18,100
And then you don't go back anyways.
He says,

776
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:22,660
sure. Blocker on blocker, on
Facebook and other social medias.

777
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,000
We used to correspond. The problem is
she has a lot of filthy nudes of mine.

778
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:32,050
I've sent her the past few years.
Needless to say,

779
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:35,380
I have my fair share of hers. All
right, well that's a stalemate then.

780
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,550
I'm worried she'll distribute them
maliciously in revenge for breaking it off

781
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:42,580
with her. She's that kind
of spiteful. Trust me.

782
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:46,180
Any advice other than hindsight,
thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

783
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,420
You're just going to have to man
up and do it, dude. You know?

784
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,990
And if the world's going to see a dick
for a couple of days, then so be it.

785
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,430
That's it.
That's it.

786
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:59,910
All right. And, um,

787
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,200
I'm actually happy for you
because who wants to be,

788
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,680
who would want to marry a spiteful person

789
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,550
because she,

790
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,420
she would've done that to you if you
stayed with their in other areas.

791
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:15,340
You're not happy.
Get the fuck out of it.

792
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:18,580
And then your hindsight stopped
sending Dick pics to people,

793
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:25,180
you know,
I dunno.

794
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,180
That's, that's how I lead that way.
What do you fucking lay in there?

795
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:30,850
Like Burt Reynolds in playgirl because
if you weren't covering your junk,

796
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,830
I don't understand. Like I
understand women cause the beautiful,

797
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:39,210
I just don't understand. I don't, it's
under scan on a stand guys doing that. Uh,

798
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:42,420
you like these dick and
balls hanging off here.

799
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,080
Um,
a naked guy.

800
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:52,830
It's like literally it looks
like it's like a design flaw.

801
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,680
You know, women are all curvy. It's
smooth and aerodynamic, you know,

802
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,630
other went to the point, other women can
look at other naked women and be like,

803
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:03,090
oh my God, she's beautiful.
You know what I mean?

804
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:08,370
And they naked guy is Craig,
you're fucking this shit
hanging off. Cover it up.

805
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,240
Um, the lemme, uh, hey bill,

806
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,680
I'm writing in as another female
listener going on six years now.

807
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:19,560
Love your work and I'm hoping you can
help me decide something. All right.

808
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:24,060
I love when the ladies right in a
May 18 just turned 18. All right.

809
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,070
She's legal.
Uh,

810
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:30,030
and I've been working at an estate
firm for three years. Look at you.

811
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:34,080
Good for you. I don't know what that is,
but that sounds impressive to me. Um,

812
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:39,540
I'm a sophomore in college. How will you
only 18 years old doing all this stuff?

813
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,980
You're like advanced classes.

814
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,790
Most people who could play the cello
when you were three. Uh, I'm on a soft,

815
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,960
I'm a sophomore in college pursuing a
criminal degree then going on to law

816
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:55,490
school. I've always wanted to be
a criminal defense attorney. Well,

817
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:59,330
let's say you're gonna make that happen
by the time you're like 21. Anyways.

818
00:49:59,331 --> 00:49:59,691
However,

819
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:04,691
the lady I work for who runs the estate
from once to pass the firm to me,

820
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,160
but I never intended to pursue a career
in a state law by dilemmas seems to be,

821
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,620
I can't decide whether I should accept
this overwhelmingly kind offer of the

822
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:21,520
estate from ready for me when I graduate
law school or start from scratch at the

823
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:25,180
bottom and criminal law.
The state firm would need some work.

824
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,280
But all in all is a successful business.

825
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,760
From listening to your story
of how you are a self made man,

826
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:35,510
I would assume you would say pick criminal
if that's what you've always wanted.

827
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:40,490
But who in their right mind turns down
a firm that's wrapped and ready with

828
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:43,790
their name on it? Looking
forward to your insight. Uh,

829
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,740
you make rush hour drives bearable.

830
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:50,680
Thanks and kindly go fuck
yourself from another broad.

831
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:54,950
All right. Jesus Christ. Is this like
the coolest person ever? She's 18.

832
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,440
She's crushing it. Um, listen,

833
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:02,510
you're an amazingly successful
person for 18 years of age.

834
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:06,410
And I would look at it like this,
the state firm, it's just, you know,

835
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,610
it's like when Columbus was sailing
across the ocean, before he saw land,

836
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:13,250
it was a couple of tree branches.
So that's what's coming here.

837
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,151
You seeing that your,

838
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:17,690
your big things come and you definitely
got do what the fuck you want to do.

839
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,100
Um,
I think you'll regret way more,

840
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,840
not trying to be in the part of law that
you wanted to be and then walking away

841
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:33,530
from some money because, uh, you know,

842
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:39,230
you know, the money, the
money makes money, makes you
like relaxed as far as like,

843
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,990
he can pay your bills and shit like that,
but it doesn't do anything for,

844
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:47,450
for like your soul or your heart,
you know what I mean? Your passions,

845
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:51,680
it just doesn't, unless your passion
is, you love fucking money, um,

846
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,730
you know, whenever the
fuck that is. Uh, so yeah,

847
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:59,030
I would definitely just stay
on the track that you're on

848
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:04,490
and you know, just tell the person,
I'm obviously ridiculously flattered,

849
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:05,570
but you know,

850
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:09,680
my dream since I've been little has
been to a criminal defense attorney.

851
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:12,050
That's the direction that's the
part of law I want to be in.

852
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:17,470
And I just know that I would have this
regret while I ran your state from and

853
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:24,050
your state from deserve somebody that
has the same level of passion for a state

854
00:52:24,051 --> 00:52:25,790
law is I do for criminal law.

855
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,300
And there you set it and the
person's going to sit down.

856
00:52:29,301 --> 00:52:32,090
They're going to start
crying. I'm kidding. You know,

857
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:36,110
it's like really like they should be a
course on how to break up with somebody

858
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:41,020
and then also how to have confrontations
like this anywhere from the fat guy at

859
00:52:41,021 --> 00:52:44,660
yet you're behind you at a baseball game
to somebody offering you something that

860
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:49,250
nobody would say no to, but your, your
heart is saying, I can't do this. Um,

861
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,020
and that's it.
And the thing about it is,

862
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:56,380
is what you have to learn as
a young person is you have
to learn that the, this,

863
00:52:56,381 --> 00:53:00,410
this is one of the biggest, biggest
skills in life is learning how to have,

864
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:06,530
um, productive confrontation. Alright.

865
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:10,580
Where you express what you
want and you get what you want.

866
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,350
Or at the very least you
stayed what you want.

867
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:15,770
If you're not getting what you
want, you walk, but you don't do it.

868
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:18,650
There's no name calling.
There's no raising of voices.

869
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,310
And even if the other person goes there,
you don't match their energy.

870
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:26,340
You just let them yell and stuff
like that and you just stay comp.

871
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,010
Um, they, they, they should, I don't know.
I'm sure somebody is doing that out there,

872
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:35,690
but they just don't do it enough.
And um,

873
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:42,080
you know, I turned the corner the other
night with my wife where, you know,

874
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:44,760
I didn't go to where energy was.

875
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,480
I understood why she was upset with
me and I told her she was right.

876
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:52,270
You are right. I didn't come home and
ask you how you were doing. You're right.

877
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:57,010
I apologize for that. I'll work on that.
But like, I don't want to yell at you.

878
00:53:57,011 --> 00:54:01,000
I love you. That's it. I mean, what the
fuck is somebody gonna deal with that?

879
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,820
Okay. When she had to yell love me,
then they just, you just sound stupid.

880
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,600
And women fortunately enough or rational
enough that you can kind of talk them

881
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:13,110
down. You know, guys,
you know, were like, oh,

882
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,600
I don't want to deal with my emotions.
You don't,

883
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,790
you just go for a fucking by my new thing.
Then I go, I go for a walk. You know, I,

884
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:22,640
I go, go for a walk. I go out
to my garage, I played drums,

885
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,870
couple of pen terrorists songs,
and I've just lost myself in that.

886
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,640
And then I come back and I can just sit,
you know,

887
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:35,160
it's a little weird that someone in the
middle of a fucking discussion has to go

888
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:38,100
out and go play to some van Halen and
then come back before they can be. But,

889
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:42,570
you know, I, you know, I have some growing
up to do, but whatever. Um, so that, yeah,

890
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:46,830
that's what I would do. And you know, I
eat, if you're doing all of this already,

891
00:54:46,831 --> 00:54:49,290
like this is not going to
be the last opportunity.

892
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:53,170
How much better would it be if
you built your own firm? You know,

893
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,390
I think that'd be pretty bad ass. All
right. But do whatever you want to do.

894
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:00,420
But that, that's my, that's
my feeling. Sorry withdrawals.

895
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,350
I've been listening to the
podcast since the first episode.

896
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:09,060
This is my third day off of opiates.
Congratulations. Congratulations.

897
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,980
Uh,
I've been on pain,

898
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,030
managed a pain management scheduled for
the last five years due to arthritis in

899
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:17,280
my spine.
Um,

900
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,060
eating painkiller after painkiller
for the last five years.

901
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,810
Eventually I got to the point where I was
starting to question if I was addicted

902
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:29,920
or not.
Every time took a painkiller.

903
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,440
You kind of skipped a few words there,
but you go through withdrawals.

904
00:55:33,441 --> 00:55:37,070
The fact that be able to sit down and
fucking write an email is a victory in

905
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:40,520
itself. Asking myself if I
still have it under control.

906
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,320
I'm a single dad with the career.

907
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:47,321
I work long hours at night and I'm lucky
enough to still be there to get my son

908
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:51,740
from school every day. Uh, I've never
missed one of his games are racist,

909
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,410
but at the same time,
um,

910
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,380
I've been taking these
painkillers every day.

911
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:01,940
It felt like carrying a demon on my back.
I'm only three days into being cleaned,

912
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,670
still withdrawing,
still can't sleep.

913
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:07,370
Skin is crawling all
of the normal symptoms.

914
00:56:07,371 --> 00:56:10,460
That hasn't stopped me from my
daily responsibilities out. Dude,

915
00:56:10,461 --> 00:56:14,000
you're a fucking Troper. Nobody really
knows that I'm growing through this.

916
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:16,250
I don't open up about
things like this to people.

917
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,430
Well that's what you need
to do immediately. He said,

918
00:56:19,431 --> 00:56:22,700
which is why I'm writing you.
I don't want anything in return.

919
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:24,940
Just wanted to vent to this,
to someone.

920
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:29,140
I've been relistening to the podcast to
pass the time until these withdraws are

921
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:32,770
over, there's absolutely no chance
that I'll ever go back to painkillers.

922
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,270
I feel miserable right now.

923
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:37,570
But it's the best feeling I've had
felt in a long time. Good for you.

924
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,060
No more demon on my back.
Well that's great. Well,

925
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:45,040
you need to reach out to people cause
it's okay to, uh, say that you need help.

926
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,820
And, um, you know, from
what I've heard, you know,

927
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,230
getting off opiates is, is, is, is
difficult, is trying to kick heroin,

928
00:56:54,231 --> 00:56:58,250
which is also an opiate. Right. I'm glad,
I don't know a lot about drugs like that,

929
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:02,840
so, um, you know, I just, yeah,

930
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:07,790
definitely let people know what
you're going through. Uh, yeah,

931
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,040
I'll leave it at that. That's,
that's a heavy fucking subject.

932
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:12,410
So it's a tough fucking guy,
man.

933
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,700
Jesus skin crawl and he's still doing
everything you need to do for his family.

934
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:20,150
And he's, um, I'm not going back.
That's an old school fucking guy,

935
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:26,360
John Wayne Shit right there. Um,
anyways. Oh, it's the holiday season.

936
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,070
Doobie Doobie. Do. Um,

937
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,940
I'm going to be on Jimmy Kimmel tonight
promoting the front runner movie

938
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:40,150
starring Hugh Jackman. It's
the, uh, the Gary had story, uh,

939
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,620
directed by Jason Reitman. I'm so
psyched to be in this movie. A truly is,

940
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:45,483
you know,

941
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,850
one of the great things I've been able
to be a part of as far as being in an

942
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:52,870
ensemble. Ah. Um, so
check that out tonight.

943
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,220
And uh, other than that, I got to go buy
a shirt to wear on Kimmel cause you know,

944
00:57:57,221 --> 00:58:01,140
God knows you can't wear the
same shirt on TV more than once.

945
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:05,770
Can't do that. You know, oh you fucking
assholes and make fun of me who have,

946
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:09,670
you know, 10 shirts that are in there,
you know, that ship your pitching staff,

947
00:58:09,671 --> 00:58:14,140
that's you rotation 10 fucking shirts yet,
show Biz.

948
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:16,180
You not allowed to do that.
You got to wear it once.

949
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,880
So what you do is I always try
to pick something that, you know,

950
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,270
it doesn't really stand out,
just sort of a bland fucking color.

951
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,070
You're getting any sort of designs on it.

952
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:27,580
The people that God sets the shirt
you wore and fucking camel. Yeah,

953
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:31,300
it is now wearing it again once I spoke
to throw it out, you waste four count.

954
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:37,540
Um, anyway, so I have to do that and
I'm also going to be, uh, you know,

955
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:41,860
I always make pumpkin bread
during, uh, between um,

956
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,290
what is it, Halloween and
thanksgiving. Thanksgiving,
I start busting out the pies.

957
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,970
I make my fucking stuffing.

958
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,760
I'm throwing down this year cause
I'm gonna be in town. I can't wait.

959
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,160
I'm very excited and,
uh,

960
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,010
I think my daughter is still one year
away from maybe going trick or treating.

961
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:02,830
I don't know. I'll ask the AF. I'll have
to ask my wife about that. But that's it.

962
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:05,320
Go Patriots.
Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton.

963
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,300
Mock mock has the Boston red sox and um,

964
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:15,520
yeah, that's it. What a great fucking
week for me is a sports fan. All right.

965
00:59:15,521 --> 00:59:17,800
And I'm not rubbing it in either.
All right.

966
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,190
I hope the Dodgers win it again
next year. If we don't, how's that?

967
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:26,690
That's the nicest thing I
could say. All right. Okay.

968
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,050
That's it. Go fuck yourselves.
Enjoy the next couple of days.

969
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:34,700
Please watch Paul Versey special,
uh, November 3rd on comedy central.

I'm so proud of him. He's got a great,

971
