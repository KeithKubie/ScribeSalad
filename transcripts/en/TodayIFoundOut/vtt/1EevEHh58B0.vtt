00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.550
Where the Looney Tune’s “ACME” Corporation
Name Came From

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.430
For those of you who didn’t spend your childhood
with your eyes glued to the TV screen watching

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.400
Saturday morning cartoons, “ACME” is the
name of the fictional company that appeared

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.010
in almost every Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote
cartoon.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.220
This company supplied Wile E. Coyote with
a never-ending range of ridiculous products

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.070
that would inevitably fail, generally with
hilarious consequences.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.910
So where did this name come from?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.350
Some people think that ACME is an acronym
for “A Company that Makes Everything”.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.939
But this is little more than a happy coincidence
given that “ACME” had been being used

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.570
in Hollywood since as early as 1920 in Buster
Keaton’s movie, Neighbors, and by corporations

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.580
before that, and acronyms weren’t even a
thing humans did at this point in time.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.100
In fact, previous to the mid-20th century,
while abbreviations were prevalent in text,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.100
pronouncing them as words was not something
people typically did, being something of a

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.690
very modern phenomenon.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.720
According to linguist David Wilton, “There
is only one known pre-twentieth-century [English]

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.970
word with an acronymic origin and it was in
vogue for only a short time in 1886.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.310
The word is “colinderies” or “colinda”,
an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.630
held in London in that year.”

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.409
No surprise then that the word “acronym”
didn’t pop up until 1943.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.490
So if that’s not where the name came from,
what is?

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.280
Without a doubt, the company name is used
ironically in the Looney Tunes cartoons.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.770
“ACME” comes from the Greek, meaning “peak”
/ “zenith” / “prime”, so in the case

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.369
of the company, essentially meaning “best”,
when in fact the products offered by the corporation

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.549
in the show are invariably prone to disaster,
something which ACME even acknowledges through

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.020
its slogan – “Quality is our #1 dream”.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.110
In the 1920s alphabetized phone books – like
the Yellow Pages – were growing in popularity,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.119
resulting in businesses re-branding under
a different name in order to get to the top

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.789
of the list and get seen by more people.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.500
ACME was a hugely popular choice for a name
at the time, since the letters AC are close

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.029
to the beginning of the alphabet and the definition
of the word suggests superiority.

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:05.009
In more modern times, Amazon.com did this
same type of thing when rebranding from “Cadabra”

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.360
to “amazon”, attempting to be put closer
to the top of alphabetical online browsing

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.509
indexes.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.330
In any event, Chuck Jones – writer, director,
and animator who worked on Merrie Melodies

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.810
and, of course, Looney Tunes cartoons for
over 3 decades – touched upon the name’s

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.970
more specific origin in an interview carried
out for the 2009 film Chuck Jones: Memories

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.629
of Childhood, in which he explained:
“Since we had to search out our own entertainment,

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.750
we devised our own fairy stories.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.959
If you wanted a bow and arrow, you got a stick.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.659
If you wanted to conduct an orchestra, you
got a stick.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.980
If you wanted a duel, you used a stick.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.250
You couldn’t go and buy one.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.280
That’s where the term ACME came from.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.959
Whenever we played a game where we had a grocery
store or something, we called it the ACME

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:47.959
Corporation.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:48.959
Why?

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.290
Because in the yellow pages if you looked,
say, under drugstores, you’d find the first

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.730
one would be Acme Drugs.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.730
Why?

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.010
Because “AC” was about as high as you
could go.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.830
It means the best, the superlative.”

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.010
So although the fictional company may boast
an interesting line of products – including

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.939
the ACME Building Disintegrator and ACME Ultimatum
Dispatcher – the origin of its name isn’t

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.220
quite as exciting.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.549
It was simply a commonly used name at the
time, inferring a company was the best, which

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.690
the guys at Looney Tunes adopted and used
with their tongues firmly planted in their

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.690
cheeks.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.930
Bonus Facts
• The fastest recorded speed for an actual

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.269
“Greater Roadrunner” bird is 26 mph (42
kp/h).

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.269
The kicker?

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.269
Coyotes have a top speed of over 40 mph (64
km/h).

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:41.620
• In the cartoon, ACME is eventually revealed
as being “A Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Roadrunner

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.439
Corporation”, which of course indicates
that Road Runner was in control of the company’s

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:46.439
products.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.969
His position would then allow him to pass
on all the faulty or untested goods to Wile.

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:54.469
E. Coyote, thereby sabotaging his plan before
it even was put into action
