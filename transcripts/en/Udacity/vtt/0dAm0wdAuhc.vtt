00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now it's time for us to get some practice with an application of the Forward Euler Method.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This time, we define a function for you called trajectory --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that's going to determine the trajectory of a particle.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We've already set the step size, the acceleration to the gravity and the initial speed of the particle.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Inside the definition, we've created an array called angles that's starts out at 20

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and increases with increments of 10 up to 70.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This creates a set of angles at which the particle can take off.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Over here, we see an example of what a ballistic trajectory of a particle

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
with a given initial angle might look like.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The next step is to create variables for position and velocity.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Each of these is an array where the number of rows equals the number of steps

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that are going to be taken plus 1 and 2 columns.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Your job is to find equations for the position and velocity of a particle that show how

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
changing the initial take off angle of the particle changes its trajectory.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Fill in your code here and good luck.
