00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.170
Times feel rough - with natural disasters,
major political conflicts and uncertainty

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.500
about the future.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.380
But as the memes roll in about it being a
horrible time to be alive, you might be surprised

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.570
to see your life now vs what it would have
been in the past.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.720
Much of history actually involves humans succumbing
to malnutrition and hunger.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.730
In Ancient Egypt, a severe drought could hit
and 5-10% of the entire population would die.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.800
Of course, things aren’t perfect today with
11% of even France suffering from food insecurity

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.300
- which means their diet is limited due to
socio-economic status and they eat less nutritious

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.860
foods and excess amounts of carbohydrates
and salt - but compare this to the years of

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.899
1692-1694 when 15% of France’s population
literally died because food was simply too

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:45.899
expensive.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.190
Today, while millions do suffer from malnutrition,
advancements in technology, government agencies

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.539
and NGOs help to ensure that most are not
dying.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.469
In fact, for the first time in human history,
more people are overweight than suffering

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:00.790
from malnutrition.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.170
As homo sapiens began to live in cities, there
was a massive increase in disease.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.170
In the 1330’s a horrifying outbreak of what
they believed were demons, bad air or angry

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.590
gods killed 75-200 million people.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.900
We now realize it was the flea dwelling bacterium
Yersinia Pestis, known historically as the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.930
black plague.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.010
But at the time, people really had no idea
what was killing them.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.010
In 1520 a spanish flotilla heading to Mexico
had an individual on it, carrying an early

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.189
case of smallpox virus.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.299
Within 2 months, the disease had killed 1/3rd
of Mexico’ population.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.780
In the years following, there were so many
infectious disease outbreaks in Mexico, that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.840
the population fell from 22 million to 2 million
over the course of only 60 years.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.630
People were constantly dying of diseases and
nobody knew how to cure them.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.240
Remedies at the time included praying, having
cold baths, or rubbing black beetles on sores.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.570
Even as recently as 1918, the Spanish Flu
spread internationally and within a few months

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.909
1/3rd of the entire world population was infected,
and 3-5% of the world died.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.520
Today, most of our flu worries are based around
the pain of needles.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.150
Modern medicine saves millions of lives.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.650
The smallpox vaccine fully eradicated the
disease from our planet.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.640
When diseases like SARS or Ebola appear and
the world prepares for a severe public health

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.349
emergency, far fewer people die due to international
organization, modern technology and continued

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.080
advancements in medicine.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.349
When Europe colonized the Americas, an estimated
100 million people died, though pre-colonization

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.569
populations of indigenous people is not well
documented making some estimates millions

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.569
higher.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.891
As many as 85 million people died in WWII
and in ancient agricultural societies, human

00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:49.989
violence caused 15% of all deaths.

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.310
Today, human violence accounts for around
1% of deaths.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.180
In 2012, only 120,000 died in war, whereas
1.5 million died of diabetes.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.670
For the first time in human history when most
people consider the future, they don’t assume

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.670
war.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.620
As we look to this year, while there is still
starvation, disease, war and inequalities,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.459
it is drastically better than most of human
history.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.180
But we must continue to be critical of our
government’s, challenge companies and rethink

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.790
the way human society is structured in order
to continue progress.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.430
By acknowledging the successful human efforts
in medical research, economic reform, peace

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.960
initiatives and governmental support to decrease
starvation, disease and violence, we can find

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.730
hope for the future.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.150
Hope is a valuable notion to focus on as we
look for a way to be content in a world that,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.030
at times, can seem so overwhelmingly bad.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.940
