00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.390
We're told to graph this
system of equations and

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.040
identify the number of solutions
that it has.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.650
And they have the system
of equations here.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.480
So they want us to graph each of
these equations and think a

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.260
little bit about
the solutions.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.560
So the first equation here--
I'll rewrite it, so I'll graph

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.790
it in the same color
that I write it.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.000
This first equation's already in
slope-intercept form, y is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.930
equal to 3x plus 1.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.120
We see that the slope, or m, is
equal to 3, and we see that

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.720
the y-intercept here
is equal to 1.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.180
So let me be clear, that
is also the slope.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.590
I just called it m because a lot
of times people say y is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.850
equal to mx plus b.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.950
So we can graph it.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.740
We can look at its y-intercept,
the point 0, 1

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.000
must be on this graph.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.620
So that's the point
0, 1 right there.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.640
This is the y-axis, that
is the x-axis.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.380
And the slope is 3.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.170
That means if we move 1 in the
positive x-direction, we're

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.785
going to move up 3 in the
positive y-direction.

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:03.310
So we move 1 in the x-direction,
we move up 3.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.200
If we moved 2 in the
x-direction, we

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.450
would move up 6.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.920
Just like that.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.640
Because 6 over 2 is still 3.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.200
Likewise, if we moved down 1, if
we went negative 1 in x, we

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.100
would go negative 3 in y.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.700
So negative 1, negative 3.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.760
Because negative 3 divided
by negative 1 is still 3.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.950
If we went negative 2 in x, we
would go negative 6-- 1, 2, 3,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.770
4, 5, 6 in y.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.140
So these are all points along
the line, and I can connect

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.920
the dots now.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.180
So let me do that.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.520
So let me connect the dots
as best as I can.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.030
This should be a line,
not a curve.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.050
My hand isn't 100% steady, but I
think you get-- let me do it

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.960
a little bit better than that.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.160
I think I can do a better
job than that.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.950
Let me draw-- that's
even worse.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.350
All right.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.565
Last attempt.

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:56.130
That's throwing me off.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.645
So last attempt right here.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.450
There you go.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.000
So that's that first line
right there. y is

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.480
equal to 3x plus 1.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.650
So let me do the
second one now.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.630
So it's written in standard form
right now, 2y plus 4 is

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.560
equal to 6x.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.110
We want to get this in
slope-intercept form, y is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.950
equal to mx plus b.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.070
So a good place to start could
be to subtract this 4 from

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.630
both sides.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.710
So it goes on the other side.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.350
So let's subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.110
The left-hand side, we're left
with just a 2y, and then the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.310
right-hand side becomes
6x minus 4.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.780
So 2y is equal to 6x minus 4.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.800
And then to get everything in
terms to solve for y, we just

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.760
have to divide everything
by 2.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.980
So let's divide everything
by 2, and we get y is

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.830
equal to 3x minus 2.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.290
So that's the second equation
in slope-intercept form.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.350
So same drill here.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.650
The y-intercept is negative 2.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.100
So we go-- that's negative 1,
negative 2 right there, and

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.360
its slope is 3.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.450
And notice its slope is the
same as the other line.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.530
So it's going to have the
same inclination.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.970
If we move 1 in the x-direction,
we move up 3 in

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.450
the y-direction.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.610
1, up 3.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.060
Just like that.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.630
If we go back 1 in
x, we go down 3.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.240
Back 1 in x, we go down 3.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.660
Just like that.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.980
So if we connect the dots
here, it'll look

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.940
something like this.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.820
I'll do my best to draw
a straight line.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.530
So the second graph, 2y plus
4 equals 6, we put it into

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.660
slope-intercept form
and we graphed it.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.060
Now, the whole point of this
question was to identify the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.820
number of solutions that
it has, the system.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.660
A solution to a system of
equations is an x and y value

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.790
that satisfy both of
these equations.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.860
Now, if there were such an x
and y value that satisfied

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.630
both of these equations, then
that x and y value would have

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.820
to lie on both of
these graphs.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.800
Because this blue line is all of
the pairs of x and y's that

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.690
satisfy the first equation.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.050
The red line is all of the
pairs of x's and y's that

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.480
satisfy the second equation.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.390
So if something's going to
satisfy both, it's got to be

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.810
on both lines.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.610
When you look here, are
there any points

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.710
that are on both lines?

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.130
Well, no.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.560
These two lines never
intersect.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.210
A point of intersection is a
point that is common to both

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.260
of these lines.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.050
No, they don't intersect.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.300
No intersection.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.700
So there is not a solution to
this system of equations.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.520
There is no solution.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.320
We know that because these two
lines don't intersect.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.790
And you didn't even
have to graph it.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.370
The kind of giveaway was that
these are two different lines.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.230
They have different
y-intercepts, but their slopes

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.410
are identical.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.650
So if you have two different
y-intercepts and your slopes

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.140
are identical, then you have two
different lines that will

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.140
never intersect.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.860
And if they represent a system,
or if they're the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.790
graphs of a system of
equations, that

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.880
system has no solution.
