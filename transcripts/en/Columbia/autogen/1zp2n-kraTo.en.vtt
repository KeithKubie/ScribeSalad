organizing together to respond to these

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640
organizing together to respond to these
 

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.630
organizing together to respond to these
hazards so we thought that through the

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640
hazards so we thought that through the
 

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.970

process of collecting narratives there

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:05.980
process of collecting narratives there
 

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.829

could be more to dialogue between these

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839
could be more to dialogue between these
 

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.320
could be more to dialogue between these
three communities and at first the

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:10.330
three communities and at first the
 

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.360
three communities and at first the
project's design was what we call

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:12.370
project's design was what we call
 

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.519

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:17.790
community-based oral history project
which means that community members would

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:17.800
which means that community members would
 

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.210
which means that community members would
interview other community members and

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220
interview other community members and
 

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.920
interview other community members and
ideally this would happen across the

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:22.930
ideally this would happen across the
 

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.360
ideally this would happen across the
boundaries between the three

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.370
boundaries between the three
 

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.410

may be interested in this gray area so I

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:53.620
may be interested in this gray area so I
 

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.420
may be interested in this gray area so I
thought we really don't want to

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:56.430

it was a problem very late in the game
 

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:12.660
it was a problem very late in the game
so one solution is to take caree early

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:12.670
so one solution is to take caree early
 

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:15.690
so one solution is to take caree early
about this um but I felt I couldn't get

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:15.700
about this um but I felt I couldn't get
 

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.430
about this um but I felt I couldn't get
anyone interested in the problem that's

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440
anyone interested in the problem that's
 

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.090
anyone interested in the problem that's
another problem so I was asking people

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:21.100
another problem so I was asking people
 

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:27.500
another problem so I was asking people
about it and so this brought up this

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:27.510
about it and so this brought up this
 

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.970
about it and so this brought up this
interesting thing that I've seen in oral

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:29.980
interesting thing that I've seen in oral
 

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.770
interesting thing that I've seen in oral
history as a field and I definitely see

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:31.780
history as a field and I definitely see
 

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.690
history as a field and I definitely see
in academia which is this double

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:33.700
in academia which is this double
 

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.580
in academia which is this double
standard of what we're doing that were

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:35.590
standard of what we're doing that were
 

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.380
standard of what we're doing that were
very effective but we're also harmless

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:37.390
very effective but we're also harmless
 

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.840
very effective but we're also harmless
and it doesn't really make sense it's

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:39.850
and it doesn't really make sense it's
 

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.750
and it doesn't really make sense it's
kind of so I found these ideas to be

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760
kind of so I found these ideas to be
 

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.400
kind of so I found these ideas to be
contradictory it was like a statement

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:44.410
contradictory it was like a statement
 

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:45.840
contradictory it was like a statement
about our own disbelief that these would

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:45.850
about our own disbelief that these would
 

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:48.720
about our own disbelief that these would
ever actually reach a wide audience or

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:48.730
ever actually reach a wide audience or
 

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.730
ever actually reach a wide audience or
that we would have an impact so I think

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:50.740
that we would have an impact so I think
 

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.910
that we would have an impact so I think
we can't be sloppy and default to a

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920
we can't be sloppy and default to a
 

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.170
we can't be sloppy and default to a
defensive irrelevance or security and so

00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:58.180
defensive irrelevance or security and so
 

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.460
defensive irrelevance or security and so
I have some thought to make it to the

00:42:59.460 --> 00:42:59.470
I have some thought to make it to the
 

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:05.310
I have some thought to make it to the
solution part lastly Public Health

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:05.320
solution part lastly Public Health
 

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.210

project took so much longer than she
 

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:22.260

later the project would have gone off
with its original design but if you have

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:48.460

intimidating and so I think the training
 

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.370
intimidating and so I think the training
