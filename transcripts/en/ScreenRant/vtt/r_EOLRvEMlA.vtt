00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.590
Most of us have a favorite actor, and a lot
of the time it means we’re more likely to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.290
see a movie if they’re in it.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.690
For better or worse.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.880
Some fans even go as far as binge-watching
their favorite performers stuff back to back

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.610
thanks to the level of access streaming services
provide.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.390
Often, someone’s entire body of work can
be found in the one place.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.009
But a few hours in to your marathon, you might
start to notice some habits you can’t unsee.

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.350
These are 10 Famous Actors Who Do The Same
Thing In Every Movie.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.149
Harrison Ford, always pointing
It’s impolite to point, so maybe that’s

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.570
why Harrison Ford likes it.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.230
The actor’s low tolerance for stupidity
has earned him a reputation as being “difficult”.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.989
Even though most people agree that responding
to the same shallow questions day in and day

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.539
out would lend itself to boredom.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.870
Plus, a little attitude keeps things interesting.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.999
Ford seems to be attracted to characters with
the same outlook.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.929
The proof is in his most iconic roles: Indiana
Jones and Han Solo.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.409
But when fans took a closer look at the actor’s
resume another theme emerged: pointing.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.909
Conan O’Brien even brought it up when Ford
swung by for an interview in 2013, and proved

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.070
it with a montage.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.110
Sean Bean, always dying
Even if you don't know Sean Bean by name,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.070
you probably recognize him as “that actor
who always dies.”

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.620
He’s also an incredibly talented performer.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.320
But from Goldeneye to Game of Thrones, the
guy’s characters always seem destined for

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.320
death.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.360
In fact, he’s died so many times, that fans
have even made entire montages dedicated to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.360
it.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.630
And with his feet planted in both television
and film, the actor has double the opportunity

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.670
to die compared to his counterparts.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.210
While the math might not be totally sound
on that last point, the fact remains that

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:51.040
Bean’s characters take journeys that (almost
always) end in death.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.680
Samuel L. Jackson, always yelling
Samuel L. Jackson does not have an indoor

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.140
voice, so don’t give him any lines he can’t
shout.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.660
The actor has become famous for his trademark
yelling in all his movies.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.420
While most of us need a reason to raise our
voices, his reason happens to be that he’s

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.420
Samuel L. Jackson.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.590
Apparently the film’s genre doesn’t really
matter either, as he’s screamed his way

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.230
through kids movies, Tarantino flicks, and
even some recent Marvel fare.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.760
His outbursts can range from joyful to antagonistic.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.730
They’re downright intimidating, but we wouldn’t
want it any other way.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.480
Because ultimately, all the yelling is kind
of endearing.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.230
Michelle Rodriguez, always a badass
Hollywood has struggled with gender stereotyping

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.520
since it’s inception.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.980
And depending on what side of the fence you’re
on, they’ve either come a long way or have

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.980
a long way to go.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.049
There may be more ladies on screen now than
in decades past, but a common argument emerging

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.379
is that their characters are derogatory, one-dimensional,
and sometimes both.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.519
When Michelle Rodriguez bucked trends in 2000’s
Girlfight, the actress found herself on a

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.739
tough-girl trajectory.

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.629
Looking over her 16 year career since, not
much has changed except the names of the characters.

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.920
Rodriguez is never not a badass.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.489
Jack Nicholson, always with the eyebrows
All of the performers on this list have huge

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.640
fanbases, but none of them have been around
along as Jack Nicholson’s.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.239
Involved with the business since the late
fifties, the actor has an incredibly diverse

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.180
resume and has been working steadily since
the beginning.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.879
So have his eyebrows.

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.310
The actor may switch roles constantly but
those brows don’t lie.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.350
Nicholson uses that to his advantage.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.599
He’s taken home a handful of Oscars and
has been nominated in every decade since he

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.599
started working.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.319
It’s worth noting that the actor shares
this honor with Michael Caine.. a man who

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.700
also has excellent eyebrows.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.300
Coincidence?

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.439
Brad Pitt, always eating
Let’s face it, a lot of us look disgusting

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.919
when we eat, and no amount of etiquette training
is going to change that.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.709
Even the beautiful people struggle to stay
glamorous at meal time, but Brad Pitt is a

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.670
well-documented exception.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.510
Watch carefully and you’ll notice that the
actor eats in almost every single movie he

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.510
stars in.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.359
All kinds of food, too; twinkies, ice cream,
steak, nachos, and lots of chips.

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.059
If this is something you noticed before we
brought it up, good for you eagle-eyes!

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:03.110
But if it slipped past you until now, you
won’t be able to miss it the next time it

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.540
happens.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.809
Julia Roberts, always crying
Julia Roberts has done her fair share of tear-jerking,

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:13.049
heart-obliterating movies.

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.650
And has been Hollywood royalty since playing
Richard Gere’s escort in 1990’s Pretty

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.650
Woman.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.750
Since her resume is stacked with dramatic
flare, she’s done more on-screen crying

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.870
than most.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.370
And has won more than a couple of awards along
the way.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.110
With a ton of box office successes under her
belt, millions of people have seen Roberts

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.190
turn on the waterworks in the name of cinema.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.030
They seem to like it, too.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.729
Because she shows no signs of stopping.

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.260
Tom Cruise, always running
Tom Cruise likes to run.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.889
And while he’s not on the same level as
people who jog at 5 am during the Canadian

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.870
winter, he’s still pretty dedicated.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.530
Just watch literally any movie he’s ever
done and you’ll see him run his heart out

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.020
at some point.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.670
He’s run from aliens, explosions, and dust
storms.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.180
He’s run through time and traffic.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.819
He doesn’t stop for anything, and no obstacles
seem to be of any consequence.

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.510
The actor keeps in shape and does a lot of
his own stunt work.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:16.050
Whereas the only marathons we’ve been doing
lately are of the Netflix variety.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.710
Ryan Reynolds, always sarcastic
Some people are of the mindset that sarcasm

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.349
is the lowest form of comedy, but Ryan Reynolds
is living proof of the opposite.

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.479
The actor has a penchant for humorous roles,
and cruises through complicated dialogue with

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:30.479
ease.

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.139
He was drawn to the role of Deadpool, and
the fusion of his comedic timing with the

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.090
script writing turned out to be a match made
in cinematic heaven.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.090
Reynolds’ super-sarcasm doesn’t end there
though, and is almost always central to whatever

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.650
character he plays.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.970
But hey, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix
it.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.330
We wouldn’t change a thing.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.850
Nicolas Cage, always throwing tantrums
Okay let’s be real: nobody really understands

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.540
what’s going on with Nicolas Cage’s movie
choices as of late.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.750
Sure, he may have been nominated for five
Razzies in the worst actor category, but he’s

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.750
never actually won any of them.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.020
He does have an Oscar from 1995 though.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.300
It seems that critics have agreed to disagree
when it comes to Cage.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.639
But everyone acknowledges that the man throws
one hell of a tantrum.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.720
He must know it too, because it happens in
nearly every movie he makes.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.970
Most of our personal favorites happen during
2006’s The Wicker Man, but everyone’s

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.000
got their preference.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.289
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.350
Did we miss any other actors who do the same
thing in every movie?

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.950
