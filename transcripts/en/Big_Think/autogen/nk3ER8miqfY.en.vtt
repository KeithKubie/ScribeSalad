what the internet was able to do with
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.800
what the internet was able to do with
information and in doing that it gives

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
information and in doing that it gives
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.250
information and in doing that it gives
any person in the world the ability to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
any person in the world the ability to
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.810

we have from inception on blockchain is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
we have from inception on blockchain is
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.369
we have from inception on blockchain is
called the blockchain because it's

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
called the blockchain because it's
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.250
called the blockchain because it's
literally just that it is a series of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
literally just that it is a series of
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010

complex math problems that are chained
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.900
complex math problems that are chained
together and the way that bitcoin is

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910
together and the way that bitcoin is
 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.420
together and the way that bitcoin is
created is anytime one of these blocks

like imagine you just have a bunch of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
like imagine you just have a bunch of
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.500
like imagine you just have a bunch of
sheets of paper and anytime one of the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510
sheets of paper and anytime one of the
 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.680
sheets of paper and anytime one of the
sheets of paper gets full a bunch of

supercomputers from all around the world

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
supercomputers from all around the world
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.600
supercomputers from all around the world
are all trying to solve these insanely

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
are all trying to solve these insanely
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.750
are all trying to solve these insanely
complex math problems that get

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760
complex math problems that get
 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.550
complex math problems that get
exponentially more difficult over time

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
exponentially more difficult over time
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.680
exponentially more difficult over time
and to give you perspective it's

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690
and to give you perspective it's
 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.440
and to give you perspective it's
literally easier to find one grain of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
literally easier to find one grain of
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.380
literally easier to find one grain of
sand in the entire universe than it is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
sand in the entire universe than it is

for one of these computers to solve a

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940
for one of these computers to solve a
 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.150
for one of these computers to solve a
math problem created by the Bitcoin

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160
math problem created by the Bitcoin
 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.240
math problem created by the Bitcoin
blockchain and because these are so

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
blockchain and because these are so
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.480
blockchain and because these are so
complex and because any time one of

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
complex and because any time one of
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.370
complex and because any time one of
these little computers tries to solve

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
these little computers tries to solve
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100
these little computers tries to solve
one of these problems they only have a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
one of these problems they only have a
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.530
one of these problems they only have a
50/50 chance of getting it right no

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
50/50 chance of getting it right no
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.810
50/50 chance of getting it right no
matter how many times they try and solve

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
matter how many times they try and solve
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.250
matter how many times they try and solve
it and so Bitcoin right now is actually

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260
it and so Bitcoin right now is actually
 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.900
it and so Bitcoin right now is actually
the world's largest supercomputer it has

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910
the world's largest supercomputer it has
 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.760
the world's largest supercomputer it has
500 times the computing power of Google

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770
500 times the computing power of Google
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.339
500 times the computing power of Google
just to create bitcoins

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349
just to create bitcoins
 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.770
just to create bitcoins
now anytime one of these computers

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780
now anytime one of these computers
 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.979
now anytime one of these computers
solves a math problem they get Bitcoin

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989
solves a math problem they get Bitcoin
 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.530
solves a math problem they get Bitcoin
they create the block cement it and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540
they create the block cement it and
 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.379
they create the block cement it and
these blocks are all chained together in

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:26.389
these blocks are all chained together in
 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.910
these blocks are all chained together in
one long ring and that has a Genesis

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920
one long ring and that has a Genesis
 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.569
one long ring and that has a Genesis
block and is essentially infinite from

block and is essentially infinite from
 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.030
block and is essentially infinite from
the moment the first block on the

the moment the first block on the
 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.729
the moment the first block on the
blockchain was created and every

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739
blockchain was created and every
 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.440
blockchain was created and every

and I would actually say that Bitcoin is

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669
and I would actually say that Bitcoin is
 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.589
and I would actually say that Bitcoin is
very similar to Burning Man in the way

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599
very similar to Burning Man in the way
 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.360
very similar to Burning Man in the way
that it's created and the way that it's

going to grow and the way that it's
 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.039
going to grow and the way that it's
going to evolve because what is Burning

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049
going to evolve because what is Burning
