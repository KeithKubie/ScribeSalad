I think they will continue whether

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
I think they will continue whether
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.270
I think they will continue whether
there's there are bumps on the road

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
there's there are bumps on the road
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.889
there's there are bumps on the road
there will always be bumps on the road

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
there will always be bumps on the road
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.369
there will always be bumps on the road
when when one of the members is is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
when when one of the members is is
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.720
when when one of the members is is
taking an action that does not have

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
taking an action that does not have
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.350
taking an action that does not have
consensus and obviously that's a bump on

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
consensus and obviously that's a bump on
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.979
consensus and obviously that's a bump on
the road but fundamentally I don't see

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989
the road but fundamentally I don't see
 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.869
the road but fundamentally I don't see
there have been many occasions where the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
there have been many occasions where the
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.900
there have been many occasions where the
transatlantic eight lines could have

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910
transatlantic eight lines could have
 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.500
transatlantic eight lines could have
collapsed and it has not so I don't see

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
collapsed and it has not so I don't see
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.200
collapsed and it has not so I don't see
I don't see that's happening at all

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210
 
 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 
well it's always a question of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350
well it's always a question of
 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.530
well it's always a question of
understanding the world as it is and you

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540
understanding the world as it is and you
 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.100
understanding the world as it is and you
know being global citizens I mean you

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110
know being global citizens I mean you
 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.550
know being global citizens I mean you
know the people have a hard time dealing

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560
know the people have a hard time dealing
 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.050
know the people have a hard time dealing
with the fact that they are part of a

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060
with the fact that they are part of a
 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.450
with the fact that they are part of a
nation with a part of the world as well

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460
nation with a part of the world as well
 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.690
nation with a part of the world as well
and that's what I call / 0 volts it is

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700
and that's what I call / 0 volts it is
 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.040
and that's what I call / 0 volts it is
it so the question is can you be a

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050
it so the question is can you be a
 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.710
it so the question is can you be a
global citizen and still a country

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720
global citizen and still a country
 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.710
global citizen and still a country
citizen and whether you know there's a

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720
citizen and whether you know there's a
 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.740
citizen and whether you know there's a
conflict between those two there can be

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750
conflict between those two there can be
 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.060
conflict between those two there can be
at times I you know hopefully

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070
at times I you know hopefully
 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.940
at times I you know hopefully
progressively this will change but this

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950
progressively this will change but this
 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.000
progressively this will change but this
is a major dilemma because if we go

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010
is a major dilemma because if we go
 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.810
is a major dilemma because if we go
towards a more of a global governance

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820
towards a more of a global governance
 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.020
towards a more of a global governance
model the role of nations will diminish

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030
model the role of nations will diminish
 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.450
model the role of nations will diminish
as we see today in the European Union

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460
as we see today in the European Union
 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.469
as we see today in the European Union
for example which progressively

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479
for example which progressively
 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.139
for example which progressively
authority and autonomy is lost and

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149
authority and autonomy is lost and
 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.880
authority and autonomy is lost and
transferred to a to a larger larger

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890
transferred to a to a larger larger
 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.090
transferred to a to a larger larger
group of states which I think prefigures

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100
group of states which I think prefigures
 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.210
group of states which I think prefigures
the World of Tomorrow I think at some

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220
the World of Tomorrow I think at some
 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.830
the World of Tomorrow I think at some
point we'll have a global government I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840
point we'll have a global government I
 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.930
point we'll have a global government I
won't see it but maybe you will but you

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940
won't see it but maybe you will but you
 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.220
won't see it but maybe you will but you
know there are some countries that are

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230
know there are some countries that are
 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.110
know there are some countries that are
so nationalistic that they have a very

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120
so nationalistic that they have a very
 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.890
so nationalistic that they have a very
hard time to deal with that that in the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900
hard time to deal with that that in the
 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:42.670
hard time to deal with that that in the
end I think this trend is inevitable

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680
 
 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.339
 
that rice broken by country I think

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349
that rice broken by country I think
 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.460
that rice broken by country I think
