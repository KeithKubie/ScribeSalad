WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.550
We starting today,
uh,
on,
um,
how many ways,
uh,

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.400
for whom the bell tolls.
And,
um,
as is frequently the case,

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.240
the title comes from a very well known classic in this case,

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.160
John Donne's home.
Um,

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.310
which essentially included in the text of phoned about hose.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.510
So you guys can just go on and read it on your own.

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.340
But I just thought that we'll talk about it together a little bit.
Um,

8
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.980
the very famous phrase from a very famous poem,

9
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.010
no man is an island and time of itself.

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.930
Each case appears of the continent a part of the main,

11
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.740
if a clod be washed away by the sea,

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.960
Europe is the last,

13
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.740
each man's death diminish me from involved in manly,

14
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.870
therefore send not for whom the bell tolls,
it tolls for thee.

15
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.940
Um,
so a number of issues come up in this poem,

16
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:06.330
justly famous poem,
um,
that we're not,

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.600
even though we have separate bodies,
um,

18
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.010
Dan's argument and in fact,
throughout his entire poetic Corpus,
um,

19
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.430
is that our separate bodies,
um,
uh,

20
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.460
in some sense and kind of optical illusion and also experiential illusion as

21
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:24.900
well.
We feel that we're just one unit,

22
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.100
but we actually tied in so many different ways to other people.

23
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.480
So the death of other people,
um,

24
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.550
with diminish me in the sense that those ties will be cut when those people die.

25
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.280
But also this,
uh,
uh,
more disturbing sense that uh,

26
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.460
the manner of death of other people is in some sense also a kind of a prelude

27
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.360
and analogy and a suggestion of the way that we would die.

28
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.990
Um,
so the bell is tolling for someone else right now,

29
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:05.260
but sooner or later it's going to toll for myself,

30
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:08.520
for you and me.
Um,
so it's,
um,

31
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.040
dev is central is absolutely central with is not the two for him develop those.

32
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.390
It is not just a general argument about importance of interconnections is really

33
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:22.610
about how the interconnections and death and no other,
uh,

34
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.680
whereby Hemingway's so centrally and meditating on the phenomenon of dying and

35
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.840
what it means to die a good death.
So we'll come back to this.
Um,
but today we,

36
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.450
that wouldn't be the focus today.
Um,

37
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.470
and instead today we'll be talking mostly about the Spanish civil war,

38
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:43.840
which is a very important context for this novel.
Um,

39
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.880
and it's very important to get some historical facts under our belts.

40
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.400
So basically the two sides of the Spanish civil war,

41
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.770
other Republicans and the national risk,
um,

42
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.570
the Republican's are sometimes referred to as the loyalists.

43
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.600
And this phrase is sometimes because it suggests that maybe the loyalists are on

44
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.780
the right,
but this is actually not the case.
The Republicans,
uh,
on the whole,

45
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.550
on the left,
um,

46
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.350
but they are loyal to the legitimately elected government.

47
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.040
Um,
the Spanish republic,
uh,
had a,

48
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.110
had an elected government,
um,
and so the loyalists were loyal to that.

49
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:24.940
They were protecting the Spanish republic.

50
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.750
And the reason we know that they are on the left is that,
uh,

51
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.890
they're back my Mexico,

52
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.820
which is understand the vogue given the Spanish connection.
Um,

53
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.490
but they were also backed by the Soviet Union,

54
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:39.550
so that lots of references to Russians in this novel,

55
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.740
from Russian planes to Russian cigarettes to the restrooms at the hotel,

56
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:48.820
gay lots.
So lots and lots of Russians.
The Russian general,
um,

57
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.470
is the opening pages of the novel.
So,
um,
the Soviet Union

58
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.410
was a central presence,
um,
in his novel.
Uh,
but more than that,

59
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.880
the reason that the Spanish civil war has gone down in history is such an

60
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.190
important war,
um,

61
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.380
is that was supported by 30,000 international volunteers making up the

62
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:15.430
international brigades,
including people from Poland,

63
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.920
France,
England,
and loss of volunteers from the United States.

64
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:24.030
So the United States volunteers,
we call it Abraham,

65
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.490
Abraham Lincoln Brigade.
Um,
and then,

66
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:32.200
so all this is on the republican side,
on the side of the Spanish republic.
Um,

67
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.520
and then opposing that,
fighting that and eventually,
um,

68
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.380
triumph and prevailing over them,
uh,
would be the nationalist.
Um,

69
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.610
in this novel,

70
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.880
Hemingway does not refer to the nationalists as the national list would never

71
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.790
comes up.
He refers to them as fast as,
um,

72
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.160
and the,

73
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.910
the world sort of pejorative rang now that it seems as if he's condemning them

74
00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:59.990
ahead of time.
But actually,
um,

75
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.060
in the 1930s fascist was just neutral.
Would,
that was the party,

76
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:06.310
the fascist party.
So,
um,

77
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.750
even though now historians were referred to that size,
the nationalist side,

78
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.970
um,
in the,

79
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.370
in my lectures have been referring to them as fast as just because that's the

80
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:17.890
word the Hemingway uses.
Um,

81
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.840
and the fascists were backed by Germany and Italy.
Um,

82
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.880
so we see lots of German planes as well,
Italian lanes as well.
Um,

83
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.940
and the victory of the fascist let to the dictatorship of general Franco who

84
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:36.920
would go on to rule Spain for many years.
Um,

85
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.220
so we know the outcome of that wall and there's a very tragic outcome according

86
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:44.320
to many people.
Um,
the,

87
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.200
one of the great photographers of the war,
uh,

88
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.120
was Robert Kappa.
Um,

89
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.120
and fortunately many of his images are now available there in the public domain.

90
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.150
So this is Robert Cap photographing the Spanish civil war.

91
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.050
And this is the most iconic image,
um,

92
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.120
is 1936 the death of a loyalist Republican soldier.

93
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.720
Um,
and most of,
um,

94
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.780
campus pictures tend to be about the death of just one person.
Um,

95
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.430
very,
um,
kind of those visceral reaction to the death of that person.

96
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.530
Um,
and,
uh,

97
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.030
kind of blurry as well because that's probably how death we're feel when it

98
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:29.710
comes to us,
is now we don't have a very distinct sensation,
um,

99
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.770
of that condition when we're going through it.
Um,
at least that's,

100
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.500
I think that that's the rationale behind that,

101
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.920
other than also the fact that he was just on site taking the picture right
there.

102
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.380
Um,
here is,
um,

103
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.610
and other picture by Robert Kappa again now I think though the six to the very

104
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.770
beginning of the war,
um,
and these people were just college students.

105
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:54.530
This was university city Madrid.
Um,

106
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.560
most of the people who fought in the Spanish who are civil,

107
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.410
Ian's,
um,
they were just students.

108
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.570
Lots of women as like this is one known for their presence of women,
um,

109
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.050
fighting.
Uh,
so,
uh,
very in many ways,
um,

110
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.870
because these were just volunteers.
It wasn't a very high tech war.

111
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.380
And Roma Campo,
um,

112
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.350
had a lot of footage about it's very load hat war and basically this is the war

113
00:07:25.351 --> 00:07:28.340
that we see and for whom devout hose,
um,

114
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.160
just one or two people walking through the mountains,

115
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:35.730
just trudging along talking to small groups of people,
um,

116
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.730
completely kind of a local initiative,
um,

117
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.610
and not just in the cities but also in the countryside.

118
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.260
And we should remember that informed about how essentially behind the lines they

119
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:52.140
have behind the enemy lines.
So they keep,
you know,

120
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.420
one possibility would be to go back to the Spanish republic is to cross the

121
00:07:56.421 --> 00:07:59.750
enemy line and go back and join with the main forces.

122
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.100
But the people that we see for whom the bell tolls are with the gorillas who

123
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:08.570
would be in conditions such as these.
Um,
so this is the,
the,

124
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.620
the kind of the iconic images,
uh,

125
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.640
of just civilly and is fighting to defend the Spanish republic.
But,
um,

126
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:21.290
the reason that it was such a,
um,
big global event,

127
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.150
uh,
was that it was an actually an incredibly high tech war.

128
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:31.151
So it is a very important link between the first world war and the Second World

129
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:36.110
War.
And we know that the alliances in the Spanish civil war,

130
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.100
Germany and Italy,
we go onto become the axes power in the second world war.

131
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.760
So a very,
very important link between those two.

132
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:45.710
Great World Wars itself to spending.

133
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:50.090
So war was a world war or saw a skim and the number of international

134
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.720
participants.
Um,
so,
um,
Thames for important,

135
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.390
the Republicans actually use trackers,
um,

136
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.130
but the fascist had real tasks and we see them,

137
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.810
um,
the tans in full force.
Um,

138
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.320
and this is the follow image of the triumph of the tanks,
the fascist,

139
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.760
um,
entering Madrid March,

140
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.710
1939 and the next month the republic,

141
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:20.010
the Spanish republic surrender to the fascist.
Um,

142
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.630
so we know they all come very well.
I was basically a very short war,
um,

143
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.310
but because they were defending a lit,
an elected government,

144
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.780
um,
the international sentiment was on the side of the Spanish republic.

145
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.640
And this is a very famous painting by the Spanish,

146
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.330
uh,
paint we row.
But you know,
this,

147
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.550
that the language was actually not Spanish a day.
Let's Lisbon French,

148
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.240
uh,

149
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.220
because he couldn't stay in Spain anymore after the outbreak of the war,

150
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.400
so he had to flee to France.

151
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.860
And this was actually an exhibition in Paris,

152
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.380
so that's why the language was in French.

153
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.770
And friends will actually come up a little bit informed about hose,

154
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.700
um,
as well as friends.

155
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.600
So it's kind of an interesting side reference that we'll be talking about next

156
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:14.610
time.
But um,

157
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.690
lost and lots of images of international aid.
Um,
once again,

158
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:23.340
mostly very non military was looking people,
uh,
giving a two,

159
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.450
two to the Spanish public.
So the,
these were others in London,
um,

160
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.460
just giving medical supplies.
Um,
but,
um,

161
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.610
the Americans were there in full force and this is the link.

162
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.790
Abraham Lincoln Brigade,
um,
they serve,

163
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.090
they're the Ashley the best equipped,
uh,

164
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.850
volunteers.
Um,
there were pictures of volunteers from Poland and they actually,

165
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:52.851
they look kind of sad to begin with without even without the fighting.

166
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:53.790
Um,

167
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.510
but the Americans were very well equipped and they look very healthy and ready

168
00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:00.570
to fight.
Um,
and they were also very,
very young,

169
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:04.410
so it was very glamorous war in one sense because of all the young people who

170
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:09.150
were fighting.
So,
and women there is,
we can see.
So,
um,

171
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.280
the Lincoln Brigade and um,

172
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.460
in the beginning of the war there was lots of musical entertainment and it

173
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:16.150
seemed like fun.
Um,

174
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:21.230
initially it quickly stopped being fun as we can tell from the novel.

175
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.050
Um,
so Hemingway was there,
he was a walker as bonding.

176
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.100
It was covering the war with the Republicans here and this rare image of him,

177
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:35.100
Ashley,
um,
holding a gun,

178
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:37.890
he wasn't supposed to fight and I don't think he actually fought,

179
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:42.450
but just in case he needed to have someday.
Um,
so,
um,

180
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.800
it all loose suggests that one way to think about the novel,

181
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.290
uh,
would be the thing about,
um,
uh,

182
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:53.450
kind of divide in the novel or kind of structural principle.
Um,

183
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.530
in terms of voluntary association versus in Voluntary Association,

184
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.600
um,
voluntary association.
Obviously the international brigades,
um,

185
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.170
all these people did not have to fight in a war.

186
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:13.171
They are voluntarily put themselves in danger in order to,

187
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.790
um,
for political reason.
Um,

188
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:20.791
so very much voluntary association in this loss of glory and honor and pleasure.

189
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.810
Um,
from that PRI,
from that.
Um,

190
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.250
and then on the opposite side with the involuntary association,

191
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.670
we get labeled as foreigners.

192
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:38.671
The Americans get labeled this thorough knows Robert Jordan gets labeled as

193
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:44.050
foreigner is not even given the dignity of being an American is referred to as

194
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:47.940
the English,
the English.
Uh,
so they even,
they,
they,

195
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.430
they get this national identity wrong,
but it doesn't really matter.

196
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:53.970
He's just one of those foreigners.
So foreign,

197
00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:58.060
there's a kind of involuntary association,
a generic type.
Um,

198
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.820
and then the ultimate involuntary association would be the company of the debt.

199
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.660
It's a very large company and very few of us really want a ready to join them

200
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:13.370
right now,
but we're put in that company.
Um,
so,
uh,

201
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.310
going back to done obviously,
uh,
and,
but also going back to,

202
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.203
um,

203
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.950
pretty much all the texts that we've been talking about all semester.
So,

204
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:24.520
uh,

205
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.520
we've been talking about this phenomenon of involuntary association in terms of

206
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:31.180
individual and type.

207
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.880
So just want to go back very quickly to refresh your memory about all this text,

208
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.590
um,
to have and have not.
Um,

209
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:44.220
Harry's in voluntary association would be with all the other half knots and

210
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:47.410
there were plenty of drum during the great depression.
Uh,

211
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.160
that would be the involuntary,
so the station for him.
Uh,

212
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.900
but luckily for him,
um,
he actually can have,

213
00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:00.930
can qualify that in voluntary association when he's mediated by the presence of

214
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:04.120
Murray,
when he becomes,
um,
you know,

215
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:07.870
this really wonderful and long lasting,

216
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.360
not perishing figure in her mind.
Uh,

217
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.380
and when he is mediated in contrast to Richard Gordon in the Fitzgerald stories,

218
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:21.250
rich boy and Bernice,
perhaps her hair,
um,

219
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.170
we have the involuntary association through type.
So rich boy,

220
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.170
um,
and,
and hunter,
he has an involuntary,

221
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.880
the association with the title of the story rich boy,
but he deviated so much.

222
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.151
I mean,

223
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:39.151
he's such an extreme example that he's almost a deviation and Bernie's reversed

224
00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:44.630
to a much more engine type,
the native American.
Um,

225
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.510
so they all have a kind of qualify in voluntary association to the immediate

226
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:52.050
surroundings.
Um,
and as I laid on,

227
00:14:52.051 --> 00:14:56.660
which we just finished discussing is Faulkner's version of to have and have not.

228
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.530
Um,
and Ashley there,
uh,

229
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.520
it seems that the constant of have not,
is most,

230
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.640
um,
to nations and,
um,

231
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.120
and in many ways Victoria's,
um,

232
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.790
at the end triumphant at the end in the sense that Dow really,
um,

233
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.000
is in voluntarily couldn't find her Jackson.
Um,

234
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.810
here's an involuntary,
so Jolen in,

235
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.470
in s and saying in a mental institution,
um,

236
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.400
so,
um,

237
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.230
that is in any ways Faulkner's is the most pessimistic,

238
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.160
um,
of those three writers today.
Um,

239
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.990
well look at a complicated,
uh,
seven full implementation,

240
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:47.240
um,
and talking about hose.
Um,
and we won't be talking about all of them today.

241
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:51.110
So this pretty much is the,
uh,
the pattern,

242
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:55.430
the structure for the,
the nets for lecturers.
Um,

243
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.300
but just want to give you a sense of what were we talking about,

244
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.430
individual versus type,
obviously,
um,

245
00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:07.000
the voluntary versus involuntary and given the fact that the setting is Spain,

246
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.560
uh,
Thoren versus not foreign.
Um,
and,
uh,

247
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.940
the question of language brings up the question though,

248
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:18.430
for the literacy and illiteracy.
Um,
and the,

249
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:23.510
the relation between the distant home and the slight environment is going to be

250
00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:27.980
very important because to the United States actually has quite an important

251
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:31.850
presence in this novel.
So with the relation between the United States and Spain,

252
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.950
um,
and something that we've been talking about all the way through the comics,

253
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.820
this is tragic.
And finally to half and half not so,
um,
all of these,
um,

254
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.590
we'll be talking about in the next two weeks.
But,
um,

255
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.230
today we'll concentrate on the concept of involuntary foreigners.

256
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.260
Um,

257
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:56.260
and it turns out that they actually two classes of involuntary foreigners,

258
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.510
one completely counted until then.

259
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.860
We would think that the involvement Turi foreigners would just be American.
This,

260
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:05.870
they are the obvious foreigners.
Um,

261
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.960
and Hemingway gives us multiple instances of when one could be an involuntary

262
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:15.050
for and that,
but I think that,
um,

263
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.350
he is an astute enough,
um,

264
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.180
reader of the future,
um,
and of the Sioux,

265
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.830
the global dimension of the Spanish civil war,

266
00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.220
to know that the Spanish colossal will be involuntary foreign is in their own

267
00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:36.170
country.
Um,
this is happening all the time now.
Um,
lots of,

268
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:39.650
lots of people are involuntary fallenness in the country.
It is,
uh,

269
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.900
one of the most common phenomenon in the 20th first century.
Um,
and,

270
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:45.883
um,

271
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.210
Hemingway is portraying some of that trending spend,

272
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:55.220
the civil war because of the phenomenon of print illiteracy and because of

273
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:58.950
technological illiteracy that against very,
very common.

274
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.200
So,
uh,
let's just start on the American side.
Um,

275
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.560
we know that Hemingway is actually very,

276
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:12.561
very good when he uses it and being considerate of those of us who don't know

277
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:18.300
Spanish or who just know a few words in Spanish,
um,
bad.
He,

278
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.970
when he uses a Spanish word or phrase,

279
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:23.880
who would give us the translation almost right away.

280
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.680
So we have no trouble understanding the Spanish in the novel.

281
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.900
Um,
but he does have this interesting,
um,

282
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
stylistic innovation of inflecting the English language in the direction of

283
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:44.760
Spanish.
So the classic example is,
um,
the,

284
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.210
an idiomatic expression,
how are you call is live,

285
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.590
what's your name?
Uh,

286
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.230
we don't go around asking people how your caught because Spanish is not really

287
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:59.550
the reference point for us.
And not,
not,
not,
not for most of us.

288
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:03.930
At any rate in this country,
uh,
no,
not yet.
But in Spain,

289
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.940
that's how English,

290
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:11.060
that's the formed English would take even in your own head if what you would ask

291
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:17.720
people all the time,
there's Como Se yama was that um,

292
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:22.350
how you call literally translated from that.
Um,

293
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.710
and is the more formal expression,
right?

294
00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:29.640
So it's not the two is not to someone that you know,

295
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:33.570
well is the more formal expression addressing someone,
um,

296
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:37.200
that maybe you're meeting for the first time someone who was older,
um,

297
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.580
more fonts showing more respect for the person,
distance from the person.

298
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:47.040
Um,
what is it,
fat of this kind of English,

299
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.190
um,
not in Spanish,

300
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.590
not translate it into Spanish words,

301
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.730
but translated into Spanish syntax.
Um,

302
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.110
is,
is not wood,

303
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:05.120
it is not the actual translation into Spanish worst,

304
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.060
but translation using the syntactical structure of Spanish.

305
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.350
I think that there are many effects that depending on the degree of your degree

306
00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:16.620
of knowledge was managed really.
Uh,
it could be irritating.

307
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:20.910
I imagine actually for someone who's,
you know,
for Spanish speaker.

308
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.870
Um,

309
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.590
but I think that for people who actually have a kind of very slight acquaintance

310
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:30.150
with Spanish,
um,
the fact is kind of a double alienation.

311
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.680
Um,
we sue take note of the fact that um,

312
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.770
this is an idiomatic English.
Um,
and we,

313
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.460
so we're struggling to kind of thing of the Spanish equivalent for that.

314
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:45.180
That would be the origin for the English phrase.
Um,

315
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.480
in any case it makes us aware of the way of how English actually is not

316
00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:58.270
translatable with for word into Spanish,
right.
How is,

317
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.740
what's your name is not,
cannot be translated word for word into Spanish.

318
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.780
So it highlights the non translatability of English and the fact that they

319
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:12.310
really are very important cross cultural barriers,

320
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:17.311
not least of all in language as the cross cultural barrier.

321
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.320
Certain things cannot gather across easily.

322
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.220
They cannot get across without modification.
Um,

323
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.280
so Hemingway gives us no illusion that you can fit easily into,

324
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.000
um,
of a different environment.
Um,

325
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.990
gives us no illusion that there could be this immediate community in between

326
00:21:37.991 --> 00:21:42.220
people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.
Um,

327
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.420
I think that this double effect of this double elimination is also going to make

328
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:50.710
us aware of sometimes how strange our own,

329
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.920
how strange the English language,
uh,
with beer.
Um,
so you know,

330
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.940
every time you know more than one language.
So if you aware of,

331
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.660
of how each of those languages,
um,
how,

332
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.770
how each one is actually quite strange in retooling instances.

333
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.700
Um,
so,
um,
it,
it makes,

334
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.670
it makes everyone is sort of involuntary foreigner,

335
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.800
even though you're still at home really,

336
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.950
you still a native speaker of one language.
Um,

337
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.600
the fact that you aware of other languages and to wish you all native language

338
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.460
cannot be automatically translated,
uh,

339
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:34.770
makes you almost authority or a slight foreigner in your own native language.

340
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.080
Um,
so,

341
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:42.400
but this is a very mild and really not painful form.

342
00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:47.200
I think of being a foreigner.
Um,
things Scott start getting more painful,

343
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.070
um,

344
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:53.070
very fast actually and informed about hose and the people still joke about it.

345
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:55.060
So here is um,

346
00:22:55.090 --> 00:23:00.090
Robert Jordan talking to the Russian in general because I don't actually know

347
00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:02.590
how it's pronounced in Russian.
Um,

348
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.540
but they were talking about the bridge and we know that Robert is supposed to

349
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:11.620
blow up the bridge so they were actually talking business.
Um,

350
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.680
and Robert Jordan is assuring the Russian general that he knows exactly what to

351
00:23:17.321 --> 00:23:21.070
do.
That he's a very good,
he's very,

352
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:25.000
is a very good engineer.
He is very good with,
with explosives.

353
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.710
Um,
and this is what God as I believe you do.
You know how the of the bridge,

354
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.270
I will not make you.

355
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:36.271
And the low speech now does have a drink so much talking makes me very thirsty.

356
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:42.010
Conrad,
hold them.
You have a funny name in Spanish,
correct?

357
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.710
Holton,
how do you say goes in Spanish?

358
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.810
Conrad general host say goes grinning,

359
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:56.020
making the sound deep in his Strout as though hawking with a bad co host,

360
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.660
he crow come right Henry Hill holds.

361
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.140
If I had known how they would pronounce,

362
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.470
how they pronounce calls in Spanish,

363
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:11.240
I would pick me up a better name before I come to war here.
So,
um,

364
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.810
the Spanish g and j sounds are pronounced as edge.

365
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.840
So that's why it is especially this concerning when you have a combination of

366
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:25.370
those as income income in general clothes.
I can't even say it now,

367
00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:28.760
I'm so confused.
Um,
that,
um,
it gets,

368
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:33.810
it is really totally alienating your own name becomes unrecognizable in a

369
00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:37.070
foreign language.
Um,
it doesn't happen,
you know,

370
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.090
most of the time it doesn't happen,
but it just,
so,
um,
it,

371
00:24:40.091 --> 00:24:43.820
it just so happens that in this one instance there really is kind of a double

372
00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:47.840
alienation going on.
Uh,
four goals.
Um,

373
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.500
so what does it mean when you own name is not pronounceable,

374
00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:55.880
there's just no equivalent sung in Spanish.
Um,

375
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.140
it could be,
you know,

376
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:03.140
really innocent and completely innocuous,
a trivial occurrence.

377
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.510
Um,
but for something like that,

378
00:25:05.511 --> 00:25:10.511
one is tented oh one is almost in voluntarily tended to read more meaning,

379
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.780
um,
into that there's just no Spanish equivalent.

380
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.920
So my own identity in that language,

381
00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:24.110
there's no room,
there's no place,

382
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:28.610
there's just no slot that is waiting for me that I can fit in.

383
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:33.730
There's just no sound that will reproduce unnecessary sound in English.

384
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.810
Um,

385
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:40.810
so it really raises the question of what kind of a place Robert Jordan could

386
00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:47.930
have in the Spanish community if there's no,
um,

387
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.550
if there's no linguistic,

388
00:25:49.551 --> 00:25:54.050
if there's no fanatic slot for him in the Spanish language,

389
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:59.150
would there be a social slots for him in that Spanish community?

390
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.560
Would there be a functional slots for him in that community?

391
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.590
He has some very,
very well defined function.

392
00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:11.591
He's there to blow up the bridge and as long as he sticks to that very limited

393
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:14.000
function palliate okay.

394
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:19.280
Room for someone who will blow up bridges and leave.

395
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.960
Um,
but the thing is people can actually just confine themselves to that very,

396
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:26.150
very narrow definition.
Um,

397
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.960
it would be unbearable actually to be no more than just someone who's there to

398
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.740
blow up the bridge and do nothing else.
You can just be,
have that very,

399
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:35.000
very narrow existence.

400
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.250
So Robert Jordan has got to have some relations to the people and once he

401
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:45.300
wanders away from that very straight,
very narrow definition,

402
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.790
things will get problematic.
Um,

403
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.140
and that's why there's so much tension between him and the Spanish.

404
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:53.430
Um,

405
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:58.430
so one other instance of in voluntary association in front being involuntary,

406
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.320
uh,
foreign foreigner,
um,

407
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.460
and the worst foreigners is actually used by the Spanish a lot,

408
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.840
partly to insult,
uh,
Robert.
Um,

409
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.540
so Pablo is actually the one where,

410
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.000
who's especially aggressive when it comes to that.

411
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.310
It was a thought on their own with us who make the explosions.
Pablo said,

412
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.390
do you know him?
What is he called?
I do not remember.

413
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.050
It was a very rare name.
What did he look like?

414
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.510
He was fair as you are.

415
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.530
Not as tall and with large hands and a broken nose.

416
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.960
Kashkin rough vigilance.

417
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.220
That would be Kashkin yes,
to Pablo.

418
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.190
It was a very rainy,
something like that.

419
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:48.630
What became of him he steps since April.
Um,

420
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.280
a number of things.

421
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:55.730
We actually don't know if Pablo remembers the name cash can one now.

422
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.840
He,
for all we know,

423
00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:01.940
he might actually be able to remember that name very well.
Um,

424
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:06.890
they don't have foreign news every day among them and task in this knowledge and

425
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.240
the hot names.
Remember he probably knows that.
And um,

426
00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.130
he is emphatic about not knowing the name,

427
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:17.930
not being able to recall the name.
Even when offered the named,

428
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.680
he refuses to repeat the name,
something like that.
Just a generic foreigner.

429
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:23.670
Um,

430
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:28.670
so nothing can be more aggressive in regretfully by way of talking dismissively

431
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.990
about Kashkin as the foot gettable foreign that because it's just a generic type

432
00:28:36.421 --> 00:28:40.480
is just there who made the explosions.
Um,

433
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.850
so in all his ways he's making this forgettable,

434
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.850
um,
unimportant,
um,

435
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.210
probably not like foreigner.
Um,

436
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:56.240
the predecessor for Robert Jordan and this will kind of unforeseen consequence

437
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:02.900
of making cash can the predecessor for Robert and public probably doesn't know

438
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:06.070
that,
but cash can actually had died.
Um,

439
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:10.310
and we know later on that he had died by killing himself.
He just couldn't,

440
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.390
he,
his job is to,
um,

441
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.600
is to blow up bridges or the blowup trains.
Um,

442
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:22.160
but he should terrify of doing it.
And so he killed himself,
uh,

443
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.780
which,
uh,
Robert Normally knows.

444
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:30.020
So a combination of deliberate aggression from Pablo,

445
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.140
um,

446
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:36.140
make turning the Florida into a generic type into which both Kashkin and Robert

447
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.100
would be inserted,
um,

448
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:44.150
that deliberate aggression from Pablo combine with a circumstance that he

449
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.040
probably wouldn't have known that cashed in his bed at this point.

450
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:55.840
All of this Ma Dad for an a not just a foreigner,

451
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.700
but dad for the,

452
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.960
the sort of scripted future for Robert Jordan.
Um,

453
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:08.130
it's not just that foreigners cannot assimilate into the community,

454
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.580
but they also have a tendency to dive fairly soon.
Um,

455
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.780
that seems to be the forecasts for Robert Jordan.
So,
um,

456
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.110
we don't know if this forecast,
uh,

457
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.440
will actually become reality.

458
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:28.210
It's just a possibility at this point.
Um,
but it's a very,
very,
um,

459
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.793
emphatic,

460
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:34.210
a possibility that is underscore numerous time Ashley by other people.

461
00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:38.290
Every time Kashkin comes up,
how he died.
Um,

462
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.800
and the fact that he's like,
Robyn,
in many ways,

463
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:46.600
their hair a there,
um,
all those things come up.
Uh,

464
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.230
so it is,
it is the kind of a signature is kind of a structural,
uh,

465
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.610
signature and narratives signature in terms of the punctuation,
um,

466
00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.430
that Hemingway puts into his novel.
Um,
others,

467
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.630
places when we started wonder,
um,

468
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.840
is the similar fate awaiting Robert Jordan similar to Kashkin?

469
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.180
Um,
so the company off the debt,

470
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:15.210
I think it's fair to say is never very far as always on the horizons in phase,

471
00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:18.660
not even on the horizon is a looming presence,
um,

472
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.250
in that community and this looming presence,

473
00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:26.080
especially for foreigners and that community.
Um,
so,
um,

474
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:27.340
that's probably,

475
00:31:27.341 --> 00:31:31.680
that's pretty bad for Americans is we don't actually see a lot of Americans when

476
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:35.830
you see one,
a rubber Jolen.
Um,
so,
um,

477
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.630
it's pretty bad.
Um,
the signs and omens are not good.
Um,

478
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.720
but it seems that the signs and omens are also not great for the Spanish as

479
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:52.150
well.
Um,
and we can look at the ways in which,

480
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.230
um,
they are involuntary foreigners in their own countries.

481
00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.440
And actually Robert Jordan is also quite aggressive and um,

482
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:05.140
making sure that the Spanish can sometimes feel like they don't quite own the

483
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.790
own country or they,
they know,

484
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:11.170
they don't know how things are done in their own country.
Um,

485
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.640
Robin handed the rubber hits a piece of paper to prove his credentials,

486
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:18.460
which if necessary,
given the fact that nobody knows anything about him.

487
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.300
So you know,
how would people know that he's on their side?
So he has,
um,

488
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:26.890
pieces of documents to prove that he is in fact,
well credentialed.

489
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.830
So he handed it to the man who opened it,

490
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:35.250
looked at it dolefully and turned it in his hands so he cannot read rubbish.

491
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:39.690
Children know that.
Look in the CEO,

492
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.740
he said the old man pointed to the CEO and a man with a carbine studying it,

493
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:51.530
turning it in his fingers.
Was the,
is that,
have you never seen it?

494
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.080
No,
there are two.
Is that Robert Jordan?
One is the Sim,

495
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.410
the service of the military intelligence.
The other one is the general staff.

496
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.370
Yes,
I have seen that seal before,
but here,

497
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.120
no one commands but me,
the ones that song.

498
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:13.280
So they obviously has a struggle for authority here.

499
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.720
It is a shock to us,
um,

500
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.020
that Pablo inside all the people that we see in his novel,

501
00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:25.790
all the Spanish that they all ill veteran,
um,
bad.
Um,

502
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:30.850
and usually we don't even have to specify as print illiteracy.

503
00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:36.370
Um,
but here it seems especially important to uh,

504
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:39.900
it out because they've very literate in and other science.
Uh,

505
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.870
we know that I was Sammo Ashaway speaks,
um,
a classical,

506
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.640
um,
um,
um,
Spanish Castilian Spanish,

507
00:33:49.641 --> 00:33:54.620
which is very pure and it's the language of literature of course.
Vedo um,
so,

508
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.610
but yeah,
actually very literate in the sense that of having a very,

509
00:33:58.611 --> 00:34:01.700
very distinguished literary tradition behind them,

510
00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:06.410
but oral tradition so they can re writing.
Um,

511
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.100
but obviously in the 20,
in the 20th century,

512
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.960
early than the 20th century,
um,

513
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.030
not to be able to read and write is a tremendous liability.

514
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:18.500
So right there,

515
00:34:18.501 --> 00:34:23.501
this one strike against all these Spanish who cannot read their own language in

516
00:34:23.721 --> 00:34:24.554
writing.

517
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:29.270
It is robbing the foreigner who can actually we Spanish writing Spanish script.

518
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:30.410
Um,

519
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:35.410
but there's another level of illiteracy and a print illiteracy and it goes even

520
00:34:37.011 --> 00:34:40.890
beyond language.
Um,
in the fact that they are two CEO's,
uh,

521
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:45.710
on that document Pablo recognizes and one only one of the CEOs,

522
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.420
he doesn't recognize the other one.

523
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.470
He doesn't recognize the other one because he's not high up enough on the

524
00:34:51.471 --> 00:34:56.240
military hierarchy to have come across the other CEO's before.
Um,

525
00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:01.300
so in many ways it is Robert's way of putting him down showing that he actually

526
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:07.330
has more knowledge of the military infrastructure than Pablo does.

527
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:13.250
So that's why Pablo is very solid and way responses and completely

528
00:35:13.251 --> 00:35:17.810
understandable response is no one commands here but me.

529
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.780
Um,
Pablos hope and as they,

530
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:24.080
this is very interesting whole,
um,

531
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.910
there will be tested and I think some degree supported in the novel,
um,

532
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.400
is that it doesn't really matter how high up you are on the general military

533
00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:39.480
infrastructure that in many ways people who actually know the community well,

534
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.510
we'll be able to have command that community.

535
00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.330
I'm just saying this now as possible or like,
um,

536
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.680
but suddenly the contest of authority between Pablo,

537
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.930
uh,
and,
uh,
Robert will be played out throughout the entire novel.

538
00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:58.530
One of the most important structural features of this novel.

539
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:04.070
Um,
another,
uh,
but print illiteracy,
um,
is,

540
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:07.440
is both very nameable.
Um,
and you know,

541
00:36:07.441 --> 00:36:11.870
is it basically defines who you are.
Um,
but it's,

542
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.350
it's kind of a general condition,

543
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.130
but they have more specific instances of illiteracy that I would call it

544
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:21.120
technological literacy.
Um,

545
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.430
and it has to do with the high tech warfare,
um,
that we're seeing,
um,

546
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.620
is also a central feature of the Spanish civil war.

547
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.070
So he is talking about,
um,

548
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:36.170
and I found myself actually looking for images for lots of military websites to

549
00:36:36.631 --> 00:36:41.230
find the images for,
for,
for this,
uh,
this or weapons.
Um,

550
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.640
how is uh,
is Louis Gun Robert Jordan thought,

551
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:48.330
do you know anything about machine gun?
He asked,
Oh man,

552
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.820
now the sales down on nothing.

553
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:56.660
He has an instance of Hemingway doing instantaneous translation now that Sam or

554
00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:01.790
nothing and Dow to the Gypsy that they filed with much repetitive and become so

555
00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:06.680
hot.
The Barrows turn the barracks,
turn,
burn the hand,

556
00:37:06.681 --> 00:37:10.800
the touches it,
the Gypsies are proudly,
unless they jam,

557
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.030
run out of ammunition or get so hot,
they melt.

558
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.830
Robert Jordan said in English,
what do you say?

559
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:25.070
[inaudible] asked him nothing and wish all of them said I was only looking into

560
00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:28.770
the future in English.
Um,

561
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.600
this is a fairly aggressive moment on the side of Robin.

562
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:36.090
Every time someone switches in the language,
they know,

563
00:37:36.091 --> 00:37:38.110
the other person doesn't understand.
Uh,

564
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.370
his thing there was intentionality is similar school aggression.
Um,

565
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.420
but we'll stay away from that for a moment and just look at the Louis Gun.

566
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.760
Um,
this was a major innovation,
actually train the World War One.

567
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.720
It started in world war one.
Um,

568
00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:00.260
and this is a very complicated piece of machinery.
So,
um,

569
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:05.150
people,
we,
nobody will have a kind of intuitive,
um,

570
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.930
command of this weapon.
And so,
uh,

571
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.520
here is just one instance of the Louis Gun drill.

572
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:16.530
You have to learn to use the gun and we can see is a very,
very big,

573
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:20.890
um,
um,
is very unwieldy.
It's heavy.
Um,
and also it,

574
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.910
you just can't hold it in your hand and you have to put it on your shoulder and

575
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:28.530
carry it around.
Um,
it really is a major hindrance,
um,

576
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.620
to any kind of movement.
And here is,
is,
um,

577
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.730
an image of how inconvenient Ashley,

578
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.930
how will the pain and is actually to use that gun.
Um,

579
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:43.120
it is a weapon that Ashley quit create springs producers,

580
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:48.100
that facial expression,
um,
on the person who you trying to use that gallon.

581
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.240
Um,
so it is understandable,
uh,

582
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:57.100
bad either Robert Jordan himself.
Um,

583
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.400
when take note when he knows is that isn't Louis Gun is not just any ordinary

584
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.480
weaponry.
Um,
this is special kinds of equipment and the signals,
um,

585
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:13.590
a certain level of fighting as soon as scale warfare when the Louis gun is

586
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:15.003
involved.

587
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.460
And it's because it's signals Isolon scale finding that is no longer strictly

588
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.040
though go affair,
no,
no longer,

589
00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:29.041
strictly based on local local knowledge or intuitive use of small weapons.

590
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.400
Um,
I think that because of all these reasons,
um,

591
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:39.450
that he was suddenly switched to English as if I'm just giving himself the,

592
00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.850
the,
um,

593
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.640
the license to think out loud to himself in a different language at that point.

594
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.740
Um,
he doesn't think very highly of the Louis Gun.
Um,

595
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:57.340
even though it's such an impressive looking at cumbersome a weapon,

596
00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:02.170
um,
it actually,
you can jam or run out of ammunition and get so hot,

597
00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:06.640
they melt.
So,
you know,
it's not a great weapon to use.
Ora.
Um,

598
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.210
that's part of the reason he's saying this in English,
so that the Spanish when,

599
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:14.230
no,
all these drawbacks,
this high tech a weapon.

600
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:15.550
Um,

601
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:20.550
but also that people who use the Louis gun really have a different relation to

602
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:25.780
the future than people who don't.
Right.

603
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.850
It's similar in,
in,
uh,
um,
um,

604
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.590
siblings setting in the 21st century.

605
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.900
People who don't have a computer at this point,
who,

606
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.140
people who've never used a computer,
very different relation to the future,

607
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:46.141
into the present than people who do it really is a sharp dividing line.

608
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.770
So in the contest of the Spanish civil war,

609
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.680
people who've never seen Louis Kahn,

610
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.140
who's never handled one have a different relation to the future.

611
00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:00.730
So the gun itself is a kind of a door keeper.
Um,

612
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:05.910
various people are admitted and having a viable relation to the future and

613
00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:11.400
various people are banned from having a viable relation diffuser or they have a

614
00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:16.060
three to manage a in a relation to the future.
So the gun is the door,

615
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:17.530
keep her.
Um,

616
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:22.110
and the English language as far as Robert understands it,
um,

617
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:26.830
it's lined up with the gun in that way.
Um,

618
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:33.860
there's um,
the,
the,
the gun is one is on the ground,

619
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.730
um,

620
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:39.730
and this another weapon that has wings that is also very important to the

621
00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:43.040
Spanish civil war.
And we see,
um,

622
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.920
the next installment and,
um,

623
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:50.600
of this technological illiteracy on the side of the Spanish in this exchange.

624
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.540
Hi,
the evening sky,

625
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:58.930
three monoplanes in v formation showing my nude and still very at that height

626
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:05.650
with it still was sun passing unbelievably quickly across the sky.

627
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.680
The motors now strobing steadily hours.

628
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.460
They seem so Robert Jordan his head.
But knew that at that height,

629
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.820
you never could be assured they are markers of samples that rather Jolen cause I

630
00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:22.580
put the glasses on and ensure instantly,

631
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:27.350
but who prefer now to it make no difference to him who they were tonight.

632
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.830
And if it pleased the Oh man to have them be hours,

633
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.810
he did not want to take them away.

634
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.410
Now as they move outside to us that go via,

635
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.560
that did not look to be the green red wing tip,

636
00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:44.730
low wing Russian kind of version of the Boeing p 32.

637
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:49.250
That is Spanish called Moscow's.
You cannot see that colors.

638
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.320
The cut was wrong.
No,

639
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.980
it was a fascist patrol coming home.

640
00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.940
So knowledge of airplanes,
um,
knowledge that Ashley,

641
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:03.110
I think most of us in this room,
how they don't have.
Um,
but anyway,

642
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:07.820
um,
this is the Moscow,
so Boeing,
Peter the two.

643
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.090
Um,
and um,
you know,

644
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:15.170
I don't know what else to say about it is that it looks kind of primitive.

645
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:20.690
Um,
and um,
but that's,
um,
Ashley,

646
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:24.050
I did read somewhere that they,
that this is the last of that.
Uh,

647
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.560
there were various previous incarnations of Boeing p 29 of something,

648
00:43:28.561 --> 00:43:31.150
and this is the laws and then Boeing to stop developing this,

649
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.710
those citizens last of the line.
Um,

650
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.850
if we look at actually the German planes,
the high angles,
very,

651
00:43:37.851 --> 00:43:40.620
very effective bombers,
um,

652
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:45.300
they actually look much more impressive than the Moscow's.
Um,

653
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:50.390
you can see that this is a plane that anyone can see,
can do serious damage.

654
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:51.590
Um,

655
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:56.590
and here is the Italian Fiat and Osama is to be forgiven for mistaking the

656
00:43:58.851 --> 00:44:03.500
Italian Fiat for the Boeing p 32 because they actually,

657
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:08.240
they assured,
um,
and they're kind of clumsy looking.
Um,

658
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:12.530
and we can see right away,
um,
that even though this is the Spanish civil war,

659
00:44:12.531 --> 00:44:15.860
the Nazi insignia is there.

660
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:20.861
So that really is the second world war intruding into the Spanish civil war.

661
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:26.470
No question that having ways using the word fascist in three deliberate way,

662
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:28.063
um,

663
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:33.430
and this is a much more effective version.
Uh,

664
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:37.470
oh,
the Spanish bombings.
Um,

665
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.850
we'll be talking about,
uh,

666
00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:47.100
of this in the actual destruction,
um,
of,

667
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:49.500
um,
of some of the people in this novel,

668
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:54.770
what the bombers were the Italian bombs can do to local population.

669
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.070
Um,
but I just want to go back,
um,

670
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:04.200
to that phrase about looking into the future.

671
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:09.240
In English.
We've talked a lot about tomorrows and the future,
right?

672
00:45:09.241 --> 00:45:14.040
Beginning with the sound and the fury and the way in which,

673
00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.460
um,
the tomorrow,
um,

674
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:22.010
of Benji and the tomorrow of Jason and the tomorrow,

675
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.260
uh,
of Quentin,
um,

676
00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:30.290
not in many ways for impels versions of the present that is not as a future that

677
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:35.010
one can inhabit.
Um,

678
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:40.250
and here it raises the question of whether the future is in,

679
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:45.530
can be inhabited by Spanish speakers who don't know English at all.

680
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.690
Um,
in this context,
it's just no way,
um,

681
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:55.200
that the Spanish could know that this local community,

682
00:45:55.201 --> 00:45:58.110
if they can really read Spanish,
um,

683
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.490
in writing this farm was no way they can read Spanish,

684
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.610
reads the future in English.
Um,

685
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:10.790
but it also doesn't feel like this is the future that even if you were able to

686
00:46:12.571 --> 00:46:15.990
read that you would want to live in,

687
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.590
even if you have the ability to read that future,

688
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.500
even if that future is written,

689
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:28.340
written large by Louis Gun and by the planes that is a very legible future

690
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:35.490
written on the sky and on the ground,

691
00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:39.780
even though there's such a legible future and you can read it,

692
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.560
it might still not be a future that you would want to move into,

693
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:49.110
not a future that you would want to inhabit.

694
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:54.360
So this is a way in which there's also a kind of a double alienation going up.

695
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.340
The Spanish are banned from that future because they simply cannot read it.

696
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.080
It is illegible to them.

697
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:06.380
Robert Jordan who can read just fine is also,
um,

698
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:11.570
in many ways an outsider to that future because it's not anything that he would

699
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:16.320
like to live and it's not a world that he would like to live in.
Um,

700
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:21.300
and I just want to give you to find the images,
um,
of,

701
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:26.380
um,
what happens to the Spanish,
uh,
historically,
uh,

702
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:30.850
because of the use of bombers,
um,
in the Spanish civil war,

703
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.300
this is,
um,
the most famous town.

704
00:47:34.301 --> 00:47:39.030
It was completely destroyed by Italian farmers.

705
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.420
Uh,
Gwen,
they can,

706
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:45.610
and this is the famous because of painting.

707
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.560
Um,
and uh,
it is,
it's,
it's,
it's,
um,

708
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:55.950
w we can see this is really the kind of the response of a low tech population to

709
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:58.600
high tech warfare.
Um,

710
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.850
you just never seen anything like that before.
So it is nightmarish.

711
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.030
It is real,
um,

712
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:10.350
in a sense that the world has turned to a different kinds of reality.
Um,

713
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.140
it's just,
it has no relation to reality as you know,

714
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:18.430
and then that's why it is so real.
And that's why cubism is in any ways,
um,

715
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:20.000
in response to,
uh,

716
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:25.010
the surreal scenarios congeal out by the high tech weaponry of,

717
00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.860
of world wars.
Um,

718
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:31.090
so we'll come back to this and talk more about,
um,

719
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:36.600
basically the phenomenon of dying both in isolation but also dying as a result

720
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:40.030
of something that is lodged and is coming at you.
