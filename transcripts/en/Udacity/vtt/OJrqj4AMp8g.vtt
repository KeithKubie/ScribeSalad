00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.120
This ordering,
what to call x2 and y2 and x1 and

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.430
y1, it can become confusing sometimes.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.210
So let's do a little
practice to make sure

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.390
we understand what's correct and
what's not.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.990
I want to know which of the following
would be a correct way to calculate

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.930
the slope of the line that goes
through both (2, 5) and (10, 3).

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.590
And I want you to check all that apply.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.610
So here are your four choices, and for
each one, see if it's a reasonable way

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.740
of calculating the slope that
goes through these points.
