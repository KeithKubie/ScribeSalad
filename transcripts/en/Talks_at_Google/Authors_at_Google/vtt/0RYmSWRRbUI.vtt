&gt;&gt;Karen Wickre: I'm Karen Wickre from the
Communications Team and it gives me a lot

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.309
of pleasure to introduce Stephen Levy, a long
time technology reporter, many of you may

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:22.510
already know. Early fame came with 'Hackers'
which some of you have with you today also.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.120
Anyway, Stephen writes for Wired Magazine
and undertook this large project to write

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.590
a book about Google almost three years ago.
And he'll tell you all about that. And to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.350
introduce him is our own Matt Cutts who'll
be firing questions at him.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Karen Wickre: So thanks. And welcome to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.370
Stephen.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Yay.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.199
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: All right. So first off, welcome

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.269
to Google.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Thank you. This is new for

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.269
me.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.071
[audience laughter]
Roughly how many times have you been to Google,

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:57.269
if you had to guess?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: I – it would be tough to

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.640
guess.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Yeah.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.801
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Because it's – obviously,
I'd been visiting Google before you were in

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.740
this campus of course.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.220
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: But the amount of time I spent
here in the last few years has been enormous.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.660
I took – I had a place to bivouac in Palo
Alto. And one thing I did notice. I have this

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.940
little route that I take from my place in
South Palo Alto and, and I pass this building.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.880
Or it was a vacant lot at first on the corner
of Charleston and San Antonio. You know they're

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.210
building some sort of giant retirement home
and community center or something. And the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.230
thing wasn't there when I started. And I watched
the thing go up and got completed during the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.860
time I was working on this book. So…
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Wow.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.570
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: it was a lot of time. Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: So what's your process for something

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.130
like this? Like how -- you decided you want
to write the definitive book about Google…

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.130
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Right.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: which I think you've successfully

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.130
written.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well, thank you.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.170
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: So how do you go about that?
How do you tackle that?

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:03.290
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well, what really shaped it
was the, the focusing approach that I took

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.580
from the beginning which came to me during
a 2007 trip that I was invited to go along

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.850
with the APM's – with the Associated Product
Managers. It's the trip that Marissa Mayer

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.340
takes the young future leaders of Google in
different places around the world. And I spent

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.071
24-7 with them which is sort of unusual for
a reporter to get that kind of access and

00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:34.890
I wasn't monitored all the time. I could talk
to them all the time and I was sort of immersed

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.531
in the Google bubble for all that time as
we bounced around the world. Now I thought,

00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:44.340
'Boy this would be interesting. The way to
tell the story is from the inside out.' From

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.280
an outsider getting access to the inside and
almost like an anthropologist living in some

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.190
primitive culture or something.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.310
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And , and getting familiar

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.990
enough to converse in the language and, and
be comfortable with it, familiar with it and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.250
have people comfortable with me and that was
the approach I took. So the ground rules were

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.540
I could talk to anyone. The people could say,
'No' but very, very few people did. I could

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.640
count on the fingers of one hand the people
who said, 'No'. And in a couple of cases,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.080
I really wanted to talk to them so we just
worked out something where I could talk to

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.599
them. And I was allowed to sit in in a number
of different kinds of meetings and gatherings

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:32.500
and things like that. And I was able to witness
the development of certain projects which

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.540
of course weren't available to the general
public. But I agreed that if a project that

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.390
I was watching had not come out by the time
the book came out, I wouldn't write about

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.370
it. I wouldn't be the vehicle by which a Google
product would be announced.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.660
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: So did that cause you any stress
with like Emerald C or any deadlines on, on

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.599
getting the book finished?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: What's Emerald C?

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.360
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: All right. Okay.
[laughter]

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.670
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: [laughs] Actually I introduced
Emerald C, I confirmed Emerald C as a code

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.180
name in there and that was done with consultation
there but I -- that was one project I could

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.270
say in, in the walls here that I was watching
pretty closely. I was disappointed, probably

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.680
not as much as people who working on Emerald
C were disappointed, that I wasn't able to

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.310
write about it in April, 2011.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: So it seems like there's a lot

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.060
of stuff you could write about. Like some,
some topics necessarily are going to get shorter

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.920
shrift. Like Google News didn't get quite
as much coverage. How do you decide what do

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.190
you talk about, what do you not talk about?
All those sorts of things.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.710
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well, the structure of a book
takes on its own life as you go and there

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.280
were a lot of projects which I had a lot of
stuff on-- on Google news for instance. I

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.180
did several interviews on that and there is
a lot to say about it but for one thing, it's

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.870
been discussed pretty widely outside. But
as the book took on its own narrative drive,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.230
I hope, as I put it together – and it's
interesting to see how the processes of writing

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.310
books has changed as technology changed. My
first book I was writing just as I actually

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.940
was starting to write on, on a computer then.
So probably this style in which I wrote it

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.110
was still pretty much the style -- you know
I'm old enough that I wrote my first stories

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:27.900
in journalism on this thing called a typewriter
and yeah. And it changes a lot as you have

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.720
the freedom to go, go anywhere. You used to
write a story -- you would start on page one

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.070
and go all the way through and start over
again, right? And so now things -- it's almost

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.290
like a picture, a photograph dropped into
a pool of developing fluid which is something

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.110
else we don't have any more.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.070
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And it, it, it, comes into
shape and, and as this one was coming into

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.919
shape, I knew pretty much how I wanted to
do it. And surprisingly the chapters 'In The

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.930
Plex' resemble the outline I gave to my publisher
three years ago. ' See, the first chapter

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.560
is gonna talk about Search. The second chapter's
gonna talk about ads. The third chapter's

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.280
gonna talk about Culture. Actually I did change
the order. And we can talk about why, when

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.890
the China chapter got pushed back a little
there

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.190
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: and the section was gonna

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.729
be called 'International' originally there.
But the thing takes a narrow drive. And Google

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.360
News – it just didn't fit in there. There
is one part in one section where I just throw

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.729
in a lot of projects that I have, right?
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.490
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: I think Google News maybe
made a couple paragraphs in that thing. For

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.330
instance, I had a lot about Noll for some
reason. I know why. It's because I was privy

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.800
to the stuff that went on in that project
when it went on. But it just didn't seem relevant

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.419
to go on for just pages and pages and pages
about Noll.

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:45.930
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Umm hmm. So once you got inside
Google behind the curtain, what was the biggest

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.850
revelation or the product that surprised you
the most or what took you back the most? Like

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.470
what was something that you didn't expect
once you were really inside the Plex?

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.139
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well there's two things. One
is very specific and that's the whole China

00:06:58.139 --> 00:06:59.139
thing.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Umm hmm.

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:04.430
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: The China thing was -- really
it was an amazing story and I say 'story'

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:12.690
because it really followed a track and -- in
the -- obviously the decision to stop censoring

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.320
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Umm hmm.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: and the subsequent withdrawal

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.680
from the Mainland was like an end. Certainly
that chapter. And with the amazing characters

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.910
and it wasn't something that was as cut and
dry as some people think journalists like.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:35.550
To me, my approach in doing journalism is,
I have like a rule which is that the real

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.970
story is always -- and I mean always not just
sometimes -- always more interesting than

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.001
the preconception you could have about that
story.

00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:44.500
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Umm hmm.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Because it's real life. I'm

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.789
a non-fiction writer so ends don't always
tie up neatly.

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:50.220
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: But the complications are

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.949
fascinating because that's life. So you may
not get the answer to every single question

00:07:54.949 --> 00:08:01.030
but you -- if you could reflect the complications
of life while fitting it in an interesting

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:06.240
narrative, then to me that's the nirvana there.
And China was a great example of that. There

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.040
were also unexpected important components
of that story that I had never heard before.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.919
For instance when I was in Beijing talking
to engineers and I have to say the Google

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:20.150
Engineers in Beijing were -- and the executives
there -- were unbelievably frank.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.300
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: The candor I had in those

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:31.800
interviews probably was as open and unafraid
they were talking to a journalist than anyone

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.909
not only have I talked to at Google but at
any company I ever covered there.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:41.080
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Wow.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: They were just -- and they

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.060
had incredibly tough criticisms in particular
of one thing -- the thing that just drove

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.850
them insane was the fact that the engineers
in China did not have access to the production

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:56.810
code. It was more than a work annoyance though
it was that and something that limited what

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.390
they could do. It was a sign to them that
they were second class citizens.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.440
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And one person told me -- this

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.940
is all on the record – that, that he feared
there was going to be a riot one day because

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.911
they were so frustrated there. And that was
fascinating. And it sort of underlined the

00:09:12.911 --> 00:09:18.770
difficulties of going in into China there
in a way that people hadn't expected there.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.940
This complication, this fear that because
China's political climate was such and there

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.520
could be pressure on the families of engineers
that Google had to take this step there.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.960
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Umm hmm.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And some people actually suspected

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:39.490
also because of the discomfort the company
had with censorship in China that this restriction

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.760
was not solely because of security reasons
but was almost a form of civil disobedience

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.880
by some of the people in Mountain View who
just didn't like the whole thing in China

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.940
and were slowing them down. So people had
that suspicion out there. I really don't know

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.800
how true that was or how much people were
intentionally dragging their feet up there

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.200
but that's how they felt there. So that was
one thing. The second thing is that even though

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:13.170
Google is much criticized in, in, in some
quarters for what is a perceived lack of coherence

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.690
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: in what it does. Even though

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:25.080
there is some -- 'sloppiness' is maybe too
negative a word but there is looseness.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.330
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Mild chaos.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: in

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.680
&gt;&gt;Matt Cuts: Sometimes
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Yes. Chaos. But chaos is a

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:33.430
word that you folks use. There is an overall
coherence to what it does. You could find

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:40.340
the root of Googleliness in stuff that happens
there and the example that I use is the autonomous

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:46.330
cars which a lot of people seize on as this
is an example of Google just doing anything

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:51.209
it damn pleases. So why don't I just focus
on the Search Engine or fighting Facebook.

00:10:51.209 --> 00:10:56.209
Instead they're doing cars that drive themselves.
I actually found that a pretty Googley project.

00:10:56.209 --> 00:11:01.870
It was AI based and Google to me, one of the
things you can say about it -- this company

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.649
is an AI company among other things. So that
makes sense that AI is really baked into these

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:12.470
things and it also is really a big information
processing exercise. It takes in all its information

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:17.590
about its local area with its little Laser
Sensors and all that and it brings back information

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:24.600
from Google in Street View and Maps and things
like that and so I, I, I found it not a surprising

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.690
product once you think about it for Google
to embark on.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:33.050
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: So going back to China for just
a second, it seems like the book really goes

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.060
into more depth about the, the interactions
between the executives than probably even

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.330
a lot of Googlers had access to. So I'm kind
of curious about how did the, how did the

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.430
structure of things work like in terms of
-- how many times did you talk to Larry or

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.089
Sergey or Eric? How was that structured whenever
you were talking with them?

00:11:49.089 --> 00:11:52.589
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well in some discussions it
was interesting. One of the first times, one

00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:54.930
of the first long interviews I've had with
Sergey

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.870
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: was in 2002 though I met him

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.890
in 2009.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm. Do you mean 1999?

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.600
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: In 1999, 1999 -- sorry. I'm
sorry. Yeah.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.130
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: He doesn't know about the Google
time travel device, all right?

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.060
[audience laughter]
Everybody keep that on the down-low.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:17.290
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And we talked about China
because they just had the first unpleasant

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.899
experience with China when Google was mysteriously
blocked for a couple of weeks there and we

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:31.410
talked a bit about that and the politics of
that. And so a lot of the discussion was not

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:36.610
directly with Sergey and Larry though they
came up on our interviews that we did have

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:44.280
there. But just a lot of the other executives
around here and some were formal interviews

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.071
and some were less formal because the nice
thing about being around here a lot is you

00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:56.899
run into people and at conferences. I'd been
talking to people and things would come out

00:12:56.899 --> 00:13:03.561
and it was a mix of going to China and talking
to the engineers gave me more information

00:13:03.561 --> 00:13:09.279
than to bring back to Mountain View and talk
to people there. And at one point, someone

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:15.270
sort of like let it slip, 'Oh we – yeah.
Then there was the time we fired our government

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.620
relations person for those Ipods and my ears
kinda went up.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.641
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Whoa. And then, and then because

00:13:22.641 --> 00:13:29.570
that person wasn't high executive and I'm
not giving anything away to people because

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:35.950
these were people in the room from Google
when this is happening. I said 'This is something

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.660
I really have to follow up on' and I did track
it down and managed to get Alan Eustace on

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.019
the record about it.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm.

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:50.380
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: You know other people there
and I -- there was a lot of talk with Googlers

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:57.160
and ex-Googlers really also about the China
thing so I put a lot of work into that section

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.160
because you could really see where the holes
were on that narrative and I really knew exactly

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.470
where to go -- it was a case of a former Secretary
of Defense said, 'There's known unknowns.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.339
And known…
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:10.113
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: and unknown unknowns' and

00:14:10.113 --> 00:14:14.639
I had some known unknowns that I could track
down in that piece of the puzzle.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:17.230
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Yes. So you've not only been
going around inside Google. You have been

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.750
visiting a lot of conferences talking to a
lot of people in doing the book and then also

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.889
doing the book tour afterwards. I understand
you were at Facebook yesterday?

00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:28.560
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Yes I was.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Anything they were particularly

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.800
interested in?
[audience laughter]

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.209
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Or [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: There were a couple really

00:14:34.209 --> 00:14:39.470
interesting things in the Q and A section
at Facebook that I think you might be interested

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:44.950
in. First was one person asked me a question
that took me aback. He said, 'Why aren't there

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.050
more people from Google coming to Facebook?'
[audience laughter]

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.060
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And that really took me back

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.470
especially since in the beginning I asked
how many people are ex-Googlers and a fair

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.740
number of hands went up. So I thought that
was an odd question. And another question

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:05.389
that was asked was, 'When is Google gonna
do a rapprochement with us? When are they

00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:08.760
going to sit down at the table with us?' I
said, 'That's what the people at Google ask

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.450
about Facebook.'
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:16.940
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: So I thought that that was
strange. And there was some interest in Google's

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:23.630
social strategy. Actually there was, I made
sure that anything I might know that I shouldn't

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:30.480
share not get out. I, I, I kept on that but
just -- and then they had, I actually took

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.610
a lot of my time there when I talked to them
, talking about China because it has been

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.660
reported that Facebook is considering its
own move into China. So I thought I'd give

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:47.410
them a cautionary tale about the experience
of one company that went into China and it

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:51.500
didn't exactly work out as planned.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hm. [laughs] So we're gonna,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.370
in a little bit we're gonna open it up for
Q &amp; A. But I wanted to ask just a few more

00:15:55.370 --> 00:16:00.880
questions. So you do a really good job. I
think a lot of books about Google end up with

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.389
'Great. Oh, Google's fantastic. It's idealistic.'
And then inevitably people feel like they

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:08.970
need to tear Google down at the end and it's
a huge privacy problem and all these sorts

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.639
of things. And I thought the book did a really
good job of avoiding that pitfall of the easy

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:17.920
narrative but there was one part where you
were talking about where Google was defending

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.589
the Google Books settlement and if I could
just read a paragraph, I wanted to get your

00:16:22.589 --> 00:16:24.800
take on this.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Please. I'd like to hear it.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.589
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Good. [laughs]
[audience laughter]

00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:31.130
So the idea is basically that somebody was
defending the Google Books settlement. And

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.460
then you say, "But Google's plight was such
that arguments seemed self-serving. Google

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:40.440
had become a company that dominated the world's
searches, whose mirror world rivaled the physical

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.850
world as a working version of reality, a company
that had knowledge of virtually everyone's

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:49.399
information, peregrinations, and intentions
accompanied fighting the giants in computer

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:54.510
software, phones and television. When Google
spoke of 'good' and 'evil', the words sounded

00:16:54.510 --> 00:17:02.139
hollow at best. Its flaws became magnified
and its virtues seemed calculated." So if

00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:07.220
you were in charge of trying to get things
back to the Google Love where people felt

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.199
like the words were not hollow
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Right

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:12.269
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: What would you do? How would
you try to change things? What projects would

00:17:12.269 --> 00:17:16.679
you do?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well, I don't know about projects

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:23.829
but I'd say that first of all, transparency
is really, really important and one thing

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:30.299
that was fascinating to me about Google was
how incredibly open the people in Google are

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:36.210
with each other internally. Internally at
Google. The fact that the moment you go, everyone

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:41.409
could see everyone else's OKR's and all this
information about what's going on inside the

00:17:41.409 --> 00:17:47.580
company is available to everyone in the company
and by and large, you do a terrific job of

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:54.330
doing that without stuff leaking as much as
you thought it would leak out on this. And

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:59.879
I remember when I went on a trip, I learned
about Chrome and I was amazed it was a year

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:06.090
later that Chrome came out and no one had
leaked it out. There was suppositions or something

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:11.860
like that. The story never leaked out there.
But externally it's not that way. To me, Google

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.359
is like a lobster. It has sort of a hard shell
on the outside but inside,

00:18:16.359 --> 00:18:19.869
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: it's softer and gooier. Right?

00:18:19.869 --> 00:18:20.869
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:18:20.869 --> 00:18:26.779
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: So I think the lobster, the
-- has to go. Maybe a soft shell crab might

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:28.359
be a better way to go.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:30.559
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: For, for Google. Not letting

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:37.159
people into everything but I think transparency
and in terms of the, the, the book search.

00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:42.239
One thought, thing that came to mind and I
don't even know how plausible this is but

00:18:42.239 --> 00:18:49.899
it's there. All these books are scanned and
part of the deal is that only Google gets

00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:54.229
the benefit of its scans. And that makes sense
in one sense because Google has invested all

00:18:54.229 --> 00:19:01.750
this money into scanning the books, right?
So it's their property. But making it open

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:06.840
to everyone I don't think would hurt Google
that much. Even licensing, maybe get some

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.840
money back from anyone else who might want
to do that. But maybe if it wasn't exclusive

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:16.289
to Google. That is one of the biggest complaints
about the original book search, that this

00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:20.950
was something that only Google will have there.
And maybe if it was more like a public service

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:28.789
that anyone can get hold of, it would add
ammunition to the idea of its fair use and

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:34.539
things like that. So I think that the original
sin in book search was not in scanning the

00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:39.499
book which in the legal system might have
been an original sin depending on how you

00:19:39.499 --> 00:19:42.070
interpret what a book scan is. Is it a copyright
violation?

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.620
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: to make one single copy of

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:51.909
a book. That's for the lawyers to fight over.
But to me it was when the Authors' Guild actually

00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:55.120
came up with a suggestion, that instead of
just doing it this way, why don't we do it

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.429
in a way where it's like a bigger project
where you're gonna sell books. And the idea

00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:05.770
of Google being the exclusive seller of books
I think turned a lot of people who might have

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.320
been your natural allies into your enemies.
One thing that struck me in particular was

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.730
all the people that lined up against Google
during this particular hearing or during the

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.729
book settlement, one guy was a lawyer who
represented Arlo Guthrie. And I thought, 'How

00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:24.610
did it get to the point where Arlo Guthrie
is testifying against Google?' That seems

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:29.960
sad.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs] So it's been many years

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.720
you've been talkin' about Google, writing
about Google. You wrote some of the first

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.950
articles about Google. And now two or three
multiple years on the book. Are you sick of

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:39.950
Google?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: [laughs]

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.239
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Are you like 'please. No Google

00:20:42.239 --> 00:20:44.309
news.'
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well I'm still upset they

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:47.169
closed Andalé.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:20:47.169 --> 00:20:51.979
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Yeah. Yeah. Me too.

00:20:51.979 --> 00:20:53.590
[applause]
The burritos over there are just not quite

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:59.790
the same.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: The -- no it -- I'm I'm gonna

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:05.769
miss comin' over as much. It was fun and I
think that one thing they really do select

00:21:05.769 --> 00:21:09.870
for when they hire people is that, 'Hey. We
want interesting people here' and early on

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:16.450
there was this joke. I think it was semi-serious
that they didn't want to hire anyone that

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.590
if Larry or Sergey were stuck at an airport
with an employee, they would be like bored

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.669
by the person's conversation, right?
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:27.789
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: So obviously the people here
are really smart. They're really interesting.

00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:34.980
They're fun to talk to and in a way it's -- there's
this preconception of engineers that they're

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.899
these grinds and they're not interesting.
And things like this authors series and people

00:21:39.899 --> 00:21:45.919
are music lovers. They're readers here and
I think that it's fun to be around here and

00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:51.029
certainly the technology's pretty interesting
and it's something I hope to continue covering

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:54.580
there. So I'm actually going to miss not being
around as much.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:00.080
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: How about something where you
finish a book and then maybe a few days later,

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.909
Eric decides to become Executive Chairman
and Larry's going to become CEO. How does

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:10.000
that change things? How does that change?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well amazingly, a day before

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.570
I finished the book [laughs] I actually had
the final page proofs in hand. It was the

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:22.820
last shot I had at the book before it would
cost a lot of money to change anything and

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:28.669
maybe push back the publication date. And
that was when that announcement came through.

00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:34.480
And I'll tell you, if it were anyone but Larry,
this book would have been in big, big trouble.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.619
But clearly if you read it, you see Larry's
personality here. And one thing I hope the

00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:44.029
book does forever is it distinguishes between
Larry and Sergey. A lot of people just think

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:47.849
of them as one of a matched set of Google
guys.

00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:50.649
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Right.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And that's not the case. There's

00:22:50.649 --> 00:22:56.190
a lot of values that they share in common.
They're great friends. But they're different

00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:04.940
people entirely and each had their own individual
impact on shaping Google. So I was able to

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:11.119
get that in and it provided a nice little
end to the book there. So that's what I was

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:15.809
doing. I was documenting that era at Google.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Umm hmm. That's good. So probably

00:23:15.809 --> 00:23:19.309
as you're touring around the country a little
bit, you're talkin' about Google, you probably

00:23:19.309 --> 00:23:24.379
hear a lot of misconceptions. Like I know
whenever I talk to people they say or they

00:23:24.379 --> 00:23:28.960
believe that Google was behind the scenes
picking every single result and how it should

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:34.859
rank. What kind of misconceptions do you run
up against? Or what sort of stuff do you see?

00:23:34.859 --> 00:23:40.389
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well, well, stuff like that.
No one understand ads, right? But I think

00:23:40.389 --> 00:23:46.539
it's great to explain it. People, people are
fascinated because here's a system. You run

00:23:46.539 --> 00:23:51.039
these auctions. You're the biggest auctioneer
in the world, but the highest bidder isn't

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:57.879
necessarily the winning bid, right? And the
-- yeah, somehow a big factor in the bid is

00:23:57.879 --> 00:24:04.849
how good an ad is. How's that work? Right?
But that's a way to explain how ads fit in

00:24:04.849 --> 00:24:14.610
into the whole Google world there. And a lot
of people, I guess they just don't get the

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:21.150
-- how driven Google is by the ambition to
take on, on, on big things. They just see

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:28.190
it as this force that delivers search there.
So I'm happy to provide a little more explanation.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.889
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Yeah. It's strange how many
people don't even realize Google has ads.

00:24:31.889 --> 00:24:34.760
So if they pick that up that's a good take
away from the book.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.799
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Yeah. And maybe not. Maybe
they'll stop clickin' on them.

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:38.789
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs] So why don't we open

00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:43.139
it up for general Q and A. So anybody who
has a question, go ahead and line up behind

00:24:43.139 --> 00:24:51.679
the microphone and whatever you'd like to
ask Stephen Levy. [pause]

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:55.399
&gt;&gt;Brennan: Hey. It's good, good to see you
again.

00:24:55.399 --> 00:24:56.499
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Yes.
&gt;&gt;Brennan: I was one of the employees that

00:24:56.499 --> 00:25:00.330
you interviewed for the book.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Yes I know. Hi, Brennan.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:01.619
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brennan: It's good because

00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:05.859
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: You are quoted in there I
think.

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:06.859
&gt;&gt;Brennan: Yes. I am actually, which is good
because

00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:07.859
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Are you here taking issue

00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:08.859
with that?
&gt;&gt;Brennan: No. No. No. It's just that the

00:25:08.859 --> 00:25:10.389
interview was so long ago that for the life
of me I actually couldn't remember what I

00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:14.830
told you by the time I said, 'Oh is this book
thing actually is going to happen?'

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.090
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: That's what my editor said.
[laughter]

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:22.711
&gt;&gt;Brennan: So anyway I had sort of one question
and one suggestion. So the one question is

00:25:22.711 --> 00:25:26.179
-- it seems like -- the question I have is
it seems like when you write a book like this,

00:25:26.179 --> 00:25:30.059
right? you sort of have a sort of an option
about sort of, sort of how much detail to

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:36.330
go into in a way that might be threatening
to the institution. Even if you're not sort

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.450
of a malicious person, right? So there's always
this sort of editorial decision you have to

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.700
make for yourself. What areas you're not going
to go into because you're basically going

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.489
to burn your bridges with the institution.
So is there something you felt like other

00:25:47.489 --> 00:25:51.200
than the projects that hadn't launched that
you, that you didn't touch on enough in the

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.499
book that maybe you would have, that you could
tell us that you wouldn't tell the outside

00:25:55.499 --> 00:25:56.499
world?
[laughter]

00:25:56.499 --> 00:25:58.239
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Hmm.
Brennan: And then the second thing is just

00:25:58.239 --> 00:26:02.249
more of a suggestion. You were talking about
sort of the chapter on China. It seems like

00:26:02.249 --> 00:26:07.479
to me that the sort of awareness that has
entered the public consciousness of how information

00:26:07.479 --> 00:26:13.190
security is being regularly violated by nation
states and other large institutions. That

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.869
would itself be the great topic of a book
for somebody that could popularize that. In

00:26:15.869 --> 00:26:21.019
so far as -- there's a lot of misinformation
about that and it seems like -- obviously

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:25.769
my interest is in security but I've had all
these people ask me like, 'Is the government

00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:29.700
of China breaking into our power plants and
things like that?' And the answer is always

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.100
like, 'Well, maybe'.
[laughter]

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:37.039
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: That's actually a good idea.
[laughs]. The first part -- well nothing springs

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:42.349
to mind really like they came up that way.
I think maybe in the deal with China there

00:26:42.349 --> 00:26:48.889
might be a couple of things that I didn't
think were important for the reader or I can

00:26:48.889 --> 00:26:55.609
go either way on it or like naming the name
of a person who might actually be in peril

00:26:55.609 --> 00:27:01.649
by mentioning that. And I think in one case
I just described who the person was but didn't

00:27:01.649 --> 00:27:06.609
mention the person's name -- it was a name
that would have meant anything to anyone,

00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:13.919
the general reader. So for that, okay. That,
that, that kind of thing. And I think Google,

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:22.940
I'm sure when they okay-ed this project, it
understood there was going to be some warts

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:29.359
revealed here and there but by and large and
this is towards that ideal transparency we

00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:34.379
talked about earlier. I think Google has been
more transparent, been a little more conscious

00:27:34.379 --> 00:27:37.220
of it here and there. You see those videos
by

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.970
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Sometimes, yeah.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: by Matt and some by Hal about

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:47.389
-- which sort of explain what some people
call and I know you guys don't like the term

00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:52.710
'black boxes' over there. So, you know.
[pause]

00:27:52.710 --> 00:28:01.039
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Thanks for coming
here. My question's kind of similar. First

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:07.170
when you started being a part of these confidential
meetings at Google, was there something that

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:12.179
you said, 'Whoa. I didn't know this.' And
the second part of that question is, was there

00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:14.710
ever a meeting you were in and you said, 'Whoa.
Whoa, whoa. I want to write about this but

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.329
then they're not gonna let me?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: But then what?

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:20.460
&gt;&gt; Male Audience Member #1: They're not gonna
let me. Was there anything now that you're

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.739
here?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Actually there were things

00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:28.589
in some meetings that I attended they said
if they had one of those memory wipers like

00:28:28.589 --> 00:28:29.589
'Men in Black',
[laughter]

00:28:29.589 --> 00:28:32.509
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: they they would have used
on me.

00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:34.869
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And Kent Walker before one

00:28:34.869 --> 00:28:42.809
GPS told me, like he freaked out and said,
'Whoa. He's in the room.' And basically told

00:28:42.809 --> 00:28:46.250
me in no uncertain terms all the different
limbs that would be broken

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.729
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: if I revealed what was on

00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:51.110
the slide at a given time which I did not
reveal.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.759
[ laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: So I still have my limbs,

00:28:53.759 --> 00:28:54.759
Ken.
[pause]

00:28:54.759 --> 00:28:57.830
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Hi.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:02.259
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Hi.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: You are in somewhat

00:29:02.259 --> 00:29:06.599
of an enviable position of having written
two books about Apple and one about Google.

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:11.970
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Apple's older.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Yeah. Yeah. My

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.830
question is and you touched upon that. I was
first of all curious if you would talk a little

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:20.169
bit about how it is to write about Apple versus
how it is to write about Google because people

00:29:20.169 --> 00:29:24.019
probably assume that Apple is more closed.
Google is more open. Blah, blah, blah. But

00:29:24.019 --> 00:29:29.889
there is probably more depth to it. And a
related idea -- Brian just had a suggestion

00:29:29.889 --> 00:29:32.749
and I was going to steal his idea of having
a suggestion. I would love it if you could

00:29:32.749 --> 00:29:37.629
write a book about stuff like that. So corporate
culture in Silicon Valley -- Apple. Google.

00:29:37.629 --> 00:29:39.809
Well, Microsoft's not Silicon Valley technically.
[laughter]

00:29:39.809 --> 00:29:43.460
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: I think it would
be fascinating even just tracking Apple from

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:48.519
1970 - whatever until to today.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Okay. Well, another interesting

00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:53.389
suggestion there. So I don't think it would
have been possible for me to do this kind

00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:58.649
of book about Apple. I just don't think that
anyone and it'll be interesting to see what

00:29:58.649 --> 00:30:04.019
kind -- I know that Walter Isaacson is doing
an authorized biography of Steve Jobs. Actually

00:30:04.019 --> 00:30:09.279
got a certain degree of access to the meetings
at Apple and things like that. I don't know

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:15.779
if he was interested in pursuing or was able
to pursue something like a project like where

00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:25.219
he talked to people like Matt. You know other
people I see in the room. Multiple times there.

00:30:25.219 --> 00:30:31.080
To get down and really understand how that
stuff works there. The one part of Apple that

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.659
they'll let no one in -- maybe they let Walter
in – was the Design Studio or things like

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:41.080
that. But the books I wrote about Apple were
sort of, sort of after the fact things that

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:47.450
were sort of based on some of the products
there. So even though I have a pretty good

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:53.950
relationship with Steve Jobs, I haven't had
much success in asking him to spend time with

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:57.250
the rank and file there. It's something that
they don't like.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:01.289
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: So you mentioned
about transparency. And I'd like to maybe

00:31:01.289 --> 00:31:05.379
visit that a little bit more. If you put on
your journalist hat and take the other side

00:31:05.379 --> 00:31:11.249
of the story, what would, what would you criticize
the most about Google and what would be the

00:31:11.249 --> 00:31:14.039
things we could do to combat that besides
more transparency?

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:21.230
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Besides more transparency?
Well I mean , so I mean one thing that I think

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:27.769
that Google and I -- I am a little critical
of this in the book particularly in one of

00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:32.519
the sections. Sometimes you guys come up with
really good products. Then you don't support

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:37.759
them well enough. And I know that this is
a conscious thing. So I was a little surprised

00:31:37.759 --> 00:31:44.889
even when after Wave last summer and this
-- this wasn't at an interview. It was a press

00:31:44.889 --> 00:31:51.959
round-table at a conference last summer. And
I asked Eric, 'Well, what about Wave? Do you

00:31:51.959 --> 00:31:56.970
think that in retrospect that you should have
given Wave more attention because it seemed

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:01.969
to me the kind of product -- it was almost
like Lotus Notes -- it needed more hand holding

00:32:01.969 --> 00:32:06.580
there.' And Eric was adamant in saying, 'This
is not the way we work. We, we put out products

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:14.269
and if they are not taken up by the public,
okay. We tried. And that was it.' So he wasn't

00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:21.039
saying we didn't, we screwed up. It was more
like 'What we do is we take risks and sometimes

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:24.739
they work and sometimes they don't.' So I
thought it was kind of interesting because

00:32:24.739 --> 00:32:31.659
if you look at the way the technological infrastructure
of Google is, down to the data centers and

00:32:31.659 --> 00:32:36.990
some of the software, internal, software there.
Google builds around failure. Right? You buy

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:41.839
this stuff with cheap components and you're
able to -- I actually write about this in

00:32:41.839 --> 00:32:50.039
there even though it's sort of a general audience.
But there's ways that you optimize a system

00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:56.399
to -- you could easily move things out if
they fail and it turns out to be more efficient

00:32:56.399 --> 00:33:01.690
and, and expedient and in the long run there.
So it's interesting that both the under the

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:08.799
hood kind of stuff at Google kind of accommodates
failure. And the stated way that you introduce

00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:14.669
products from the top of the stack also accommodates
failure there. So in a way you can say Google

00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:20.399
is a culture of failure.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Well it does seem like we're

00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:24.879
willing to throw more things at the wall and
understand that some of it won't succeed.

00:33:24.879 --> 00:33:26.979
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Um hmm.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: And that's how you get a lot

00:33:26.979 --> 00:33:31.279
of these products like Gmail or Ads or Adsense
that really do succeed. And it seems like

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:36.059
-- I always love when people say, 'Oh Google
had Wave' or 'Google had this product'. It's

00:33:36.059 --> 00:33:38.850
like unless you're trying, you're not going
to figure out whether that's successful.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:42.409
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Yeah. But it, but it, but
it, but in some cases before you get the hook,

00:33:42.409 --> 00:33:45.360
maybe you could let the timer go on a little
longer.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.649
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Yeah.

00:33:46.649 --> 00:33:51.989
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: Thank you again
for coming. I grew up in the East. Manufacturing

00:33:51.989 --> 00:33:59.600
was big when I was young. Kind of like here.
And what would you, if you went to Ford Motor

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:04.889
Company, General Motors, Chrysler. They were,
the, companies when my parents were young,

00:34:04.889 --> 00:34:08.460
when I was young. That's where you wanted
to work. A lot of innovation happening there.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.520
But now it's the Rust Belt. It seems like
it's dying.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.060
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Um hmm.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: If you were invited

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:19.879
there what you learned both at Google and
Silicon Valley, what would be one thing you

00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:23.460
would tell them to change to do better than
what they're doing?

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:29.889
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Some of the lessons that I
hope that any person who's interested in management

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:40.559
and, and issues like that can draw from Google,
the way I describe it is, I guess on one hand,

00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:47.119
it's reliance on data to make decisions. Google
works on this data and testing which is something

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:51.839
you all know. But that's something that's
really not as well known at least to the extent

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:57.779
that you do it and how you do it. And I was
fascinated to learn about some of the ways

00:34:57.779 --> 00:35:09.650
that you -- in terms of things like -- the
almost cap and trade system you have for speed.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:15.089
Like how people trade those things off and
things like that. And they have an auction

00:35:15.089 --> 00:35:19.579
kind of bidding system for resources. The
data centers . How that's really baked into

00:35:19.579 --> 00:35:23.650
the system. I think that's very interesting.
But I guess even more important, just the

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:30.750
core of it is the idea that these, the decisions
made ideally at Google aren't personal decisions

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.990
but they're made on the basis of what data
the information you can bring to the table

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:40.059
to bring things your way and the way in product
groups -- how the product managers can't boss

00:35:40.059 --> 00:35:45.680
the engineers around but have to basically
convince them that their direction for a product

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.730
might be the right direction. That's, that's
kind of interesting. And elevating engineers.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:54.750
And I talk about this -- how Google really
is a company where the engineers, the technical

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:59.099
people really rule. And if you are not a technical
person, you just have to accept that. You

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:06.420
have to accept your place in that, that, that
world there. One guy who was one of the top

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.430
sales guys told me he learned early on that
basically Larry and Sergey - and these are

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:18.040
his words - ' don't give a rat's ass about
people like us. Maybe we're useful in the

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:23.130
overall sense of things but it's really the
engineers who are on top.' And actually I

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:29.320
think you get more done that way. I like makers
and I like -- I wrote 'Hackers'. I like those

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.890
people. So one thing I talk about is some
Googlers who go to Washington and they're

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:36.220
appalled that there's none of that mentality
there.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:40.550
[laughter]
That one person who left Google told me, 'I've

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.359
been in the White House for six months. I
haven't met one engineer.'

00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:45.920
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And this is actually a good

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.420
and valid criticism about government. Seeing
where we are. This is a country run by lawyers,

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.420
right?
[laughter]

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.910
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And Google they have a lot
of lawyers but the lawyers are actually told,

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.890
'Your job isn't to say no. Your job is to
figure out how to work out, how we can get

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:07.010
done what we want to get done.' As someone
who has dealt with lawyers personally, I think

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:10.391
that's pretty good. So those are lessons that
I think can be drawn from that.

00:37:10.391 --> 00:37:15.170
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: So do you think that -- I think
relying on data overall is a huge strength

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.859
for Google and it helps us make some really
hard decisions. Do you think it also gives

00:37:18.859 --> 00:37:24.630
us a blind spot in areas with like Evan leaving
to go do Twitter and Paul Buchheit leaving

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:30.160
to go do Friend Feed and Four Square? Do you
think that our emphasis on data creates that

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.770
vulnerability in some areas?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well, in those cases, I don't

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.980
think it was the emphasis on data. It was
just a question. It gets to be a bigger company

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:42.700
and Google is a company that in the hiring
process selects people who have a low tolerance

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:47.560
for bureaucracy. That's the kind of person
that Google wants to work here. An ambitious

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:52.250
person who's gonna get really annoyed when
some corporate rule prevents him or her from

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:57.470
doing what he or she wants to do. So a certain
amount of bureaucracy is inevitable in a company

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:02.020
that's 24, 26 -- it's like the debt clock.
It keeps going up as we speak.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.440
[laughter]
And how many people who are here? So that's

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:13.069
a natural force to drive the people who are
core Googlers away from Google. And the big

00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:20.630
challenge is how you stop that? How you minimize
what the inevitable forces of bureaucracy

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:25.930
or how do you do this thing that has to be
done. How you keep things really interesting

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:31.190
for people and allow them to work on the interesting
things they want to work on which is sort

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:37.839
of the Montessori ideal. We haven't talked
about that. And so I think that -- I've talked

00:38:37.839 --> 00:38:43.940
to, to, to Paul. Maybe it's a different kind
of case because Google took his product and

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:51.880
maybe didn't do with it what he had in mind.
But that, that, that, that to me is a key.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.519
You're always gonna get good applicants but
the really kind of applicants that are the

00:38:56.519 --> 00:39:00.260
Googliest people, it gets tougher and tougher
as the company gets bigger.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:05.140
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: As a journalist,
what do you wish Google were doing to help

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:10.170
save the news industry?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: I'm not a big finger pointer

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:16.040
at Google itself as, as some places it's tanked
the news industry. I think Craig's List is

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.110
-- I know -- Craig's a nice guy and all
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:25.150
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: it has done more to erode
it. But I think there's probably things that

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:33.109
Google could do more though I think it's putting
a reasonable amount of effort into it. A lot

00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:39.811
of journalists are like really – maybe give
more coverage to that related to other things

00:39:39.811 --> 00:39:47.820
than one might see. I think that one thing
Google could do and I don't see that as much.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:52.430
Maybe Panda could help in this but it wasn't
a specific goal of Panda is that I would just

00:39:52.430 --> 00:40:00.099
love to see the results in both Google News
and Search to make sure you get the source

00:40:00.099 --> 00:40:04.610
of a story as opposed to whoever aggregated
it. It just galls journalists who produce

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:11.619
a story that the Huffington Post description
of a story winds up way high when your original

00:40:11.619 --> 00:40:16.600
story that they're stealing from -- and I
think it is stealing -- is on page three . How

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.359
can that be? And isn't there a signal for
that?

00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:24.200
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: So you would even want to see
like not just the original story ranking but

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.180
like some way to know that this is this person
-- they really wrote this story.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.369
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: That would be good too but
I'm just thinking. To me --

00:40:30.369 --> 00:40:33.089
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Get it right.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: if I'm just looking for a

00:40:33.089 --> 00:40:37.700
story the most relevant result would be the
original story and not the way some Huffington

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:47.690
Post or Newser or someone else or blogger
encapsulated it in a way so that people won't

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:53.599
go to the length to go to my story.
[pause]

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:57.140
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Um hmm. Cool.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: I am fascinated

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.829
by the four products you mentioned in the
book and also their success or failure. The

00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:03.050
first product is Gmail -- it came from a Google
20% project. Its success might say from the

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:05.990
book that it caught the attention of Larry
and Sergey because it helped them to solve

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:11.650
the e-mail problem. It was a success. But
then the OKR because no one in Google understands

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:20.720
it and never got the resource and it fell
flat. Then there's external purchase -- the

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.280
Dodge Ball. Still the fate is nobody understands
it in Google and never [pause] got the resource

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.280
it needs.
&gt;&gt;Stephen: A Dodge Ball fan, there.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.280
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Yeah.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.960
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Facebook's in the back. Microsoft's
in the back.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:35.960
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: And the last example
is the internal product – Google Video -- where

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:41.000
we have lawyers know too much of the industry.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: What was the final product?

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.470
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: The Google Video.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: All these are discussed in

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.059
the book by the way.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: That's right. Did

00:41:45.059 --> 00:41:48.220
you draw parallel or comparison between these
four product failures and success either internally

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:56.569
or externally? Do you think Google will become
a big company and because of the constraint

00:41:56.569 --> 00:42:02.099
or lack of familiarity with subject matter
constrain Google finding new product area

00:42:02.099 --> 00:42:08.230
where it gets a successful funding, assuming
it's a start up where YouTube or Dodge Ball

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:11.710
get funding from VC instead of internal policy
maker

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:14.119
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Right
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: understanding or

00:42:14.119 --> 00:42:18.119
not. What's your suggestion on that?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Well it's interesting. Of

00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:23.480
all the products, I don't think there's one,
necessarily one thread between all those things

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:30.730
you mentioned. One thing where bigness definitely
had a, a, an effect on was the Google Video

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:36.530
thing. One thing, point I make in the book
and this became very transparent because all

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:42.160
the e-mails from the early days of Google
Video and the early days of YouTube became

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:50.359
open to the public when the Viacom filed suit
there. So you compare the e-mails of Google

00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:55.690
video to the e-mails of the very small YouTube
team over the pizza shop. Right? And Google

00:42:55.690 --> 00:43:01.040
video -- there was a lot of energy being spent
doing slide shows for the GPS and talking

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:06.869
to lawyers about what they could do and how
to do the right thing in copyright. And at

00:43:06.869 --> 00:43:10.230
YouTube, they were just saying, ' Hey. Let's
just do it all. We'll let it all shake out

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:16.150
later. We just want videos up, videos up,
videos up.' So it's not surprising given that

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:24.289
that YouTube whipped Google video to the point
where -- to its credit, Google recognized,

00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:31.100
'Whoa. If we want to play on this playground,
we've gotta get these guys' and they overpaid.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:36.940
Eric said, under oath, that they overpaid
a billion dollars but that looks like a pretty

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:43.160
good deal now. I actually said as a thought
experiment on Twitter a couple weeks ago.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:49.009
'If you had to buy either company now and
YouTube were standalone, which would you buy?

00:43:49.009 --> 00:43:51.529
YouTube or Groupon?'
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Hmm.

00:43:51.529 --> 00:43:56.651
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: And I think most people would
say 'YouTube'. I would say, 'YouTube' though

00:43:56.651 --> 00:44:05.460
the word is that Google offered six billion
dollars for Groupon. Right? So maybe now,

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:10.460
I don't know how much YouTube would be worth
in the open market. But I just thought it's

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.390
an interesting comparison.
[pause]

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:17.140
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: Can you share with
us what you're working on next? Your next

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.690
book?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: If I knew, I would happily

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:23.519
share.
[laughter]

00:44:23.519 --> 00:44:29.000
I actually -- during the whole time I was
working on this, I was also holding down employment

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:37.160
at Wired Magazine and at some, a few times
the two tracks converged and I with Google's

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:43.130
understanding, I wrote stories for Wired that
were drawn from, from my research on, on,

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:48.180
on the book and I wrote other kinds of stories
also for Wired. So I was workin' pretty hard.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:52.720
So I'd like the next few months at least just
to work at one place. It would be almost like

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.869
a vacation.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:44:53.869 --> 00:44:55.960
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: So first I would

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.950
like to say thank-you very much for writing
'Hackers'

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:58.950
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: You're welcome.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: In a lot of ways

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.950
that book influenced
[applause]

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:04.230
my choice to come here.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: I hope one day you thank me

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.250
for writing 'In the Plex'.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: I'm only three

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:07.750
quarters of the way through it.
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Okay.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:12.130
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Second, we're a
steward of an extraordinary amount of personal

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:17.150
information, search habits, e-mail, etc. and
we can often imagine products that would be

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:20.609
very useful for people and that a lot of people
would want to adopt. But there would also

00:45:20.609 --> 00:45:24.839
be component of the community that would find
it just downright creepy. And it's hard for

00:45:24.839 --> 00:45:29.069
me oftentimes when I look at a product to
decide. This is gonna creep people out so

00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:32.420
much that there will be a massive negative
reaction and we will never be able to release

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:38.230
the product. How can we expose these features
to people in the community and get comfort

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:42.019
and confidence in the users so that we can
actually make these things available?

00:45:42.019 --> 00:45:47.609
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: That's a real tough question
and I do mention the time and it happened

00:45:47.609 --> 00:45:56.359
at a GPS when it was decided not to put face
recognition into Google Goggles. And the reason

00:45:56.359 --> 00:46:05.359
was technically it was impossible but that
would be too radioactive to do and I think

00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:10.730
it just came up again recently and I think
the feeling was we'll also wait for someone

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:16.369
else to do it first there. It's a tough question
but a couple times Google's done it. I did

00:46:16.369 --> 00:46:23.670
sit in, I really lobbied hard to sit in to
a meeting of the Privacy Council that takes

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:32.030
place and looks at the products in terms of
a privacy lens. And the top, the product under

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:36.950
discussion then was a feature in Latitude
which tracked people's whereabouts which was

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:44.980
a potentially creepy thing. But there was
all sorts of extra reminders to people that

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:50.001
it was totally opt-in and reminders to people
that 'You've opted in' and every couple of

00:46:50.001 --> 00:46:54.529
months it was decided you'd get a further
reminder. 'Hey you're still opted in with

00:46:54.529 --> 00:47:00.960
this. You're still leaving bread crumbs everywhere
you go'. And that came out and I was really

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:07.190
curious to see if there was any push back
and there wasn't there. So it is possible

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:11.619
to -- in a way -- to let people know exactly
what you're doing. If you're really up front

00:47:11.619 --> 00:47:21.769
about it and you're really clear about that
you built in these safeguards that only people

00:47:21.769 --> 00:47:27.190
who want, understand and want to use it are
using it, I think things, things, things could

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:32.260
work there. I think that in interest based
advertising when Google rolled it out, Google

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:38.690
did a very good job of priming the privacy
groups and that came out with very little

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:47.369
flap. Larry told me once, that he said it's
really almost random what products come out

00:47:47.369 --> 00:47:52.900
and people go crazy about a privacy aspect
of it. He said it's almost like you can't

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.140
predict it. Some headline writer'll write
that it's creepy and people will, will, will

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:03.109
go nuts there. It's true to a certain degree
but I think there's plenty you could do by

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:08.510
being vigilant and then by getting ahead of
the game and being really up front about it.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:12.690
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: And it was interesting when
gmail launched, somebody registered gmail

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:18.019
is too creepy dot com and yet people were
talking about making g-mail illegal. And now,

00:48:18.019 --> 00:48:21.210
if you try to take away people's gmail, there
might be riots.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.170
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Right
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Where people got really unhappy

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.940
about it. So it seems like there's a little
bit of both. Sometimes you can predict.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.410
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Right.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: And yet it never hurts to over-communicate.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:31.529
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Right. Well gmail is an interesting
case 'cause I think that's where Google got

00:48:31.529 --> 00:48:36.099
thrust really into the privacy spotlight.
And it's surprising it went that long without

00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:43.760
it because there have been sort of this building
discomfort with the effectiveness with which

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:51.559
Google could pluck un, un, unsavory items
about people and put them high in search results

00:48:51.559 --> 00:48:58.490
and people were unhappy with that all along.
I think that's a continuing privacy concern

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:03.220
for Google even though Google wasn't, isn't
responsible directly for those things appearing

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:08.499
on the Web, Google is the means by which most
people see that. So I think that Google should

00:49:08.499 --> 00:49:14.730
take ownership of that problem and somehow
do a better job of, of, of not making people

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:19.029
go to places like Reputation Defender having
to spend thousands of dollars to fix their

00:49:19.029 --> 00:49:21.269
Google results.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Do you think that privacy will

00:49:21.269 --> 00:49:25.509
always be Google's Kryptonite? Like when we
rolled out or tried to roll out free wi-fi

00:49:25.509 --> 00:49:29.710
in San Francisco, people were like, 'Oh Google
might know what you're searching for on the

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:33.279
free wi-fi' and now that's dead. It seems
like no matter what..

00:49:33.279 --> 00:49:34.390
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Is that what killed it? Do
you really think so?

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:38.059
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Oh I-- there were at least people
who were speculating about that back in the

00:49:38.059 --> 00:49:43.520
day like Vern at the San Francisco Chronicle
wrote a whole article about that. Do you think

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.270
anything Google launches people are always
going to be looking for that privacy angle

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.069
or?
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Oh of course they're going

00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:55.119
to be looking for it but it's possible that
you could get around it. I guess one, one,

00:49:55.119 --> 00:50:01.049
one thing is the amount of work you have to
do can be underestimated like in gmail, I

00:50:01.049 --> 00:50:07.150
think the problem was, the assumption was
that once people understood that you really

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:10.980
weren't sitting in a room and reading their
mail, they would say, 'Oh. Okay. I'll just

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:19.500
go away.' But actually it just uncovered the
larger issues of privacy there and put Google

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:24.779
into the era of privacy scrutiny which I think
is appropriate to Google and any company which

00:50:24.779 --> 00:50:28.009
deals in this stuff should be scrutinized
for what it does in privacy.

00:50:28.009 --> 00:50:31.349
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: So I think we've got time for
one more question and then Stephen, you're

00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:33.779
willing to stick around in order to...
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: I'll sign every book if you

00:50:33.779 --> 00:50:35.529
bring it up there.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Whoever wants it.

00:50:35.529 --> 00:50:37.970
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: I'm here. 'Cause I don't want
to leave this place.

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.420
[laughter]
If you open Andalé&nbsp; , I'll sign them twice.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.299
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughing] And Stephen will

00:50:42.299 --> 00:50:47.480
be outside by the micro kitchen out there.
So go ahead.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.940
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: Having closely
observed the top management here, were there

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:54.559
instances where you felt something didn't
make sense the way they're working? I could

00:50:54.559 --> 00:50:57.150
do a better job than most of these people
are doing?

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.359
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: It happens to us

00:51:00.359 --> 00:51:05.849
when we look at others. And did it turn out
that after a long time it made sense that

00:51:05.849 --> 00:51:09.430
what they did was right, or did it turn out
that yes I was correct, these people screwed

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:12.230
up?
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs]

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:15.490
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Was that a comment or a question?
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: That's a question.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:19.090
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Yeah, yeah. How do I?
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: What would you consider something

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:25.410
where you second guessed Google and were you
right or not? You know, were you wrong?

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:34.259
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Oh right. Let me think. Umm.
[pause] I think where I was right and they

00:51:34.259 --> 00:51:38.640
weren't -- umm.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Where you said, I can't believe

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:42.520
Google's about to do this bone-headed thing,
did it turn out to be bone-headed?

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.640
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: It sounds familiar to me.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughing]

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.440
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: I know I've thought it somewhere.
[laughter]

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:58.279
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: But I'm blanking on the circumstances.
Maybe in terms of the, the deal with Yahoo.

00:51:58.279 --> 00:51:59.770
I knew that was big trouble.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Umm hmm.

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:04.440
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: I knew that was big trouble.
And as it turned out, it was big trouble because

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.589
you came within a few hours of a company being
ruled as a company in violation of the anti-trust

00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:09.589
rules.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Umm hmm.

00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:12.471
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: So that was a problem.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Good.

00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:15.900
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: So there you go.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Okay. So one last fun one before

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:21.619
you go. If there were a Google movie, who
would you want to play..

00:52:21.619 --> 00:52:23.369
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Oh no.
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Larry and Sergey? [laughs]

00:52:23.369 --> 00:52:24.369
[laughter]
Anybody in particular?

00:52:24.369 --> 00:52:31.589
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: I don't know. Let's see. Um.
For the young Larry and Sergey, right. So

00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:34.000
you get Michael Cera as…
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: [laughs loudly]

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.859
[audience laughter]
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: Oh. Oh. On that note, thank

00:52:36.859 --> 00:52:40.539
you very much. Stephen Levy. [laughs] Great.
[applause]

00:52:40.539 --> 00:52:44.680
&gt;&gt;Stephen Levy: Thank you all for cooperating
with me.
