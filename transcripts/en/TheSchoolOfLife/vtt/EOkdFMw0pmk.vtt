00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.600
Ralph Waldo Emerson is the father of
American literature.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.980
In a series of strikingly original essays, written in
the mid-nineteenth century,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.789
he fundamentally changed the way that
America saw its cultural and artistic

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.200
possibilities, and he enabled a
separation from transatlantic literary traditions.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.399
"We have listened too long...", he wrote, "...to the Courtly muses of Europe."

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.140
Emerson's abjection of cultural
traditions brought about what one

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.210
contemporary called: "America's
intellectual declaration of independence."

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.210
and he established generational conflict
and transformation as commanding ideas

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.100
in American literature.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.960
Emerson himself hardly seemed destined
to fit a revolutionary mold.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.149
He was born in 1803, the son of a Boston
preacher, and was descended from a line

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.719
of New England ministers that went back
to the bedrock of seventeenth-century

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.970
Puritanism. When his father died in 1811, 
his mother took in boarders to pay the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.570
rent.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.610
Still, she sent her son to Harvard in
1817, and then Harvard divinity school to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.100
train for the priesthood in 1825.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.630
As a young man,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.100
Emerson was strongly influenced by a
remarkable aunt of his: Mary Moody Emerson,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.509
who though self-taught, had read
everything from Shakespeare to the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.100
romantics and it formed a unique
religious perspective based on piety

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.630
nature and literature, that would
resonate powerfully in the life and work

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.770
of her nephew.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.329
So when Emerson was ordained in 1829,
marrying the love of his life

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.040
Ellen Tucker in the same year, he was
already unsatisfied with the formal

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.000
nature of New England religious
orthodoxy.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
When Ellen died of tuberculosis just two years later, he
resigned from the church

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.800
and soon after embarked on a trip to Europe.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.000
Leaving on Christmas Day 1832,
two crucial things happened to Emerson

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.200
on that tour of europe.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.900
In Paris, he went to the famous "Jardin des Plantes",

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.200
a botanical and zoological garden.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.900
There he had an epiphany.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.440
Writing in his journal that: "I feel the
centipede in me,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.500
the Cayman, carp, eagle and Fox...

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.200
...I am moved by strange sympathies. I say
continually: I will be a naturalist.".

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.300
Emerson's insight was that nature is in us, a part of us,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.300
and not just its higher forms,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.400
but in all its grotesquerie and
wildness.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.500
The second thing that happened on that
tour, was that Emerson met the English

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.700
romantic poets: Samuel Taylor Coleridge
and William Wordsworth,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.900
and found them rather ordinary, dry 
and conservative men.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.400
The insight that Emerson drew from this,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.739
was that if great men could be so
ordinary,

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.400
why should not ordinary men be great?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
as he would write a few years later,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.910
meek young men grow up in libraries, believing
it their duty, to accept the views which

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.489
Cicero, Locke, Bacon have given. Forgetful
that Cicero, Locke and Bacon were only

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.730
young men in libraries when they wrote
these books.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.200
Emerson had found two ideas that would
guide his life's work.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.000
That man and nature are one

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and that everyone can
recognize that they are

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.060
a uniquely, significant human being.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.900
On his return to America in 1833, Emerson
became a professional lecturer

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.000
giving talks on natural history and literature

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in halls around New England.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.500
He remarried and had several children,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.700
presenting a stolid, bourgeois
appearance to the world.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.400
But his inner life was full of
turbulence and originality.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.739
In his 1836 essay, "Nature",

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.260
Emerson outlined the germ of a new
philosophy, a key element of this, was the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.500
importance of American originality. In
its opening lines, Emerson wrote:

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.690
"Our age is retrospective, it builds the sepulchres
of the fathers. It writes biographies,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.500
histories and criticism. The foregoing
generations beheld God and nature face to face;

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.400
we, through their eyes. Why should not we
also enjoy an original relation to the universe?".

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.900
America, needed to stop looking
back to its European heritage

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.300
and start looking about it self.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.800
No past moment was more important,
than the present moment.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.300
No tradition was more important, than
novelty.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.800
No generation, was better than the current generation.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.400
Everything that
matters is here now insisted Emerson,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.210
and that here was: America.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.710
This was an extension of Emerson's ideas,
about the significance of the individual

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.100
that came under the heading of what he
called "self-reliance".

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.100
Everywhere Emerson looked, he saw people leading lives that were based on tradition,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.800
that were limited by religious forms and social
habits.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.730
No one could be themselves, Emerson
thought, because they were all too busy

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.190
being what they were supposed to be.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.900
Emerson wanted to get rid of each of
these burdens:

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.400
the past, religion and social forms,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.100
so that each person could
find out who they truly were.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.170
As he put it:

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.350
"History is an impertinence and an injury;

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.500
Our religion, we have not chosen, but
society has chosen for us...

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.800
And...

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.700
...Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the
manhood of every one of its members."

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.850
We must, he argued, live from within
trusting nothing but our own intuitions.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.890
For, as he concluded...

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.290
...nothing is at last sacred but the
integrity of your own mind.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.590
This leaves open a vital question: What
is your nature...

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.860
...once you've rid yourself of history,
tradition and religion?

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.490
What can be said is that it isn't
necessarily self-indulgence, haterism

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.870
or narcissism.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.720
Rather, it's the surrender to that force
which Emerson recognized back in the

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.500
Jardin des Plantes.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.900
An obedience to nature itself.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.800
By nature, Emerson seem to mean the natural world: 
plants, animals, rocks and sky,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.810
but what he really meant was God.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.490
Emerson was a "Pantheist". That is, someone
who believe that God exists in every

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.630
part of creation, from the smallest grain
of sand to the stars.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.800
But also crucially that the divine spark
is in each of us.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.400
In following ourselves,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.720
we are therefore not merely being fickle or selfish,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.200
we are rather, releasing a divine will,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.000
that history, society and organized religion normally hide from us.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.800
The individual as
Emerson writes "is a God in ruins".

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.010
But we have it within us, by casting off all
custom to rebuild ourselves

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.380
Emerson makes this Pantheist connection,
explicit in what are perhaps his most

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.800
famous lines.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.600
"Crossing a bear common, in
snow puddles at twilight under a clouded sky,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.660
without having in my thoughts any
occurrence of special good fortune,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.900
I've enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am
glad to the brink of fear,

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.360
standing on the bare ground, my head
bathed by the blythe air and uplifted

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.010
into infinite space, all mean egotism vanishes...

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.280
...I become a transparent eyeball...

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.700
...I am nothing...

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:28.400
...I see all. The currents of
the universal being circulate through me...

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.780
...I am part or particle of God!

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.700
In the Romantic tradition on which
Emerson draws, it is the sublime,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.700
great mountains, rushing torrance, dark forests,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.700
which releases the inner vision as we find ourselves in all of them.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.850
For Emerson,

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.400
it's a perfectly dull walk across an
ordinary common on a dark winter's evening

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.200
that brings him, to the brink of fear.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.400
Emerson's God, is in the snow puddles too.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.120
Stood there on the common,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.980
he disappears, becoming nothing as the
currents of God flow through him.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.300
What is left is just, a transparent
eyeball.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.600
Such transcendent moments are rare,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.060
but they reveal an essential
connection between nature, God and man.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.890
They are one.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.600
They also give Emerson a proper sense of
each individual's importance,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.220
as a part of God.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.300
Transcendentalism became the name of the
movement that grew up around Emerson,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.200
at this time.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.200
Another aspect of the epiphany
that was to have a profound

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.740
effect on American literature, was the
emphasis on the value of the ordinary.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.800
What Emerson put forward in essays like
"The American scholar" and "the poet",

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.250
was that the American every day, was a proper
subject for literature.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.200
This was because for Emerson, the
transcendentalist God is everywhere,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.910
and it's the poet's job to reveal this.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:57.190
"There is no object...", he wrote, "...so foul that
intense light will not make it beautiful."

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:03.190
"...Even a corpse has its own beauty." This
coming from a man who had opened his

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.800
first wife's tomb a year after her death...

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.800
...to take a look!

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.300
The great American writers, who followed Emerson,

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.870
were liberated by his work to
look around and write about what they

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.820
saw and how they lived,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.000
transforming the everyday into a vital
symbol of something higher and more elusive.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.630
Henry David Thoreau's two years
at Walden Pond, became a book that showed

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:30.310
the cosmos reflected in the depths of
the waters of a mere pond.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.400
The poet Walt Whitman said: "I was
simmering, simmering, simmering...

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.390
...Emerson brought me to a boil."

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.230
Emily Dickinson heard a fly and could
write of the other side of death.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.900
The novelist Herman Melville, took a whaling voyage,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.400
and made it an allegory
of American imperialism and the defiance of nature.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.580
In the 20th century, the
American critic Harold Bloom looked back

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.000
at Emerson's originality and saw in it
the origin of:

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.800
"The strong tradition of American poets."

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.640
From Robert Frost and
Wallace Stevens to John Ashbery,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.400
Emerson's legacy to american literature
and culture and indeed to the world,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.000
was one of ceaseless invention and forward
momentum.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.250
As he put it: "I unsettle all things...

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.250
...no facts are to me sacred, none are profane...

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:23.010
...I simply experiment an endless seeker
with no past at my back."

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.650
people of

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.200
Paul pronouncing his name if you don't
speak German it's not at all obvious how

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.550
you're supposed to say it a safe bet is
to start with a hard was a great check

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.410
writer who has come to own a part of the
human emotional spectrum which we can

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.250
now call the casket desk and which
thanks to him

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:51.750
where
