Chandra Balasubramarian: Cardinal Commerce, 
what we do today,

00:00:05.958 --> 00:00:12.667
is we provide for over 70,000 retailers
the ability to authenticate payments,

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.042
accept alternative payments,

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:20.583
like Google Check-Out, PayPal, Amazon,
using a single, easy to use interface.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.250
So, that's the core of what we provide.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.833
And the way we're kind of extending
that on to the mobile--

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:28.417
and that's what we're here
to present today--

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:33.250
is essentially taking that experience of
working with those 70, 000 retailers

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.792
in the e-commerce world.

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:36.417
We have taken that and said,

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:40.042
"Hey, let's extend a similar model
out to the mobile environment."

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:43.167
And then today, we're working
with a lot of mobile retailers,

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:44.875
providing them the ability to again,

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:50.292
accept a lot of alternative payments
as well as credit card transactions.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:53.958
And then we also provide
for the development community,

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.458
the retailer community, 

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:58.667
an Android library that they can simply install.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:04.083
If you look at the trend that's happening today
is there are a lot of different convergents,

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:09.667
or different applications where multiple
products from multiple retailers

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:13.125
are being made available
from more than one single app.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:16.500
So what we call that is
"syndicated check-out."

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.167
So essentially, what you're doing is
the retailer syndicates their products out

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:24.833
to a shop savvy through Google
Shopping application

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:29.667
and then today you're using the bar
code scanner to do a price comparison

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.125
and then go click on that.

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:33.750
You get sent to the retailer's
website to purchase.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.375
But some of the other trends
are gonna be in-app purchase.

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:36.958
I see this.

00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:37.917
I scan this.

00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:40.458
It's cheaper than retailer X, Y, Z.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:44.125
I wanna buy it right now without having
to go through five different screens,

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:45.917
even if it's a mobile device.

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:48.500
If you look at kind of all three put together,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.208
the Android operating system,

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:53.292
the Google Check-Out
payment infrastructure,

00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:56.292
and then the Google Wallet
technology infrastructure.

00:01:56.292 --> 00:01:59.917
I mean all three things kind of combine
and make it a rich experience

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:03.375
to the developer community,
to the retailers,

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:06.083
and from an integrator
point of view, for us,

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:10.125
to bring all these parties together
into the ecosystem.
