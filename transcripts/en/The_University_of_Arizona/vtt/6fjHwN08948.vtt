00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.990
We got some animals.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.260
And we exposed them
to green light.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.730
And then we tested them.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.630
And we saw that they developed
better capacity to handle

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.220
uncomfortable stimulus.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.050
The more we optimized the
system, the more potent,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.980
if you will, the effect
of the green light became.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.240
And I thought, since this is
very noninvasive, we did not

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.450
see any side-effects
on the animals,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.600
what's holding us from
trying it on humans?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.200
I have fibromyalgia
very severely.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.630
And I've had that for 20
years, terrible, terrible, nine

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.450
or 10 pain.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.350
And this brought it
down quite a bit.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.170
The study is 10 weeks long.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.134
We provide them
with a green light.

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:06.710
And at the end of
the study, I ask

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.630
them to return the light to
us along with some surveys

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.050
to document their pain, how
their pain is improving over

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.420
the 10 weeks period.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.280
So we brought the lights home.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.100
And my husband built
this frame for it.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.090
And for 10 weeks, I did this,
about three feet away from you,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.790
in a darkened room, and do it
for an hour or two every night.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.050
After two days, I could
tell that my pain was less.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.780
And I just couldn't believe it.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.930
You don't expect things to work.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.310
But it worked.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.670
She became happier,
more interactive.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.380
She was doing more stuff
with her family and friends.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.270
And when she returned
the light, she

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.484
was sad because she felt she's
going to lose all that effect.

00:02:04.484 --> 00:02:06.900
So we just contacted her, and
we returned the light to her

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.100
and told her, just use it.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.350
If it's that helpful,
go ahead and use it.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.442
So she was very happy.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.050
I still have pain.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.140
But it's so different
than lying in bed

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.690
and crying with the pain.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.120
It just made a huge difference
in how I felt about myself

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.240
and how I felt about life.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.370
And I owe that to Dr.
Ibrahim and his lights.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.520
I bring to Raj some
of the problems

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.130
we face in the pain clinic
with some of the really hard

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.620
to treat pain conditions.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.310
And we tried to
come up with models

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.570
to see if there are better
ways to manage such pain,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.730
or to at least understand
the nature of that pain.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.690
And once we have
better understanding,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.580
we might be able to
find a better management

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.480
to address that pain.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.160
In this case, it's green light.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.200
It's actually very safe.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.140
So we see a path much faster.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.100
You can imagine
eyeglasses, for example,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.980
being designed that have
the same effect, that people

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.850
can wear.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.180
So that's very important.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.300
But at the same time, while
that progresses to humans,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.950
it's very important for us to
understand how it's working.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.930
And that's where we still
need to do studies in rodents.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.860
We need to make sure that
the mechanisms we envision

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.120
are working to bring
about pain relief

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.580
are actually what's happening.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.280
So one of the goals
we had in mind

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.720
when we started on this project
is define also something

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.740
in addition to being safe and
efficacious, to be affordable.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.240
And thankfully, so far
anyway, light is still cheap.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.070
Not if you want
designer eyeglasses.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.620
Exactly.
