is the thing about this movie that
really sticks with you and it doesn't

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739
really sticks with you and it doesn't
 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.740
really sticks with you and it doesn't
feel like a gimmick either because it

movie and think that was boring because

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160
movie and think that was boring because
 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.009
movie and think that was boring because
nothing really happens it's a lot of

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019
nothing really happens it's a lot of
 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.470
nothing really happens it's a lot of
really really interesting conversations

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
really really interesting conversations
 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.710
really really interesting conversations
and very very cool filmmaking techniques

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720
and very very cool filmmaking techniques
 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.270
and very very cool filmmaking techniques
it's not really until the film draws to

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280
it's not really until the film draws to
 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.039
it's not really until the film draws to
a close where you realize it's messages

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049
a close where you realize it's messages
 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.990
a close where you realize it's messages
about life are very profound Patricia

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000
about life are very profound Patricia
 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.940
about life are very profound Patricia
Arquette Nathan Hawk in particular are

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950
Arquette Nathan Hawk in particular are
 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.619
Arquette Nathan Hawk in particular are
very good in this movie young actor who

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629
very good in this movie young actor who
 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.240
very good in this movie young actor who
plays the boy in the film you do see his

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
plays the boy in the film you do see his
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.009
plays the boy in the film you do see his
performance get a little bit better as

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019
performance get a little bit better as
 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.930
performance get a little bit better as
he starts very young and then gets older

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940
he starts very young and then gets older
 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.180
he starts very young and then gets older
which makes sense because as an actor he

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190
which makes sense because as an actor he
 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.770
which makes sense because as an actor he
is maturing and as a person he's

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780
is maturing and as a person he's
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.750
is maturing and as a person he's
maturing but the idea that I discovered
