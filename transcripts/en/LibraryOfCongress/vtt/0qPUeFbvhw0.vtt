00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.340
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: All right.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.910
Why don't we get going?

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.240
My name is Matt Barton.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.960
I'm the Curator of Recorded
Sound at the Library of Congress.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.700
Usually, I'm down in
Culpepper, but spending a lot

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.000
of time up here this week.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.310
Which is a nice trip
down memory lane for me.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.050
I used to work in this building.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.550
And, I'm also the current
President of the Association

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.360
for Recorded Sound Collections,
ARSC, until May when Cary Ginell,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.500
who's President-In-Waiting,
takes over.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.450
So, we're starting a little late.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.670
I don't want to talk
too much beforehand.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.400
Rather, just jump right
into the introductions

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.820
because I'm lacking
in imagination today.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.760
We're going to do this
alphabetically.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.620 position:56%
And, unfortunately, the first person
in line would be Charles Hardy,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.230
and I haven't seen him yet.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.460
So, we hope that he
makes his way here.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.940
But, I am going to skip to the
next in line alphabetically,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.170
and that is Jonathan Hiam Curator

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.740
of Music Division,
Rodgers and Hammerstein.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.870
Then, we have Matt Karush
from George Mason University

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.450
and Hearing the Americas.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.280
He's also Editor-in-chief of
the Journal of Social History

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.210
and Professor of History at Mason.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.580
Elena Razlogova, excuse me.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.000
Razlogova from Concordia University
where she's an Associate Professor

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.830 position:56%
of History and also is the author of
"The Listener's Voice: Early Radio

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.040
and the American Public".

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.880
And, she's co-editor of Radical
Histories in Digital Culture issue

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.210
of the Radical History Review.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.940
Mark Williams who is
with the, right here.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.780
Dartmouth College and the
media ecology project.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.080
And, finally, Thomas Witherspoon of
the Shortwave Radio Audio Archive

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.550
of which he is the
founder and curator

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.590
of as well the Radio
Spectrum Archive.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.490
And, we also have three discussants
who are sitting down here

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.010
in the front row who
will be jumping in

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.360
and leading things once everybody
gets to give their short talk here.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.490
And, they are Betsey Peterson,
American Folklife Center,

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.900
and Carlene Stephens, and
David Walker from Smithsonian.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.510
So, alphabetically, I think
it's to you, Jonathan Hiam.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:50.050
[ Applause ]

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.350
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Hiam: Thank you, Matt,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.130
and thank you to the
taskforce for inviting me.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.230
It's wonderful to see
everybody, so good morning.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.720
So, I think the panelists and
myself all agree it's a bit

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.640
of an open forum in
a way to talk about,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.180
generally, digital curation here.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.780
So, I thought the best thing I
could do is to tell you a couple

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.390
of the imperatives that we have

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.630
at the New York Public
Library that feed into this.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.190
And, maybe, then, hopefully, raise
some questions from everybody

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.460
so we can start thinking about what
we need to start thinking about.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.650
So, so, anyhow, I want to point
out there were a few things.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.310
So, I'm the curator and part of the
Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.400
of Recorded Sound which is vast.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.260
Next to the Library of
Congress, it's the largest

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.820
in the U.S. We have everything
from performing arts materials

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.380
through spoken word,
industry recordings,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.320
all phases of recorded sound.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.330
So, it's, sort of, a
completist archive in that sense.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.770
Of course, we've got
thousands of radio broadcasts,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.130
and the first thing
I'll say at least

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.320
about the way our collections
are managed.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.690
And, this is probably covering
[inaudible] that's brought

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.040
up already in this conference.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.220
But, just, not just cataloging,
but even inventorying the variety

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.620
of radio programs, the subjects,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.020
is a very complicated
task to begin with.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.540
Many of our radio recordings
have not come

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.710
into the collection as such.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.020
They came with individual's
collection, for example.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.830
Perhaps a famous stage actress
or actor for whom all of their,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.570 position:56%
sort of, great radio broadcasts
were captured on transcription disk.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.030
But, they're not necessarily
identified that way.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.860
Just like news broadcasts have
come in through all kinds of means.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.610
Government recordings, of course,
but we just, we have thousands

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.190
of copies of just home
enthusiasts recording radio

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.390
from the '50s and '60s.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.580
And, again, not necessarily
identified as such.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.880
So, there's a big work

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.480
in just discovering the holdings
we already have, and especially,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.310
strangely enough, even
holdings that we feel

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.460 position:56%
like we've already got a pretty good
amount of intellectual control over.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.040
There are a lot of people packed
into a 15-minute radio broadcast

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.770
on a disk that may
have two or three.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.810
So, there's a lot,
work to be done there.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.050
That being said, what
we're finding from a sort

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.520
of digital curation
standpoint is we've been finding

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.770 position:56%
that there's a very practical need
for first, I would say, staff level,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.190
quick access to the types
of recordings we have.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.350
Because a curation project, often,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.860
at a place like the New York Public
Library is focused either, one,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.610
on an exhibition or two,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.980
maybe trying to reconstruct some
collections or build something

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.520
out for a special purpose.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.400
In particular, educational efforts

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.920
which are among the more recently
really prioritized efforts

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.220
at the New York Public Library.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.310
And, of course, everywhere,
but it speaks well to the theme

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.150
of this conference, I hope, too.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.510
So, to give you an
example, like many places,

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.410
the New York Public Library's
in the middle of building

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.120
out a meaningful interface for
the public to stream digital audio

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.610
and moving image in particular.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.260
The earliest iteration of the
streaming portal for materials

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.410
at the New York Public
Library was actually something

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.500
that was innovated through
the Jerome Rogers, excuse me.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.730
Jerome Robbins Dance Division
at the New York Public Library

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.340 position:56%
for the Performing Arts who acquired
a grant from the Duke Foundation

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.340
to develop a portal to
stream moving image of dance.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.510
That set of, that access point was
fascinating because it was designed

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.990 position:56%
with curatorial tools built into it.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.880
You could kind of create
multi tracts of images.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.000
You could pull in materials from
outside, like YouTube, Disney,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.610
YouTube or other sites and
integrate it with those tools.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.600
It was really well received.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.170
Student populations loved it.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.540
General researchers loved it, but
as all things institutionally,

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.750
as the digital program started
to get bigger and bigger,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.090
that was kind of folded
into a larger platform

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.060
which has now seen a
variety of iterations.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.540
Some more successful than others.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.750
However, it really is
moving in a good direction,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.480 position:56%
and I mention this for a few things.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.750
Because one is the curation
part of it was initially offered

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.640
up as a public tool,
which was really cool.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.700
But, I think what we were finding
was staff was loving the kind

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.460
of quick and dirty access to lists
of files, that either we could use

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.290
because it had the proper, sort of,
file codes that we can recognize

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.100
by aisle or even just
the internal files

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.850
that hadn't gone to cataloging yet.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.470
Because if we knew what they were,

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.540
we could do a lot with
them very quickly.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.180
So, I think we're at a place where,
while we are really looking forward

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.340
to building out public tools for
things like digital curation,

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.090
we're also really looking at
how useful these things are,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.210
fundamentally, on the sort
of interior side of things

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.810
to let us get a grip of
what we have and make

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.920
that material much more useful
to the staff much more quickly.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.700
I would add one other thing, just
a very kind of specific thing,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.860
so the current digital platform

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:14.310
of the New York Public Library
digitalcollections.nypl.org is

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:20.320
starting its next phase of
being aligned with our MMS is

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.720
to have MMS markers that when
materials go into an exhibition.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.220
So, these are things that
are digitized outside

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.540
of a public request, a
researcher or that sort of thing.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.130
These materials will be tagged at
the front end of their clearance.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.660
So, all the rights get
cleared, all of this.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.550
So that it can be put
into this digital portal.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:45.810
Now, they'll be marked with or
soon to be marked with markers

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.770
that will tell us this was
in a particular exhibition.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.430 position:56%
So, you can go in and, now, the
public and the staff can sort things

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.100 position:56%
on the OPAC to sort of show you, oh,
this was, these were digital objects

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.490
that were part of this physical or
digital exhibition four years ago.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.800
And, it's very useful for both the
public and staff in that regard.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.870 position:56%
And, provides a really nice shortcut
for developing educational programs.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.710
Okay. The last thing I'll say,
and I'll get out of your way,

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:16.270
is another thing that's been useful
for us to think about how we want

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.100
to manage and curate our digital
files, as I've mentioned before,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.240
in the context of educational
programs.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.900
One of my colleagues,
Danielle Cordovez, who's here,

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.370
has been working with a grant
called an NYPL Innovation Grant.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.190
Something that's awarded
to staff internally

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.180 position:56%
to do something new and interesting.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.420 position:56%
Danielle has been working on that
project to build out some technology

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.210
that will basically, you know, just
basically be a box of recordings

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.830
that you can take into a
classroom and stream locally.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.780
That's an element of control that
we're increasingly comfortable

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.250
with in terms of protecting
materials, but also being able

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.320
to curate through just
the assimilation of files

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.620
into whatever kind of program
you want to take with you,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.180
just out into a classroom or
out into a branch library.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.350
Keep in mind, the New York
Public Library, though,

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.910
we're representing the
research side of it.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.670
Also has essentially
90 lending libraries

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.160
that we serve in different
ways, too.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.800
So, these sort of simple,
I don't want to say simple

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.100
because the mechanics are not.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.190
But, the simple use of
digital tools to kind

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.550
of aggregate files, see
things more quickly.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.440
It's kind of the human,
cheap version of big data,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.870
helps us put things together very
quickly and makes them portable

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.980
and stretches the boundaries
of what's possible.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.660
So, I'm going to stop at that.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.030
Those are just some loose
things, but to give you a sense

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.080
of where we're at and what we're
thinking about, at least, you know,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.870
myself and my colleagues
who are here.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.800
We can't speak on behalf
of the whole library,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.130
but nobody really can do that.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.430
So, anyway.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.510
Thanks. You want to take
questions at the end, or?

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.260
Thank you, Jonathan, and I
think next, we have Matt Karush.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.670
&gt;&gt; Matt Karush: Thanks very much.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.240
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Want
to do it from there?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.540
&gt;&gt; Matt Karush: What's that?

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.840
Yeah, can I stay here?

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.140
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: By all means.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.440
&gt;&gt; Matt Karush: Is that all right?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.740
Will that work?

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.040
Okay. So, I'm here.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.340
I'm a professor at
George Mason University,

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.110
but I'm here representing the
project Hearing the Americas.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:17.150
In which I'm sort of
a co-Lead Historian,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.490
I think is my official title.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:23.520 position:56%
But, this is a project housed at the
Center for History and New Media,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.610
the Roy Rosenzweig Center for
History and New Media at Mason.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.360
It has, we have digital
projects for the public,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.580
planning grant from the NEH.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:38.140 position:56%
And, the idea is to put together an
accessible digital public humanities

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.460
project aimed at increasing user's
understanding of the early history

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.360
of recorded popular music.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.910
It's actually not radio at all, so
I feel a little out of place here.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:51.800
But, in any case, I think it
raises some overlapping issues.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.410
The inspiration for this came,
really, from the availability

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:02.270
of a huge amount of recorded music
from the period between the 1890s

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.950
and the 1920, thanks,
principally to two collections,

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.880
the National Jukebox from here
at the Library of Congress

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.970
and the University of
California Santa Barbara cylinder

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.270
audio archive.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.580
So, between those two collections,
users have, really, immediate

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.990
and kind of amazing access to
more than 20,000 recordings

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:31.080
from that early period in the
history of recorded music.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.120
And, I, both me and my
colleague, Mike O'Malley,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.210
who's the other Lead Historian
on this, have made efforts to use

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.210
that material in classes with
different amounts of success.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:49.530
But, one thing we noticed is that
even, even the most well-educated

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.950
of our students, the students who
came to the material as music fans,

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.140
music buffs, interested in music
history and quite knowledgeable

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.680
about music history, were
basically unable to make much use

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.670
of that material unless we
provided a great deal of guidance.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.010
And, that really, you know,

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.340
from a pedagogical perspective
wasn't particularly a

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.850
shocking realization.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.120
But, it did bring home
to us the fact

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.980
that even though these collections
have made these recordings,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.170
you know, they put them
right at your fingertips,

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.800
and they're very well, sort of,
tagged and searchable and it's just

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.920
in a very, they're both very
efficient websites to use.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:31.260
But, despite that, for somebody
who's not pretty significantly well

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.860
versed in both that
period in music history,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.390
but also that period
in history, period.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.630
It's quite difficult to
make sense of that material.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.230
It basically all sounds
the same to people.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.680
They have trouble, kind of,
making anything out of it.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.050
Maybe I'll say a word
about why that might be.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.480
But, in any case, that's
where we're coming in trying

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.140
to put together what's
basically, I guess,

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.550
a website that's providing a great
deal of, that will, hopefully,

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.660
provide a great deal of
contextualization to sort of make,

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.190
help users make sense of
these collections and sort

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.410
of use them, right,
make use of them.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.680 position:56%
The two collections that I mentioned
give users immediate access

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.880
to a really wide range of different
forms of music, marches, tangos,

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.540
ragtime, foxtrots, cakewalks,
Hawaiian, serenades, opera,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.640
ethnic songs, lots of ethnic,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.530
lots of ethnic humor,
for better or for worse.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.570
Minstrel show routines, also
for better or for worse.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.900
But, the whole panoply of
American popular music before 1925,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.710 position:56%
and they require contextualization
in at least, I think, two main ways.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:47.150 position:56%
First of all, we hope to provide a
lot of significant contextualization

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.070
on the issue of the formal
properties of music, right,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:55.110
so that users could begin to start
to hear the recordings in a way

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.140
that they probably can't when
they first start streaming.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:04.600
So, this is, you know, topics
from syncopation, improvisation,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.630
being able to identify
certain kinds of rhythms,

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.930
certain instrumental techniques
on different kinds of instruments,

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.860
band arrangements, etc.
And, obviously, sort of,

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.290
that project of contextualization
raises issues

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.620
of digital curation, right?

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.910
It raises kind of challenges
how to do that effectively.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.520
Then, the second kind of
contextualization we're interested

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.350
in is more historical, right,
trying to make understandable

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:36.240 position:56%
and audible the multiple contexts
of race, class, gender, nationality,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.180
that enable the given performance

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.080
and that structure the way it
was heard at a particular time.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.120
And, just to give you kind of a
broad, we're, this is very much

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.120
in the, in the planning stages,
but just to give you a broad sense

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.510
of the sorts of themes
that I think, hopefully,

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.960
we'll be able to make
contributions to, I guess.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.940
The history of capitalism
and technology, right?

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.040
These recordings have a lot of
potential to shed light on that.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.960
The history of the music
business in that period,

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.870
but also of recording technology.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:10.520
The history of race and
constructions of race.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.170
I already mentioned the
prominence of minstrelsy,

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.160
for example, in the collection.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.170
But, it's, you know,
that is a really rich

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.140
and complicated topic because,
as probably many of you know,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:26.010
it's not just, these are not
just white black face performers,

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.900
but also African Americans
who kind of reappropriated

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.670
that in interesting ways,
that genre, if you will.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.580
And then, finally, and the reason
the project is called Hearing the

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.880
Americas is, in the first place,

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.660
we have a transnational
component to this.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.870
The majority of the songs on,

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.510
in both of these collections were
recorded in the United States

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.650 position:56%
in places like New York and
Camden, New Jersey and Philadelphia.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.680 position:56%
But, the collect also features, both
collections feature recordings made

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.490
in Mexico City and
Buenos Aires and Havana.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.340
We also, they also feature
Latin American musicians,

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.620
composers and genres, right?

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.720
And, they make visible
the transnational roots

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.800
of U.S. popular music in
ways that may, hopefully,

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.960
surprise visitors to this site.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.740
So, this is, you know, the Hawaiian
roots or contributions to blues

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.770
and country music in the
U.S., the Argentine, Cuban,

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.220
and Brazilian roots of jazz,
the key role of Caribbean

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.590
and Mexican musicians in the
North American soundscape.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.590
So, those are some of the issues

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:31.790
that I think the collections can
speak to, but kind of aren't yet.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.200
I mean, unless you're
bringing a great deal

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.190
of knowledge to them at this point.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.310
As I say, very early
planning stages.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.600
We're just kind of
mapping out, right now,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:48.230
what the site architecture will
looks like, but it will have,

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.530
it will provide users kind

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.850
of multiple routes
through the collections.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.020
You know, in other words,
you can follow individuals.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.080
You can follow genres.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.040
You could follow songs, and sort

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.410
of plan your own itinerary
through the collections.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.680 position:56%
One thing that we do hope to include
that presents a real challenge

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.700
from the digital curation
standpoint, I think,

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.510
is kind of annotated listening
guides so that, you know,

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.360
we can sort of point out to
you as you're listening things

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.440
that you're hearing
or might be hearing.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.670
You know, that's in its
early stages of planning,

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.900
but I think that's a real
challenge for us which I'd be happy

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.260
to hear suggestions about.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.320
I think the current idea is
something like SoundCloud.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.070
I don't know if you've
ever, some of you, I'm sure,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.910
have seen the annotations
that you can do on SoundCloud.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.050
So, that's a kind of
model that exists,

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.700
but this is definitely
a work in progress.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.360
So, that's all I'll
say at this point.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.160
Turn it over.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.400
&gt;&gt; Elena Razlogova:
[inaudible] started there.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.470
And, my colleague [inaudible],
who's also at Concordia University

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:19.550
in Montreal, points out that public
[inaudible] of audio materials

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.510
and reading materials
as well compete

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:27.180
with commercial cloud services
like Spotify, Netflix, and others.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.900
And, only certain material
ends up in the cloud.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.600
And, even if it does end up in
the cloud, the algorithms tend

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.480
to choose materials
that are published

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.240
by commercial corporation
rather than public services.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.210
And, I know that this problem is
important for museums and libraries

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:47.200 position:56%
as well because I was at an
excellent digital workshop yesterday

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.410 position:56%
at Maryland, University of Maryland.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.640
And, [inaudible] from the
Smithsonian had a slide showing

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.440
that at Smithsonian
archives, the artifacts viewed

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:07.080 position:56%
by about 10,000 users, but Wikipedia
gives them ten times more views

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.970
because Wikipedia's
a public project.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.970
And, the Smithsonian, even though
it's a government institution,

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.390
very well-known and very popular,

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:19.120
it doesn't have the same
discoverability as Wikipedia does.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:27.360
So, my project is basically
based on getting live recordings

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.550 position:56%
of music performances at freeform
radio stations throughout the United

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.310
States and also Canada.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.830
And it turns out that these
recordings are mostly very

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:41.230
informally archived, obviously,
and they usually are locatable more

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:46.490
at recording companies rather
than radio stations themselves.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:50.520
So, we started working with
[inaudible], and so far,

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.440
the files look kind of like
this, a bunch of wav files

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.920
with no metadata whatsoever.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.150
And, we need to research how to,
how to conceptualize these and how

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:03.030
to link them to particular
radio stations.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.160
On displaying them, we collaborate

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.600
with radio station FMU,
WFMU from New Jersey.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.230
It's a college radio station fairly
known to people who are interested

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:19.630
in obscure, nonpopular,
and weird music.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:24.920
So, in that sense, we already
get hardcore music listeners,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.810
and because we're more interested
in independent labels, we actually,

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.830
this is our core audience,
basically.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.390
Independent labels, independent
musicians, so that works very well.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.450
But, how do we reach more people.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.070
So, we going to, the page so far.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.430
I'm not going to show you my
page because it's not ready yet.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.890
But, our page will
look kind of like this.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:55.320
So, it's not aesthetically pleasing
in a way that, say Pitchfork is,

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.490
but it does have attraction
to these hardcore listeners.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:04.270
And, this is the list
of radio shows from FMU.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.860
And, sometimes, there are images.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:13.620
Okay. So, I decided to look at
what small labels, small venues,

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:20.230
and rare music promoters are doing,
and a lot of things are happening

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.400
that are very interesting.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.380
So, one option is to
issue these recordings.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:35.070
So, this is, this is a record, a
special record published by a Death

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.870
by Audio space in Brooklyn which
closed recently a few years ago,

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.190
and this is a vinyl of the
last music show at the space

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.820
under the title "Start Your
Own Fucking Show Space".

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.130
I just wanted to say
that in this conference.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.250
[ Laughter ]

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.360
So, the coverage in
music in the music press

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.540
for this release is fairly
high, so not just archiving

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.990
but releasing vinyl,
I think, is vital for,

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.850
for these kinds of projects.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.820
Because material production
and material, like,

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.470
events such as a record launch,

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.600
do a lot for these kind
of projects, I think.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.980
Another option is collaborate
with commercial.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.970
bandcamp is a commercial entity,

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.350
but it is geared towards
independent musicians.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.160
And, it is known in
independent music community

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.820
as a fair institution
to collaborate with.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.900
And Dischord label that is actually
from D.C. recently released all

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:41.660
of their recordings including
demo recordings on this platform.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:48.450
And, in conjunction with this
recording, with this release,

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.040
they were going to do a round table

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.100
where they invited music
journalists, musicians themselves,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:00.600
and label representatives to
discuss the history of the label.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.020
So, I think that kind of
coverage is also very interesting

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.300
because not only it
allows you to release

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.810
and contextualize metamaterial
such as liner notes, memoirs,

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:17.020
station memos, or posters, but also
it generates historical data via

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.420
oral history or documentary
practices that, then,

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.970
can be useful for historians.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.350
So, this is another
example of a vinyl release.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.500
This is a Tenzier label
form Montreal.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.810
Nonprofit organization
that preserves

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.760
and disseminates [inaudible]
recordings

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.360
of Quebec avant garde artists,
mostly [inaudible] artists.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.350
And, this, also a DIY
project by just one person

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.190
or a few people, but
they do the same.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:52.410
They digitize recordings of public
performances by free jazz musicians

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.540
in the '60s and '70s
that are quite amazing.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.500
There are people there actually
went to proletarian areas, like,

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.070
to worker areas and farmer
areas to perform free jazz

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.700
which is really hard music to hear.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.360
And then, they would give lectures
about how to hear it before,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.930
and they would end by
collective performances

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.310
with the people in the audience.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.950
So, all of these recordings exist,

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.990
and they've all be digitized
by this organization.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.380
But, then, once a year,
in conjunction

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.370
with these archival practice,
they release a vinyl recording

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:28.100
to promote their project
and also make it an event.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.610
So, these are these
releases of the records.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:36.250
And then, finally, another
option for musicians

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.440
as well is touring with the music.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.740
So Awesome Tapes From Africa.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.260
Probably most of you
guys know what that is.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:50.020
It's a project of Brian Shimkovitz
who started it as an MP3 blog

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:57.720
in the early 2000s, and he makes
available African music that's not

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.820
otherwise released on major labels.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.900
And, this is kind of an
anti-Spotify project.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.390
I just love, I love these projects
because they make music available

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.340
that would never be on Spotify.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:14.910
So, he started with a blog,
and then he created a label

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.680
that releases some of
this music as recordings,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.440
and 50% of the profits
go to African artists.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:28.210
Also, on bandcamp, as you can see,
and at the same time, he travels,

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:30.370
and he performs DJ
sets of that music.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:34.400
And, he basically explains his
project which is controversial

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.390
as well because, well,
there are issues

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:41.200
with how much should he
give back to the musicians,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.760
how much can he profit
from this kind of business?

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.080
So, he creates a discourse
about this kind of music,

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.830
and I think in some ways,
freeform music in America even,

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:58.290
is also a lost physical landscape.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:05.190
Maybe not as lost as, not as
difficult to access as, say,

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:11.380
local African music production, but
it is outside of the cloud, so far.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.150
And, maybe we just don't
have to bring it to Spotify,

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.310
but maybe we could have
it exist on the edges

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:21.950
of the commercial businesses, so
we can, it can be accessible and

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.800
yet not be representable
by entities like Spotify,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:31.770 position:56%
but rather by DIY and public spaces.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:37.330
So, I want to finish
by thinking about how

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:43.090
to publicize this project
apart from the DIY methods

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:48.260
that I just described, and I
think Wikidata, I'm really excited

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.590
about it after hearing
two presentations on it.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.680
I think not only we
should connect the archives

00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:03.230
to publicly funded projects
such as DEEP L.A. or Europeana,

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.100
but I think internet archive.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.450
And, Wikidata, they're interesting

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.430
because not only they're
grandfathered, but they also DIY.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:17.800
They start it as public, as
nongovernmental entities,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.840
and their reach is
just so much vaster

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.840
than the reach of even
the Smithsonian.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.140
So, I think it's important
to remember.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.440
That's it.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.240
Thank you.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.460
[ Applause ]

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.760
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Okay.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.060
Thank you.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.360
Thank you for that, Elena.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.660
Thank you especially for
that PowerPoint here.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.170
Your example has made it
impossible for any of us to claim

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.100
that we don't have time
to do something now.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.190
[ Laughter ]

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.630
Okay. And, next, we'll
hear from Mark Williams.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:47.930
&gt;&gt; Mark Williams: Hi.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.870
Thank you very much.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.400
Cool. You can hear me.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.700
Awesome. Thank you.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.450 position:56%
Yeah. I was going to stand up, but I
think I need to see my slides here.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.040
I'm going to really bang
through some slides.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.610
I made them on a Mac, and they're
not being screened on a Mac.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.910
So, I hope I recognize them,
but, yeah, they look okay.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.880
I'm going to talk about the
Media Ecology Project which is a,

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.180
we're really, honestly, trying

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:19.470
to create what I would call
a virtuous cycle in which,

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:25.220
by virtue of having access to
archival, time-based media,

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.830
we grow scholarship
about that media.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.840
Both traditional, whatever
that means,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.290
but also computationally enhanced.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.790 position:56%
We produce metadata that makes the
archival collections more searchable

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.080
and discoverable, and we
help to save these media

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.850
as instances of public memory.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.620
So, I'm going to bang
through the slides.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.920
They're informative.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.400
It's also a little bit of advocacy.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.750
Our goals will take a village,
and this is a great village.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.860
So, I hope we can do some things.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.910
This is our WordPress site,
which essentially talks

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.150
about the foundations of
the project but also some

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.940
of the grants that we've received.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.720 position:56%
Very happy to have an overview of
the project in this great collection

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.500
that was coedited by
Charles Acland and Eric Hoyt

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.660
about the digital humanities
and media history.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:16.170
I frame the project
in terms of modernity.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:19.610 position:56%
All the media that we study, that we
tend to study are part of modernity,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.560
and my favorite description
of modernity is

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.240
from the great French
poet Baudelaire

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.200
who called modernity a
combination of the ephemeral,

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.420
the contingent, and the fugitive.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:34.470
We have so much work to do on
the fugitive, and I say giddy up.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.270
So, various contexts and premises.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.000
Most of digital tools made
for the sciences crying need

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.180
in the arts and humanities.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.610
If every institution tries to
do everything, we're doomed.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:49.740
So, we need to think creatively,
think forward, act collaboratively.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.240
These historical materials
are going to disappear.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.410
Most people don't realize
that, particularly, maybe,

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:01.190 position:56%
our students who see 1000 cat videos
an hour, and they can't imagine

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.500
that moving image culture,
for example, is anything

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.330
but ubiquitous and eternal.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.070
And, both things are just wrong.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:10.890
So, we need to wake people
up to that, but we also need

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:15.190
to forage new direction for the
academic and scholarly community

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:16.920
to give back to the archives.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.730
It can't just be a one-way trip.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:24.620
So, we want to augment preservation
goals via more online access.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.330
We want to add value back to
the archives and libraries.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:33.430
Scholars and academics can make
these materials more searchable,

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.670
can make materials
searchable across archives.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.900
These are two huge value adds.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.270 position:56%
Can even become part of the workflow
if the archives are interested.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.880
So, the best first users can
help to advocate for what

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.720
to digitize next and why.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.220
These are three value adds
before we're really doing

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.520
significant scholarship.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.690
I call this due diligence.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:54.990
Cool. All right.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.000
So, that's what I just said.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.160
So, MEP is a triangle
of tools and platforms.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.150
Media thread which comes
out of Colombia University

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:09.050
and produces a capacity to
make time-based annotations.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.440
That's really the kind
of searchability

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.990
and discoverability we
want to advocate for.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:18.270
We can produce those
annotations and push them

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:20.910
out to this amazing
digital publishing platform

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.790
from the University of Southern
California called Scalar,

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:27.380
and once it's in Scalar, you can
link to anything on the magic box

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.460
and really contextualize things.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.750
But, we can also work to build
vocabularies that people can share

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.670
and actually have common
vocabularies

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:37.820
so that these different
aspects of search

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.400
and discoverability
are, in fact, communal.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.410
And, different scholars
contribute to one another's work.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.490
We hang out to the
metadata that's produced.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.330
The archives host their
own materials.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:55.930
They're the best curators
and handlers of that.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.140
And, by virtue of this
kind of triangle

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.200
and then additional
computational tools,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:06.010
we can try to create the
future that we're describing.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:10.090
So, we want to realize a
sustainability project regarding

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.940
media history as public memory.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.840
Every archivist I have ever
talked to understands this.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.140
They get it.

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.870
They want, they want to be
part of this, and we're,

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.740
that's our battery is the
enthusiasm of the archives.

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:28.830
Develop network scholarship in
relation to this online content,

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.080
promote and get more people

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.780
to understand this dynamic
ecology of historical media.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:39.400
Support the essential work of the
archives, engage primary research,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.620
and innovate new forms of
scholarship and publication.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.850
So, DH is a, you know,
complicated term.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.950
I actually love that
it's kind of messy.

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:52.560
People can't give you
one definition of DH,

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.520
but what it means is we're
working across disciplines

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.400
from a lot of different directions.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.000 position:56%
And, the first thing to make DH work
is you have to respect one another.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.700
You have to understand you're
working across disciplines,

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.000
recognize there are going

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.470
to be little frictions
that arise as a result.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.890
Maintain collegiality and just
find the new research questions

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.450
that make things go.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:19.020
In terms of the traditions
of DH, a lot of DH is focused

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.450
on word culture, and
I love word culture.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.910
I was an English major.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.310
But, if we're dealing
with time-based media,

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.850
we're dealing with other kinds
of objects, and we really need

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.470
to innovate the ways to deal with
those other kinds of objects.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.750
So, media thread sort
of looks like this.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.260
It's a classroom platform.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.360 position:56%
It's divvied up into courses, if you
will, and if you have a collection

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.400
or an emphasis, we can call that
a course and start to populate it.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.820
And, start to create
time-based annotations.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.310
A lot of our work is with
moving image culture,

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:54.630 position:56%
but I am a firm believer in the
significance of intermediality, and,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:59.820
in fact, my new favorite term in
which to think about that comes

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:04.450
from the theorist Bakhtin
who talked about chronotopes

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.940
and the significance of historical
moments where there's a combination

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:14.110
of newsreels plus radio plus
something else plus the newspapers.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:18.040 position:56%
And, it forms a kind of a chronotope
that we need to understand better,

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.150
and we can really facilitate
these kinds of understandings.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:26.680
So, for sound culture and for radio
culture, same kind of capacity.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.900
This, you create time-based
annotations, manual,

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.190
time-based annotations,
but one of our goals is

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:37.600
to facilitate how the manual
time-based annotations can help

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:43.150
train the algorithms to produce
machine learning annotations

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:49.420 position:56%
and see how that can really super
generate search and discoverability.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.570
This is not quite what
Scalar looks like now.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:55.940
This is like Scalar 1.0,
and now they're 2.0.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.380
But, you see how it
facilitates a different way

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.740
to put together linked data,
and that's really the part,

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.800
the main significance of
time-based annotations is

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.310 position:56%
to facilitate these linked data
search and discoverability practices

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:13.470
where you're not just doing a fly
over of the titles of a collection.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:17.320
You're searching within the
texts themselves and coming

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:22.150
up with a whole other way to
imagine what the scholarship

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:26.250 position:56%
and the future availability will be.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:30.270
Scalar has beautiful data in
terms of their visualizations,

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:34.530
so that's certainly a nice thing,
and this is what Onomy looks like.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:37.620
So, Onomy, this is my little joke.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.790
It's like taxonomy without the tax.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.380
I live and work in New Hampshire.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.020
You get bonus points if
you take the tax away.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.730
Right? Government joke.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.040
Perfect audience.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.130
But, it really is to create
vocabularies that we can share

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:57.580
and deploy, you know,
in a fairly common way

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:01.740
which will actually enhance so much
of the search and discoverability.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.920
These are our metadata standards.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.330
We are very strongly open.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:12.040
In relation to the presentations
yesterday, we're all about RDF

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.590
and JSON and creating those
triples and, you know, making,

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:22.270
making those kinds of
search capacities viable.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:25.800
Delighted to be working with the
Radio Preservation Task Force.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.630
We are actively pursuing
relationships

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.380
with different archives,

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.460
one of which I'll tell
you about in a second.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.980
And, we're working toward a
special issue of the Journal

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.390
of e-Media Studies which is also
published at Dartmouth about some

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:47.510
of the activities of the
preservation taskforce.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:51.400
We have an amazing project with the
National Archives that really came

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.590
to us because of some
brilliant grad students

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.640
who recognized a new opportunity

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:01.850
to study what I call the
film studio none of us know.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:03.840
Everybody knows MGM
and Warner Bros.,

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.360
but the U.S. Information Agency
produced, like, 18,000 films,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.200 position:56%
and under these curious
circumstances whereby, by and large,

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.800
they were forbidden to be
seen within the United States.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.010
That's no longer the case, but
it means that there are scholars

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:22.180
in other parts of the world
who have been thinking about

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.400
and studying these USIA
films for a long time.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.430
We're a networked scholarly
platform.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:32.170
we can imagine engaging scholars
from other parts of the world

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:36.240
to start to teach the United States
about its own cultural project.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:42.050 position:56%
That's pretty exciting, and of
course, it has many audio components

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:45.880
as well, including the Voice of
America which has materials both

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.870
at the National Archives
and the Library of Congress.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:51.550
So, we're incredibly
excited about that.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.260
Most of our grant money
has been to develop tools

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.970
for moving image culture, so we've
got this semantic annotation tool

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:01.380
whereby you can create
time-based annotations

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:05.970
for different geometric parts of
the frame that will really lead

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.120
to more granular, you know,
kinds of search and discovery.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.880 position:56%
And, very excited to be working with
some incredibly gifted colleagues

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.280
in computer science who are
trying to teach the machines how

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.210
to identify objects in actions.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:23.700
But, also, other kinds of
textuality, like audio text,

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:31.320
written text, etc. And, we
are reaching out to people

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.960
who have some coding
wherewithal and some interest

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.150
to help develop these other kinds

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:41.410
of machine reading capacities
regarding sound culture.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:45.650
So, we know that we can help with
speech and music discrimination.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.300
This is part of what came up
yesterday with the conversations

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.360
about pop up archive which is
really great at spoken word.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.450
But, unfortunately, is also
going away sometime soon.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.620
It was reported yesterday.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.790
We can work with different
kids of diarization

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.570
of speakers, separate speakers.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.940
That's really a challenge
to get the machines

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.630
to recognize there are
different people talking,

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.650
and how do you parse them?

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:13.850
But, also, the tools that
my colleague, Michael Casey,

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:19.170 position:56%
who's a brilliant computer scientist
at Dartmouth and who's different

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:23.920
from Mike Casey at Indiana
who's kind of a legend in this.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.870
My Michael Casey developed
this really great kind

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:35.930
of sonic culture toolkit that
we work to parse sound culture,

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.500
but we also have some
tricks to make it work

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.150
for moving image culture as well.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.680
So, our goals.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.050
Advocate for digitization.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.870
And, all archivists know
that it's a water wheel.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.560
Once you, it's not digitize
and you're done, right?

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.090
It's digitize and then migrate.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.750
But, there are a lot of people
working on those challenges.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.440
Work to develop a scholarly
secure tier

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.130
of access to online collections.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:07.700
The time is now for this,
and there's a lot of interest

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.060
in trying to move forward.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:13.860
And, we would love for people to
get together and make that happen.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.700
Help to drive 21st century
scholarship, raise awareness

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.660
about the endangered status,
get some new pedagogy.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.580
Get scholars to recognize that they
have an obligation to create search

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.540
and discoverability metadata
in their scholarship.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.830
Engage in this incredible dialectic

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.100
between close reading
and distant reading.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.200
The arts and humanities,
all about close reading.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.460
Computational studies,
all about scale, you know.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.470
That's literally a dialectic,
and we can learn from that.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:47.790
We can really move the conversation
and develop new approaches

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.140
that enable crowdsourcing.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.940
So, thank you very much.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:58.440
[ Applause ]

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.740
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Thank you, Mark.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.550
Just wanted to say that I just
got word from Josh Shephard

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.830
that Charles Hardy who was to
have been on this panel had

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.590
to cancel on very short notice.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.100
However, he is alive
and well, just not here.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:15.960
So, any of you know him, you
know, that's the story there.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.260
Excuse me.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:23.360
So, finally, to our last
panelist, all the way over there,

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:29.600
who hails from an area of radio
that is storied and vital.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.910
But, I think also misunderstood
and underappreciated.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.410
That's shortwave.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:36.780
So, Thomas Witherspoon.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:40.240
&gt;&gt; Thomas Witherspoon: Thank you,
first of all, it's a real honor

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.940
to serve on this, you
know, distinguished panel.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.420
And, I was just telling Josh
yesterday that I feel a little

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.940
out of place here because
I'm not an academic.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.190
I'm not a professional
archivist, yet here I am.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.800
And, I'm also from
rural North Carolina,

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.100
and I'm going to try
to speak quickly.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.330
And, that doesn't always
work very well.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:06.580
But, during my undergraduate
studies, I worked every year

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.860
in an archives department of our
university, and I think it's there

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.710
where I sort of became passionate
about preserving, you know,

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:17.210
important pieces of work.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:20.080
And, I did my graduate studies in
anthropology at the London School

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:25.480
of Economics, and today, I
write about communications.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.540
All aspects of it, the
history, content, the culture,

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:34.580
and I blog on a blog called
"The Shortwave Listening Post".

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.620
We have about 7000 daily readers,

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.880
and so I'm particularly
fascinated with shortwave radio.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.490
And, I usually tell people
when they ask what I do,

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:46.340 position:56%
I'll say I'm a radio anthropologist,

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:50.950
and sometimes they
back away from me.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:57.210
You know, for those of you who
don't know, radio is a medium

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:00.860
for international communications,
and it's not hindered by borders.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.160
It doesn't care who's in
power, in what country,

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.890 position:56%
and it literally blankets our earth.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:09.770 position:56%
And, all you need is a $20 receiver,
and you can be at the south pole

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:16.140
and receive a station that emanates
from Japan or the U.S. or France.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:23.380
I work a lot with enthusiasts
in the shortwave radio world,

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:29.150
and every year, I attend a fest
in, convention in Philadelphia

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:32.460
where a lot of others there are
interested in shortwave radio

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.820
and international broadcasting.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.550
And, many years ago,
we had a forum topic

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:41.240
about preserving off-air recordings
of shortwave radio broadcasts.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.510
Because people, you know,
enthusiasts back in the day,

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.930
during the Cold War and
earlier, have, you know,

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:51.810
they started recording
on magnetic media.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:56.100
And, now, those things are starting
to deteriorate, and we wanted a way

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.530
that we could encourage people
to digitize these things

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.870
and share them in some way.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:05.930
Afterwards, not a lot happened
because we never really, you know,

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.240
we didn't bring this to fruition.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.310
So, I decided to do it myself,

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.840
and I created the shortwave
radio audio archive.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:18.360
This archive is, we have hundreds
now of, hundreds and hundreds

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:23.350
of off-air recordings from various
shortwave radio broadcasters,

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:26.510
and sometimes, also,
AM broadcasters.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:30.410
It's set up, though, as a podcast.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:35.870
So, when you subscribe to this
via iTunes or the RSS feed,

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:37.470
anytime we upload a recording,

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:39.590
it automatically downloads
that recording.

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:41.580
We don't have any introductions
or anything like that.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.380
It's just the recording.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:47.230
And, quite a lot of the
2000 people who subscribe

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:52.880
to this keep the entire archive
of recordings at their home.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.060
That's a lot of offsite,
you know, recordings.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:03.130
And, so, anyway, that's how we
propagate it, and you can visit

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:07.490
that website at
shortwavearchive.com.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:10.770 position:56%
Like, again, it's funded 100% by me.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.250
It's not affiliated with
a university or anything,

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:16.890
and I'm not super risk averse.

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.930
When I put things out
there, but by and large,

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:23.540
these are off-air recordings
from international broadcasters,

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.970
you know, and a lot of propaganda
and other interesting things.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:33.270
And, I also work with another site
called, it's actually a new team

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:35.030
that we've formed called
the Spectrum,

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:37.090
the Radio Spectrum Archive.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:41.230
How many of you, with a raise of
hands, how many of you have heard

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:44.630 position:56%
of radio spectrum recordings before?

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:45.930
Oh, yes. Okay.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:50.040
So, at the end of this,
you'll all have your hands up.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:55.250
Since the early days of radio
transmitting, we've had efforts

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:58.660
to preserve recordings, and
these are audio recordings

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:02.900
of a broadcaster on a particular
frequency, a particular day,

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.830
and possibly a particular topic.

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:10.990
Today, through the use of
software defined radios,

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.430
these are little radios that
look like an external hard drive,

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:16.440
and you can hook it up to your
computer with a USB cable.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.150
And then, you hook up an
external antenna to it,

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.680
and it is a radio that's
controlled by your computer.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.790
And, you can do just kind
of crazy things with it.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:26.560
You can record spectrum.

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.330
Instead of one frequency, one
broadcaster, I can record, say,

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:34.290
the entire FM band all at once

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:38.320
or the entire AM broadcast
band all at once.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.270
Or, you know, a couple of
shortwave bands all at once.

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:45.230
All, dozens and dozens and
dozens of stations on there

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:47.420
and the static in between.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:48.720
Everything.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:52.170
And, later, you can tune
through it as if it were live.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.080
I've got a short video.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.830
I narrate in this video.

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.430
This is on our website,
and just to kind

00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:59.730
of give you a flavor what this is.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:02.210
And, I'll tell you before we
start it, what you're looking

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:06.470
at on the screen is a software
defined application called HDSDR.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.750
It's free, and it can
read recordings.

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.720
This particular recording I'm
demonstrating is a unique one.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.620
Most of the recordings
now are made digitally

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.430
with the software defined receiver.

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:23.370
This was made in Providence, RI
on May 1, 1986 by an enthusiast

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:28.790
who basically hacked his receiver
and connected it to a hi-fi VCR

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:32.440
and recorded the intermediate
frequency, and then played it back

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.270
through is radio so he
could tune through it later.

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:38.180
Like, time travel.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:44.140
And, he very kindly, a couple
years ago, digitized those tapes

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.160
and put them in a form that
we can read them on this.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.960

how bad the Chernobyl nuclear plant

of the western world.

anything is wrong.

about Chernobyl are
in Moscow and Kiev.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:27.500
&gt;&gt; We've been monitoring these
broadcasts since Tuesday,

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:33.280

mention of anything connected

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.580

So, you know, this is actually sort

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.260
of a rougher copy of
a spectrum recording.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:44.480
It was made on a hi-fi VCR in
1986, but a lot of the stations

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.450
on there are no longer on the air.

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:51.620
Some of them went off the air ten
years after this was recorded.

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:56.120

the only copy of this in existence.

You know, we still
capture things today.

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.210

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:05.720

they're still very significant.

I spend a lot of time
capturing the AM broadcast band

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:44.980
Maybe even a kiosk, you can have
an interface where someone can tune

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.260
through the spectrum
as if it were live.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.290
And, they'll probably see that
now, you know, we were living

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:54.370
in this kind of dynamic time
where the public was divided,

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:57.850
and a large percent of
the population, you know,

00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:01.420
lacked some of the critical
thinking skills to discriminate

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.920
between fake and real news.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.590
And, I think that's
something that's playing

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:08.340
out on the airways right now.

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.510
So, some of our challenges.

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:12.720
Well, these files are huge.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.000
To record the entire
AM broadcast band,

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.510
it sucks up about two gigabytes
of space for every one minute.

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:23.260
[ Whistle ]

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.760
And, space is cheap.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.890
You know, hard drives are cheap,
but putting those in the cloud

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:30.230
or in some sort of, you
know, digital format

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:34.100
that can be archived is much
more difficult, very costly.

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.880
And so, we're trying to
figure out ways to do that.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.610
Of course, bandwidth
makes it difficult

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:40.360
to pass these recordings
on to each other.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.030
Especially if you've
got large files.

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:47.840
And, we'd like, maybe, at some
point, to turn this into something

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.860
where we can have an
endowment to, perhaps,

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:55.150
fund it even in some modest way to
keep these recordings in existence.

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:59.810 position:56%
And, also, we want to do outreach,
stuff like this, so people are aware

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:01.110
that spectrum recordings
are out there.

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:04.460
So, how many people know what a
spectrum recording is, now, right?

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.360
Excellent.

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:10.700
So, if you have any ideas, please
approach me at this conference,

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.050
because I don't know many of you.

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:14.370
Come over, give me your
card, or something.

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:17.190
I'll give you a card,
and we can talk.

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:20.510

for allowing me to be here today.

Thank you, Thomas, and
thank you all of you.

So, we've got almost half an hour
for some good discussion here.

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.600
There's an extra chair
up here if one

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.170
of the discussants
would like to take it.

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:46.600
Please don't fight over it.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.230
But, are you ready?

00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:52.060
Do you want to just stand
up and face the crowd,

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.570
or how should we do this?

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.260
Okay. Okay.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:56:01.210
&gt;&gt; I think we should, since I
am part of the host institution,

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:03.510
I think we should start
with [inaudible].

[ Background Conversation ]

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.960
And, not to make you nervous,
but we are livestreaming.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.260
So, if you could, you know,

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.020
try and crane yourself a
little ways towards the camera.

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.580
That might help the people
viewing this at home.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.880
Or, come up here, you know.

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.280
Whatever you like.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I don't know which is the bigger
challenge, to say something sensible

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:34.990
or to turn in two directions
at once.

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:36.290
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Okay.

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:43.270
&gt;&gt; I want to thank this panel
very much for pulling me,

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.700
a curator, into the 21st century.

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:53.680
I am fascinated by the multiple
definitions of digital curation.

00:56:53.680 --> 00:57:01.300 position:56%
We, I don't know if that's something
you want to discuss, but I'll,

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:05.090
I am going to pose a question.

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:08.580
Because I come from the
material side of curation

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:13.600 position:56%
but has nothing to do with curation.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:21.810
I was interested, in every
case, to hear about your users.

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:25.340
I come from a background in
the history of technology.

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:31.650
The current trend is
to say users matter,

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:36.500
and these are the historical
reason, the historical cases why.

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:44.830
So, could you each say
something more about the users

00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:49.190
that you already have or
imagine that you will have

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:53.720
and why scale matters
to these users?

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:59.590
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: We don't have
to do it alphabetically anymore.

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:00.890
&gt;&gt; Yes. Good.

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:02.190
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Jump in.

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:03.490
&gt;&gt; Mark Williams: Yeah.

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:04.790
I can start.

00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:06.840
I mean, the users that
we're starting

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.620
with for our pilot projects are
scholars, and trying to come

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.560
up with new and innovative
research questions to pursue.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.250
And, we've had fantastic
results in that regard.

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:19.870
And, in fact, some of
the research questions.

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:22.130
I've never heard of the
different methodologies they want

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:23.430
to bring to these texts.

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:27.300
So, the goal overall is to
give back to the archives

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:29.390
and make them searchable
and discoverable,

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:33.910 position:56%
and then see how the public more
generally wants to use them as well.

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:37.410
But, we're starting with the
scholarly tier, if you will,

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:41.850
and seeing what kind
of new methodologies

00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:45.180
and discoverability that generates.

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.140
&gt;&gt; Elena Razlogova: Well,
for me, or for this project,

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:49.440
as we imagined the users.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.750
We don't have the users,
obviously, yet.

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:55.020
But, I think we would
start with music bands,

00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.640
like people who are
interested in independent music

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.020
or odd music, nonpopular music.

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:02.080
But, that includes
scholars of music.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.430
Any music historian or music
scholar would be interested

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:06.730
in this kind of material.

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:10.940
So, there are two ways to promote
it or to distribute it as one

00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:15.450
to make it public for
everybody for general listener

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:18.040
to discover and see and hear.

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:24.700
And then another one would be to
plug it into the library universe,

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.940
so the scholars could,
can use it as well.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:31.990
But, I think a lot of work needs
to be done to promote these kinds

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:36.490
of ad hoc recordings to
scholars to contextualize them

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:39.270
to make them understand
why this kind

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:45.570 position:56%
of cultural production is important.

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:48.040
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Hiam: Well, I'll just
say very quickly that, of course,

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:55.320
as a public library, our users are
anyone and everyone who decides

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.040
to go to the website for starters.

00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.600
So, while we have a pretty good
sense of who uses what types

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:06.310
of materials, that doesn't always
translate as to customizing the way

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:08.430
in which we can present
them and serve them.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:11.870
So, all that's to say that
we do our best to make things

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:16.710 position:56%
as widely available and discoverable
as possible to anyone and everyone.

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:22.800
But then, we also, and I think this
happens more on the sort of flesh

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.570
and bones human level, is that
the staff really is empowered

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.020
and takes it seriously
to go, literally,

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.120
into communities such as this.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.820
Or, if you're working
in a, you know,

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:41.740 position:56%
we're making these tools accessible
to all sorts of library staff users.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.250
So, education officers, so
to say, or branch led brands

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.550
who do children's programming.

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:49.360
Presumably, they'll also
have uses for these.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.020
So, we want to make
things really open.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:56.380
And then, build tools on top that
allow smaller user groups to maybe,

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.300
you know, again, aggregate
materials or have packages

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.610
of things passed onto
them by the staff.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:07.400
But, I do think in terms
of the variety of users.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.120
We try and actually go out
into different fields to find

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.150
out what it is people need
and how they want to use it.

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:15.450
So.

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:19.640
&gt;&gt; Matt Karush: the
conversations about our users

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.280
for Hearing the Americas might
be have been really interesting.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.730
I sort of came into the project
thinking first of students

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:33.610
and teachers, but then, it became
a digital project for the public.

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:37.830
Which implies a bigger,
broader audience,

01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:41.200
and more of a public
history kind of project.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.940
So, you know, my colleagues in
the project have done a bunch

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:50.670
of audience testing and
elaborating personas,

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:53.430
which has been really interesting
as somebody who's never done any

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:55.330
of that just to see that happen.

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:58.690
But, I think what's the big,
sort of, primary audience

01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:05.600
at this point are sort of fans and
music history buffs, I would say.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.900
Which there are many.

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.910
But, the interesting
challenge about that for us is

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:15.050
that the motivating questions
that come up over and over again

01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:18.130
from those communities
sometimes lead

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:21.460
to frustration with the collection.

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.840
In other words, because the
motivating questions have to do

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.910
with the genres that people
first think of when they think

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.740
of early American popular music.

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.060
So, there's a lot of
interest in blues music.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:35.650
There's a lot of interest
in country music.

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:38.510
And, even the more savvy members

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:40.980
of that community are sometimes
surprised that we're really looking

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.460
at a period before those
genres have emerged.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.400
And, the music sort
of surprises them

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.700 position:56%
and frustrates them in certain ways.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.000
So, we've been, I mean,
that's been kind

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.950
of a big challenge for
us to work through.

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:54.490
I mean, so, there are
lots of different ways

01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:55.930
of approaching that problem.

01:02:55.930 --> 01:03:00.160
But, you know, there will be
things, sort of, hooks, right,

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.110
designed to sort of peak the
interest of that community.

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:06.730
But then, maybe also
open people's eyes

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:08.320
and surprise people
in interesting ways.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.490
So, trivia questions
that pull people

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:16.260
and playlist is another
sort of technique.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.160
But, we're, I mean, I
think that is the kind

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.860 position:56%
of central challenge of the project.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.610
&gt;&gt; Thomas Witherspoon:
And, you know, for me,

01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:28.040
the shortwave radio
audio archive, really,

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.860
I threw it out there for everyone.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:33.170 position:56%
You know, anyone who wants to listen
to it, people who are nostalgic,

01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:34.780
historians, you know, people

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.650
in media studies, any
kind of researchers.

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:38.240
Whoever wants it can have it.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.260
Interestingly, though, the
publicity we've gotten,

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.410
which just appeared
in my email one day.

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:49.320
"The Wire" magazine in
the UK which is a magazine

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.990
for musicians reviewed the
Shortwave Radio Archive as a source

01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:57.780
of material for music
and gave us, you know,

01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.870
all kinds of good publicity.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.780
And, our users kind
of jumped from there.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.340
That's not one I would have
ever thought of, but you know,

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:08.080
shortwave radio has kind of
an interesting sonic texture,

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.660
and, which I find appealing.

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.750
And, evidently, others do as well.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:19.440 position:56%
The spectrum archive, at the moment,
it's not super practical to share it

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.550
with everyone just
because of the data size,

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:25.540 position:56%
and we just don't have the
applications in place to share this.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:28.960
But, ideally, I'd like it to
be accessible to everyone.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.770
Perhaps have an online site where
people can pull up a recording,

01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:35.700
like a digital library,
and tune through it.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:41.080
That would be the ideal to me.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.170
&gt;&gt; David Walker: Well,
kind of as a follow up,

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:49.560
kind of as a follow up to that.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:53.530
As far as engaging with the
communities, as you suggested,

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:57.800 position:56%
what are some ways in which you can
bring people in and accept, kind of,

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.230
feedback from the communities.

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:01.220
And, I think that's a
great example you mentioned

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:05.870
of letting people tag
recordings, for example, but,

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:08.110
there's a lot of indigenous
and, like,

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:11.680
marginalized groups represented
in this media, and it's,

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.450
there's a shared identity there.

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:15.840
Are there some potential ways

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:24.330
that you can let people
kind of enhance the data?

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:25.630
&gt;&gt; Mark Williams: There are.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.540
And, we're seeking them
out, and that was part

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.780
of my final advocacy bit
about crowd sourcing.

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.250
I think we're, we're interested,
I should probably clarify.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:36.710
We're interested in formulating
new research questions

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:38.690
in an interdisciplinary way.

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:41.590
So, that tends to mean
you want to deal

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:43.370
with experts in different fields.

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:46.930
But, we're absolutely
interested in research questions

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:50.720
that enable crowdsourcing
and other kinds of input.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.730
And, I was very inspired, you
know, the panel before this one was

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:57.910
about indigenous and native
cultures and their radio cultures.

01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:02.450
We would love to work with them
to formulate a pilot project

01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:07.090
with various tribes, pan tribal,
you know, kinds of affiliations.

01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:10.010
And, that means that, in
many cases, you'll be dealing

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:14.060
with traditional materials
that need to be

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.530
for certain people and not others.

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:22.090
And, having a capacity to
navigate some of those issues

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:26.350
of respect regarding traditional
cultures is a very important thing.

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:33.200
So, just being able to say for
whom, when, and how can we engage,

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.110
you know, massive crowdsourcing
when it is appropriate.

01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:39.410
You know, how many fans

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:42.800
of time-based culture
are there in the world?

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.600
Billions. I think people, if
we can make it clear to them,

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:54.050 position:56%
that these materials are going to be
lost but for better annotation and,

01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:55.860
you know, teach them simple ways

01:06:55.860 --> 01:07:00.320
that they can maybe develop
a CAPTCHA kind of app so that

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.800
if people have somebody who's
talking at the Wikimedia thing.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.400
You know, free five minutes,
you can just go on and,

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.580
like, help save media history.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:12.670
You know, and make it
that simple, ultimately.

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:15.060
But, yeah, we do need governors

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.900
that can respect certain
kinds of content, for sure.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.200
Yeah.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.500
&gt;&gt; Elena Razlogova: I think, also,

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.800
in respect to indigenous
communities,

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.520
I know [inaudible] the songs

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.450
for Wikipedia have been really
successful in promoting gender,

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.930
like, women's culture
and women's contribution.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:35.210
So, something like that for media
would be so great to have, like,

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:38.130
to organize the meat and
then have people contribute

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:40.390
in the particular, as
a particular event.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.420
I think it'll work.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.720
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haim: Yeah.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:47.170
I'd like to go back to
the idea of public events.

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:51.740 position:56%
So, while, in one sense, I think
part of your question is addressing,

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.560
well, how can we get, essentially,
the whole world to chip in?

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.410
And, I think there are tools
being developed and even some

01:07:57.410 --> 01:08:00.280
that already exist that do that.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.500
As institutions, perhaps,
we haven't put

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.430 position:56%
up those projects to the public yet.

01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:05.780
They haven't been formed.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.080
In many cases.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.380
Not everywhere.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.680
In some cases.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.900
So, that's, that's a kind
of catching up or getting.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.200
I shouldn't say catch up.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.700
I think institutions beat
themselves up sometimes.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.330
Sometimes, it takes a long
time to get to a certain place

01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:21.520
and to do it right, and it, there's
a lot of wrongs along the way.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:26.030
So, but I think big institutions
like NYPR, getting to the point

01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.610
where they're going to have tools.

01:08:27.610 --> 01:08:30.350
There's already been successful
projects with text based things.

01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:32.940
Like, I don't know if you've
ever seen the Menus Project

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:38.310 position:56%
that the public library put out or,
you know, there's a variety of very,

01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:40.780
very well received public
engagement projects.

01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:44.950
But, I would say, what we've
discovered is having public

01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:48.450
programs, maybe the reach isn't
a million people at a time,

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:52.100
but even if it's anywhere
from 15 to 210, you've,

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.650
at least just as you've
demonstrated here,

01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:57.870
introduced exponentially
people to ideas

01:08:57.870 --> 01:09:00.120
and materials they didn't
know were there before.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.380
In an interactive way that we can
do in public spaces without feeling

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.640
like we have to worry
about the law as much

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.030
because we have our own rights.

01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:10.990
So, I would go back to,
like, public programming

01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:15.130
and thinking smaller before we
get bigger is also a useful tool.

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:19.210
&gt;&gt; Matt Karush: Yeah, I
would just say, you know,

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:24.190
that I think we're,
you know, very excited.

01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:25.870
Although, maybe also
a little nervous

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:29.520
about the crowdsourcing
potential for the project.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.780
You know, it's 20,000 plus
recordings, and we're not going

01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.940
to be able to contextualize,
you know,

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:38.060
even a significant
chunk of them, really.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:44.850
So that, the ability to allow
users to help with that project,

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:48.530
true to that process is, you know,
in some ways, what it's all about.

01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:51.970 position:56%
On the other hand, you know, there's
a curatorial tension there, right?

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:56.960
So, we have to figure out, we have
to navigate how to maintain control

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.510
or whether to maintain control or,
you know, what to do about that.

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:03.740
But, I think we are
excited for that.

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.430
&gt;&gt; Thomas Witherspoon: Yeah,
and I can say that in terms

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:08.550 position:56%
of the spectrum archive, one of the
things I imagine, if you can imagine

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:12.020
when you have a recording with just
dozens and dozens of broadcasters

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.210
on it, with all kinds of content.

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.510
At some point, hopefully,
there will be a way

01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:20.800
that individual broadcasts
could be tagged and people,

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.390
as they're listening to it, can
make notes and keep those notes

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:24.860
in the broadcast recordings.

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:27.710 position:56%
And, that's something I'm interested
in, and you know, a lot of,

01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:30.600
especially in urban areas, well,
and actually in rural areas,

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:35.110
AM broadcasters are often
serving, you know, diaspora or,

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.120
you know, a particular group.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.650
And, that would be
something that they could keep

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:41.950
and be used in other archives.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:52.460
&gt;&gt; I'm also not a [laughs] an
expert in digital curation.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:57.130
I'm at the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress.

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:00.200
And, I've loved hearing
about all of the projects.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.220
The diversity is amazing.

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.070
I'm also struck by the diversity
of the different contexts

01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:06.720
in which everyone is working in.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:13.690 position:56%
I mean, both large institutions and
as individuals, devoted individuals.

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:18.730
And, I'm curious, do you feel
that this field is at a point

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:23.040
where this networking effort,
I mean, is it, is it happening?

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.010
Are issues being identified
or threads

01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:32.550
that are being identified beyond
sort of the individual projects

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:38.640
or the, you know, opportunistic
projects that come our way.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.620
I mean, you all have different
funders, and I was also struck

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:46.980
by how people are supporting
themselves doing this.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.680
And, I know funders often drive
what some of the issues are,

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.480
what, who the audiences are.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:58.710 position:56%
I mean, you have to shape your
project to feed them, but are there,

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:03.590 position:56%
are we at a point where we can begin
identifying what the central issues

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:08.110
are, what the Radio Preservation
Taskforce can do, what government

01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:10.750
or larger institutional
entities can do?

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:15.160
I'd just be curious to
hear from all of you.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.460
&gt;&gt; Mark Williams: It's
a great question,

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.970
and I can only give a partial
answer, but there's a little bit

01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:22.120
of another advocacy point.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:29.440
In my experience with different
grant-giving institutions,

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.100
there needs to be more awareness

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.810
about the significance
of network scholarship.

01:12:34.810 --> 01:12:37.800 position:56%
And, a major significance to that is

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.850
that the local is no
longer so local.

01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:44.550
And, when you put a
lot of locals together,

01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:46.600 position:56%
you have transnational significance.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.160
You know, and the AAPB is a
great example of this, right?

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.820
I think that's part of
its historic importance is

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:55.460
that it's collating
different archives

01:12:55.460 --> 01:13:00.100
from different public broadcasting
stations and making them,

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.280
putting them in a position
to talk to one another.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.940
And, for scholars to
run across them,

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:08.760
and in a lot of grantmaking
conversations

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.920
that I've been part of, and I think
some of this is maybe generational,

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.800
people have not internalized
this yet.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.760
That network scholarship means
that the local can matter as much

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.650 position:56%
as any big network or anything else.

01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:26.570
And, if you really start
to fund local projects,

01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:30.290
we're going to change how we
understand the history of media.

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:33.120
I mean, it's just,
that's where we are now.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.580
And, I think that needs
to be underscored.

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:36.880
Yeah.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.980
&gt;&gt; Elena Razlogova:
I guess we're going.

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:42.880
So, I was at the taskforce last
year, and there was a debate

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.890
at the metadata panel
between Ken Freedman,

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:48.570
who's the head of FMU,
and archivists.

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:52.460
And, basically, it was
going to impossible block

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:56.290
where he was saying, "I just want
to put up music online right away.

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:58.070
I don't care about metadata.

01:13:58.070 --> 01:14:02.030
I don't care about lists
controlled descriptors."

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:03.580
And, the archivists were
saying, "How can you do that?

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:06.070
We have to have a list first,
and then you put music on."

01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:07.500
And, I think at this conference,

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:11.110
I now feel that there's a
meeting point, that there is a way

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:15.470
to informally coordinate
between professional archivists

01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:21.930
and independent collectors and
projects that are, maybe, informal,

01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:25.820
but eventually will be
put into this larger,

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:28.390 position:56%
larger universe with the ID numbers.

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:34.710
And, I think, I guess, for me,
it seems like internet archive

01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:40.710
and Wikidata would be the place to
bring these two entities together.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:44.180
So, people can continue
the independent projects

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.380
and informal collection, and
then, still know that eventually

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.880
through crowdsourcing
or some kind of grants,

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.590
everything will be part
of the same universe.

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:55.910
We'll see.

01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:57.720
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Haim: Yeah,
I don't, I think, I mean.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.750
I think there's a time, and
this is a time to do this.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:06.230
I also do note that I think large
public institutions like the one

01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:11.040
where I come from, it's, I
would say there's a gap growing

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:16.550
between the speed and agility with
which smaller efforts or something

01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:21.850
like Wikipedia or something can
operate in a way that is creating,

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:25.230 position:56%
it's not even going to be a question
of bigger institutions catching up.

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.770
I think it's just going to be there
might be some different purposes

01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:29.070
served in that landscape.

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:31.410
I don't know what they are,
but I can't imagine any sort

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:34.380
of policy change in the
next two or three years

01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.040
where something comes down to this.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.660 position:56%
Hey, we can share all of this stuff
either freely with everyone or with,

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.300
even through a tier, which
I think is a better approach

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.600
for getting at stuff.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.480
But, also limits the
number of people.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.280
So, I think there's a lot
of work to be done there,

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.770
and it may be that meeting point
isn't actually people doing,

01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:56.900
trying to collaborate on the
exact same thing but trying

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.710
to find the strengths
around that circle

01:15:58.710 --> 01:16:00.580
that puts it together,
if that makes any sense.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:03.650
So, I don't know, that's
what I would say.

01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:05.500
&gt;&gt; Matt Karush: Yeah, I'm a
total newbie to this field.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:10.540
So, it's hard for me to see, you
know, the sort of obstacles to

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:15.980
or opportunities for that sort
of networking and collaboration.

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:23.900 position:56%
I mean, I would say that the sort
of, the focus on the archive itself,

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.200
for somebody who doesn't,

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.990
who doesn't generally think
that way as a scholar.

01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:30.070
The focus on the archive promotes
a kind of interdisciplinarity

01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:31.710
at least, and it kind of,

01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:33.260
I don't know if it's
quite network scholarship,

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.640
but it's moving in that direction.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.650
I mean, I'm a historian of
Argentina, and I'm in the room

01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:40.970
with historians of the
U.S. and musicologists.

01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:44.760
And, we're all trying to figure out
how to make sense of this material

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.670
and present it in a
way that makes sense.

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:50.590
So, in that sense, I do see it as
a kind of possibility for making,

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:52.890
forging those connections.

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:57.200
&gt;&gt; Thomas Witherspoon: Yeah,
and you know, for me, this is,

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.690
this is all about discovery,
finding out the other side.

01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:05.550
A lot of times, in what I'm
doing, I feel kind of alone.

01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:07.760
I'm there, doing my thing.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:14.270
I'm not, I don't have colleagues I
can turn to easily, and yesterday,

01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:19.640
at one of the Cold War forums,
one of the presenters was talking

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.590
about various sources
of source material,

01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:25.120
and he mentioned the buffs.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.590
You know, the people, the
enthusiasts out there.

01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:33.840
And, that's the realm I'm in, and
I'm very, I'm humbled to be here.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:39.340
And, more than that, I really
congratulate the Radio Preservation

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.880
Taskforce and Josh for
reaching out to people like me

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.060 position:56%
and not just staying in the world of
academia, to bring these together.

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.580
Because I think there's an
incredible synergy between,

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:53.490
that's how you discover that
all these things are out there.

01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:57.720
So, yeah. That's, I
think that's the power

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.520
of having a conference like this.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.280
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.580
Thank you.

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:04.880
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.760
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: We still have a
few minutes left, and I'd like to,

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.410
if any throw it open
to the rest of you

01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:10.740 position:56%
if there are any questions from you.

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.040
Put up your hand.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.340
We'll get the microphone to you.

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:15.640
There's one, Danielle.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.650
&gt;&gt; Hi. To the gentleman on
the end in the blue shirt,

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:24.500
you'd be surprised at how
many anthropologists are drawn

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.800
to this field.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.820
I met several, so you're not alone.

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:31.040
But, how far back do
your archives go?

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.340
&gt;&gt; Thomas Witherspoon: Okay.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:36.630
So, the shortwave radio
archives, the audio recordings,

01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:39.800
go back to about I
think the late '50s.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.150
And, we have quite
a few in the '60s.

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:45.790
A whole lot in the
'70s and '80s and '90s.

01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:48.100
And, actually record them today.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:54.630
In fact, we, a lot of us make
an effort to record stations,

01:18:54.630 --> 01:19:00.590 position:56%
for example, the voice of Turkey
during the Gezi Park protests didn't

01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:04.810
mention anything about the
Gezi Park protests for a week

01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:06.110
after they were happening.

01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:07.410
It was headline news.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:08.710
We try to record things like that.

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:13.030
So, we have a lot of
current recordings as well.

01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:16.660
The spectrum archive, really, I
don't know how deep that is yet.

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.450
This 1986 recording I played is
probably one of the older ones.

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:23.800
The technology hasn't
been around for very long.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.350
The technology has been
around since about 2005

01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:28.490
to do these digitally
and very easily.

01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:33.410
So, the bulk of our recordings
are from about 2005 until now.

01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:37.430
&gt;&gt; Tom, I have a quick follow up.

01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:41.190
How do we find that YouTube
thing that you played?

01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:43.640
I've been searching
for it desperately, so.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.940
&gt;&gt; Thomas Witherspoon: Okay.

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:50.340
Yes. So, go to spectrumarchive.org,
and it's right on the front page.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.430
&gt;&gt; It's also been tweeted
on the hashtag.

01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:54.730
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:56.030
&gt;&gt; Okay.

[ Laughter ]

01:19:57.330 --> 01:19:58.630
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: How
many hits for that

01:19:58.630 --> 01:19:59.930
in the last 20 minutes
is what I want to know.

01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:01.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thomas Witherspoon: Let me check.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:02.530
[ Laughter ]

01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:06.370
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:07.670
This is great.

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:14.200
The first comment that praised
this panel for expanding our view

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.570
of what digital curation
is is on the money.

01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:22.100
But, coming out of the
field of digital curation

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.270
or digital preservation as it's
emerged from libraries and archives

01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:30.090
over the last 15 or 20 years,
I still want to make a pitch.

01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:32.620
And, it's that in the
title of this conference

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:35.070 position:56%
or this session is digital curation.

01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:40.290
I'll make a pitch for
connecting these diverse projects

01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:43.530
to some pretty good
thinking about how

01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:46.560
to keep digital collections alive.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.450
I mean, it's not a solved
problem, but it's one that in

01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:53.350
which curators working in libraries

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:58.130
and archives internationally have
developed methods, techniques.

01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:59.680
And, it's not only
about the metadata.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.170
It's really about redundancy.

01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:02.800
It's about standards.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.620
It's about partnerships
with curatorial units

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.260
in which their mission
is to keep things alive.

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:14.940
So, what was mind blowing for me
is the ability to think about DIY,

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:19.110
to think about fan base material
without denying the relevance

01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:23.320
of standards and best
practices that libraries

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.500
and archives have been
developing internationally.

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.820
So, there is a need to foster
that cross conversation,

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.550
so that this really critical
stuff doesn't get lost.

01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:37.000
If it's in your bedroom,
at some point, you know,

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.120
I don't want you to
get hit by a bus.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.660
And, literally, things
like this happen.

01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:49.450
People, estate sales and computers
from the 1990s are opened up.

01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:52.710
And, lo and behold, it's
valuable raw materials.

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:57.100
So, what we want to do is connect
the dots between traditional,

01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:02.150
what is, I could call traditional
digital curation thinking and DIY

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:05.360
and innovative new applications.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.950
So, it's a pitch more
than anything else.

01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:09.790
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Anyone else?

01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:11.110
&gt;&gt; Elena Razlogova:
Can I respond to that?

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:12.410
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Oh, please.

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:14.620
&gt;&gt; Elena Razlogova:
Just one point to make.

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:19.100
I'm also blown away by the
professional approach to curation.

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.820
And, Library of Congress
archives, I worked in the archives.

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.120
They're amazing.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:27.070
But, we also have to remember that,
for example, environmental pages

01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:30.120
of the White House were
also government archive.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.650
And, it's not there anymore.

01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:36.230
So, I think redundancy
of government and outside

01:22:36.230 --> 01:22:39.540
of government also required.

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:43.010
&gt;&gt; Mark Williams: Yeah, it's a
great point, and we're so grateful

01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:45.590
to be working with
archivists, as, you know,

01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:47.080
we're not trying to
reinvent the wheel.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:50.230
We want to work with what the
archives want to work with.

01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:52.940
And, at the same time, it
comes back a little bit

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:57.480 position:56%
to the crowdsourcing kinds of issues
where certain professionals want

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.970
to use controlled vocabularies.

01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:04.450
And, we're happy to help in
that regard, but for true search

01:23:04.450 --> 01:23:09.460 position:56%
and discoverability, we want to know
the terms that ordinary folks use

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:10.780
for search and discoverability.

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:14.310
So, it's, there are all these
little dialectics, you know,

01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:16.550
that we're trying to,
trying to navigate,

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:18.620
and that's a great point to raise.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.920
Absolutely.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.610
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Okay.

01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:24.380
I think we have time for
one more, if it's quick.

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:29.300
Anyone? No?

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:32.080
Okay. Well, in radio speak, no?

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.880
&gt;&gt; Wait. We do have one.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.180
[inaudible].

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:36.480
&gt;&gt; Matt Barton: Oh, can't
see through the pillar here.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.500
Please. [laughs] It's a
marginalized community over here.

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.500
[ Laughter ]

01:23:46.410 --> 01:23:48.220
So, no? Okay.

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.050
[laughs] All right, then.

01:23:50.050 --> 01:23:52.720
In radio speak, the little clock
on the wall or the little clock

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.530
in my pocket is telling
us that it's 12:30.

01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:57.070
It's time for lunch.

01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:59.510
Please, let's have a hand
for this wonderful panel.

01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:06.140
[ Applause ]

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.640
Thank you all for coming, and
we'll see you back here real soon.

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:15.480
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
