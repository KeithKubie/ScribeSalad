00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's now apply the scientific method to a Python program which removes HTML markup.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
First of all, let us write down again what we have observed so far,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
what we expected, and what the output was.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If our input was foo in HTML markup, then we would expect the output foo,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the actual output was foo, so this is just fine.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If our input was the same thing in double quotes, we would expect the double quotes

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
also to appear in the output, but instead we get the HTML markup still included in the output

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that is the whole thing fails because of all the observations we made and from this,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we need to come up with the first hypothesis on what makes the error.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So, here a quiz. Which hypotheses are consistent with our observations so far?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Check all that apply.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Is it that double quotes are stripped from tagged input, is it that tags in double quotes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
are not stripped, is it that the tag for bold is always stripped from the input,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
or is it that four-letter word are stripped.
