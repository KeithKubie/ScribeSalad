00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.149
Can human beings wipe out a species for good?

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.900
… … … [ That's wordplay.]

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.760
Hey terminators, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.900
When we talk about extinction, most of the
time, it’s a bad thing.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.170
Nobody celebrated when poaching drove the
west african black rhino out of existence,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.840
because they had done nothing to incur the
wrath of humanity besides having a horn on

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.840
their face.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.920
So have human beings ever caused an extinction
that would make the most kind-hearted conservationist

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.650
bust out the confetti and sing “na na na
na hey hey hey goodbye?”

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.870
Has there ever been a good, intentional extinction?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.010
So far it has happened exactly one time.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.780
In 1979 smallpox was officially declared eradicated.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.850
The disease was caused by the variola virus
and existed for over 3,000 years.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.579
It caused raised, red bumps that would fill
with fluid that would turn into pus and 30%

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.280
of the people infected died.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.940
In the 20th century it killed some 300 million
people worldwide.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.079
Clearly it was a bad mama-jama, but thanks
to an aggressive global vaccination campaign,

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.950
it’s been wiped as far as we know out save
for a few samples that exist in laboratories.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.720
So if people ever ask what good vaccines do;
that.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.310
Nobody got all weepy eyed when variola took
a hike because it wasn’t a valuable part

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.470
of its ecosystem like other species we unintentionally
wipe out.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.660
Smallpox only affected humans, so once it’s
gone everybody wins.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.240
Well, except the virus.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.110
After smallpox we’ve come close to eliminating
a few other ailments, but we haven’t gotten

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.270
to 100% completion yet.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.940
The next closest species we’ve almost wiped
out (intentionally) is the guinea worm.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.670
The guinea worm is a parasite that’s terrible
in almost every way.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.500
It enters its human host when they drink contaminated
water.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.131
It drills out of their intestines and sets
up shop in the abdominal muscles where it

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:46.240
grows for a few months until it reaches sexual
maturity.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.360
Then the males and females mate, yes, while
still inside of a person, and the smaller

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.740
male dies while the female, which can grow
over a meter long, works its way down to the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.060
person’s leg.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.110
After being inside of its human host for over
a year, the female emerges from the leg or

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.550
foot and releases an irritant that causes
the wound to burn.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.270
It burns on and off for months, keeping the
infected person from being able to work.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.989
The only way to sooth it is with water, so
when the host sticks their leg in a stagnant

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.799
pool, the mother worm vomits out her millions
of embryos and the whole process starts over

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:17.799
again.

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.719
Now you may be thinking that if these embryos
are in the water, then something must eat

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.090
them, and you’d be right.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.189
They’re often eaten by water fleas.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.540
But they aren’t a valuable link in the food
chain, because they give the fleas the same

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.650
treatment we get; the guinea worm burrows
out of their digestive tract and munches on

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.680
their insides while it waits for a human to
swallow the flea.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.129
So everything about this worm is horrible,
and there’s no vaccine or drug that kills

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.129
it.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.430
The only way to get rid of it is to cut it
out or wait til it pokes its head out and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.499
then reel that sucker around a stick, drawing
it free a couple of centimeters at a time

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:49.859
over the course of weeks.

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.749
Efforts to educate people about how it spreads
and provide them with water filters have been

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.469
spectacularly successful.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:01.939
There were over 3 million cases in 1980, in
2015 there were 22, and so far in 2016 there

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.719
have been just 12 cases.

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.810
The fight’s not over yet, as now the worms
seem to have jumped to dogs to survive, but

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.690
if the campaign to end guinea worms in dogs
is as successful as it has been in humans,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.779
maybe in a couple of years humanity will have
wiped 2 species out.

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:16.779
That we meant to anyway.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.549
Can you imagine how long ago the guinea worm
would have gone extinct if it had a valuable

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.920
horn?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.549
Humans might be causing a mass extinction
but it’s not the first!

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.099
If you want a recap of the 5 previous times
the earth’s slate was almost wiped clean,

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:46.010
Trace has a video on 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.540
it here.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.090
After the Guinea worm, what’s the next disease
we should focus on to eliminate it forever?

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.090
Malaria?

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.090
I don't know...

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.499
