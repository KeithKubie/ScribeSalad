00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:04.070
Last night, I initiated
official lockdown procedure.

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.105
-(alarm blaring)
-That's right.

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:09.175
Shit has gotten real.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:11.811
No one is allowed
in or out of the bunker,

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.781
besides my opponent tonight,
musician and visual artist

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.182
Kim Gordon.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.917
-(cheering, applause)
-Yes.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.054
She's promoting the film,<i> Don't
 Worry, He Won't Get Far on
 Foot.</i>

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.656
I hope she finds her way
through my trap maze.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.926
Because... opposers,
we are in this together.

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.362
Together, we will fight back
against the forces

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:32.031
trying to shut down truth
and devour America!

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.633 line:0%
But first...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.236 line:0%
-(alarm stops) -we got to sell
some great products.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.939 line:0%
It's the ShOpposition Fire Sale.

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:43.376 line:0%
Look, if they have their way,
tomorrow is our last show,

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.712 line:0%
so we're here to sell you some
products to help you navigate

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.482 line:0%
the globo-fascist
news cycle without us.

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:53.152 line:0%
And though I've never lied
to you yet this episode, and...

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.921 line:0%
I'm not gonna start now.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.857
This has nothing to do
with us needing money,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.260
or my numerous gambling debts.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.496
This is about helping<i> you.</i>

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:06.299
Just like my buddy, Alex Jones,
over at<i> InfoWars.</i>

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:09.535
He makes around seven
to 12 million dollars a year

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.537
selling diet supplements alone.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.539
(chuckles)
More than enough to settle

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.209
-one of his many lawsuits.
-(laughter)

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.145
And we have ten times
the deals he does.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.414
Let's take a look
at these incredible deals.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:24.851
Laura Grey, what amazing
products do<i> you</i> have?

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.586 line:0%
Oh, you're gonna
love this, Jordan.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.955 line:0%
We here at the ShOpposition
know the best way

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.357 line:0%
to get ready for a fight
is to<i> stay</i> ready.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.026 line:0%
And nothing keeps you readier
than fear!

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:37.330 line:0%
But what happens if you
aren't just naturally afraid

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.031 line:0%
of nearly everything?

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:42.635 line:0%
That's when you need...
ShOpposition brand Fear Goggles.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:43.936
(laughter)

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.638
These goggles
are specially designed

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.540
to keep your anxiety high,

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.308
so you can see the truth.

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:50.910
Is that a professional athlete

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:53.146
kneeling to protest
police brutality?

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.715
Just slip on your goggles and...

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.283
Oh, my God!

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.519
It's blatant disrespect
for the flag

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.855
and a violent protest
against America!

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.590
(gasps):
Oh...

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:08.828
Hey. Is that two black men
calmly sitting in a Starbucks?

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.863
Fear Goggles on and...

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:13.399
Help! It's turbo ISIS
come to attack me

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:15.501
and steal
my half caf mocha frap!

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:16.636
KLEPPER:
Oh, I'll tell you.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:17.970
Lookin' good, Laura.

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:20.406
And remember, opposers,
if you don't see a threat,

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.075
you're just not looking
hard enough.

00:02:23.108 --> 00:02:25.545
Kobi Libii, what incredible
ShOpposition product

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.013
do you have for us?

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.382
-Jordan, you're gonna love this.
-Gentlemen, I'm sorry,

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.051
I'd like to report a criminal.
He is a man.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:33.853
He is standing inside,
wearing...

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:37.456
Laura, take off the goggles!

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.125
Oh, hey, Kobi.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:42.094
Uh, fun fact, opposers,
Laura's called 911 on me

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:44.330
at least 27 times.

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:47.266
Which is all the proof you need
that those goggles work.

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.002
You know what else works
like a cursed demon charm,

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:53.673
our ShOpposition brand
Slippery Slope 'N' Slide.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:54.974
(takes deep breath)

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:56.976
You'll have hours
of fun in the sun

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.245
while learning to make
the best kind of argument,

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:00.913
the Slippery Slope kind.

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:03.749
At the top of the slide, we see
a peaceful immigrant family

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:06.719
entering the U.S.,
but soon your local Burger King

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.588
starts selling empanadas,

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.224
your child has a playdate
with someone named Julio,

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.593
and before you know it--
my God, what's that!

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:16.629
A group of vicious
MS-13 gang members! Watch out!

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:18.664
Those face tattoos might bite.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.666
When you whiz down this baby,

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.769
you'll find yourself
sliding down a mental slope

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:27.406
into refreshing,
splash-tastic xenophobia.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.243
It's almost July,
get yours now.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:33.079
Also available in "gay marriage
leads to pet (bleep).”

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.847
Oh, no.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.649
This is a must-have for summer.

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:40.653
And the sale price of just
$49.99 is lower than Mike Pence

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:43.956
when he lovingly ties the
president's shoes every morning.

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.925
Aaron and Josh,
looks like you've got

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.994
a really big deal over there.

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.830
Yes, Jordan,
we are a very big deal

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.699
because we make everything
a big deal

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:55.801
if it's something we care about.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.337
Like, remember when
the Boy Scouts decided

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.274
to let girls in and libs were
all, like, "Woo-hoo,"

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:04.343
and we were all like,
"But it's the 'Boy' Scouts,"

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:06.879
and they were all like, "Is that
the hill you want to die on?”

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:09.015
And we were like, "Yes! Yes!

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.717
Watch us die..."

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.688
on our one-of-a-kind
Hill to Die On.

00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:18.224
(cheering and applause)

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:22.628
No fight is too small to make
a huge (bleep) deal over.

00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.431
Not enough people saying
"Merry Christmas"?

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:27.700
Die on that hill.

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:31.404
I have to think for two seconds
about your "preferred pronouns"?

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.839
-Die on that hill.
-KLEPPER: Oh.

00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:36.409
Give that guy a TV Oscar.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.878
Shopposers,

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:42.548
get your hands on your very own
Hill to Die On today.

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.950
Tucker Carlson,
I'm looking at you.

00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:48.287
It's the perfect prop for what
you naturally do every night.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.390
But our great products keep
flying off the shelves.

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:54.827
Tim Baltz, tell us how many
satisfied Shopposers we've got.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.798
Dozens, Jordan,
dozens of thousands.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:02.234
The Shopposition inbox is jammed
with glowing reviews,

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:05.604
like this one for our Cayenne
Heart-Accelerator pills.

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:07.773
Dr. Richard Jenkins writes,

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:12.144
"This product is fatal
at any dosage." One star.

00:05:12.177 --> 00:05:15.047
That's one star,
the best kind of star.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.717
Okay, everyone, I'm sure
what he really means

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.553
is "fatally great
at keeping you alert."

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:23.189
Tomato/potato, Jordan.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:26.392
The point is, that last product
will kill you.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:29.095
Let's move on to another
satisfied customer.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.564
This review is for our
Shopposition-brand

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:32.932
Bone Condenser.

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:35.868
Rupert19-- 19-- Rupert19--

00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:38.070
Boy.

00:05:38.103 --> 00:05:41.173

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:44.977

Don't know how this is supposed
to fit up there." One star.

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:54.420
-Nice. -I think that's enough
product reviews for now.

00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:56.822
Shopposers, this is serious.

00:05:56.855 --> 00:05:59.392
We're under attack, and with our
show going off the air,

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.060
you need these products

00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:03.062
so you can fight the globalists
on your own.

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:06.232
There's nothing strange about a
media outlet making you afraid,

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.835
then selling you products
to profit off that fear.

00:06:09.868 --> 00:06:13.005
Alex Jones tells you tap water
is feminizing men,

00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:16.709
then goes ahead and sells you
male vitality supplements.

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:18.644
If that seems awfully convenient
to you,

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:21.046
maybe you're just not seeing
things clearly.

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:22.848
In fact, you know what?

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.785
Let me bring out
my trusty gaslight.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:27.052
There.

00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:28.921
Look at that gaslight.

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:30.523
If you think
I'm making up problems

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.091
and then selling you
the solution,

00:06:32.124 --> 00:06:34.260
your brain's just broken.

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:36.429
Good thing I sell
brain-fixer pills,

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:39.198
now on sale at
theshopposition.com.

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.966
Is this gaslight getting bigger?

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:42.435
Buy my drugs.

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.103
Get on board.

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:45.704
Who doesn't like pills?

00:06:45.737 --> 00:06:47.072
Yummy, yummy in my tummy.

00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:49.241
Pills make daddy go vroom-vroom.

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:50.643
Don't question it.

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:51.944
You need them.

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:52.978
We're at war.

00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:53.979
How do you know?

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:54.980
I already told you.

00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:56.582
Look at the gaslight.

00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:59.285
(bleep) it.
Buy the gaslight...

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:02.087
with five reasonable payments

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.559
of $29.66666.

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:09.395
Wow, that is a deal!

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:11.397
(cheers and applause)

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.632
Our phone lines are open,
Opposers,

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:15.367
and we need you
to win this fight.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.735
The fight continues.
