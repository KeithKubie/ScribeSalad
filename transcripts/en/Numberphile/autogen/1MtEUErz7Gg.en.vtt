okay so today I want to show you a

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.540
okay so today I want to show you a
 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.930
okay so today I want to show you a
fractal see well okay so you may ask you

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940
fractal see well okay so you may ask you
 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.040
fractal see well okay so you may ask you
know what is the zero well see well is

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050
know what is the zero well see well is
 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.700
know what is the zero well see well is
something that solves this equation a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
something that solves this equation a
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.460
something that solves this equation a
plus x equals a but then you say well

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
plus x equals a but then you say well
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.130
plus x equals a but then you say well
what is a if we are talking about say

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
what is a if we are talking about say
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.830
what is a if we are talking about say
the counting numbers you know so we say

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
the counting numbers you know so we say
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.070
the counting numbers you know so we say
one two three and so on

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
one two three and so on
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.070
one two three and so on
if I am only allowed to use the counting

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
if I am only allowed to use the counting
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.939
if I am only allowed to use the counting
numbers then I you know X cannot be

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
numbers then I you know X cannot be
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.709
numbers then I you know X cannot be
there is no counting number that will

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
there is no counting number that will
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.260
there is no counting number that will
solve this question so in the country

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
solve this question so in the country
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.619
solve this question so in the country
the counting numbers do not have zero

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629
the counting numbers do not have zero
 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.690
the counting numbers do not have zero
well they are the natural numbers do

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
well they are the natural numbers do
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.450
well they are the natural numbers do
right so we put zero and then we call

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
right so we put zero and then we call
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.490
right so we put zero and then we call
these the natural numbers 0 1 2 3 4 they

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
these the natural numbers 0 1 2 3 4 they
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.029
these the natural numbers 0 1 2 3 4 they
do have a 0 it's x equals 0 but this

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
do have a 0 it's x equals 0 but this
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.939
do have a 0 it's x equals 0 but this
zero okay so in the natural numbers if

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
zero okay so in the natural numbers if
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610
zero okay so in the natural numbers if
you were going to solve a different

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
you were going to solve a different
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.260
you were going to solve a different
equation for example a plus x equals 0

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
equation for example a plus x equals 0
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.859
equation for example a plus x equals 0
if in the natural numbers then this only

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
if in the natural numbers then this only
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.370
if in the natural numbers then this only
has one solution if a 0 if a is not 0

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
has one solution if a 0 if a is not 0
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320
has one solution if a 0 if a is not 0
then these have no solutions

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
then these have no solutions
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.570
then these have no solutions
right so then how do you solve this well

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
right so then how do you solve this well
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.690
right so then how do you solve this well
you solve this by then you know having

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
you solve this by then you know having
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.780
you solve this by then you know having
even more numbers and then talk about

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
even more numbers and then talk about
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.539
even more numbers and then talk about
what we call the integers dot dot dot

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
what we call the integers dot dot dot
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.819
what we call the integers dot dot dot
minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 and so on

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 and so on
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.899
minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 and so on
in this set these two equations you know

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
in this set these two equations you know
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390
in this set these two equations you know
have solutions so there is a 0 and and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
have solutions so there is a 0 and and
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.149
have solutions so there is a 0 and and
you can always solve a plus X equal 0

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159
you can always solve a plus X equal 0
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.429
you can always solve a plus X equal 0
today I will show you a different type

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
today I will show you a different type
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.520
today I will show you a different type
of number okay they have this very

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
of number okay they have this very
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.749
of number okay they have this very
special 0 that looks like a frat okay

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
special 0 that looks like a frat okay
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.840
special 0 that looks like a frat okay
and these new numbers that I will talk

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
and these new numbers that I will talk
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.080
and these new numbers that I will talk
about they're called sandpile so what is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
about they're called sandpile so what is
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.749
about they're called sandpile so what is
the sample so this is a you know it's

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
the sample so this is a you know it's
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.350
the sample so this is a you know it's
going to be a 3 by 3 green okay and on

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
going to be a 3 by 3 green okay and on
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.149
going to be a 3 by 3 green okay and on
this 3 by 3 grid I am going to put

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
this 3 by 3 grid I am going to put
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.109
this 3 by 3 grid I am going to put
numbers that are either 0 1 2 or 3 so in

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
numbers that are either 0 1 2 or 3 so in
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.080
numbers that are either 0 1 2 or 3 so in
every one of these nine cells I'm going

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
every one of these nine cells I'm going
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.080
every one of these nine cells I'm going
to put either

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
to put either
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.809
to put either
I want a two or a three and that's going

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819
I want a two or a three and that's going
 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.940
I want a two or a three and that's going
to be my sand pile so these numbers

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
to be my sand pile so these numbers
 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.089
to be my sand pile so these numbers
represent number of grains of sand that

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099
represent number of grains of sand that
 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.449
represent number of grains of sand that
you put one on one shell in this grid

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459
you put one on one shell in this grid
 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.479
you put one on one shell in this grid
and so these are my numbers and then I

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489
and so these are my numbers and then I
 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.910
and so these are my numbers and then I
need to tell you about well what's the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920
need to tell you about well what's the
 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.160
need to tell you about well what's the
addition how am I going to add them so

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170
addition how am I going to add them so
 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.690
addition how am I going to add them so
for example 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 3 let's add

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700
for example 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 3 let's add
 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.699
for example 1 2 0 2 1 1 0 1 3 let's add
let's say 2 1 3 1 0 1 0 1 ok so I have

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709
let's say 2 1 3 1 0 1 0 1 ok so I have
 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.539
let's say 2 1 3 1 0 1 0 1 ok so I have
it here to sand piles and how do I add

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549
it here to sand piles and how do I add
 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.080
it here to sand piles and how do I add
them

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090
them
 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.140
them
well I add them by adding every number

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150
well I add them by adding every number
 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.339
well I add them by adding every number
number in itself so if you have 1 + 2

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349
number in itself so if you have 1 + 2
 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.870
number in itself so if you have 1 + 2
that's going to be 3 2 + 1 that's also 3

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880
that's going to be 3 2 + 1 that's also 3
 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.150
that's going to be 3 2 + 1 that's also 3
0 + 3 3 2 plus 1 is 3 1 plus 0 is 1 1

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160
0 + 3 3 2 plus 1 is 3 1 plus 0 is 1 1
 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.650
0 + 3 3 2 plus 1 is 3 1 plus 0 is 1 1
plus 1 is 2 0 plus 0 is 0 1 plus 1 is 2

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660
plus 1 is 2 0 plus 0 is 0 1 plus 1 is 2
 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.120
plus 1 is 2 0 plus 0 is 0 1 plus 1 is 2
3 plus 0 is 2 ok so that's these are my

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130
3 plus 0 is 2 ok so that's these are my
 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.900
3 plus 0 is 2 ok so that's these are my
new numbers and how to add them now I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910
new numbers and how to add them now I
 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.280
new numbers and how to add them now I
can run into trouble

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290
can run into trouble
 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.520
can run into trouble
yes for example if I change one of these

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530
yes for example if I change one of these
 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.580
yes for example if I change one of these
numbers for example these 1 for a 2 then

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590
numbers for example these 1 for a 2 then
 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.370
numbers for example these 1 for a 2 then
I'm going to have 2 + 2 which is 4 and I

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380
I'm going to have 2 + 2 which is 4 and I
 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.400
I'm going to have 2 + 2 which is 4 and I
am not allowing for so how do I fix that

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410
am not allowing for so how do I fix that
 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.710
am not allowing for so how do I fix that
problem okay and so this is why these

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720
problem okay and so this is why these
 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.170
problem okay and so this is why these
are called sand piles so there is some

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180
are called sand piles so there is some
 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.690
are called sand piles so there is some
dynamic thing that happens in here

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700
dynamic thing that happens in here
 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.599
dynamic thing that happens in here
and so when I when I'm angry which is 4

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609
and so when I when I'm angry which is 4
 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.349
and so when I when I'm angry which is 4
it is unstable and it's going to topple

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359
it is unstable and it's going to topple
 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.460
it is unstable and it's going to topple
and send the drinks of sand to their

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470
and send the drinks of sand to their
 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.750
and send the drinks of sand to their
neighbors okay okay now like 1/2 of

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760
neighbors okay okay now like 1/2 of
 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.720
neighbors okay okay now like 1/2 of
cards that's right so in here because

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730
cards that's right so in here because
 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.050
cards that's right so in here because
this 4 is in a corner then it has two

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060
this 4 is in a corner then it has two
 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.629
this 4 is in a corner then it has two
neighboring cell okay and then 2 other

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639
neighboring cell okay and then 2 other
 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.430
neighboring cell okay and then 2 other
you know imagine that this is sitting on

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440
you know imagine that this is sitting on
 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.440
you know imagine that this is sitting on
top of our table and then so it's going

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450
top of our table and then so it's going
 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.099
top of our table and then so it's going
to send one kind of sent to these three

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109
to send one kind of sent to these three
 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.009
to send one kind of sent to these three
and then one will send to this other 3

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019
and then one will send to this other 3
 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.170
and then one will send to this other 3
okay everything else remains the same

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180
okay everything else remains the same
 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.570
okay everything else remains the same
and then it's going to lose one going

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580
and then it's going to lose one going
 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.190
and then it's going to lose one going
sent to this edge and one great

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200
sent to this edge and one great
 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.710
sent to this edge and one great
Center this edge and now it's going to

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720
Center this edge and now it's going to
 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.530
Center this edge and now it's going to
have zero now this process created two

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540
have zero now this process created two
 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.050
have zero now this process created two
new four so then I have to repeat it

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060
new four so then I have to repeat it
 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.760
new four so then I have to repeat it
again because remember my rules is that

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770
again because remember my rules is that
 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.770
again because remember my rules is that
the entries have to be between zero and

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780
the entries have to be between zero and
 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.680
the entries have to be between zero and
three and you do this process until you

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690
three and you do this process until you
 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.900
three and you do this process until you
have no more force and here as you see

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910
have no more force and here as you see
 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.210
have no more force and here as you see
we created one yet one more force we

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220
we created one yet one more force we
 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.040
we created one yet one more force we
need to repeat this process and that's

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050
need to repeat this process and that's
 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.230
need to repeat this process and that's
the addition of the two samples that we

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240
the addition of the two samples that we
 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.510
the addition of the two samples that we
have at the beginning okay so then the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520
have at the beginning okay so then the
 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.660
have at the beginning okay so then the
question is do we have a free will in

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670
question is do we have a free will in
 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.770
question is do we have a free will in
this in this set of samples and well it

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780
this in this set of samples and well it
 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.570
this in this set of samples and well it
turns out that it's you know from the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580
turns out that it's you know from the
 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.750
turns out that it's you know from the
definition of of this addition the zero

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760
definition of of this addition the zero
 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.890
definition of of this addition the zero
is unsurprisingly zero zero zero zero

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900
is unsurprisingly zero zero zero zero
 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.520
is unsurprisingly zero zero zero zero
zero zero zero zero here if I add

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530
zero zero zero zero here if I add
 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.920
zero zero zero zero here if I add
anything to this I am NOT going to do

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930
anything to this I am NOT going to do
 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.630
anything to this I am NOT going to do
anything well that was sort like a

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640
anything well that was sort like a
 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.300
anything well that was sort like a
boring theorem and it is boring because

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310
boring theorem and it is boring because
 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.290
boring theorem and it is boring because
if I want to solve an equation like a

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300
if I want to solve an equation like a
 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.880
if I want to solve an equation like a
plus x equals zero where this is one you

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890
plus x equals zero where this is one you
 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.760
plus x equals zero where this is one you
know every single thing is a sample then

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770
know every single thing is a sample then
 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.240
know every single thing is a sample then
this equation has no solutions so if I

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250
this equation has no solutions so if I
 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.910
this equation has no solutions so if I
put two samples together you know if I

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920
put two samples together you know if I
 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.730
put two samples together you know if I
have a sample a and a sample X and I put

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740
have a sample a and a sample X and I put
 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.200
have a sample a and a sample X and I put
them together I will never be able to

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210
them together I will never be able to
 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.540
them together I will never be able to
topple everything until I get a 0 there

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550
topple everything until I get a 0 there
 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.390
topple everything until I get a 0 there
is no - a sand pile it doesn't exist and

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400
is no - a sand pile it doesn't exist and
 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.790
is no - a sand pile it doesn't exist and
the reason ok so if we if we put numbers

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800
the reason ok so if we if we put numbers
 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.680
the reason ok so if we if we put numbers
into our sand pile so we say a 1 a 2 a 3

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690
into our sand pile so we say a 1 a 2 a 3
 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.480
into our sand pile so we say a 1 a 2 a 3
a a a 9 so we put nine numbers you know

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490
a a a 9 so we put nine numbers you know
 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.520
a a a 9 so we put nine numbers you know
and this is like the result of some

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530
and this is like the result of some
 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.280
and this is like the result of some
addition then there will there will be

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290
addition then there will there will be
 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.080
addition then there will there will be
top links okay there will be top links

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090
top links okay there will be top links
 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.900
top links okay there will be top links
but at the end of the day you loose and

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910
but at the end of the day you loose and
 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.500
but at the end of the day you loose and
only if you are on the edge of this grid

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510
only if you are on the edge of this grid
 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.480
only if you are on the edge of this grid
but however every single time you are on

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490
but however every single time you are on
 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.540
but however every single time you are on
an edge can get sent to another

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550
an edge can get sent to another
 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.630
an edge can get sent to another
neighboring cell so you will never be

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640
neighboring cell so you will never be
 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.450
neighboring cell so you will never be
able to get rid of entire sent so there

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460
able to get rid of entire sent so there
 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.410
able to get rid of entire sent so there
is no - a sand pile so how do we fix

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420
is no - a sand pile so how do we fix
 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.320
is no - a sand pile so how do we fix
that in the natural number okay we fix

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330
that in the natural number okay we fix
 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.720
that in the natural number okay we fix
that by making them bigger into the

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730
that by making them bigger into the
 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.000
that by making them bigger into the
integers so we threw a

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010
integers so we threw a
 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.360
integers so we threw a
all the negative numbers and here we're

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370
all the negative numbers and here we're
 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.860
all the negative numbers and here we're
going to do something different we are

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870
going to do something different we are
 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.740
going to do something different we are
actually going to shrink our set so what

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750
actually going to shrink our set so what
 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.240
actually going to shrink our set so what
is the step that we're considering we

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250
is the step that we're considering we
 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.150
is the step that we're considering we
are considering every single sample with

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160
are considering every single sample with
 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.470
are considering every single sample with
this so are the set that we're

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480
this so are the set that we're
 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.870
this so are the set that we're
considering let me call it m and this

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880
considering let me call it m and this
 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.830
considering let me call it m and this
set M is the set of all sand piles all

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840
set M is the set of all sand piles all
 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.420
set M is the set of all sand piles all
sand piles on the three by three grid

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430
sand piles on the three by three grid
 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.880
sand piles on the three by three grid
yes we're a sand pile is just a

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890
yes we're a sand pile is just a
 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.680
yes we're a sand pile is just a
collection of nine numbers where every

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690
collection of nine numbers where every
 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.870
collection of nine numbers where every
number is between zero one two or three

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880
number is between zero one two or three
 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.230
number is between zero one two or three
and in fact how many such fun paths are

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240
and in fact how many such fun paths are
 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.790
and in fact how many such fun paths are
there we have nine cells this cell can

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800
there we have nine cells this cell can
 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.360
there we have nine cells this cell can
be a 0 a 1 a 2 or a 3 so it has four

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370
be a 0 a 1 a 2 or a 3 so it has four
 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.880
be a 0 a 1 a 2 or a 3 so it has four
possibilities this cell has also four

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890
possibilities this cell has also four
 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.620
possibilities this cell has also four
possibilities this arrow has four

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.630
possibilities this arrow has four
 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.260
possibilities this arrow has four
possibilities as well so a basic

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270
possibilities as well so a basic
 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.260
possibilities as well so a basic
counting says that we have four to the

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270
counting says that we have four to the
 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.980
counting says that we have four to the
nine total and piles and this number

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:34.990
nine total and piles and this number
 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.890
nine total and piles and this number
happens to be two hundred and sixty-two

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:37.900
happens to be two hundred and sixty-two
 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.650
happens to be two hundred and sixty-two
thousand one hundred and forty-four so

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660
thousand one hundred and forty-four so
 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.930
thousand one hundred and forty-four so
this is the set of all sand pile but now

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:42.940
this is the set of all sand pile but now
 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.420
this is the set of all sand pile but now
we're going to shrink it okay so we are

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430
we're going to shrink it okay so we are
 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.250
we're going to shrink it okay so we are
not going to consider all the sand piles

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:47.260
not going to consider all the sand piles
 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.670
not going to consider all the sand piles
we are just going to consider a smaller

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680
we are just going to consider a smaller
 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.040
we are just going to consider a smaller
collection of them and that smaller

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.050
collection of them and that smaller
 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.400
collection of them and that smaller
collection is the collection of samples

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:55.410
collection is the collection of samples
 

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.100
collection is the collection of samples
that I can obtain by starting with the

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.110
that I can obtain by starting with the
 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.360
that I can obtain by starting with the
all three yes do threes is the sample

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.370
all three yes do threes is the sample
 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.170
all three yes do threes is the sample
that has the most sense okay and then

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:07.180
that has the most sense okay and then
 

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.150
that has the most sense okay and then
I'm going to add whatever I want to add

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:09.160
I'm going to add whatever I want to add
 

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.640
I'm going to add whatever I want to add
to it and when I'm done you know the

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:13.650
to it and when I'm done you know the
 

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.020
to it and when I'm done you know the
resulting sand pile is going to be in my

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.030
resulting sand pile is going to be in my
 

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.790
resulting sand pile is going to be in my
new collection okay so the new

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800
new collection okay so the new
 

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.410
new collection okay so the new
collection the smaller collections is

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:19.420
collection the smaller collections is
 

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.500
collection the smaller collections is
all the samples that I can obtain from

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:22.510
all the samples that I can obtain from
 

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.500
all the samples that I can obtain from
the old threes by adding extra sand and

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:25.510
the old threes by adding extra sand and
 

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.160
the old threes by adding extra sand and
then toppling so for example if I add

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.170
then toppling so for example if I add
 

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.219
then toppling so for example if I add
just one grain of sand in the center

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:32.229
just one grain of sand in the center
 

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:38.000
just one grain of sand in the center
cells then well I have everywhere threes

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.010
cells then well I have everywhere threes
 

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.210
cells then well I have everywhere threes
except a four in here all you're going

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.220
except a four in here all you're going
 

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.270
except a four in here all you're going
to start a big top right now yes yes so

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:45.280
to start a big top right now yes yes so
 

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.840
to start a big top right now yes yes so
I start toppling and so these four is

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:48.850
I start toppling and so these four is
 

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.400
I start toppling and so these four is
going to send one grain of sand to each

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.410
going to send one grain of sand to each
 

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.990
going to send one grain of sand to each
of its four neighbors

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000
of its four neighbors
 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.249
of its four neighbors
so three four three four zero four three

00:08:56.249 --> 00:08:56.259
so three four three four zero four three
 

00:08:56.259 --> 00:09:01.439
so three four three four zero four three
four three I have now for unstable birds

00:09:01.439 --> 00:09:01.449
four three I have now for unstable birds
 

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:03.530
four three I have now for unstable birds
if I can topple them all simultaneously

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540
if I can topple them all simultaneously
 

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.480
if I can topple them all simultaneously
so each of them is going to lose four

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:06.490
so each of them is going to lose four
 

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.100
so each of them is going to lose four
grains of sand so now they are going to

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.110
grains of sand so now they are going to
 

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.179
grains of sand so now they are going to
be zeros they are going to send each is

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:12.189
be zeros they are going to send each is
 

00:09:12.189 --> 00:09:13.619
be zeros they are going to send each is
going to send one grain of sand to the

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:13.629
going to send one grain of sand to the
 

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:16.050
going to send one grain of sand to the
center so now the center has four grains

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.060
center so now the center has four grains
 

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.030
center so now the center has four grains
of sand again and the corners will

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.040
of sand again and the corners will
 

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.040
of sand again and the corners will
receive one grain of sand from one side

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.050
receive one grain of sand from one side
 

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.559
receive one grain of sand from one side
and one grandson - from the other so now

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:22.569
and one grandson - from the other so now
 

00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:28.360
and one grandson - from the other so now
the corners have five

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:28.370
 
 

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.170
 
okay and we need to repeat this process

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:32.180
okay and we need to repeat this process
 

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.120
okay and we need to repeat this process
these four is going to send one grain of

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.130
these four is going to send one grain of
 

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.980
these four is going to send one grain of
sand to each of its neighbors now it has

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:36.990
sand to each of its neighbors now it has
 

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.640
sand to each of its neighbors now it has
zero

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:37.650
zero
 

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.000
zero
the corners are still 5 we topple the

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.010
the corners are still 5 we topple the
 

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.470
the corners are still 5 we topple the
corners and we get you know they are

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480
corners and we get you know they are
 

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.270
corners and we get you know they are
going to lose four grains of sand so

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:47.280
going to lose four grains of sand so
 

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.940
going to lose four grains of sand so
each corner will have one at the end and

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:52.950
each corner will have one at the end and
 

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.380
each corner will have one at the end and
then these numbers going to get one

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:54.390
then these numbers going to get one
 

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.000
then these numbers going to get one
grain of sand from here one grand-slam

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.010
grain of sand from here one grand-slam
 

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.380
grain of sand from here one grand-slam
from these other five so now they are

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:57.390
from these other five so now they are
 

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.430
from these other five so now they are
going to be pleased so that is part of

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440
going to be pleased so that is part of
 

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.530
going to be pleased so that is part of
my new set this is part of my new set

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540
my new set this is part of my new set
 

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.950
my new set this is part of my new set
correct yes so these new sets

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:06.960
correct yes so these new sets
 

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.490
correct yes so these new sets
okay have many many samples you know the

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:10.500
okay have many many samples you know the
 

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.350
okay have many many samples you know the
original set had two hundred and

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360
original set had two hundred and
 

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.570
original set had two hundred and
sixty-two thousand one hundred forty for

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580
sixty-two thousand one hundred forty for
 

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.480
sixty-two thousand one hundred forty for
our new set so this I said that I'm

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.490
our new set so this I said that I'm
 

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.350
our new set so this I said that I'm
going to call F which is the sand piles

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360
going to call F which is the sand piles
 

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.230
going to call F which is the sand piles
arising from the old three it's much

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240
arising from the old three it's much
 

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.690
arising from the old three it's much
smaller it's about a half it's half as

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:26.700
smaller it's about a half it's half as
 

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.130
smaller it's about a half it's half as
big it has more or less a hundred tough

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:30.140
big it has more or less a hundred tough
 

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.460
big it has more or less a hundred tough
now one we have one big problem here and

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:34.470
now one we have one big problem here and
 

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.300
now one we have one big problem here and
the big problem is that the zero zero

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:38.310
the big problem is that the zero zero
 

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.960
the big problem is that the zero zero
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero is

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:41.970
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero is
 

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.310
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero is
not in because you know we start from

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320
not in because you know we start from
 

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.740
not in because you know we start from
max we add sand to it we are never going

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:48.750
max we add sand to it we are never going
 

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.120
max we add sand to it we are never going
to get rid of all the cent

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:50.130
to get rid of all the cent
 

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.820
to get rid of all the cent
so this zero is not in our sub

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:52.830
so this zero is not in our sub
 

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.760
so this zero is not in our sub
collection so we lost our zero we wanted

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:55.770
collection so we lost our zero we wanted
 

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.990
collection so we lost our zero we wanted
to find sort of the - sand pile and now

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000
to find sort of the - sand pile and now
 

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.180
to find sort of the - sand pile and now
we have even a bigger problem which is

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:02.190
we have even a bigger problem which is
 

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.140
we have even a bigger problem which is
we don't have a fever

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:03.150
we don't have a fever
 

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.720
we don't have a fever
however let me show you just a couple of

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:05.730
however let me show you just a couple of
 

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.100
however let me show you just a couple of
these computations as you can see they

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.110
these computations as you can see they
 

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.680
these computations as you can see they
take a little bit of time so let me show

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:09.690
take a little bit of time so let me show
 

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.760
take a little bit of time so let me show
you just a couple more computations okay

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:13.770
you just a couple more computations okay
 

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:19.400
you just a couple more computations okay
okay so it turns out okay that the old

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:19.410
okay so it turns out okay that the old
 

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.240
okay so it turns out okay that the old
tooth is in s it is you can get also you

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.250
tooth is in s it is you can get also you
 

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:28.390
tooth is in s it is you can get also you
can get co2 so this all Q's is the old 3

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:28.400
can get co2 so this all Q's is the old 3
 

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:40.100
can get co2 so this all Q's is the old 3
plus 1 3 1 3 3 3 1 3 1

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:40.110
 
 

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.210
 
and also let me show you another one

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220
and also let me show you another one
 

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.610
and also let me show you another one
that another element that is in X so

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:46.620
that another element that is in X so
 

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:53.990
that another element that is in X so
these elements 2 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 is also

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000
these elements 2 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 is also
 

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
these elements 2 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 is also
less so now I'm going to add these two

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.010
less so now I'm going to add these two
 

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.470
less so now I'm going to add these two
new sand piles that are you okay so I'm

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480
new sand piles that are you okay so I'm
 

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:07.190
new sand piles that are you okay so I'm
going to add the 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 so

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200
going to add the 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 so
 

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.490
going to add the 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 so
the old 2's plus this new element that

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500
the old 2's plus this new element that
 

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.770
the old 2's plus this new element that
we go 2 2 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 if I add them

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:15.780
we go 2 2 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 if I add them
 

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:26.170
we go 2 2 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 if I add them
then I gave the 4 3 4 3 2 3 4 3 4

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:26.180
then I gave the 4 3 4 3 2 3 4 3 4
 

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.260
then I gave the 4 3 4 3 2 3 4 3 4
yes and I have 4 in the corners so I'm

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:30.270
yes and I have 4 in the corners so I'm
 

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.040
yes and I have 4 in the corners so I'm
going to topple them and so each of the

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.050
going to topple them and so each of the
 

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.630
going to topple them and so each of the
force is going to lose four grains of

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640
force is going to lose four grains of
 

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.700
force is going to lose four grains of
sand so now I'm going to have zeros in

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:37.710
sand so now I'm going to have zeros in
 

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.780
sand so now I'm going to have zeros in
the corners and then these three is

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:41.790
the corners and then these three is
 

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.280
the corners and then these three is
going to receive one greater than from

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:43.290
going to receive one greater than from
 

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.870
going to receive one greater than from
this for another grain of sand from

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880
this for another grain of sand from
 

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.310
this for another grain of sand from
these other four so now they're going to

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320
these other four so now they're going to
 

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.930
these other four so now they're going to
be five sides and I still have a two in

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940
be five sides and I still have a two in
 

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.670
be five sides and I still have a two in
descent ok so now all the files topple

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680
descent ok so now all the files topple
 

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.400
descent ok so now all the files topple
and we are going to lose four grains of

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:58.410
and we are going to lose four grains of
 

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.250
and we are going to lose four grains of
sands all the files are going to be now

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260
sands all the files are going to be now
 

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:06.230
sands all the files are going to be now
one okay they are going to send each

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240
one okay they are going to send each
 

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.940
one okay they are going to send each
value and send one grand ocean to the

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:07.950
value and send one grand ocean to the
 

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.680
value and send one grand ocean to the
center so now the center sale has two

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:12.690
center so now the center sale has two
 

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.370
center so now the center sale has two
plus four meaning 6 threads of sand and

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380
plus four meaning 6 threads of sand and
 

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.230
plus four meaning 6 threads of sand and
then each of the corners is going to get

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240
then each of the corners is going to get
 

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.870
then each of the corners is going to get
1% from each side so now they are going

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880
1% from each side so now they are going
 

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.970
1% from each side so now they are going
to have to and v6 will topple is going

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:25.980
to have to and v6 will topple is going
 

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.160
to have to and v6 will topple is going
to lose four grains of sand and we get

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.170
to lose four grains of sand and we get
 

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:36.740
to lose four grains of sand and we get
the all twos back this is something that

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:36.750
the all twos back this is something that
 

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.320
the all twos back this is something that
it's a little bit surprising ok so we

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.330
it's a little bit surprising ok so we
 

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.300
it's a little bit surprising ok so we
have to some parts we have the old tools

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:41.310
have to some parts we have the old tools
 

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.280
have to some parts we have the old tools
and then we have this other sand pile we

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:43.290
and then we have this other sand pile we
 

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.320
and then we have this other sand pile we
put it on top of each other and we get

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:45.330
put it on top of each other and we get
 

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.960
put it on top of each other and we get
the old tools back so it's acting like a

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:47.970
the old tools back so it's acting like a
 

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.480
the old tools back so it's acting like a
zero and in fact if we were to do this

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:50.490
zero and in fact if we were to do this
 

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.570
zero and in fact if we were to do this
computation again on the all three

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:53.580
computation again on the all three
 

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:58.220
computation again on the all three
or on any other sample in F we will get

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:58.230
or on any other sample in F we will get
 

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.640
or on any other sample in F we will get
the same sample so the zero in our new

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:01.650
the same sample so the zero in our new
 

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.830
the same sample so the zero in our new
set F R 0 is these two one two one zero

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:06.840
set F R 0 is these two one two one zero
 

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.900
set F R 0 is these two one two one zero
one two one two

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:08.910
one two one two
 

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.450
one two one two
so that will have that effect on any

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:11.460
so that will have that effect on any
 

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.360
so that will have that effect on any
other stand hold in air correct correct

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:14.370
other stand hold in air correct correct
 

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.270
other stand hold in air correct correct
and the maximum MAGIX and it's the

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:17.280
and the maximum MAGIX and it's the
 

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.820
and the maximum MAGIX and it's the
automatic sample and in fact it can be

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:19.830
automatic sample and in fact it can be
 

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.130
automatic sample and in fact it can be
used to separate these two sets like the

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:22.140
used to separate these two sets like the
 

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.350
used to separate these two sets like the
things that are in s and the things that

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360
things that are in s and the things that
 

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.780
things that are in s and the things that
are not if you are a fan pile that it

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:26.790
are not if you are a fan pile that it
 

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.990
are not if you are a fan pile that it
doesn't come from the old trees okay

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000
doesn't come from the old trees okay
 

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.270
doesn't come from the old trees okay
then you're not going to get the same

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:32.280
then you're not going to get the same
 

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.820
then you're not going to get the same
sample after you add like a test you can

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:34.830
sample after you add like a test you can
 

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.040
sample after you add like a test you can
apply it's a text yes it's a test

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.050
apply it's a text yes it's a test
 

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:41.960
apply it's a text yes it's a test
oh that's a good question so what do you

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:41.970
oh that's a good question so what do you
 

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.580
oh that's a good question so what do you
think that should happen I think it

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:43.590
think that should happen I think it
 

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.090
think that should happen I think it
should result in itself we can check

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:47.100
should result in itself we can check
 

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.170
should result in itself we can check
that yes

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.180
that yes
 

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.290
that yes
so to each cells we could have just

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300
so to each cells we could have just
 

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.990
so to each cells we could have just
multiply every entry by two butts okay

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000
multiply every entry by two butts okay
 

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.380
multiply every entry by two butts okay
so let's do it four four two four two

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:57.390
so let's do it four four two four two
 

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.790
so let's do it four four two four two
zero two four two four again we have

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800
zero two four two four again we have
 

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.030
zero two four two four again we have
fours in the corners they are going to

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040
fours in the corners they are going to
 

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.610
fours in the corners they are going to
topple zero in the center and when the

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620
topple zero in the center and when the
 

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.490
topple zero in the center and when the
fourth bubble you know they are going to

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.500
fourth bubble you know they are going to
 

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.580
fourth bubble you know they are going to
be going to zero the news for grains of

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:13.590
be going to zero the news for grains of
 

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.410
be going to zero the news for grains of
sand the corners are going to receive

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.420
sand the corners are going to receive
 

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.750
sand the corners are going to receive
two grains of sand each and the center

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760
two grains of sand each and the center
 

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.510
two grains of sand each and the center
is going to get one grain of sand from

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:20.520
is going to get one grain of sand from
 

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.220
is going to get one grain of sand from
each of the fourth I need to topple the

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.230
each of the fourth I need to topple the
 

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.820
each of the fourth I need to topple the
center and I get exactly two one two one

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:25.830
center and I get exactly two one two one
 

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.790
center and I get exactly two one two one

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.950
0 1 2 1 what do we call that special
power I call it a magic power token I am

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:42.960
power I call it a magic power token I am
 

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.320
power I call it a magic power token I am
well we call it the identity some pile

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:45.330
well we call it the identity some pile
 

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.320
well we call it the identity some pile
but you know it's also the zero of this

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:48.330
but you know it's also the zero of this
 

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.900
but you know it's also the zero of this
set so we indeed call it a favor let me

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:50.910
set so we indeed call it a favor let me
 

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.570
set so we indeed call it a favor let me
show you yet one more beautiful property

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:53.580
show you yet one more beautiful property
 

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.310
show you yet one more beautiful property
of this zero remember at the beginning

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320
of this zero remember at the beginning
 

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.930
of this zero remember at the beginning
we had these equations a plus x equals 0

00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940
we had these equations a plus x equals 0
 

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.270
we had these equations a plus x equals 0
now our zero is these two one two one

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:02.280
now our zero is these two one two one
 

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:02.950
now our zero is these two one two one
two

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:02.960
two
 

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.980

one two one two it turns out that in s

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:05.990
one two one two it turns out that in s
 

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.830
one two one two it turns out that in s
we can always solve these equations so

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:08.840
we can always solve these equations so
 

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.270
we can always solve these equations so
there is always a - sand pile on s we

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:13.280
there is always a - sand pile on s we
 

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.920
there is always a - sand pile on s we
can always solve this question so this

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:14.930
can always solve this question so this
 

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:18.250
can always solve this question so this
set s has you know it behaves in sort of

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:18.260
set s has you know it behaves in sort of
 

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.600
set s has you know it behaves in sort of
like the integers

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:19.610
like the integers
 

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.950
like the integers
they each have a zero but it also has

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:22.960
they each have a zero but it also has
 

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.890
they each have a zero but it also has
you know this additive inverses this - a

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:26.900
you know this additive inverses this - a
 

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.870
you know this additive inverses this - a
sand pile you know if we start from the

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880
sand pile you know if we start from the
 

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.320
sand pile you know if we start from the
all three right so what could I add here

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:32.330
all three right so what could I add here
 

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.800
all three right so what could I add here
to the old trees to get to this zero

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:35.810
to the old trees to get to this zero
 

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.730
to the old trees to get to this zero
sand pile so is there such a thing as -

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:39.740
sand pile so is there such a thing as -
 

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.460
sand pile so is there such a thing as -
a sample something that I absolutely -

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.470
a sample something that I absolutely -
 

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.700
a sample something that I absolutely -
get to zero but let's see so if I add 3

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:45.710
get to zero but let's see so if I add 3
 

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:54.130
get to zero but let's see so if I add 3
3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 I get the serum sample

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:54.140
3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 I get the serum sample
 

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.320
3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 I get the serum sample
in this very specific set we created

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:56.330
in this very specific set we created
 

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.900
in this very specific set we created
this is a negative sample that's right

00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:58.910
this is a negative sample that's right
 

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.200
this is a negative sample that's right
this is minus D all three this is what I

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:02.210
this is minus D all three this is what I
 

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.290
this is minus D all three this is what I
add - took the old trees to get to the

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:05.300
add - took the old trees to get to the
 

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.630
add - took the old trees to get to the
zero but the river I had something else

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640
zero but the river I had something else
 

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.960
zero but the river I had something else
there so for example are you old - yes

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:10.970
there so for example are you old - yes
 

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.490
there so for example are you old - yes
that wouldn't have a negative effect

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:12.500
that wouldn't have a negative effect
 

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.410
that wouldn't have a negative effect
correct correct

I have 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 this is also
 

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.970
I have 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 this is also
the zero sample and actually these works

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:30.980
the zero sample and actually these works
 

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.140
the zero sample and actually these works
for any sample that comes from Max from

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.150
for any sample that comes from Max from
 

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.400
for any sample that comes from Max from
the old tree okay I can always find a -

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:39.410
the old tree okay I can always find a -
 

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.610
the old tree okay I can always find a -
sand pile so this 0 it's you know it's

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:42.620
sand pile so this 0 it's you know it's
 

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.450
sand pile so this 0 it's you know it's
it's very special I told you about you

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:46.460
it's very special I told you about you
 

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.830
it's very special I told you about you
know that at the beginning I was going

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840
know that at the beginning I was going
 

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.480
know that at the beginning I was going
to talk about fractals Ewell's

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:49.490
to talk about fractals Ewell's
 

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.280
to talk about fractals Ewell's
this doesn't look like a fractal I mean

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:51.290
this doesn't look like a fractal I mean
 

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.410
this doesn't look like a fractal I mean
it's very pretty but it doesn't look

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:53.420
it's very pretty but it doesn't look
 

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.450
it's very pretty but it doesn't look
like a fractal so let me now tell you

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:55.460
like a fractal so let me now tell you
 

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.990
like a fractal so let me now tell you
about fractals ok we can play the same

00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000
about fractals ok we can play the same
 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.650
about fractals ok we can play the same
game that we have played on a 3x3 grid

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:02.660
game that we have played on a 3x3 grid
 

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.200
game that we have played on a 3x3 grid
we can play it on any grid for example

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.210
we can play it on any grid for example
 

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.810
we can play it on any grid for example
on the 2x2 grid and if we play it on a

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:07.820
on the 2x2 grid and if we play it on a
 

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.360
on the 2x2 grid and if we play it on a
2x2 grid vit tall so there is also an

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:10.370
2x2 grid vit tall so there is also an
 

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.120
2x2 grid vit tall so there is also an
identity and the identity is very simple

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:13.130
identity and the identity is very simple
 

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.510
identity and the identity is very simple
is the all -

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520
is the all -
 

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.760
is the all -
is that the identities for what set the

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:18.770
is that the identities for what set the
 

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.700
is that the identities for what set the
Mac set yes we have a 2x2 grid and we

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:21.710
Mac set yes we have a 2x2 grid and we
 

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.760
Mac set yes we have a 2x2 grid and we
look at the Sun piles on the 2x2 grid

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:24.770
look at the Sun piles on the 2x2 grid
 

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.580
look at the Sun piles on the 2x2 grid
that come from max max in this case is

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:27.590
that come from max max in this case is
 

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.640
that come from max max in this case is
three three three three three

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:30.650
three three three three three
 

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.299
three three three three three
so this is the zero sand pile on a two

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:34.309
so this is the zero sand pile on a two
 

00:18:34.309 --> 00:18:36.340
so this is the zero sand pile on a two
by two green on a three by three grid

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:36.350
by two green on a three by three grid
 

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.370
by two green on a three by three grid
well it's you know the one we have

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:39.380
well it's you know the one we have
 

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.270
well it's you know the one we have
competed two one two one zero one two

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280
competed two one two one zero one two
 

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.169
competed two one two one zero one two
one two okay we could do this on a 3x3

00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:47.179
one two okay we could do this on a 3x3
 

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:50.529
one two okay we could do this on a 3x3
grid on a 4x4 or even on rectangular

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:50.539
grid on a 4x4 or even on rectangular
 

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:53.110
grid on a 4x4 or even on rectangular
grids like at you know five by ten or

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120
grids like at you know five by ten or
 

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.010
grids like at you know five by ten or
something like this so let me show you a

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:57.020
something like this so let me show you a
 

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.500
something like this so let me show you a
few more zeros okay

00:18:59.500 --> 00:18:59.510
few more zeros okay
 

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.990
few more zeros okay
so this is the 3x3 what about a four by

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000
so this is the 3x3 what about a four by
 

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.360
so this is the 3x3 what about a four by
four combo should look like 2 3 3 2 3 2

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:07.370
four combo should look like 2 3 3 2 3 2
 

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:16.270
four combo should look like 2 3 3 2 3 2
2 3 3 2 2 3 2 3 3 2 they we always have

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280
2 3 3 2 2 3 2 3 3 2 they we always have
 

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.640
2 3 3 2 2 3 2 3 3 2 they we always have
to have some symmetry because you know

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:18.650
to have some symmetry because you know
 

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.039
to have some symmetry because you know
we are you know the grid itself you know

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:21.049
we are you know the grid itself you know
 

00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:22.990
we are you know the grid itself you know
it's very symmetric so we can continue

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000
it's very symmetric so we can continue
 

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.270
it's very symmetric so we can continue
doing this we can let me show you

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280
doing this we can let me show you
 

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.210
doing this we can let me show you
maybe one more or a few more let me show

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:28.220
maybe one more or a few more let me show
 

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:36.490
maybe one more or a few more let me show
you the 5x5 ok so a 5x5 is a 2 3 2 3 2 3

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:36.500
you the 5x5 ok so a 5x5 is a 2 3 2 3 2 3
 

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:50.049
you the 5x5 ok so a 5x5 is a 2 3 2 3 2 3
2 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 so

00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:50.059
2 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 so
 

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:53.020
2 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 so
they have some structure okay that is so

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:53.030
they have some structure okay that is so
 

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.390
they have some structure okay that is so
they are symmetric and we can there is

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400
they are symmetric and we can there is
 

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.520
they are symmetric and we can there is
actually an algorithm to compute every

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:57.530
actually an algorithm to compute every
 

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.380
actually an algorithm to compute every
single one of these seals for any

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:01.390
single one of these seals for any
 

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.899
single one of these seals for any
rectangular grid so but this algorithm

00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:04.909
rectangular grid so but this algorithm
 

00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:08.230
rectangular grid so but this algorithm
is you know not an algorithm you know

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240
is you know not an algorithm you know
 

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.510
is you know not an algorithm you know
for small cases it produces them very

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520
for small cases it produces them very
 

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.669
for small cases it produces them very
fast but in very large creature it will

00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679
fast but in very large creature it will
 

00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:15.159
fast but in very large creature it will
take you know maybe a lifetime to

00:20:15.159 --> 00:20:15.169
take you know maybe a lifetime to
 

00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:18.310
take you know maybe a lifetime to
complete this but we can compute let's

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320
complete this but we can compute let's
 

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.289
complete this but we can compute let's
say for example a 400 by 400 ok so let

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:23.299
say for example a 400 by 400 ok so let
 

00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:26.230
say for example a 400 by 400 ok so let
me show you the picture so this is the 0

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240
me show you the picture so this is the 0
 

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.960
me show you the picture so this is the 0
sand pile on a 400 by

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:28.970
sand pile on a 400 by
 

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.680
sand pile on a 400 by
400 greets and it's full of colors so

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:32.690
400 greets and it's full of colors so
 

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.020
400 greets and it's full of colors so
let me explain to you the colors the

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.030
let me explain to you the colors the
 

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.110
let me explain to you the colors the
black means zero grains of sand the

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120
black means zero grains of sand the
 

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.140
black means zero grains of sand the
yellow means one grain of sand blue

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:41.150
yellow means one grain of sand blue
 

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.080
yellow means one grain of sand blue
means two and red means three and as you

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.090
means two and red means three and as you
 

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.630
means two and red means three and as you
can see in this picture there is yes a

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640
can see in this picture there is yes a
 

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.549
can see in this picture there is yes a
lot of symmetry but then there is also

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559
lot of symmetry but then there is also
 

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:52.090
lot of symmetry but then there is also
this fractal structure that they have

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:52.100
this fractal structure that they have
 

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.120
this fractal structure that they have
and in fact so this is something that is

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.130
and in fact so this is something that is
 

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.789
and in fact so this is something that is
very interesting to people you know to

00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799
very interesting to people you know to
 

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:01.270
very interesting to people you know to
try to describe exactly what type of

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280
try to describe exactly what type of
 

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.240
try to describe exactly what type of
fractal structure do we have so I had a

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:04.250
fractal structure do we have so I had a
 

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.940
fractal structure do we have so I had a
1 million by 1 million grid it would

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:06.950
1 million by 1 million grid it would
 

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.470
1 million by 1 million grid it would
find this somewhere within it

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480
find this somewhere within it
 

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.430
find this somewhere within it
correct correct yes and and you know so

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440
correct correct yes and and you know so
 

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.620
correct correct yes and and you know so
we know a few things about this this

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:14.630
we know a few things about this this
 

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.360
we know a few things about this this
type of fractals but not a lot

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:16.370
type of fractals but not a lot
 

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.390
type of fractals but not a lot
ok so roughly you know the you know so

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400
ok so roughly you know the you know so
 

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.070
ok so roughly you know the you know so
you may ask for example what is the

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080
you may ask for example what is the
 

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.760
you may ask for example what is the
density of these these pictures so how

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:24.770
density of these these pictures so how
 

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.130
density of these these pictures so how
many grains of sand you know in average

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.140
many grains of sand you know in average
 

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:30.460
many grains of sand you know in average
are on a cell and well you know it has

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:30.470
are on a cell and well you know it has
 

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.409
are on a cell and well you know it has
to be in less than 3 it turns out that

00:21:32.409 --> 00:21:32.419
to be in less than 3 it turns out that
 

00:21:32.419 --> 00:21:35.799
to be in less than 3 it turns out that
it has to be bigger than 2 okay and it's

00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:35.809
it has to be bigger than 2 okay and it's
 

00:21:35.809 --> 00:21:40.930
it has to be bigger than 2 okay and it's
more or less 2.1 okay it's close to the

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:40.940
more or less 2.1 okay it's close to the
 

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.960
more or less 2.1 okay it's close to the
point so it's really not to in fact you

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:43.970
point so it's really not to in fact you
 

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.020
point so it's really not to in fact you
know we can you know generalize this say

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:47.030
know we can you know generalize this say
 

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.970
know we can you know generalize this say
we I showed you how to do this with

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:48.980
we I showed you how to do this with
 

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.399
we I showed you how to do this with
grids but we can do this with other type

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:51.409
grids but we can do this with other type
 

00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:53.470
grids but we can do this with other type
of grades like hexagonal grids and

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480
of grades like hexagonal grids and
 

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.380
of grades like hexagonal grids and
triangular grids and get different

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:55.390
triangular grids and get different
 

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.630
triangular grids and get different
levels different sets we could even play

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640
levels different sets we could even play
 

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.169
levels different sets we could even play
this game with an infinite grid and very

00:22:02.169 --> 00:22:02.179
this game with an infinite grid and very
 

00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:04.090
this game with an infinite grid and very
interesting things happen when you play

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:04.100
interesting things happen when you play
 

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.070
interesting things happen when you play
on infinite grids would you like to see

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080
on infinite grids would you like to see
 

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.500
on infinite grids would you like to see
so what I'm going to show you is an

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:08.510
so what I'm going to show you is an
 

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:11.460
so what I'm going to show you is an
image created created by Wesley penguin

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:11.470
image created created by Wesley penguin
 

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.039
image created created by Wesley penguin
where you have an infinite grid and then

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:15.049
where you have an infinite grid and then
 

00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:17.620
where you have an infinite grid and then
you put lots and lots of sent to one

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:17.630
you put lots and lots of sent to one
 

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.710
you put lots and lots of sent to one
cell and then you topple and see what

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720
cell and then you topple and see what
 

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.810
cell and then you topple and see what
happens so in this case we're going to

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:22.820
happens so in this case we're going to
 

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.049
happens so in this case we're going to
put two to the theory number of grains

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:26.059
put two to the theory number of grains
 

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:28.570
put two to the theory number of grains
of sand in one cell and then we're going

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:28.580
of sand in one cell and then we're going
 

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.360
of sand in one cell and then we're going
to topple and see what happens

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:30.370
to topple and see what happens
 

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.899
to topple and see what happens
and the picture that we get is the this

00:22:34.899 --> 00:22:34.909
and the picture that we get is the this
 

00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:38.020
and the picture that we get is the this
type of picture it's also you know

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.030
type of picture it's also you know
 

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:41.049
type of picture it's also you know
fractal blue is 0-2 displayed on an

00:22:41.049 --> 00:22:41.059
fractal blue is 0-2 displayed on an
 

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:42.350
fractal blue is 0-2 displayed on an
infinite grid so

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360
infinite grid so
 

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.970
infinite grid so
so when you topple you're going to reach

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980
so when you topple you're going to reach
 

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.620
so when you topple you're going to reach
your there is going to be some perimeter

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:45.630
your there is going to be some perimeter
 

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.450
your there is going to be some perimeter
and then after that you're not going to

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460
and then after that you're not going to
 

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.720
and then after that you're not going to
have grains of sand so zero is blue then

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:50.730
have grains of sand so zero is blue then
 

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.360
have grains of sand so zero is blue then
a lighter blue is one yellow is two and

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:53.370
a lighter blue is one yellow is two and
 

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.880
a lighter blue is one yellow is two and
ready three it's very interesting that

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:55.890
ready three it's very interesting that
 

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.890
ready three it's very interesting that
you know the picture that you get looks

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:57.900
you know the picture that you get looks
 

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.560
you know the picture that you get looks
sort of like a circle so there's a bunch

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:00.570
sort of like a circle so there's a bunch
 

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.540
sort of like a circle so there's a bunch
doesn't just send grains of sand

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:02.550
doesn't just send grains of sand
 

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.030
doesn't just send grains of sand
everywhere but it sort of like preserves

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:05.040
everywhere but it sort of like preserves
 

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.460
everywhere but it sort of like preserves
the circular structure and we can even

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:07.470
the circular structure and we can even
 

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.070
the circular structure and we can even
zoom in this picture and see what

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080
zoom in this picture and see what
 

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.700
zoom in this picture and see what
happens

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:10.710
happens
 

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.690
happens
so we can zoom in and you see that there

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700
so we can zoom in and you see that there
 

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.510
so we can zoom in and you see that there
is this sort of fractal type structure

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520
is this sort of fractal type structure
 

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.460
is this sort of fractal type structure
and you know things that you know only

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:19.470
and you know things that you know only
 

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.100
and you know things that you know only
by looking very very close we see you

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:22.110
by looking very very close we see you
 

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.200
by looking very very close we see you
know that very intricate things are

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.210
know that very intricate things are
 

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.120
know that very intricate things are
happening right so we can play this with

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.130
happening right so we can play this with
 

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.180
happening right so we can play this with
different types of grips this is a you

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:29.190
different types of grips this is a you
 

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.990
different types of grips this is a you
know a triangular grid and this is again

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000
know a triangular grid and this is again
 

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.390
know a triangular grid and this is again
pulling lots and lots of grains of sand

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400
pulling lots and lots of grains of sand
 

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.990
pulling lots and lots of grains of sand
in one cell and then toppling and in

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000
in one cell and then toppling and in
 

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.500
in one cell and then toppling and in
here you know we have more neighbors per

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:42.510
here you know we have more neighbors per
 

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.890
here you know we have more neighbors per
cell so our max you know before we

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900
cell so our max you know before we
 

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.830
cell so our max you know before we
topple weak you can put larger piles of

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840
topple weak you can put larger piles of
 

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.840
topple weak you can put larger piles of
censoring here we can put all the way up

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:50.850
censoring here we can put all the way up
 

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.840
censoring here we can put all the way up
to five and that is stable so we have

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:53.850
to five and that is stable so we have
 

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.640
to five and that is stable so we have
more colors and then it produces this

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:55.650
more colors and then it produces this
 

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.680
more colors and then it produces this
type of also fracture looking picture

00:23:59.680 --> 00:23:59.690
type of also fracture looking picture
 

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.640
type of also fracture looking picture
point goes back to itself so we know

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:03.650
point goes back to itself so we know
 

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.320
point goes back to itself so we know
that this point is on the straight line

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:05.330
that this point is on the straight line
 

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.090
that this point is on the straight line
because it intersects the circle

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:07.100
because it intersects the circle
 

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.700
because it intersects the circle
