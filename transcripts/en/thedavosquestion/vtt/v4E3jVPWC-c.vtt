00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.850
&gt;&gt; The government of Canada has been one of
the primary supporters of

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.450
Haiti and the Haitian people during this earthquake
time.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.450
It's been a very difficult time.
We've -- have our troops there.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.970
We have two ships in Haiti from the Navy with
ships able to generate

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.939
clean water as well, which is very important.
Our Armed Forces also have clean water equipment

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.480
with them.
We have donations Canadians now, individual

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.790
Canadians that total more
than $80 million those are matching donations.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.870
We've agreed to match those and Canadians
have been very generous in

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.329
their donations to the people of Haiti.
Also with expedited the adoption of some Haitian

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.040
children who were in
the process of being adopted by Canadian parents.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.649
We've expedited that.
So the children have already arrived in Canada

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.320
to join their, their
adoptive parents.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.750
We are the second largest donor of aid to
Haiti.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.530
As Finance Minister, I was able to announce
last year that we were

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.560
forgiving our debt, the debts that are owed
by Haiti to Canada.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.149
We did that last year.
They were eliminated as of September 2009.

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.450
And we're encouraging other countries that
still have indebtedness with

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.240
Haiti to do the same thing, that is, to forgive
their debts to the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.639
Haitian people, who are going to have to undergo
a major time of

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:27.499
reconstruction, which is going to take years.
And we're going to helpful as a government

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:32.270
in Canada with Canadians in
support in helping the reconstruction in Haiti.
