00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.980
 Have you ever wondered how you deal with others? 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.240
 For example, in North America if you are a man 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.340
 Longer than 175.7 cm or taller than 161.8 cm 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.380
 You or you are above the general average 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.260
 If you weigh less than 88.3 kg as a man and 74.7 kg as a woman 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.440
 You or you are below average 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.160
 While humans worldwide weigh 62 kilos on average 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.280
 If you read less than 12 books per year 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.800
 You are below average 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.720
 However, it is likely that readers who are nerds have increased this number. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.680
 Reading 4 books a year is the most common. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.880
 And if you read more than 300 words per minute 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.120
 You are above average 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.940
 Write more than 40 words per minute 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.540
 You are also faster than the majority 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.675
 If you have a bachelor's degree or higher 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.080
 You are above average 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.340
 But if she does not finish high school 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.880
 You are a developed country 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.900
 You are much less than average with only about 10% of those who have not finished it 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.000
 If you are a man who can lift weights weighing more than 135 lbs, 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.220
 You are stronger than many 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.960
 If you are a woman you can go miles 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.600
 In less than 7 to 10 minutes 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.980
 You are faster than the others 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.880
 If that makes you sleep more than 6.8 hours 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.580
 That is more than the majority 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.060
 If you drink less than 3 cups of coffee a day 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.380
 You are below average 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.900
 Still thirsty? Most people drink 3 to 4 glasses of water a day 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.220
 Too much fluid makes you urinate a lot? 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.660
 If you urinate less than 6 times a day you are below average 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.240
 If you need more than once a day 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.765
 This is higher than average, based on studies&gt; 

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:22.140
 But that does not necessarily have to worry. 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 The natural person releases the gases about 14 times a day 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.860
 This is about 500 to 1500 mm 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.815
 do you have a family? 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.320
 If you end up having more than two children in your life, in most of Europe and North America, 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.540
 That is higher than the average rate 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
 But if you have less than 6 children in Niger 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.740
 You are below average 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.260
 If you watch the TV for more than 5 hours and 4 minutes a day 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.560
 This is more than the majority 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.040
 This is the same time that average people spend on their portable devices 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.780
 But if you are a teenager and spend less than 9 hours on networking sites daily 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.855
 You are actually lower than the average teens 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.980
 Ordinary people also touch their cell phones more than 2,000 times a day. 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.680
 Do you think you are smarter than the average person or lead better? 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.440
 Or you think you have better health or stronger memory or that you are a fuller friend than the average person 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.280
 It turns out that the vast majority of people also think that they are better than the average person 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.020
 It is a phenomenon called delusional supremacy 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.260
 Is a cognitive bias whereby people overstate their own qualities and abilities. 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.455
 A study showed 

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:19.555
 That 87% of university students 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.180
 Rated their academic performance above the average 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.660
 Interestingly, people with low intelligence tend to overstate their intelligence 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.200
 While those with an above-average IQ tend to underestimate their abilities. 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.060
 Men are more likely to exaggerate their IQ by 5 points 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.800
 While women reduce their abilities. 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.520
 Perhaps the most shocking is that in the cognitive test 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.180
 Even those with the lowest scores think they are above average 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.000
 Which shows a strong illusion 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.940
 Researchers believe this because these are the worst in the test 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.440
 They are also the worst in understanding the skills required to do well 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.120
 This article won the Nobel Prize in 2000 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.995
 According to Charles Bukowski: 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.320
 "The problem of this world is that fools are always confident of themselves most confidently, but the wise are filled with doubts"
