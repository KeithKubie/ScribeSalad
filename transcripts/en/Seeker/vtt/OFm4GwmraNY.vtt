00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:06.599
Our planet is surrounded by a hazardous shell
of space trash that is threatening any chance

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:10.350
at future exploration beyond Earth.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.560
NASA defines orbital debris as any man-made
object in Earth orbit which is no longer in use.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.100
This junk includes objects as small as screws
and paint flecks

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.820
to as large as spent rockets and satellites.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.380
There are so many abandoned objects that the
U.S. military issues over 20 warnings each

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.120
day for potential space collisions.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.730
So now, scientists are starting to deploy
sci-fi inspired spacecraft to clean up our

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.860
mess, but it’s not gonna be easy.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.719
Since humanity’s first satellite lifted
off, we’ve launched thousands of satellites

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.739
and spacecrafts, of which, only a fraction
are still active.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.539
Many of the retired satellites are wasting
away in low-Earth orbit, breaking apart into

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.749
millions of smaller pieces that make up the
artificial junk cocoon surrounding our planet.

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:04.710
This is a huge problem because these tiny
pieces of trash are traveling ten times as

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.480
fast as a bullet, and a collision between
a ten centimeter sphere of aluminum and a

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.400
spacecraft would have the same outcome as
the detonation of seven kilograms of TNT.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.900
And the potential for collisions is highly
likely.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.580
In 2013, Ecuador's first satellite collided
with a cloud of particles from an old Soviet rocket.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.020
And in 2018, the CryoSat-2 spacecraft was
on a crash course with a rogue object

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.640
so the European Space Agency had to shift the spacecraft out of its normal orbit.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.220
The International Space Station has also been
hit by debris and has the scars to prove it.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.840
To protect the ISS and future spacecraft,
European scientists developed RemoveDEBRIS

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.720
- a satellite built to combat space junk.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.160
And in mid-2018, the first of its kind cosmic
custodian was on the clock in space.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.080
RemoveDEBRIS is testing out several different
ways to dispose of space junk

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.900
launched from the satellite.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.260
One of which is the net - a spider web of
sorts made of super strong material

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.640
designed to capture junk.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.810
Six small motors act as weights to spread
the net to 5 meters across.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.020
The motors are then used to close the net
around the debris.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.890
After a successful capture, the weight of
the net drags the junk into Earth’s atmosphere,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.400
where it’ll burn up.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.760
RemoveDEBRIS will also test out a harpoon
to snare rogue objects.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.650
The harpoon projectile is about the size of a pen, and has a set of barbs near the tip,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.030
which will latch onto the target.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.360
These scientists aren’t the only ones taking
on the role of space clean up.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.721
Russian engineers are attempting to use a
process called laser ablation, in which a

00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:51.120
beam would irradiate an object like a lost
screw,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.540
removing layers until it is entirely vaporized.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.730
While we’re finally making progress on the
clean up, potential solutions like RemoveDEBRIS,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.440
are still just being tested so they aren’t
yet being used at their full potential.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.060
And even if the experiments prove to be successful,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.660
legal hurdles are preventing a start to the clean up.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.520
Until we perfect one of these concepts, scientists
are focusing on monitoring debris using technology

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.280
like NASA’s Space Debris Sensor, which helps
zone in on objects too small to detect from Earth.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.319
But just like pollution here at home, if we
don’t find a solution, the consequences

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.600
will be catastrophic and will certainly hinder
any plans of future spacecraft,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.500
and humans venturing beyond Earth.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.620
