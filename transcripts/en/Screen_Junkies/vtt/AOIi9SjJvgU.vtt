As long as they’re all white...

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.730
Seriously even when they die, they come back
whiter.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:03:15.949
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A film that took so much of Peter Jackson’s

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.260
life - he didn’t want it to end –

Making it really hard to hold in your pee.

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:35.120

A film with such fake emotional stakes - Gandalf

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.020
will sacrifice himself for his friends,
only to somehow come back to life, making

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.739
it not really a sacrifice...

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.309
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And a story where the protagonists can’t

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:50.589
win their own battles without convenient
Ghost Armies, Living Trees and Magic Eagles...

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:51.799
