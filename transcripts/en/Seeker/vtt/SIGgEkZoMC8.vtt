00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.340
Usually if something’s too good to be true,
it’s a sham.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.140
Like a fuel cell that pulls CO2 out of the
air sounds as likely as a unicorn.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.570
Well, get ready to believe in unicorns.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.670
Hi there, power hungry maniacs, Julian here
for DNews.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.930
We talk a lot about energy production here
at DNews, and with good reason; the comfortable

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.720
way we live in developed countries is impossible
without a huge amount of energy, but to make

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.480
it we often end up damaging the environment
and lower our quality of life.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.350
Two steps forward, one step back.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.071
Clean and renewable sources of energy are
gaining ground, but in the US natural gas

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.730
is still #2 behind dat king coal.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.640
According to the US Energy Information Association,
Coal produced 39% of our energy and Natural

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.600
gas made another 27% in 2013.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.480
Coal and Natural gas have the advantage of
being cheap, well established, and don’t

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.910
have the problem of intermittency.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.730
The drawback is their byproducts are harmful
to air quality and contribute to climate destabilization.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.770
So if they’re making harmful gasses, why
not just capture the gas and put it underground?

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.789
I know that sounds like a stupid question,
but it’s actually one potential fix.

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.310
Older methods of Carbon Capture and Storage
used steam from the plants to compress CO2.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.469
But that steam is what drives turbines to
make electricity so to keep up with demand

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.619
coal plants would have to burn 25-40% more
fuel.

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.990
Then the price of energy goes up and coal
gets used faster, making it infeasible.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.509
Now however, a company called FuelCell Energy
believes they have a solution.

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.969
Using a carbonate fuel cell, The CO2 in the
plant’s exhaust is converted into carbonate

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.349
ions, then they’re passed through an electrolyte
layer and converted back into CO2.

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:42.889
This generates electricity and concentrates
the CO2 from 13% to about 70%.

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.399
If it’s more concentrated, it’s more efficient
to condense it.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.289
The Carbon Dioxide can then be chilled to
a liquid from at -40 Degrees Celsius and stored

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.399
in geological formations underground.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.139
As a bonus, the process also cleans up about
60% of nitrous oxides that are a component

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:59.149
of smog.

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.009
Its a pretty incredible process that just
keeps getting better.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.389
It’s like having a mirror that makes you
more handsome when you look at it.

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:11.140
FuelCell energy has been testing the concept
on a small scale for the last 5 months, but

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.209
they’re getting ready to scale it up to
hundreds of megawatts.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.590
The process does use power from the fuel cell
to refrigerate the CO2, but it’s much more

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.900
manageable than the older methods, and the
fuel cell is still adding to the overall output

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900
of the plant.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.939
These fuel cells could also be used at oil
wells where it’s illegal to burn off the

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.450
natural gas byproduct but there’s no pipeline
to transport it.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.060
Energy could be generated on site, and the
CO2 could be pumped into the ground where

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.000
it forces the oil out of the pores of the
rocks and makes the well more efficient.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.270
Of course burning petroleum products would
release more CO2, so in that scenario it’s

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.540
not clear how much the technology would actually
be helping.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.080
But at least it shows a lot of promise for
keeping the cost of clean energy down while

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.950
more renewable sources are brought online.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.599
If this ends up cleaning up Coal and Natural
Gas plants, would renewable energy even be

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.599
worth it?

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.840
Trace has the answer to that right over here.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.950
So do you think it’s a stopgap or a permanent
solution?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.990
Let us know in the comments, and I’ll see
you next time on DNews
