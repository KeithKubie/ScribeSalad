00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.311
Nearly every one of your science classes

00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:20.126
starts off with the scientific method.

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:21.044
You recognize this?

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:21.764
Ask a question,

00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:22.962
form a hypothesis,

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:24.260
perform an experiment,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.559
collect data,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:26.951
draw conclusions,

00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:29.567
and then memorize a bunch of facts.

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:31.220
This is really boring!

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.137
Science is not a simple recipe in a cookbook,

00:00:35.137 --> 00:00:38.935
and learning is not memorizing facts for tests.

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:40.859
Yet, that is exactly what we do.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.364
We have to change this!

00:00:43.364 --> 00:00:50.034
We have to look at how curiosity can ultimately benefit society

00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:53.546
by looking towards tomorrow,

00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:56.745
by going through a path from involvement

00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:57.954
to imagination

00:00:57.954 --> 00:00:59.225
to invention

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.138
to innovation.

00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:05.213
And I'd like to illustrate this by telling you the real story

00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:09.622
about how we discovered how geckos stick.

00:01:09.622 --> 00:01:11.485
First you need to get involved.

00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:15.432
You need to do curiosity-driven research yourself.

00:01:15.432 --> 00:01:18.615
We know that learning by being an active researcher

00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:21.257
is the best way to learn.

00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:23.307
Imagine being in my lab

00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:25.510
and trying to discover how geckos stick.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.488
"Here is one of our subjects.

00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:28.634
This is a crested gecko.

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:30.148
We are going to put the gecko on glass

00:01:30.148 --> 00:01:31.523
and we're going to use a high speed camera

00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:35.053
that can capture up to 1,000 pictures in one second.

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.288
There he goes.

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:38.136
OK, record it.

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:40.863
There's the animal's toes."

00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:44.008
"So how do their feet stick and unstick so quickly?"

00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:46.778
How &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; they do this?

00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:49.521
We wonder, it's kind of crazy, right?

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:51.801
It's hard to believe.

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:56.944
Well it turns out, it was already known that the geckos have hairy toes,

00:01:56.944 --> 00:02:00.413
and those hairs are really small compared to your hair,

00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:03.873
and the little tips at the end are even smaller.

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.329
Well, my student Tanya,

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.956
who is not much older than some of you when she did this,

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:10.328
a sophomore undergraduate,

00:02:10.328 --> 00:02:12.418
tried to figure this out,

00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:15.332
and we told that her that in order to do this,

00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:19.367
you'd have to measure the force of a single hair.

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:20.685
Though we kind of only did this jokingly

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:22.269
because these hairs are so small,

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.389
we didn't think it was possible.

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.707
But Tanya didn't know that,

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:28.947
and she went on to build the simplest,

00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:32.299
most beautiful measurement device ever.

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.195
Here it is:

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:36.076
she took one of those tiny little hairs

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:38.557
and put it on to a probe,

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:41.296
and then she began pushing it into the metal beam.

00:02:41.296 --> 00:02:44.312
Now she was very frustrated for months - it didn't stick.

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:45.803
But she had figured out she had to orient it

00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:47.858
just like the gecko grabs on,

00:02:47.858 --> 00:02:49.195
and then it worked!

00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:53.362
And there's the little split ends grabbing the beam in that little window.

00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:55.350
And then she did something magical:

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.871
for the first time ever,

00:02:56.871 --> 00:03:00.488
she measured the force of a single gecko hair

00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:02.822
that allowed her to discover

00:03:02.822 --> 00:03:06.448
a completely new way to stick to something,

00:03:06.448 --> 00:03:10.137
something no human has ever known before.

00:03:11.707 --> 00:03:13.539
They have hairy little toes,

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:14.950
huge numbers of hairs,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.817
and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible,

00:03:17.817 --> 00:03:22.700
100 to 1,000 nano-tips that an animal has on one hair,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.356
and 2 billion total,

00:03:24.356 --> 00:03:26.928
and they don't stick by glue,

00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:28.450
or by suction,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.359
or by velcro.

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.835
It was discovered that they stick by inter-molecular forces alone,

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:35.162
by van der Waals forces,

00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:38.072
and you'll learn this in Chemistry and Physics, if you take it.

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:38.861
It's unbelievable!

00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:43.650
It's a whole new way of thinking about making an adhesive!

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.248
Well, this isn't the end of the story,

00:03:45.248 --> 00:03:46.743
there are still mysteries.

00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:49.999
Why are the gecko's feet looking like this?

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:54.076
They have bizarre toes and we don't know why.

00:03:54.076 --> 00:03:58.321
If you go into a museum and look at each gecko species,

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.993
you see they have all different hairs,

00:04:00.993 --> 00:04:02.969
different lengths, and thicknesses, and patterns.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.368
Why?

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:06.394
I don't know!

00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:09.269
But you should come to Berkeley and help me figure this out.

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.445
It's just about right, so, apply.

00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:13.656
But it's a mystery.

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:15.739
There is even more stuff that is unknown.

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.088
This tarantula also has hairs

00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:20.793
and can stick this way, too,

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:25.659
but recently it was found that they also can secrete silk from their feet,

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.960
not just their behind, like you know they do.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.180
And even more recently, my graduate student Ann showed

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.453
that all spiders can secrete glue,

00:04:36.453 --> 00:04:40.795
and we know nothing about this glue

00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:44.015
except it was around way before this guy,

00:04:44.015 --> 00:04:46.523
millions of years before.

00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:48.346
So don't stop at the discovery,

00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:52.281
next imagine the possible uses for society.

00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:57.046
Here is the first human supported by a gecko-inspired adhesive.

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:59.456
This is my former graduate student, Kellar Autumn,

00:04:59.456 --> 00:05:01.541
who is professor at Lewis and Clark,

00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:05.902
offering his second born child for the test.

00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:09.422
And she's a very good sport about it!

00:05:09.422 --> 00:05:11.731
Now imagine all the things you could make from this,

00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:14.134
not only adhesives, but products in sports,

00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:14.924
and biomedicine,

00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:15.452
technology,

00:05:15.452 --> 00:05:16.479
robotics,

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.062
toys,

00:05:17.062 --> 00:05:18.109
automotive,

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:18.747
fashion,

00:05:18.747 --> 00:05:19.860
clothes,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.931
and yes, even hair pieces.

00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:25.868
I swear to you, we got a call from Michael Jackson's hairdresser

00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:28.421
about hair pieces before he passed away.

00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:32.862
Who would have guessed from studying geckos?!?

00:05:32.862 --> 00:05:38.513
Next, invent a game-changing technology, device, or product.

00:05:38.513 --> 00:05:42.013
Like my engineering colleague at Berkeley, Ron Fearing, did

00:05:42.013 --> 00:05:46.382
when he made one of the first synthetic, self-cleaning dry adhesives

00:05:46.382 --> 00:05:50.975
after the simplest version that you see in animals.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:54.410
Believe it or not, right now, because of this work,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.166
you can make your own synthetic gecko nano-tape

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:01.617
by nano-molding with just a few parts,

00:06:01.617 --> 00:06:05.421
and here's the recipe that we can give you.

00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.135
It's been incredible since we made this discovery

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:09.418
of all the papers and the work

00:06:09.418 --> 00:06:11.302
and the different ways to make it,

00:06:11.302 --> 00:06:14.469
it's emerging into a billion dollar industry.

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.734
And who would have imagined that it started

00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:21.389
because we were curious about how geckos can run up walls.

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.448
Next you need to innovate,

00:06:23.448 --> 00:06:28.857
create a business that ultimately benefits society.

00:06:28.857 --> 00:06:31.576
Did you know that there are 6 million people per year that have chronic wounds,

00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:33.282
2 million develop an infection,

00:06:33.282 --> 00:06:37.339
and infections account for 100,000 hospital deaths?

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:39.763
Imagine if you could build a company that could produce

00:06:39.763 --> 00:06:42.653
a gecko-inspired band-aid

00:06:42.653 --> 00:06:46.629
that would remove the pain and suffering.

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:49.092
Just a simple invention.

00:06:49.092 --> 00:06:51.345
If you look at the last three great earthquakes,

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:55.174
over 700,000 people were trapped and lost their lives.

00:06:55.174 --> 00:06:58.449
Imagine the company that made a search-and-rescue robot

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.773
inspired from a gecko

00:07:00.773 --> 00:07:04.075
that could move anywhere

00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:08.540
and quickly find individuals that have been trapped,

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.644
that sometimes survive as long as two weeks.

00:07:14.644 --> 00:07:16.945
There is a gecko-inspired robot, StickyBot,

00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:19.871
from the Stanford group,

00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:22.176
that can grab on to any surface.

00:07:22.176 --> 00:07:27.451
Now we ran our own, for TED, Mini Bio-inspired Design Challenge

00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:30.246
to get you to think about these kinds of products.

00:07:30.246 --> 00:07:32.554
We have a winner.

00:07:32.554 --> 00:07:34.296
Here's the winner.

00:07:34.296 --> 00:07:37.878
The winner came up with this design called StickySeat.

00:07:37.878 --> 00:07:38.577
Really clever.

00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:40.671
It's a seat that is not only comfortable,

00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:43.379
but it aids a seat belt, if you were in an accident,

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:45.724
in terms of keeping your seat and moving.

00:07:45.724 --> 00:07:46.913
This is brilliant!

00:07:46.913 --> 00:07:47.929
We didn't think about this,

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:49.567
although we might think about patenting it now,

00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:51.928
but there is a winner for this,

00:07:51.928 --> 00:07:53.553
and the winner, and you can't,

00:07:53.553 --> 00:07:55.862
you can't make up something like this,

00:07:55.862 --> 00:07:58.542
the winner's name

00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:00.736
is Harry.

00:08:00.736 --> 00:08:01.886
Where's Harry?

00:08:01.886 --> 00:08:04.201
Harry, come here, we have a prize for you.

00:08:04.201 --> 00:08:06.203
Where's Harry?

00:08:06.203 --> 00:08:07.592
Harry!

00:08:07.592 --> 00:08:08.989
Come here!

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.202
We have a crested gecko for you

00:08:17.202 --> 00:08:19.819
that has very cool hairs on it.

00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:22.852
Congratulations for Harry!

00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:24.387
Excellent job!

00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:28.768
So don't worry, if you missed out on this, it's OK

00:08:28.768 --> 00:08:31.269
because we are doing another design challenge

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:33.354
working with the San Diego Zoo.

00:08:33.354 --> 00:08:36.516
They're developing a best ideas project in San Diego,

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.227
but it's going to go national.

00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:41.990
And I'll leave you with a fact that you should keep being curious

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.508
because curiosity-based research leads to the biggest benefits,

00:08:46.508 --> 00:08:48.484
as we showed you in our example,

00:08:48.484 --> 00:08:50.999
and you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; make a difference

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:51.604
&lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;

00:08:51.604 --> 00:08:53.639
because like Tanya,

00:08:55.424 --> 00:08:57.736
you don't know what can't be done.

00:08:57.736 --> 00:08:59.019
Thank you.
