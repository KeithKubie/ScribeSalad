00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.330
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.640
With sports engineering, we
can model a whole sport.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.680
And we can use it to push the
physical boundaries of the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.930
discipline.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.457
And if we introduce technology
into sport, is it cheating?

00:00:22.457 --> 00:01:02.300
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.050
Let's start with the
100-meter sprint.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.030
We've collected data on the
average performances of the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.490
top 25 athletes in the 100-meter
sprint every year

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.770
since the 1890s.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.720
You can immediately see some
pretty major spikes and steps,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.820
most obviously from the First
and Second World Wars, which

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.000
worsen performance
dramatically.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.750
The first post-war Olympics were
in 1948, so we usually

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.430
use that year as the
baseline for any

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.810
comparisons that we do.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.080
In the 1970s, there's a dramatic
increase in times,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.800
which was due to the
introduction of fully

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.210
automated timing.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.720
Removing the reaction time of
the judges setting their stop

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.250
watches going increased the time
recorded for all runners.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.270
There's another smaller step
change in 2008 when Usain Bolt

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.430
came on the scene with
his dramatic win

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.530
at the Beijing Olympics.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.210
What's interesting is that, if
we remove Bolt from our top 25

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.130
and just analyse the
other 24, the step

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.170
change is still there.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.920
At these elite levels, it looks
like a standout athlete

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.130
makes everyone else perform
better too.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.750
The men's 100-meter sprint
has improved by

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.800
around 5% since 1948.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.605
Over the same period, the men's
javelin has gone some 70

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:22.070
meters to 85 meters,
an increase of 21%.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.280
Are we really saying that the
performance improvements of

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.140
these two sports is
that different?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.190
Well, one issue we have is
that, with sprinting, our

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.810
measurement is time, while, for
javelin, it's distance.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.365
What we need is a
common metric.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.430
That shared measure is an
energy calculation.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.360
And as an example of how we
can visualise that, we can

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.800
look at the women's 100-meters
freestyle swimming event.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.770
Now this circle represents a
baseline performance in 1948.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.490
And by 2010, performance had
improved by 52% to here.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.720
Now what are the things that
contributed to that

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.680
performance improvement?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.090
Well here, we have the
globalisation effects.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.690
And by that, I mean population
increase, nutrition, coaching,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.390
professionalisation.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.830
But there are other effects that
have improved performance

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.300
in swimming as well.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.160
Here, we have the Olympic
games oscillation.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.900
And that occurs every four
years, so that, in an Olympic

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.670
year, you see a small but
measurable performance

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.430
improvement.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.590
What about technologies
that we've allowed?

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.450
Well, in swimming, we think
about the swimsuit.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.720
And in 2000, they went from the
traditional female style

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.680
and the Speedos to the longer,
full-body suits.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.460
More impressively, though,
goggles, hats, and shaving

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.070
down had quite a large effect
prior to those swim suits.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.220
An effect of goggles was to
allow the swimmer to train for

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.610
longer in chlorinated pools.
thereby, improving

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.870
performance.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.680
Of course, there are
technologies that have not

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.370
been allowed.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.280
There were the full-body
swimsuits in 2008 that had

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.000
polyurethane panels
down the sides.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.370
And by 2009, the whole body was
covered in polyurethane.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.930
And what that did was that
reduced the skin friction

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.085
across the body.

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:09.650
It pulled the body in and
reduced the cross sectional

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.720
area of the body presented
to the water.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.750
And that reduced hydrodynamic
drag.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.360
The other thing we've noticed in
swimming is the transition

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.959
between hand timing and fully
automated timing, something

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.170
we've seen in other sports.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.110
So with these statistics and
with this methodology, we can

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.920
look at the effect of different
factors on sport.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.340
And one thing we've noticed is
how globalisation has started

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.150
to reach its limits.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.560
The Industrial Revolution
has had its impact.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.050
Most of the improvements we're
seeing in sport today are

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.470
smaller in nature and
due to technology.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.370
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.850
We started our journey with the
birth of modern sport and

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.310
its development, hand-in-hand,
with technology.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.900
But performances are starting
to plateau.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.190
And even with the occasional
Usain Bolt mixing things up,

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.830
world records are going
to become rare

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.930
in some of our sports.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.190
Now athletes don't like that,
audiences don't like that, and

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.330
the ruling bodies
don't like that.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.640
Sports engineering will hold the
balance between the world

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.090
of the possible, that's Newton's
laws, and the world

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.710
of the allowed, that's
the rules of sport.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.970
Now the rules of sport are
completely arbitrary.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.370
They're steeped in tradition,
but they do change.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.730
There were 300 ancient
Olympic games

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.660
lasting over 1,200 years.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.250
And in that time, we went from
the sprint to chariot racing.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.680
So the science and engineering
we're learning with today's

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.220
sports will be used to develop
those sports that we'll see in

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.420
the 300th modern Olympic games
1,000 years from now.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:06:21.550
