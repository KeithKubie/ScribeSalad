00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If you keep on following data dependencies and control dependencies

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
starting from a given statement,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the set of statements that you get,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that is, the set of statements that could have possibly influenced the statement in question,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is also called a program slice, also called backward slice

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
starting from statement, contains all of the statements

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that the statement S in question would transitively depend upon.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You obtain a backward slice by starting with a statement S,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and then following all the dependencies until you have reached a fixed point.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The interesting thing about slices is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that anything that is not in the slice cannot have influenced the stage at the statement S

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
or whether S is being executed or not.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Therefore, the slice can act as a filter.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let me illustrate this by an example.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
As an example, let's take a look at the statement, "tag is true".

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is our statement S.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now, let's see what's all contained in the slice of tag.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
First of all, there is no direct data dependency because no variable is being read in here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
However, this is control dependent on this F condition.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This if condition, again, is dependent on the character C, so this is also part of the backward slice,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and this condition up here reads from the variable S, which is passed as a parameter up here,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
so this is also part of the backward slice.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now let's go to quote.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Where does quote come from?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It is being initialized up here and set down here,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so we end up in the place where quote is being set.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now, can you keep on doing this?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Completing the backward slice of S?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
One by one, check all statements that are part of the backward slice.
