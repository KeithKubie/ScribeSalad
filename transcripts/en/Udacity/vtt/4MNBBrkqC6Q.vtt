00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.360
Let's try the loop for just the first line first. It seems like the minute

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.708
isn't changing, only the hour is changing, so I'll declare a loop variable

00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:11.818
called hour that's going to go through all of the hours. It will start at one,

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:15.906
and will go as long as hour is less than or equal to twelve, and we won't skip

00:00:15.906 --> 00:00:20.456
any. Inside, I want to print the hour, followed by a colon, followed by the

00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:24.460
minute. And I don't want to print it on a line because all of the hours should

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.367
go on the same line. Hopefully, you notice I'm using a descriptive name for the

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:32.033
counter. And that's because in a moment we're going to have multiple loops and

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:36.747
it'll be confusing to see which loop counter is which. let's try this and see

00:00:36.747 --> 00:00:43.280
how far we got -if I fix the compiler errors. Okay, this is a good start. We

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.882
have the first line. Now, the loop for the second line would look like this.

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:52.224
The only difference is this number, the minute. So, I'm going to add a loop

00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:57.121
that counts up the minutes. The minutes will go from 0 to 59. And for each

00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:01.471
minute, I'll print out all of the possible hours with the current minute. Which

00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:05.761
I'll pass into print def so I can get rid of my comparison code down here. And

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:09.704
let's see how that worked. Well, it's kind of hard to tell, because it's all on

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:13.683
one line. What I really want is to have a line break after I finish the first

00:01:13.683 --> 00:01:18.073
line. So after I've printed out all of the hours, I want to print an empty line

00:01:18.073 --> 00:01:22.804
to advance down to the next line. And now my table prints out, but there are a

00:01:22.804 --> 00:01:28.880
couple of issues here. It only goes up to 58 and I said it should go up to 59.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.452
And it looks like some is missing up at the top. The stuff that was missing at

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:36.379
the bottom Is because of my loop condition. I should have gone to less than or

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:41.042
equals and the parts that I'm missing at the top are. Probably because bluej

00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:45.770
has limited the amount of output that it remembers in the terminal. I'm

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.310
going to try to going to options and unlimited buffering and then try this

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.685
again. Now it actually saves all of the data that I wanting to see. Alright, I

00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:57.068
think we're already for another practice question.
