00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.280
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Thank you all for coming. I'm glad
to be here with you, and I'll launch right

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.310
into this and to tell you that the reason
we began with this clip, aside from giving

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.590
you a sense of what the film was like, is
because it contains, or it contains three

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.519
different kinds of truths that are important.
The first is the truth about what happens

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.819
to, when people try to disseminate knowledge
and galvanize people to do something about

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.690
this problem, which is that there's a lot
of push back.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.329
That's what I received for it when it was
Executioners, that's what anyone receives

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.980
who wants to stand up and say, "The killing
must stop. We have to do something." Particularly

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.530
when you say what we have to do is something
forceful. There's enormous push back because

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.050
people don't want to do anything. Not everybody,
but many, including many powerful people.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.140
A second truth that you saw in this film is
in the person of Ellie Nicarambe, so it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.350
a small-scale truth. And it's the truth of
the perpetration on the ground of these kinds

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.260
of deeds or crimes, which is that at every
moment or a moment after moment, one person

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.770
decides to raise his hand, looking at a victim;
it can be a man, it can be a woman, it can

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.940
be a child, and he decides, or she, they're
usually men, but there are some women, decide

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.110
to strike the victim and to kill the person.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.000
Overwhelmingly, victims of genocide, of mass
murder, in our time, have been felled in a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.330
personalistic way with the killer facing the
victim, often bludgeoning the victim or cutting

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.390
the victim with, n-, with pre-20th century
weaponry. That's why we have to keep this

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.410
in mind. The small-scale truth about the reality
of what happens.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:07.920
And then, there's a large-scale truth that
you saw, which is the enormity of the problem.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.980
Genocide has taken more victims than conventional
military operations during our time. Indeed,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.250
many, many more -- it's not even close. This
fact should be known to every concerned citizen

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.730
of our country and indeed of all countries.
And it is a fact, which is unknown to virtually

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.170
every single citizen of our country and the
rest of the world.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.730
And when you hear this, it changes the way
you see the world. War, which is at the center

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.120
of international security concerns and policy-making
and at the center of the concerns of international

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.110
political institutions, should be side by
side with the prevention or stopping of genocide.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.040
Which, right now, is treated as a secondary
or tertiary phenomenon, certainly not central

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.650
to international security discussions or policy-making.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.541
So, this large-scale fact should change how
you understand the world and what is a, the

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:20.180
chief problem of lethal violence in the world
today -- it's mass murder. Now to talk about

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.630
this, as you have probably gleaned, my manner
is to be, to, just to be forceful. I don't

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:34.380
sugarcoat things. It's a very serious subject
I need hardly say, but I can't in this af-,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.959
in this afternoon tell you everything that
you need to know that needs to be reconceptualized

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.099
or explicated.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.790
If this were to be a full presentation, I
would go over how genocides begin -- why they

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.920
actually begin. Why they unfold in the ways
they do, why the perpetrators kill. What the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.400
perpetrators' communities are like.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.020
They're not atomized people. They live in
communities while they're killing and in larger

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:09.260
communities they are embedded, so what those
communities are like. How genocides end? A

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.120
critical topic, virtually unexplored. Why
different genocides issue in different outcomes.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.000
Sometimes, mainly men are killed, sometimes
men, women and children. The numbers vary

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.770
enormously. Lots of things vary. Why do they
vary? And ultimately what we can do about

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.270
it. Full treatment of genocide would deal
with all these subjects.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.139
I will touch on some of them, but not all
of them and if you have questions about the

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.509
others, I'll be happy to hear them or your
comments, for that matter. Now the truth,

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.990
and I will sit here and I will stand here
today and I will tell you what I think are

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.599
truths about genocide -- things that are undeniably
true. And that that often are, though they

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:01.490
are often contested or, or denied. It is not,
we must tell the truth about genocide.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.639
The most fundamental truth is it's not, it
is not something that is overwhelming, not

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.800
beyond our understanding or beyond our control.
This is how it's often portrayed in the media

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.139
and in conversation. These eruptions occur,
what can you do? These people just kill each

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.219
other, what can you do? It's inevitable. It
will be with us for all of, for all time.

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:26.840
It's endemic to the human condition and so
on. These are the things that you hear or

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.889
the subtext of what is said about it. It's
simply not true. None of that is true.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.550
[audience member clears throat]

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.409
It is as understandable as anything else.
It is within our control to do something about

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.689
it. We need political design, political will,
political ingenuity to do it. In fact, we

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.400
understand quite well why these things happen
and, I think, what we can do about them.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.630
We need to tell the truth about the extent
of the problem. It's not just the numbers

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.620
that I've told you. We have to recognize that
this is a systemic feature of the modern world.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.240
As bad as you think the Rwanda or the former
Yugoslavia or the Holocaust or Darfur or name

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.400
whatever genocide that you want. As bad as
you think that that is, these are typically

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.860
portrayed as a series of w-, unrelated one-off
events when, in fact, they are systemic features

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.900
of the internation-or-of the international
community or of the world order. Systematically

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.180
produced, we need to begin to see them that
way.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.580
And the reason it's important is if you see
it as a systemic problem, than you begin to

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.819
think about systemic solutions and not just
waiting till the next one happens and say,

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.729
"What can we do here? What should we do? What
ought we do?" And either do it or more likely

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.479
not.

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.069
And, as I said, it must become a central feature
because it's systemic to world. The extent

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:55.021
of the problem is so great of international
security policy making. We must tell the truth

00:06:55.021 --> 00:07:00.169
about the nature of the problem. The problem,
as bad as it is, is namely genocide, is not

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:07.039
even the real problem. It's not the most fundamental
problem. Genocide is but one manifestation

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:16.279
of, of more fundamental kind of politics,
which can be called eliminationism.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:20.119
Eliminationism takes many forms, and it is
what it sounds like. It's a politics in which

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:25.059
states and the people supporting them, it's
almost always states, decide to eliminate

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:31.819
a group of people. That's the politics. The
reasons it is done vary from case to case.

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:36.999
It's something we could talk about. I'm not
going to get into now.

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:42.029
When they decide to eliminate a group, they
then choose a variety of eliminations means,

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:49.619
or eliminations tools to employ. And they
include force transformation, so forcing people

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:56.740
to convert from their religion, for example,
force transformation, incarceration in camps,

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.650
the prevention of a group's reproduction,
which is often done through sexual violence

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:10.599
 -- rape. Expelling people and slaughtering
them, en mass, the largest such slaughters

00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:15.599
of what we typically call genocide.

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:19.629
Now, the reason to look at the problem of
the politics of eliminationism as a federal

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:24.169
problem and not genocide, itself, is not just
because that really is what's going on. States

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:27.719
decide to do this, their followers say, "Oh,
yes, we have to get rid of these people,"

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:33.630
and then they carry it out. But also because
in every case of what we call genocide, the

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:39.380
perpetrators have used some of these, if not
all, these other eliminationist means at the

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.331
same time. And when you see that, you see
that genocide really is but a policy tool.

00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:48.440
Or mass murder is a policy tool that goes
along with these other ones. So, we have to

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.870
start focusing on not just stopping the killing,
but on all forms of elimination politics and

00:08:53.870 --> 00:09:01.290
come up with an anti-eliminationist political
response.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.570
We need to tell the truth about the perpetrators.
They're not abstractions, they're not blindly

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:12.190
obedient as is often said to authority, they're
not just pressured to do what they do because

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.990
of the system, they're not bureaucrats as
they're often, as they have often been portrayed

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:22.800
 -- just doing what bureaucrats do, which
is supposedly a job well done.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.970
They are, as I told you earlier, they're individual
human beings working to get, working together,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.990
but each one deciding what to do to raise
his hand, making decisions about what's right

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.470
and wrong -- knowing, having views about what's
right or wrong, and wrong. One thing that's

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.100
not in the film, I don't if, how many of you
have seen the film or if you're going to,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:50.199
but one thing that is not in the film is in
Rwanda, we went to the war camp of the people

00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:55.769
you saw in the opening clip. And it was early
afternoon, they'd finished their day of work,

00:09:55.769 --> 00:10:00.000
they were having lunch and their lunch was
in a large shed. It was about 50 yards or

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.529
60 yards by 30 yards and there were benches,
so it's a rather big, a rather big place.

00:10:07.529 --> 00:10:09.420
And their bench is in a parabolic form.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:15.319
Actually, not very different from here. And,
and I went in there with the director of photography,

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:19.290
and I was standing not very different from
where I'm standing now at the point, at the

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.649
focal point of the parabola, and there were
no guards in this camp. It was a minimum-security

00:10:23.649 --> 00:10:29.769
c-, camp, I will get, I can tell you later
why, and I looked out on a scene, a surrealistic

00:10:29.769 --> 00:10:35.089
scene of the kind that I never imagined in
my life I would see. Which is, a thousand

00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:38.870
mass murderers, or a thousand people there,
mostly men, a few women.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.410
A thousand mass murderers and they were all
staring at us. They didn't look very happy.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:50.440
We've later found out they weren't very happy.
And I thought to myself, "Look at these people."

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.050
And that we have to humanize them. They're
not a mass of people; they're an individual

00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:03.040
mass murderer, a thousand times over, who
individually and collectively decided to work

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:10.480
in concert to slaughter their victims. We
need to humanize them. And part of that is

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:17.110
recognizing that, as other human beings have
done -- they can make decisions based on their

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.379
values to slaughter people.

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:23.759
[Daniel coughs]

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:32.009
Listen to Anne, a Tutsi survivor, captured,
hiding in the bush as Hutu used dogs to ferret

00:11:32.009 --> 00:11:41.390
every last Tutsi out. She, I'm, she say that,
"They slashed my right arm. Then while they

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:50.629
were," thank you. I've reached that age. "Then
while, she had to watch as a Hutu killed all

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:55.440
my children in front of me and they slashed
my right arm. Then," and these are her words,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.490
"while they were raping me, they were saying
that they wanted to kill all Tutsis."

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.681
This is what the perpetrators were saying.
They wanted to do it. So then in the future,

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:08.810
all that would be left would be drawings to
show that there were once a people called

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:14.430
Tutsi. And why do the Hutu want to obliterate
the Tutsis? So they wanted to, but why did

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:21.829
they want to do it? Ellie Nicarambe, whom
you've seen, explains that the killers did

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:27.379
not know that the Tutsi were human beings,
because if they had thought about that, they

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:30.189
wouldn't have killed them.

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:34.889
"Let me also include myself." He says this
about himself as well. "Let me also include

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:41.769
myself as someone who accepted it. I wouldn't
have accepted that the Tutsi are human beings."

00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:49.040
He's emphatic about this being the common
view and common knowledge among all Hutu.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.769
"As I was hearing it," he explains, "I had
the same perception as others at the time."

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:59.949
Adding, that is was such a fact of Hutu society,
that no Hutu, and these are his words, "Could

00:12:59.949 --> 00:13:06.420
swear and lie to you that he did not know
that." What's the effect of such views? So

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.060
they wanna do it, they wanna do it because
they have these views. What's the effect of

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:18.670
the views upon the killers? And Nicarmbe explains,
"It is a cloud that came into people's hearts

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.759
and covered them and everything became dark.
Because to see someone standing in front of

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:29.470
you without any energy, and you hold your
machete on, your machete high, or a club and

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:35.990
hit him, it is something difficult that was
done with a lot of anger and rage. I mean,

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.759
this genocide."

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:42.550
The perpetrators of genocide overwhelmingly
are willful killers believing what they're;

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.389
that what they're doing is right and necessary.
How they came to do it, or how they're gonna

00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:50.629
do it in different instances of genocide is
more complicated, and it varies from case

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:51.629
to case.

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:57.710
And what they actually believe varies quite
a lot, but this is the core of it. One of

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.740
the things I focus on in the film and in the
book as well is the cruelty of the perpetrators,

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.040
which is almost always left out of the analysis.
The cruelty is almost endemic, almost, not,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:12.040
not entirely to mass murder and genocide.
Why are the perpetrators so unnecessarily

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.670
cruel to their victims? Torturing them, beating
them, degrading them in ways that are not

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:22.040
necessary for the simple act of killing.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:28.310
The truth is that we need to em-, to humanize
not just the perpetrators, but also the victims.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:36.310
Now, this may surprise you because we all
empathize with the victims. When we think

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:43.699
about them, we can have some sense, some sense,
of the suffering and the horror that they

00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:44.699
endured.

00:14:44.699 --> 00:14:50.680
But we need to humanize them because we lose
their individuality in the numbers. A thousand

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:56.230
people are, the perpetrators kill a thousand
people here, 400 thousand there, millions

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:01.680
here; it's easy to lose the individuality
of each of the victims. I have sat across,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.910
stood across, walked with victims from genocides
arou--

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.120
[Daniel coughs and clears throat]

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.120
Excuse me.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.120
[Daniel coughs]

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.490
from genocides or mass eliminations around
the world. You hear their stories, you see

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:23.459
their suffering; these are the ones who ar-,
who survived. They are marked, indelibly,

00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:29.720
with horror and suffering for their whole
lives. We need to do it. And the reason we

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.290
need to do it is because it is focusing on
what they are going through, and imagining

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.160
what it would be like for any of us or our
family members to go through it, which will

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.100
motivate us and motivate our political leaders
if we can get them to start thinking this

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:50.899
way, to do something to stop it or prevent
it. So, we need to humanize the victims because

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:57.759
it's the right thing to do and because it's
the politically important thing to do.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:00.149
We need to tell the truth about what starts
genocides.

00:16:00.149 --> 00:16:03.230
[Daniel coughs]

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:08.970
It's not ethnic con-, it's not ethnic conflict.
It's not hatred spun out of control. It's

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:14.680
not all of the structural or transhistorical
factors that are often said to start genocides.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.689
All these things may go in to creating the
conditions under which they begin, but ultimately,

00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:28.850
almost every genocide has begun because one
person or small group of people have made

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:34.050
a decision to slaughter or otherwise eliminate
the victims.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.680
[Daniel coughs]

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.910
We can name these people. We often know when
the decision was taken.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.790
[Daniel clear throat]

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:53.709
Excuse me. All the things that are necessary
for genocides to occur, such as a willing

00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:57.709
population of perpetrators who will carry
out the orders and they have found them, but

00:16:57.709 --> 00:17:07.780
if this decision is not taken, if Hitler or
Pol Pot or Bagosora or Milosevic or al-Bashir,

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:18.830
decided not to initiate mass slaughter, eliminationism
or genocide, it would not happen. And they

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:23.180
could've always, in every instance, decided
to do otherwise.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.500
This is critically important to recognize
because when you shift the discussion away

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:32.890
from this abstraction, such as ethnic conflict
or transhistorical forces or globalization

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.340
or capitalism, or whatever you want to say,
and you start focusing on the human beings

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:43.220
who actually make the decisions, you can begin
to think very differently about policy responses.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:48.300
And how to make other leaders, the future
or would-be genocidal leaders make other decisions

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.300
in the future.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.960
[Daniel clears throat]

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:57.340
And this brings us back to the problem of
politics. It begins because political leaders

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:07.050
have political goals of social transformation,
of dominance, power, of creating a utopia

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:14.310
as they understand it, of gaining or maintaining
territory, or what have you.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:21.250
It's politics and we need to reinsert or recapture
genocide eliminationism into our understanding

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.760
of politics, which is has been sequestered
from. It's treated as something that sort

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.400
of out of this world. It's another form of
politics; a politics of eliminationism, which

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:38.250
is on a continuum with other kinds of repressive
and even normal politics. It's politics, which

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.240
we can meet with politics.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.520
We must tell the truth about what we do, which
is next to nothing.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.680
[Daniel clears throat]

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.990
Really, next to nothing. We stand by and watch
as people get slaughtered, expelled, raped,

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:57.450
otherwise brutalized. And we need to tell
the truth about why we do nothing because

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:03.410
of cynicism of our political leaders, which
are, who are governed by the hallowed creation

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:08.560
of national interest. That is, we only do
something that is within our nation's interests,

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.810
however that is defined. And our political
leaders will speak fine words about how they

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.190
care and about how they would like to stop
it, in fact, in the future, will stop such

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:23.700
things and prevent them, but they don't. And
they give all kinds of excuses for why they

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.190
don't do sometimes, don't take sometimes a
very simple and local cause actions that would

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:32.620
save the lives of enormous numbers of people.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.580
But it's not just our political leaders' cynicism
and the creative national interest; it's also

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:46.160
the international community. Which, contrary
to how it's typically pro-, portrayed, is

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:54.740
actually set up to do nothing. The international
community is located centrally in the body

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:03.340
of the United Nations, which has as its bedrock
principle, state sovereignty and the respect

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:13.300
and protection of state sovereignty. Which
means, well, which means that when leaders

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.881
start killing their people, it's almost guaranteed
that nothing will be done.

00:20:17.881 --> 00:20:28.210
Because if you're going to forcefully intervene
in another country where political, where

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:34.450
state, or the, is slaughtering its own people,
you need to abridge their sovereignty, according

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:39.530
to international law, because they haven't
attacked you, it is aggressive war. You are

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:45.900
actually committing a transgression internationally.
What the International Committee says to leaders

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:51.710
is, "If you cross someone's borders and start
killing people, we will come after you. You're

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:57.590
fair game; it's war. But as long as you slaughter
and expel, incarcerate, rape or do whatever

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:03.270
you do to people in your own country, we will
say you're a very bad person and maybe an

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:07.660
international court will one day call you
in to account, but really there's nothing

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:13.750
we're going to do." That's what the international
system says.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.970
We need to tell the truth about what is wrong,
and it's really very simple to characterize

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:26.390
what is wrong. The world, with its collective
strength, which is composed mainly of countries

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.690
and particularly, if you look at the economically
and politically powerful countries of the

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.680
world, those of the West, mainly composed
of countries that abhor mass slaughter and

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.380
eliminationism.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:43.860
And the world with its collective strength
led by the United States and Western powers

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:51.720
with their enormous strength, look upon these
weak and poor countries and the governments

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:59.250
that, and the leaders that rule them, slaughtering
their people, and they do nothing. And if

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:08.740
you were a naive person, you would say, "How
can this be? This doesn't make sense."

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:21.781
But this is the situation in the world. That's
what's wrong and we need to tell the truth

00:22:21.781 --> 00:22:28.330
about how it can be changed and about what
can be done. And the truth is -- everything.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.960
And when I say everything, I mean everything
or pretty close to everything.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.330
[Daniel coughs]

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:39.360
I think it would be pretty easy to stop most
of the mass killing in the world if we had

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:48.980
a little political wor-, will and were willing
to do to take a few basic steps to change

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:57.250
the international context for genocidal, or
would-be genocidal leaders. If I'm right that

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:03.130
it's politics, it's not just a volca-, a human
volcanic eruption, and if I'm right, then

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:08.270
one leader or a small group of people make
the decision, and that they do so when they

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.551
calculate the cost and benefits of what they're
doing.

00:23:11.551 --> 00:23:15.740
After all, these are political leaders who
know how to calculate costs and benefits.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:21.430
Even those who are besotted by ideologies,
who truly believe that go-that the people

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:26.050
they're targeting are vermin, no matter how
besotted they are by ideologies, these are

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:31.110
people who have risen to the pinnacle of power
in their countries, which people don't do

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:41.450
if they're not cool, calculating practitioners
of cost and advantage and of power.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:45.491
If it's politics and started by a small group
of people, one person who calculates cost

00:23:45.491 --> 00:23:53.070
and benefits, that means we can respond politically
by designing an international context and

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:58.530
a set of responses that would change their
cost/benefit calculus. And we'll get them

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:03.670
to see that the cost of initiating elimination
assaults against the people they would otherwise

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:09.040
target are too great, and so they'll say to
themselves, "You know, I have to find a different

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:19.230
way to deal with this problem." As they understand
the problem. So, how do we do this? I will

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.890
just be very brief.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:30.200
To have an international anti-eliminationist
system, you would need three components. An

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.600
intervention system, so when they begin, you
can do something to stop it. A justice or

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:40.030
punishment system, so that you can punish
the people afterward -- bring them to justice.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:47.420
And a prevention system to try to prevent
them from beginning in the first place. Now,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:52.100
to the extent that there is serious, that
there are measures being taken today, it's

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.530
in the world of justice.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:25:00.090
There's an international criminal court, but
it is too limited, too slow, too late to be

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:06.240
a one stop shopping response to the problem
of mass murder and eliminationism. There are

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.330
talk, there is talk about rapid deployment
forces at the UN and other forms of intervention

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:17.570
through the UN; there's talk of it. But where
we should really be placing our emphasis is

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:21.940
on prevention for the obvious reason that
we don't want these things to begin in the

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:29.000
first place. Keep in mind that in a day, the
perpetrators can kill ten thousand people.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.040
We don't want them to begin for another reason,
which is they're much harder to stop, or prevent

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:41.070
that is, they're much harder to stop before
they begin than to stop once they are underway.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:45.560
Because then you're, you have the problem
of having to intervene militarily, perhaps.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.160
And what do you do with the perpetrators?
How do you get them to stop when they've already

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:57.240
thrown their lot in with this kind of policy?
And so, and another reason we should focus

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:04.260
on prevention is prevention, a preventive
system can target every would-be, if it's

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:09.710
a system, every would-be perpetrator that
is a political leader so, which means you

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.760
don't have to know where they're about to
begin.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.740
You don't have to wait till they begin to
begin to do something. Just as laws in our

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:26.010
country and the police forces, which guarantee
them, I fe-, preemptively, prevent an enormous

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:31.121
amount of crime that would otherwise take
place. They fail, there still is crime. Because

00:26:31.121 --> 00:26:36.450
everyone knows that if you break the law,
the punishment can, or may, or in some cases,

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:41.100
almost certainly will ensue. You need an international
preventive system that would operate the same

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.700
way so we don't have to be able to figure
out where the next genocide is going to happen

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.540
and then bring measures to bear on the would
be perpetrators.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.450
[Daniel clears throat]

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:58.410
Unfortunately, to do this, you need to be
willing to use force, and you have to guarantee

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.980
that you're going to use it.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:07.520
And things you have to, and the, the thing
you have to make clear is that if a genocidal

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:13.340
leaders begin to slaughter their people, that
you, the United States, NATO, will use their

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:19.640
military forces as they did in Bosnia to degrade
the militaries of these, of the states that

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:26.310
undertake the perpetration of genocide. Target
military facilities, munitions, forces, stay

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:31.600
away from civilian infrastructure; no dictator
wants his military to be destroyed.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.870
The leaders of these militaries don't want
their capacities to be destroyed. In Bosnia,

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:42.420
when we finally began to bomb seriously, we
being NATO, in 1995, after the massacre in

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:48.520
Srebrenica, Milosevic came to the negotiation
table in three weeks, and it was over. If

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.230
we had bombed three years earlier when it
began, the slaughter would have never taken

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:58.570
place. I asked the President of Bosnia, in
Herzigo- Herzegovina, Izetbegovic, what would

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:02.730
have happened if we had bombed in 1992, he
said it would have changed everything. It

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:09.280
would've never happened. If you bomb, and
you make it clear you're going to do it again,

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.980
many would-be killers would think twice about
starting.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:23.150
If you're willing to target the killers, themselves,
that is, the leaders of the countries, you'll

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:31.700
have a doubly effective means of preventing
them from doing what they do. Any genocidal

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:39.530
leader and those serving in high-level positions
should know that if they b-, undertake a genocidal

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:45.230
campaign against a group of people that they
will have bounties placed on their heads of

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.410
sizable amount so that they know they can
never go to sleep sure that they will wake

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:57.870
up the next day. Now, the two questions about
such a pre-, such a thing: would it be effective,

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.541
and are we comfortable, or is it right to
do?

00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:02.660
[audience member coughs]

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:09.770
I asked the President of Bosnia, who knew
Milosevic very, very well, would Milosevic

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:14.840
ever have begun the genocide against the Bosnians
had there been a bounty system in place? And

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:23.180
he said to me, "I don't think he would have."
This is in the film. I asked Tharcisse Karugarama,

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:28.570
the Justice Minister of Rwanda, who has steeped
himself in the problem of genocide as much

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:37.140
as any other public figure of our time, processing
1.2 million people suspected of having participated

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:45.770
in the genocide; convicting about 900 thousand
of them. I asked him, "Would a bounty system

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:51.960
have prevented the Rwandan genocide?" And
he said, "Definitely, definitely, definitely,

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:57.360
definitely, many times definitely." And he
explained--

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.760
[Daniel clears throat]

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.870
"If people knew that at the end of the day
they'll be the losers, they never invest in

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:08.370
a losing enterprise because genocide, as you
correctly pointed out, is a political enterprise.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:14.630
It's a political game, but again, it's a power
play. It's wealth; it's everything. So if

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:20.210
people involved in it knew at the end of the
day they'd be the losers, they would not play

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.690
the game. That's for sure."

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:33.640
Now we need to tell the truth, and I'll get
back to the advisability of such a notion

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.370
in a moment, we need to tell the truth about
the impossibility or futility of putting into

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:43.930
genocide. If we had been here a hundred years
ago, and I had said at that time, that it

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:52.020
would be possible to put an end to imperialism,
to st-, to prevent war from being a principle

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:58.510
means by which many states in the world relate
to one another, and that human rights and

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.130
political rights would be respected in many,
many, many countries around the world, there'd

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:06.420
be such powerful public norm that even those
countries that don't respect them pay lip

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:13.260
service to them, you would've thought I was
mad.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.650
Imperialism, the most powerful countries in
the world were the imperialist powers. It

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:23.100
was endemic to humankind. The world was carved
up by the imperialists. Who could foresee

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:28.940
the, that imperialism, at a large scale, would
come to an end quite rapidly, and today is

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:35.940
not a problem in the world, except for in
very local areas. War was considered to be

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:43.390
a natural state of humankind, or states. Peace
was often conceived of as being but the interlude

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.530
between war.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.780
And again, many of the major powers of the
world were, who, were engaged and would be

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:55.480
engaged in major wars against one another.
The idea that it would cease to be a means

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.950
by which many states in the world relate to
each other would not have been believed at

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:05.570
the time. And human rights and political rights,
and people might have said, "Well, maybe in

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:12.240
England. Maybe in the United States, but not
in the rest of the world where they were in

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:18.560
embryonic form at best, in most places." And
yet they are. Eliminating eliminationism,

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:27.390
putting an end to it is much easier than putting
an end to these analogous, or related, international

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.610
and national violations.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:35.130
In part, because these other achievements
have already been made. And also, because

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:41.780
if my analysis is correct and it really is
a few people who make the decisions to slaughter

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.750
so many -- of course they need the others
to carry them out -- but without the initiation,

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:50.200
the perpetrator on the ground would never
ever start slaughtering people in their en-,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:57.630
all over the country. If that is correct,
what follows from it is that it only takes

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:02.700
a few other leaders, a few moral men and women,
the President of the United States, the leaders

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.370
of some European countries and elsewhere,
to make a decision to change the international

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:14.340
system and change the cost/benefit calculus
or the sy-, the cost/benefit incentives that

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.870
would-be genocidal leaders phase.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:26.890
It really could be done that easily. Now we
have to tell the truth about what's radical.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.750
And this gets back to the advisability of
the boundaries, but there are other things

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:35.040
to do as well. The critical think to keep
in mind is how do we change the cost/benefit

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:42.530
calculus? Lots of things are possible. I gave
you two very powerful ones.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:51.610
About the advisability, the truth is that
what I'm proposing, although maybe people,

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:58.280
or some people think of it as radical, is
not radical at all. What is radical, indeed,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:05.590
there is nothing more radical than the status
quo. The status quo is what's radical because

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:10.609
the status quo is people, leaders and those
who serve them start slaughtering people,

00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:16.860
men, women, children, brutalizing them, expelling
them, destroying their lives, raping women

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:23.280
systematically, and we stand by and let it
happen by the hundreds of thousands of millions.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:30.200
That is radical. Putting a bounty on the head
of a per-, someone who would do this, to prevent

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:38.530
him from doing it, that's not radical. That's
nothing. You should know that the US has a

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:45.860
bounty program. Our country has a bounty program.
It's been around for a few decades, overseen

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:51.210
by both democratic and republican presidents
and administrations. President Obama currently

00:34:51.210 --> 00:35:00.880
oversees it, and it's, but it's for terrorists.
It's for the capture of terrorists.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.510
[audience member coughs]

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:06.890
So we have a bounty program that says, "If
you slaughter a few Americans, we'll put huge

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:12.620
sums of money on your head, yet if you kill
people of another country by the hundreds

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:18.270
of thousands, we will do nothing." All we
need to do is extend a program that's already

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:26.460
in place, that's been operating and has been
quite effective. And we can start saving lives.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:33.610
So, finally we have to tell the truth about
our duty, and it concerns protecting innocent

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:46.370
people. Ask yourselves the following question,"
What if this were April 1994 today, and the

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:55.990
Rwanda genocide were about to begin? Today.
A genocide which took the lives of 800 thousand

00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:02.010
people and destroyed and many other and in
so many ways the lives of others who survived."

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:06.850
And you knew you had a choice. They're gonna
do it, unless you have a bounty program, or

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:15.010
unless you're willing to take military measures.
What would you choose? To put a bounty on

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:20.790
the heads, prospectively, of the Rwandan leaders
and save the lives of hundreds of thousands

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:27.780
of people, or to say, "No, we shouldn't do
that," and let the Rwandan genocide occur?

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:33.170
That is the question we really have to ask
ourselves, and in doing so, consult your hearts

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.900
and your minds and as-, think about what your
duty is, what the duty of the President of

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:43.010
the United States is. To save lives. Thank
you.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.010
[applause]

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:53.430
&gt;&gt;presenter: Thank you, Daniel, for that,
is this on? Great. Thank you for that fascinating

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:58.140
and frankly pretty chilling description of,
of where we're at with this. I wanna open

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.901
up the floor for questions, but I'll start
it off really quickly, myself. There's also

00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:04.000
a cost/benefit analysis that our political
leaders are making in our country, and the

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.650
international community is making its and
its operations about the cost and benefits

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:15.930
of intervening in this space. Can you talk
a little bit about how we can tilt the equation

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:16.930
in those cases as well?

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:20.400
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Look, our leaders, including President
Obama, who's been enormously disappointing,

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:27.920
he's done nothing in Sudan, and our political
leaders basically stand by time and time again.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.850
The only way to get them to move is to put
political pressure on them. And to make it

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:37.811
clear that the old excuses will not fly; that
we can't do anything, that's beyond our control,

00:37:37.811 --> 00:37:43.100
there's just those people over there doing
it. And that if our President, our Secretary

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:48.490
of State and others stands by and does nothing,
that they will be held morally culpable, that

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:54.020
there is a price, a moral price or price of
reputation for them to pay. Put pressure on

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.270
them.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:59.010
And this, so we need to change the discourse
from being, "Oh my God, look what's going

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.950
on in Sudan, isn't it horrible," to, "Why
are the people in Washington doing nothing?"

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:08.100
And what is their responsibility and what
kind of blood is on their hands? We can do

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:15.190
it with technology, we can do it with grass
roots organization, we can make a, get a different

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:16.560
conversation going.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:22.460
A different discourse about who is responsible
and what they must do and what the political

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:28.590
and human consequences are of their failures.
Similarly, we should put the leaders of other

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.350
countries, presidents, prime ministers, whatever
they call themselves, cabinet level leader,

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:37.090
leaders of military and police, they should
all be put on notice. We have technology;

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:42.560
it can help us do it. Of what will happen
to them if they start killing people in their

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.940
own country or otherwise eliminating them.
And what has happened in the cases that the

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.640
people have been prosecuted, those have been
prosecuted. Put 'em on notice, and they're

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.910
not on notice right now. They may have some
vague notions. They may think, "Well, it's

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:58.190
not my problem. I'm just following orders.
Or, or it's the political leaders making the

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.190
decision."

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:04.230
But they should all be told. We have the means
to do it now and no one's doing it. And so

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:09.700
we should think about how we, and you here,
have great capacity to do this, can get a

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:18.070
new international conversation and notification
system in place so that we don't just all

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:23.090
end up surprised again when the next one happens
and then it goes on and on and on.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.520
&gt;&gt;presenter: Other questions?

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.520
[pause]

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:32.460
&gt;&gt;male audience member 1: Hi. Thanks, it's
actually two questions. First question is

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:38.410
 -- how did you get interested in the subject?
If you have maybe in your history been touched

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:46.440
by this in some personal way. And the second
question is we sort of all agree r-, r-, Rwanda

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:51.630
was a genocide and right now, several others,
conflicts, there's no questions about it,

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:57.130
but I kinda wanna know what you're, how you
see the issue with the Palestinians, is that

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:03.730
a war or is it a eliminationist policy, as
you put it? And if it's a war, then is the

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:08.880
United Nations failing to prevent something?
It was chartered to do that alone, what you

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.490
said, it should be also doing which you present,
preventing genocides.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:17.320
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Ok. If we, to the first question,
if we had run the film for another minute,

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.120
you would've had your answer to the part of
the answer to the first question. My father's

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:28.490
a survivor of the Holocaust and he, he was,
he was and he's still around. He's a professor,

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:33.720
and this was his field of study, so I grew
up s-, with this material around my home and,

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.250
indeed, we lived in Germany when I was a child.
When I was ten, he was doing research the

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:43.560
subject and so I've been thinking about this
material, or this subject, for as long as

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:49.780
I can remember thinking about serious things.
So, that's how I first became interested.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.080
I mean, th-, that's the kind of biographical
reason, there are also the intellectual reasons

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:59.010
to many children of survivors of many genocides
who don't end up studying this professionally.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:04.030
I wrote about the Holocaust at, I wr-, as
Steve said at first because I didn't think,

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:06.110
I knew that perpetrators hadn't been studied.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.180
There was a gaping hole in our knowledge,
so you understand why the people actually,

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.530
who they are and why they do it, you can't
explain why it happens. And once I started

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:17.960
that, I then continued working in this area
and wrote the book, Worse than War, and did

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:23.321
the film because I thought that, if what I'm
telling you is true, and I certainly believe

00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:30.570
it is, that much of what has been said about
genocide has been partial or wrong. And that

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:37.181
if we rethink and re-, and if we rethink what
we-the, the problem, the nature of the problem,

00:41:37.181 --> 00:41:41.960
then we can actually do a great deal; not
just understand it better, but to save people's

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.260
lives. So, that's how, that's the, those are
the intellectual and moral reasons for doing

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.350
it.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:53.670
With regard to the Middle East conflict, or
the Palestine-Israeli conflict, whatever you,

00:41:53.670 --> 00:42:00.040
whatever term you wanna use, it's not genocide
and I don't think it's an elimination assault.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:07.990
I presume you meant by the Israelis upon the
Palestinians. And it, this is a hornets' nest

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:14.690
of a, of, of a conflict, and it's a hornets'
nest of a discussion often as well and I don't

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:20.420
really wanna enter in, enter into it full-
blown right now. There is a, there a terrible

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:29.220
conflict over land and security and, and,
and self-governance and many other things

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.630
in which two people are intermeshed.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:37.680
There are, they, the majority of Israelis
and Israeli leadership haven't, are not, have

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:45.180
no intention or desire to eliminate the Palestinian
people. And they're not undertaking eliminationist

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:49.800
policies as such, even if you could, you might
want to make an argument that on the margins,

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.060
say, "All right, and then we won't have to
talk about it." What should be said, is that

00:42:52.060 --> 00:43:00.070
in 1948, there were eliminationist, there,
there were eliminationist assaults on both

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:04.540
sides, but the Israelis did as well to clear
the land at that time of Palestinians so that

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:10.980
the Israel that emerged would be more governable
from their perspective. So, there is that

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.130
original sin, certainly, in the founding of
the state of Israel, and we should be clear

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:16.730
about that.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:25.330
&gt;&gt;male audience member 2: Hi, thanks. I mean,
I think we're all in agreement about being,

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:28.680
about finding ways to find problems, about
finding ways to stop genocide and, but one

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:39.970
question I have is you talk about having like,
a morally, a moral, it almost sounds like

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:49.120
a moral leader who's making these judgments,
and we see from just different, varying opinions

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:56.510
that one morality can't make a rule for everyone.
For example, a lot of what can be done for

00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:01.340
people we want to condemn on genocide can
also be put on our leadership's head. And

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:06.460
how do we then answer questions like that,
especially during Bush's regime when lots

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.940
of people were dying and the entire international
world was, was talking to us, sorry--

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:12.940
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Sure.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.810
&gt;&gt;male audience member 2: I lost my question,
but I, but, sorry.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:25.250
&gt;&gt;Daniel: That's ok. Look, there are two kinds
of answers to that. One is to, to say that,

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:33.020
this is, this is the human condition. We have
to, we have to talk it out, make your arguments,

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:37.220
make them persuasive, and if you have a more
persuasive argument than I do and convince

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:41.150
more people then I can, well then you're gonna
have more people with your point of view on

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:45.050
the thing yours or whoev-, whatever, whoever
the "you" are, or whatever the point of view

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.650
is than mine.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:52.060
We're in the situation where we have, where
people are dying, sometimes by American military

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.900
accor-, because of American military forces.
But what I've been talking about is dying

00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:01.470
because people are setting out to slaughter
populations. And we do our best to try to

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:06.400
make sense of it and to persuade people to
agree and for political leaders to enact policies

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:12.250
to do something about it. So, that's one thing.
It just, it, being silent is b-, not talking

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:16.350
about it and not trying to figure out how
best to do it is not the solution. It's a

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:24.840
totally losing proposition cause we'll be
where we are right now.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:37.650
The, so, the second thing is that whatever
we can agree upon, we can agree upon one thing,

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:44.950
which is slaughtering children should not
happen. Or we can take the very easy cases.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:49.901
Rwanda is a very easy case. That's why I put
it forward. We, you and I, may not agree,

00:45:49.901 --> 00:45:55.390
I'm, I'm not presuming any views on your part.
You and me may not agree about whether situation

00:45:55.390 --> 00:46:01.240
X would fall into the eliminationist category,
or whether we should do something about it.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.850
At, so let's not agree upon that.

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:07.730
But let's do what we can do on the cases that
we can agree about. If we stop one genocide

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:13.700
or one mass elimination, we've saved so many
lives, and we've saved so many lives from

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:14.700
being ruined.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.700
[audience member coughs]

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:20.119
And so, even if we can't agree on many others
and we fail on some, let's do it right one

00:46:20.119 --> 00:46:25.960
time. If s-, if you're, if the political authorities
in New York, the police authority, the police,

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.350
were to figure out a way to reduce the murder
rate in New York by half in a year, we would

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:34.360
be singing "Hallelujah! How did they do it?"
And it would be a tremendous thing. It would

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:39.990
save a few hundred lives; I don't know the
exact figures. And we would try to replicate

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:46.380
what they did in c-, city after city. If we
stop one genocide, it's a thousand times,

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:52.800
maybe more than a thousand times, more productive
in the life, in the saving of lives. So, all,

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.920
all this on the margins there'll be disagreements.
Is this real eliminationism? Is this genocidal?

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:02.020
Do we want to enact a policy in this case?
That's always the case. Let's do the easy

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:06.369
cases. Let's do it one time. And let's do
it right.

00:47:06.369 --> 00:47:11.270
And if we do it one time, it'll be a signal,
it'll be a signal and a lesson for the next

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:16.520
would be genocidal leader. That's why I think
it would be really easy if we prevent or stop

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:22.860
genocides, it will be produced, us, if we
make it serious that this is not just an isolated

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:30.510
event, it will produce a virtuous cycle in
which each will learn it will be, they'll

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:34.920
learn the lessons and they'll start looking
to solve their political problems in other

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.920
ways.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.030
&gt;&gt;presenter: Almost out of time. Any more,
one more question?

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:47.760
&gt;&gt;male audience member 3: Hi, thanks for speaking
today. I have a two-part question that I think

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.780
my answers are what you just said, and if
so, that's fine. One is -- how do we know?

00:47:52.780 --> 00:48:01.690
And the second one is -- how do we get agreement
to act? So, how do we know is, when a state

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:06.380
is controlling media, controlling access,
when do we know that we have good data, and

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:13.670
then the second is for, among especially among
nations, how do we get agreement to take that

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:22.600
action? Our recent case being the ship sunk
in South Korea. We, the US is basically doing

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.400
nothing and it looks like they will do nothing
cause there, we can't get agreement on that

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.560
 -- political agreement. How do we get around
those?

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:33.970
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Look, the, the UN is, for this matter,
a pretty hopeless organization. And I say

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:39.290
this not as a republican who hates the UN
or as one who wants to celebrate American

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:44.970
power; I say this as a liberal internationalist.
It's just a hopeless organization for this

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:45.970
kind of matter.

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:49.500
It does a lot of good in other ways; the World
Health Organization, and many other things

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.631
they do good, but it's an en-, it actually
enables elimination assaults more than it

00:48:53.631 --> 00:49:01.060
impedes them. And so we have to look to outside
the UN. On the question of knowing, we almost

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:02.060
always know at this point.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:08.440
There's so much information available and,
and, and YouTube itself, YouTube itself, is

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.270
now instrumental for getting information out,
from people loading stuff up from their phones

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:19.390
and, and, and other means. We know very quickly.
Refugee streams begin. We have satellite photography;

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:24.410
we have local reports now. We know almost
immediately. Knowledge is not a problem, by

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:31.359
and large. And as I said earlier, maybe there's
some cases where it is, but, but let's deal

00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:34.970
with those cases where we get information.
Now what happened, what, what should happen

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:38.940
is there should be an international watchdog
agency created through treaty.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:44.680
One country can set it up. We're, NATO can
set it up. Staffed by experts, impartial experts,

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:49.840
who will be charged with receiving information,
everybody follows information, and they have

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:56.292
the duty, if there's report of an eliminationist
assault, to render a quick finding in a matter

00:49:56.292 --> 00:50:01.870
of days about whether it's taking place. Or
whether the, there's probable cause, it's,

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:06.590
is, the suspicion is strong enough that it's
taking place. If they say so, the countries

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:12.430
that are, the country that is, that is suspected
of undertaking a genocidal or eliminationist

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:16.950
assault would have to then take a series of,
do a series of things, including letting international

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:23.350
observers -- if necessary military force -- open
the country up, stop everything they're doing

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:28.880
immediately. And if not, then a whole series
of sanctions and measures get triggered.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.400
Now, this has to be done outside the UN because
you'll never get agreement because of the

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:38.170
security council and its constitution and,
and there have been actions taken outside

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:44.490
of this, outside the UN, outside of, not under
UN auspices, and sometimes international wars

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:49.510
cry foul, but who, who can say that it wasn't
right to end the Bosnian genocide with NATO

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:55.690
bombing? NATO could just set this up. And
some people might say that this is not kosher

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:58.700
and so on, ok, let them say it. And they can
be on the side of saying, "Well, we'll do

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.760
nothing." And we can be on the side of saying
we're gonna save lives.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:08.850
So create a dedicated organization with expertise
and a set of, a set of triggers that will,

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:13.109
and, which will then unleash a series of clearly
articulated measures that'll be known ahead

00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:19.369
of time to everybody. And act upon it. We
can change the world -- at least in this one

00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:23.820
critical respect.
Thank you, everyone.

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.050
