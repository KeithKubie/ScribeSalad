00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.440
So far we've only talked about how to
use Gradle to build a project component

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.555
of a single deliverable output.

00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:07.768
But builds rarely stay so simple.

00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:10.660
A Gradle project can have
any number of sub projects,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.260
each of which also has
their own sub projects.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.190
Every multi project build
also has a root project.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.440
Even if that root project is
the container for its subprojects.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.390
You'll generally create a subproject
in order to move some reusable

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.020
functionality into a library.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.180
That way the library can be used
by other projects, and also so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.320
Gradle can determine
that the library and

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.378
the app that depends on it
should be built together.

00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:34.440
A Gradle multi-project build is
configured in a settings decorative file

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.100
in the root of your project.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.340
If you're creating an Android app,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.650
using Android Studio this file's
automatically generated for you.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.710
In fact, every Android project
created by Android Studio

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.910
is a Gradle multi project by default.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.840
Note, Android Studio refers to
sub projects as modules, but

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.010
we'll use the two terms interchangeably.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.000
let's check out an example.
