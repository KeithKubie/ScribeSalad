00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.110
So your goal for this quiz, is to finish

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.800
modifying the crawl_web procedure, so that instead of returning just

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.510
the index, it returns both an index and a graph.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.040
And the graph gives the link structure. The graph should

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.118
be a dictionary, where the entries in the graph are

00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:19.540
a URL, which is the target page, and a list.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.790
Which is the pages that link to that target. So

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.640
to test your graph making code, we've provided a sample

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.200
site at this URL. So if that's the link

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.110
that you pass in as the seed for the crawl_web.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.659
It's going to crawl in the site we set up.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.010
And there's an index page that looks like this, it's

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.720
got five links on it. And, those links go to different web pages. So the first

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.595
one goes to my favorite hummus recipe. So, there's a link from

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:50.710
index.html. And it goes to the page hummus.html. And if we

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.120
follow that link, we get to a page that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.330
has no links on it. This second link. Goes

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.136
to page arsenic.html. And that page includes a link

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:02.470
the Nickel Chef page. And the Nickel Chef page

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.210
includes a link to kathleen.html. And that page has

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.170
no links on it. And the third link on

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.860
the index page, also goes to the kathleen.html page.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.910
And there's two more links on the start page.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.000
The first one goes to the Nickel Chef page,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.430
which we've already seen. And the last link, goes

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.260
to the Zinc Chef. And from the Zinc Chef

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.620
page, we have two more links, we have one to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.950
the Nickel page. And we have one to the Arsenic

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.940
Chef's famous hummus recipe page. So this is a pretty

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.040
complicated link structure, although it's very simple compared to the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.870
things that we actually find on the web. But your goal

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.330
is to be able to produce this graph, by modifying

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.430
the code that we have for crawl_web. And then once

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.380
we have the page ranks, we'll be able to use

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.320
PageRank to find the best page. To find a hummus recipe.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.758
So for this site, the graph that your

00:01:58.758 --> 00:02:02.520
crawl_web should produce, should have entries that show these

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.170
connections, so there should be an entry where the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.180
URL is the urank/index.html, I'm leaving out the beginning

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.870
of the URL. And the entries should be a list of all the pages that, that links

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.965
to there. So they're going to be five pages. All

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:21.234
five of these should be in the list here.

00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:24.939
There should be the Hummus page, there should

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.150
be the Arsenic page, and the other three pages.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.810
The order that. Links appear in this list doesn't

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.535
matter, it's correct as long as you have all

00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:35.560
five of the links that you can reach from

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.210
the index.html page. The kathleen.html page, doesn't have any

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.930
outgoing links, so the entry for kathleen.html should be

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.430
an empty list. So see if you can figure

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.090
out how to change the code for crawl_web, to produce as its second

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.870
output, a graph that shows the structure of the web pages that we crawled.
