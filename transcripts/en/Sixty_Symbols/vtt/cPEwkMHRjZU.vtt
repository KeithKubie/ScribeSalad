00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
PROF. MERRIFIELD: Mach's Principle. As in Mach number, as in the speed of sound.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.890
Well, let's start off, back up a little bit.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.380
I want to talk about centripetal force and centrifugal force

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.520
'cause they're kind of sources of much confusion and amusement.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.360
People commonly talk about centrifugal force, and then you learn a little bit of physics,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.020
and then you get told actually there's no such thing as centrifugal force;

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.540
there's just a thing called centripetal force. And then, if you go a little bit further down the line,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.840
maybe you think, "Well, maybe there's both." So we should talk about them both actually.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.300
So, a bit of latin: &lt;i&gt; Fugo, fugare &lt;/i&gt; means "to flee".

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.480
So you're fleeing the center. Centrifugal force is fleeing the Center.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800
Centripetal Force: &lt;i&gt;Peto&lt;/i&gt; is "I seek", so it's actually seeking the center.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.060
So one is fleeing, the other seeking.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.860
And so one is going away from the center, the other is coming towards the center.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.500
Let's start with a simple thought experiment. What I want is a cylindrical room,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.749
with you standing in it, and let's put you on a pair of rollerskates, just to make life simple.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.060
And then I'm going to start the room rotating around its central axis.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.160
So what's gonna happen? Well, what's gonna to happen is that

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.040
as the room rotates you're gonna start moving around as well.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.627
But remember, unless the force is being applied to you,

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.500
your natural tendency is you'll carry on in a straight line.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.500
So if you're on rollerskates,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.240
then that's probably not much by way of friction, which means you'll just slide on the floor, so, as

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.040
the thing starts to rotate around, you start traveling as the thing rotates,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.260
but you'll travel along in a straight line,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.320
so you'll head off in this direction. You're going in a straight line.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.580
BRADY HARAN: Till I whack into the wall?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.340
MERRIFIELD: And then you're gonna hit the wall, and that's the interesting thing that, actually, at the point

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.505
where you hit the wall, suddenly you're kind of pressed against the wall as the thing rotates,

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:26.560
and as it rotates faster and faster you'll be pressed to the wall harder and harder.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.240
And that's why people think about centrifugal forces, because actually they're being pressed to the wall,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.849
so, from your perception,  in this rotating room,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.640
there is a centrifugal force where you're being pushed outwards

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.360
and you're being pressed against the wall and

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.980
clearly, there's a centrifugal force.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.620
Whereas somebody who's just watching the room from above, as we are here,

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.749
will say "Actually, no, there isn't a centrifugal force at all. What's going on

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.180
"is that you wanted to travel in a straight line, but then this wall stopped you,"

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.160
"and that's actually a centripetal force."

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.080
"The wall is pushing you towards the middle all the time."

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.880
"And so, actually the force there is, you know, is pushing you inwards, there's a centripetal force,"

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.180
"which is keeping you going around in a circle as you're pressed against the wall."

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.560
HARAN: Sounds like centripetal was right, then?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.800
MERRIFIELD: It is, kind of. Because that's the kind of the bigger picture view

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.960
when you're outside the rotating reference frame.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.560
Whereas, you know, if you're in the rotating reference frame then centrifugal force is what's going on,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.240
but, in some sense, what's more fundamental is the rest of the universe,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.780
that's actually looking down on this thing seeing it rotate.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.470
HARAN: We do learn that for every force, there's like an equal and opposite, though,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.290
so doesn't it make sense that both are happening at the same time at that point?

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.840
MERRIFIELD: Indeed. By the time you're pressed to the wall,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.100
you're neither being accelerated away from the wall or towards it,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.260
so there's kind of a balance of forces there.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.140
You can think of the centrifugal force is pushing you out, while the centripetal force is pushing you in,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.480
well, it all comes to the same thing.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.000
As you said, in some sense, that centripetal force is kind of more fundamental.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.620
In the centrifugal case, you're kind of being fooled: you think you're in a non-rotating room, right?

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.410
And actually you're suddenly flung to the wall, and that's why you

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.500
interpret it as a centrifugal force, and therefore you're being fooled

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.620
because, although the things in the room around you don't appear to be rotating,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.740
because they're all rotating at the same speed you are,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.340
somebody looking down on this from above could say, "Actually, you know,"

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.040
"the whole thing is rotating and therefore the centripetal force is fundamentally what's going on."

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.020
But that's where we get to Mach's Principle.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.800
Because the question you could ask is "How do you know you're rotating?"

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.560
How do you know it's just not the rest of the universe rotating the other way?

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.360
All the time when we were doing Relativity things we would always say,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.200
"you can't tell whether it's you moving forwards and something else stationary,"

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.320
"or you stationary and something else moving backwards;"

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.600
"there was this kind of relativity there." So the obvious question is why isn't there a relativity here?

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.300
Why isn't it equivalent to saying either

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.510
the room's rotating and the rest of the universe is stationary, or

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.000
the room stationary and the rest of the universe is rotating the other way?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.020
Because they both look the same to an outside observer.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.660
You know, they're both, one thing's rotating relative to the other.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.680
HARAN: I can answer that!

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.440
MERRIFIELD: Okay...

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.220
HARAN: If you created that scenario for me there,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.700
the person on the rollerskates wouldn't move.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.220
With the rest of the... but how does the universe know, right? You're right! You're absolutely right!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.660
But it means in some sense rotation is absolute, right?

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.460
That actually you can tell the difference between whether the room is rotating and the rest of the universe is stationary,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.220
or whether the room is stationary and the rest of the universe is rotating

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.240
by the fact whether or not on your rollerskates you get pushed to the outside.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.700
And that's what Mach's principle says, is that,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.400
"actually, the physics of the small scale depends on the large scale."

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.240
That actually the entire universe is somehow influencing this room.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.140
So that you actually know that it's the room that's rotating

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.920
and the rest of the universe is stationary, rather than

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.860
the rest of the Universe that's rotating and the room's stationary.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.500
Somehow the two are talking to each other.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.990
HARAN: They're talking to each other and one's saying,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.080
"I'm the big guy here and you're the little guy, so you're the thing spinning, not me."

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.060
MERRIFIELD: Exactly. Although, you know, in principle, you could make the entire universe rotate if you want to do.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.980
It'd be a lot of effort, but actually, you know, you could do it.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.000
But somehow they know which is the thing that's really rotating which is the thing that isn't.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.681
And that means somehow the physics of the large scale is affecting what's going on on the small scale.

00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:48.820
The reason why you know you're rotating

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.300
is only by reference to the entire universe around you.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.520
And another statement of Mach's principle, which is kind of the same thing,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.960
is that if you actually made the entire universe rotate, including this room...

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.180
you wouldn't be able to tell.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.040
Because then there's nothing for it to be rotating relative to.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.120
HARAN: Coming back to just the room in the universe, the simple version,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.620
MERRIFIELD: Yep.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.220
HARAN: Has has anyone got any idea how this...

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.620
through what medium this information is communicated between the room and the Universe?

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.680
MERRIFIELD: Not in detail.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.000
I mean, that's why this is a principle rather than a law,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.940
is that actually it's just something which we know has to be happening

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.720
because we can tell when we're in a rotating room or when we're not,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.060
but what the mechanism is, is not entirely clear, at least in detail.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.260
This very much influenced Einstein when he was moving on from Special Relativity to General Relativity,

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.000
'cause clearly he was kind of thinking about reference frames,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.960
'cause he'd done all that with Special Relativity.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.760
Then you come to this General Relativity case

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.200
where he knew perfectly well, that actually if you're in a rotating room

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.740
you know you were in a rotating room because you get flung to the walls.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.540
And that was what made him think that actually whatever is going on in General Relativity

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.580
has to somehow have Mach's Principle imprinted in it.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.000
And, indeed, the laws of General Relativity say that what kind of effects the motion on the small scale

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.620
depends on the distribution of mass all over the Universe.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.960
Because actually the curvature of space, the way that space is distorted on small scales,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.560
depends on the distribution of mass throughout the Universe.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.640
So actually in some sense sort of has Mach's Principle built into it

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.500
because the what's going on on a very small scale in terms of

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.800
particles being accelerated around by gravity,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.620
depends on how space has been distorted, which in turn depends on

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.040
the distribution of mass throughout the Universe.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.840
So I think he was very much inspired by Mach's Principle to think about

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.000
the things which then led to General Relativity.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.300
HARAN: I find it deeply disturbing that the Universe is talking to itself like this, and we have no idea how!

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.380
[Cheesy Ringtone Plays]

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.280
MERRIFIELD: It is! Somehow that information on the big picture of the Universe

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.880
is somehow being communicated to the small scale.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.900
So Einstein got very excited. He was able to show, within General Relativity

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.640
that there is this strange effect. That if you have, like, a pendulum

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.460
just swinging here, and you put a sphere around it, and make the sphere rotate,

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.240
that actually makes the pendulum start to process around.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.980
And so, because actually, effectively the rotating mass is kind of dragging space with it

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.540
and that affects what's going on.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.560
So he was quite excited that actually he could show mathematically that actually

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.420
f the universe really is rotating around an object it actually does have an influence on the object.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.140
So again there is this tie between what's going on on a large scale and what's going on on the small scale.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.660
But beyond those kind of very specific cases, I don't think anyone's

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.440
tackling the big picture question of why Mach's Principle is true in general.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.740
