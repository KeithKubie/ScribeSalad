00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.280
 
so right behind me you can see is the

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290
so right behind me you can see is the
 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.960
so right behind me you can see is the
Icefall about a hundred yards right out

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970
Icefall about a hundred yards right out
 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.730
Icefall about a hundred yards right out
of base camp and it's probably one of

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740
of base camp and it's probably one of
 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.320
of base camp and it's probably one of
the trickiest parts of the whole climb

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
the trickiest parts of the whole climb
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.749
the trickiest parts of the whole climb
and you want to be efficient and quick

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759
and you want to be efficient and quick
 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.419
and you want to be efficient and quick
through there for safety's sake so we

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
through there for safety's sake so we
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.279
through there for safety's sake so we
set up a little ladder training course

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289
set up a little ladder training course
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.590
set up a little ladder training course
there's going to be 25 ladders sections

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
there's going to be 25 ladders sections
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.960
there's going to be 25 ladders sections
that we need to negotiate day in and day

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
that we need to negotiate day in and day
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060
that we need to negotiate day in and day
out through the Icefall probably a half

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
out through the Icefall probably a half
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.490
out through the Icefall probably a half
a dozen times so we need to be dialed

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
a dozen times so we need to be dialed
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.750
a dozen times so we need to be dialed
and so that's all we're going to do this

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
and so that's all we're going to do this
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.490
and so that's all we're going to do this
little training course right out our

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500
little training course right out our
 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.529
little training course right out our
door here our first day with the spikes

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
door here our first day with the spikes
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.750
door here our first day with the spikes
on first day rigged up and we're looking

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
on first day rigged up and we're looking
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910
on first day rigged up and we're looking
over at the Icefall up there we got that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
over at the Icefall up there we got that
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.970
over at the Icefall up there we got that
big thing hanging over us and we just

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
big thing hanging over us and we just
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889
big thing hanging over us and we just
take it one little step at a time and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899
take it one little step at a time and
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.229
take it one little step at a time and
the first step is getting comfortable

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
the first step is getting comfortable
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479
the first step is getting comfortable
with this rigging getting comfortable

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
with this rigging getting comfortable
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.380
with this rigging getting comfortable
with these ladders and our systems this

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
with these ladders and our systems this
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.270
with these ladders and our systems this
one I thought of going across the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
one I thought of going across the
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.939
one I thought of going across the
ladders with crampons on really scary

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
ladders with crampons on really scary
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580
ladders with crampons on really scary
but they broke it down explained it it's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
but they broke it down explained it it's
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799
but they broke it down explained it it's
all pretty awkward these crampons on

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
all pretty awkward these crampons on
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779
all pretty awkward these crampons on
metal ladders and the ladders are a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
metal ladders and the ladders are a
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.810
metal ladders and the ladders are a
little shaky into a day like this just

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
little shaky into a day like this just
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.320
little shaky into a day like this just
practicing is gonna help us that first

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
practicing is gonna help us that first
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.510
practicing is gonna help us that first
time we go we actually go through the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
time we go we actually go through the
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.810
time we go we actually go through the
Icefall we want to cruise it we don't

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
Icefall we want to cruise it we don't
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.980
Icefall we want to cruise it we don't
want to be clumsy around figuring out

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
want to be clumsy around figuring out
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.359
want to be clumsy around figuring out
these systems that we could have done

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
these systems that we could have done
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999
these systems that we could have done
with less hazard down here and so that's

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
with less hazard down here and so that's
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.580
with less hazard down here and so that's
what today is about
