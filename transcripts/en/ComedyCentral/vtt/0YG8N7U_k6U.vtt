(cop show music)

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.708
- [Radio] Car 67,
come in car 67.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.777
- This is car 67,
- This is car 67,

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.145 align:start size:81% position:19%

- code five,

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:16.116 align:start size:97% position:3%
- nothing to report.
- we've got nothing to report.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.519
- You are such an idiot
man, I mean Van Hagar

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.422 align:start size:97% position:3%
had just as many hits as the
original Van Halen, okay.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.025 align:start size:88% position:13%
5150, Best of Both
Worlds, When It's Love,

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.961
Dreams, Summer Nights,
Finish What Ya Started,

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.596
Black and Blue, Right Now--

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.197 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Radio] Right Now, really,
you're gonna come at me

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.499
with Right Now, please.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:33.767 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What are you talking
about, Right Now

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.068
was the theme of an
entire generation.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.437
- [Radio] It was a Pepsi
jingle, you mental case.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.172 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Have you not
listened to the poetry,

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:41.374 align:start size:84% position:16%
the genius, of Sammy
Hagar's lyrics,

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.143 align:start size:84% position:16%
talking about
living for the day,

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:46.312 align:start size:88% position:13%
taking advantage of what
you have, right now,

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.314 align:start size:84% position:16%
don't wait 'til
tomorrow with Theresa?

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.916
- [Radio] Theresa, did
you just say Theresa?

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:52.218
- No, I didn't.
- Holy shit,

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.353
you just put your ex wife

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.321 align:start size:84% position:16%
into a Van Hagar song.
- I did not.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.823 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Radio] Oh my god.
- I did not.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.658 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Radio] What fucking
asshole does that?

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:02.262 align:start size:88% position:13%
- No I didn't, no don't
tell the guys over.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.130
Tell the guys to mind
their own business.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.598
You mind your own business Hawk,

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.468 align:start size:84% position:16%
you leave Sammy
Hagar, you stop it!

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.537
You stop it right now,
(laughing over radio)

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:11.504
stop it, you stop it.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.540
Die in a car fire, you jackass!

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.542
Stop, dack, dah!

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.080 align:start size:81% position:19%
- So, something
bugging you, or...

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.314
- Yeah, something's bugging me,

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:23.116 align:start size:88% position:13%
you don't talk shit
about Right Now, on my--

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:26.386
- I'm gonna fuck
this car, ha ha.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.288 align:start size:81% position:19%
Hey, hey.
- It's Captain Ed.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:29.689
Captain Ed U Cation.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.558
- Watch me fuck this car,

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:36.496
it's as easy as one, two, three,

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.499
oh yeah, that's it, that's it.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.734 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Why is Sergeant
Pepper humping our car?

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.670
- Come on, there's no way
you don't know who that is.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.171 align:start size:84% position:16%
He's got this great
show for kids,

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.373 align:start size:84% position:16%
that makes learning
fun, and hip.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.776
He's great, Captain Ed!

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.945 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Captain Ed]
Drink my piss, car.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.446
- Ha, classic Captain Ed.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.248
- This is our car, asshole!

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:57.317
I don't care how many
kids he's educated,

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:59.252
I'm taking this guy in.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.055 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Come on, he's
just goofing around.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.857 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Typical Hollywood
bullshit, he thinks just

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.326 align:start size:97% position:3%
because he's a celebrity,
he can do whatever he wants,

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.461 align:start size:97% position:3%
he can fuck my wife and
I'm just gonna stand around

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.363
and take it, get over here.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:12.132
- Excuse me sir, big fan.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.900
Could I trouble you
for some ID please?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.301
- Why do you need
to see some ID huh,

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.637
you obviously know
who he is, fanboy.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.306 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well I doubt his real
name is Captain Ed U Cation,

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.510
oh, wow, it's really
Captain Ed U Cation.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.578
- I got it legally changed.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.680
- Can you even change your
name to Captain legally?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.283
- No, I actually am a captain.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:33.153 align:start size:84% position:16%
You two wanna get
married, I can do it,

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.522
but all we gotta do
is find an ocean.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.925
You and I should have
an underwear party.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.427
- Why did you do that?

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.662
- He rushed me!

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:45.131 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's just his way,
he's a goofy guy.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:47.800 align:start size:97% position:3%
And he uses that goofiness,
to fight illiteracy.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.069
So just give him a break,
he's just having a bad day.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.238
- I'm having the best day.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.408
(puking)

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:56.910
- Seriously?

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.278 align:start size:97% position:3%
Typical Hollywood celebrity,
does whatever he wants,

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.780 align:start size:88% position:13%
puke on my shoe, no
problem, make a mistake,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.248
it's okay, live your life

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.851 align:start size:94% position:6%
with no responsibilities,
right Captain?

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.687 align:start size:94% position:6%
You are an idol to
children for God's sakes.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.856
- That's true, my kids
really look up to him.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.357
He's their hero.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.393
I'm not, but they love him.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.894
- Doesn't that piss you off?

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.996
You spent your whole life
trying to be a good cop,

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.933 align:start position:0%
and this Hollywood fly-by-night
can do whatever he wants,

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.902
he's worshiped like a god, I
mean you're getting shot at,

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.971
and he's taking my
wife out to dinner,

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.472
and doing the hibbidy-dibbidy.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:28.341
- Okay, I feel like
I need to make sure

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:30.476
you know Captain Ed
isn't the weatherman

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.011
your wife left you for.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.781
- Uh, ex wife, and yes, I
know, I'm not some kinda--

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.449
- Give me that dick.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:41.154 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm gonna make ya feel
like a special boy.

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:43.990
- Wow, it's been awhile since
anyone made me feel special,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.228
but, um, I'm gonna have
to decline, I'm married.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.896
- I got a gun in here somewhere.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.197
- No way does he have a gun.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:53.099
- I'm pretty sure
it's, there it is.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.100
- He's got a gun.
- I was wrong,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.237 align:start size:72% position:28%
I was wrong.
(gunshot)

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.307
Okay, so we definitely
have to take this guy in.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.176 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Gee, do ya think so?
- Yes.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.411
Normally I wouldn't ask, and
I know it's not procedure,

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.914
but do you think we can get
a picture with Captain Ed?

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.782
It would go a long
way with the kids.

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.651
- You wanna take a
picture with him?

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:12.485
Seriously?

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:14.020
- Yes.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.923
- Now come to think of it, if
my wife wants to screw me over

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.992
by fucking a weatherman,
I'll get revenge on her

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.461
by fucking a kid's show host.

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.729
- Yeah, that makes sense, okay,

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.398
let's take like a
selfie, let's do--

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.000
- It's actually called an ussie.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.234
- Really?

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:29.269
- Yeah, like if there's
more than one person,

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.603
it's called an ussie now.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.504
- Oh, okay.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.173
Uh, cheese!

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.608
That's good, that's real good.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.644 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, hey, pretend
you're an urban youth,

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:40.146
and he's teaching
you how to read.

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.247
Cheese!

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.548
Alright, now get back to--

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:43.716
- [Chance] No no,
let me teabag him.

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:47.453 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Moses] No, Captain
Ed, Captain Ed?

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.255 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What's wrong with him?
- He's not breathing.

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:51.457 align:start size:88% position:13%
He's not breathing,
Captain Ed, Captain Ed!

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.759
- Wake him up.
- No, come on!

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:53.860
Gah, wake up!

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.261
He's not waking up.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.163 align:start size:97% position:3%
Okay, you know he's
beloved by millions, right?

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.732
Captain Ed, come on if you
die my kids will hate me!

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.334 align:start size:97% position:3%
Please wake up.
- Okay, woah woah, calm down,

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.902
I got an idea, I got an idea.

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:07.073
Get in the car, just go, go,
come on, come on, come on.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.812
(body sliding down hood)

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:30.963 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, Right Now
really is a good song.

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:33.032
- [Moses] Is that Van
Halen or Van Hagar?

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:34.634
- [Chance] Shut up.
