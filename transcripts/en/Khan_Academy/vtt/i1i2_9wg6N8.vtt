00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:01.173
- [Voiceover] What I'd like to do

00:00:01.173 --> 00:00:03.972
in this video is order these six numbers

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:05.259
from least to greatest.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.233
So the least of them being
on the left hand side,

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:09.011
and the greatest on the right.

00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:11.821
And I encourage you to pause this video,

00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:14.096
and see if you can do it on your own,

00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:16.836
before we work through it together.

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:18.252
So assuming you've had a go at it,

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:19.831
so let's do it together,

00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.932
and to help us there,
let's plot these numbers

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:24.220
on a number line, and I have a number line

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.892
up here, so there you go,

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:28.677
there is a handy number line.

00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:30.511
And let's just take them one by one.

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.730
So the first number here,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.495
we have 7/3.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:34.901
So let's see if we can express that

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.594
in a different way, if we can write that

00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:39.160
as a mixed number.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.376
So 7/3, how many wholes are here?

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.418
And the whole is going to be 3/3.

00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:48.111
So this is going to be 3/3,

00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:50.107
plus another 3/3,

00:00:50.107 --> 00:00:52.186
is going to get us to 6/3.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:54.589
And so you're going to
have one more third left.

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:55.386
So this is 7/3.

00:00:55.386 --> 00:00:57.818
Three plus three, plus one is seven.

00:00:57.818 --> 00:01:00.011
So this is 3/3 is one whole,

00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:02.554
three thirds is one whole, so this is two

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:04.505
and 1/3.

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:07.418
So seven thirds, same thing as one, two,

00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:11.207
and you see, between consecutive integers,

00:01:11.207 --> 00:01:15.653
we have three spaces,

00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:18.194
so we are essentially marking off thirds,

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:19.671
so two and 1/3,

00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:20.678
is going to be 1/3 of the way

00:01:20.678 --> 00:01:21.769
between two and three,

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:23.371
so it's going to be right over there,

00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:27.330
so that is 7/3.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.617
Then we have negative 5/2,

00:01:29.617 --> 00:01:30.778
so same logic.

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:33.830
Negative, let me do that
in that green color.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.362
So, I can do it over here.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.588
Negative five over two,

00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:40.308
well that's the same thing as the negative

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:42.526
of 5/2, and 5/2 is going

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:46.391
to be 2/2 plus another 2/2,

00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:49.907
plus 1/2 so this is two

00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:51.312
and 1/2, this is one, this is one,

00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:52.581
and that's 1/2.

00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:55.786
So this is going to be one, plus one,

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:57.459
plus 1/2, two and 1/2,

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:58.552
we have our negative out there,

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:01.733
so it's negative two and 1/2.

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:04.656
Let's see, negative one, negative two,

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:06.227
and the negative two and 1/2 is going

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:07.628
to be halfway between negative two,

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:09.231
and negative three, so it's going

00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:11.808
to be right over there.

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:16.139
So that is negative 5/2.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.854
Then we have zero, not too difficult.

00:02:18.854 --> 00:02:21.467
It's actually labeled on
our number line for us.

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:23.347
Then we have negative two.

00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:25.310
Negative two, once again,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.831
on our number line for us.

00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:29.431
Two, two steps, two whole numbers

00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:31.171
to the left of zero.

00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:34.876
So negative two is going
to put us right over there.

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:37.151
Then we have negative 12/4

00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:38.695
so it might jump out at you immediately,

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:40.471
12 divided by four is three,

00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:43.792
so this is going to be the
same thing as negative three.

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:47.876
So this is negative 12/4

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:48.821
or if you want to use the type

00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:51.203
of logic that we used in
these first two numbers,

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:54.715
you could say negative 12/4

00:02:54.715 --> 00:02:56.397
is the same thing as the negative

00:02:56.397 --> 00:03:00.181
of 12/4 which is 4/4

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:01.104
plus another 4/4

00:03:01.104 --> 00:03:02.579
so that gets us to 8/4

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.042
plus another 4/4

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:05.248
that's 12/4.

00:03:05.248 --> 00:03:08.754
This is one, two, and three,

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.972
or negative three.

00:03:10.972 --> 00:03:14.200
So negative three is the
same thing as negative 12/4.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.162
And then finally, one more number,

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:18.786
negative 3.25.

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:21.038
So you could view this,
this is the same thing,

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:24.997
negative 3.25 is the same thing as

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:29.558
negative three and 25/100

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:31.974
and 25/100 is the same thing as 1/4.

00:03:31.974 --> 00:03:34.292
25 is 1/4 of 100.

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:36.695
So this is the same
thing as negative three

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:38.599
and 1/4.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.886
So let's see, let's go negative one,

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:42.697
negative two, negative three,

00:03:42.697 --> 00:03:44.485
and then we have to go a fourth,

00:03:44.485 --> 00:03:45.396
and we're not going to be able

00:03:45.396 --> 00:03:47.286
to do it super precisely,

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:49.282
but it's going to be less than 1/3,

00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:51.673
so it's going to be right over there.

00:03:51.673 --> 00:03:56.339
So that right over
there, is negative 3.25.

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.026
So we wanted the numbers ordered

00:03:58.026 --> 00:03:59.405
from least to greatest,
well, we've done that.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.785
The least is negative 3.25,

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:04.827
Then negative 12/4, then negative 5/2,

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.231
then negative two, then zero,

00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:12.231
then 7/3, and we are done.
