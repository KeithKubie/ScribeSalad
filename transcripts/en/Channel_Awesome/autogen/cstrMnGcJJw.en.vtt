00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:50.389 align:start position:0%
little bit in slow-mo or they slow down
 

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:52.900 align:start position:0%
little bit in slow-mo or they slow down
the<00:08:50.569><c> frame</c><00:08:50.720><c> rate</c><00:08:51.079><c> or</c><00:08:51.199><c> whatever</c><00:08:51.379><c> so</c><00:08:51.860><c> or</c><00:08:52.250><c> sped</c><00:08:52.759><c> up</c>

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:52.910 align:start position:0%
the frame rate or whatever so or sped up
 

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.290 align:start position:0%
the frame rate or whatever so or sped up
I<00:08:53.059><c> guess</c>

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:53.300 align:start position:0%
I guess
 

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.990 align:start position:0%
I guess
now<00:08:53.480><c> it</c><00:08:53.600><c> just</c><00:08:53.630><c> looks</c><00:08:54.019><c> slow</c><00:08:54.529><c> anyway</c><00:08:55.000><c> whatever</c>

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
now it just looks slow anyway whatever
 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.449 align:start position:0%
now it just looks slow anyway whatever
they<00:08:56.330><c> did</c><00:08:56.570><c> um</c><00:08:56.839><c> you</c><00:08:57.290><c> know</c><00:08:57.830><c> it's</c><00:08:58.010><c> something</c><00:08:58.220><c> it's</c>

00:08:58.449 --> 00:08:58.459 align:start position:0%
they did um you know it's something it's
