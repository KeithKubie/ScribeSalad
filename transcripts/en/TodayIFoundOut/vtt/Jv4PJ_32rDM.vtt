00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.610
Thomas Fitzpatrick, known to his friends as
Tommy Fitz, was a native of Washington Heights,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.540
Manhattan, who, although he had moved to New
Jersey, still hung out with his old friends

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.540
from the neighborhood.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.920
A “wild bunch,” Tommy’s crew were adventurous
and enjoyed frequenting area bars.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.869
Late in evening (or rather early in the morning)
of September 30, 1956, as he was leaving a

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.440
tavern on St. Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan
to return home, Tommy bet one of his buddies

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.370
he could make it back to the bar from New
Jersey in a mere 15 minutes.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.340
This, of course, is impossible by car.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.590
So after leaving the bar on that September
night, Tommy traveled to the Teterboro School

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.579
of Aeronautics in New Jersey where he then
stole a single-engine plane.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.400
Hoping to evade authorities until his return
task was completed, he took off without lights

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.380
at around 3:00 a.m.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.540
According to reports, his original plan was
to land the plane at the field of George Washington

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.250
High School, just a few blocks from the tavern,
but since its lights weren’t on that morning,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.850
a drunken Tommy chose to land the plane in
front of the tavern itself on St. Nicholas

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.380
Avenue near its intersection with 191st street-
managing to thread the needle, successfully

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.240
avoiding lamp posts and parked cars in his
landing.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.369
Of course, landing a plane in the middle of
a street in Manhattan was bound to get noticed

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.929
and the cops were called in.

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.959
Eventually charged with grand larceny, Tommy
was never convicted since the plane’s owner,

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:37.270
presumably amused by the whole thing and with
no harm done to his plane, refused to press

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.600
charges; however, since the city’s ordinances
prohibited landing planes on its streets,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.759
Tommy was fined $100 (about $800 today) and
had his pilot’s license suspended for six

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.759
months.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.500
Just over two years later, again after imbibing
at a Washington Heights bar, Tommy repeated

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.500
the feat.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.719
This time, Fitz had been telling the story
of his first flight when another patron questioned

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.200
the authenticity of the story- read called
him a liar.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.280
His honor put to the question, at about 1:00
a.m. on October 4, 1958, the inebriated Tommy

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.280
again went to the Teterboro School of Aeronautics
in New Jersey and “borrowed” a plane to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.980
fly back to New York City.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.340
This time he landed the plane at the nearby
intersection of Amsterdam and 187th Street.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.099
After landing the plane, he initially fled
the scene.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.650
However, when police were called in and once
again found themselves with a plane sitting

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.930
in the middle of a Manhattan street, and recalling
the unique incident two years before just

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.150
a few blocks away, they decided to go investigate
and see if Mr. Fitz had something to do with

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.150
this one too.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.750
At first, he reportedly denied it, but witnesses
who saw him exit the plane and run off claimed

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.260
it was him, ultimately inspiring Fitz to confess.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.340
He later succinctly summed up his decision
making paradigm in choosing to perform the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.709
feat again, stating, “It’s the lousy drink.”

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.540
With this second incident, there was no mercy.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.379
The magistrate judge, Ruben Levy, threw the
book at him saying, “Had you been properly

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.459
jolted then, it’s possible this would not
have occurred a second time.”

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.760
The 28 year old Tommy Fitz was sentenced to
six months in prison for transporting stolen

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.769
property.

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.850
Beyond his flying escapades and little stint
in prison, Tommy Fitz had a full life, serving

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.939
as a Marine in the Korean War and earning
a Purple Heart, enjoying a 51-year marriage

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.040
to his apparently understanding wife, Helen,
having three sons, working as a steamfitter

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.049
and living to the ripe old age 79, dying in
2009.

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.340
While a much easier landing, the aerial adventure
of one Mathias Rust in 1987, and where he

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.810
ended up landing, made his trip a little more
historic.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.030
The then 18 year old German had been flying
around Europe in a rented plane when he got

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:55.069
the bright idea to see if he could fly to
Moscow and land in the Kremlin…

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.370
Starting from Helsinki-Malmi Airport, and
claiming he was headed to Stockholm before

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.719
taking off, Rust made the attempt.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:05.730
Along the way, he was warned off several times,
had Soviet Air Defense tracking him, and had

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.230
soldiers repeatedly requesting permission
to shoot him down, but were denied each time.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.079
On top of uncharacteristic restraint by Command,
a series of gaffes on the military’s part

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.560
allowed Rust to make it to the Kremlin without
being destroyed.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.920
However, along the way he decided his original
idea a bad one, as he assumed he’d just

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.150
be arrested inside the fortress and that the
government would deny the event, so no one

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.350
in the public would know what he did.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.810
Instead, he decided he’d try landing in
Red Square.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.130
However, after a pass over the square, he
found there were too many people walking around

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.130
to make that feasible.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.690
He ultimately landed on a bridge by St. Basil’s
Cathedral around 7:00 pm on May 27, 1987.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.440
After the landing, Rust was, of course, arrested,
and ultimately sentenced to four years in

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.260
a labor camp in the Soviet Union.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.380
However, two months later as a sign of good
will to the West, Mikhail Gorbachev ordered

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.840
Rust be released.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.180
It has been claimed by retired U.S. 3-star
general and former Director of the NSA William

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.160
Odom that the military mistakes that ultimately
allowed Rust to penetrate the Soviet Union’s

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.740
vaunted defenses and fly over the Kremlin
allowed Gorbachev to remove many of his strongest

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.180
military opponents, with the event severely
tarnishing the military’s reputation in

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.760
the eyes of the public.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.800
And, indeed, as a result of Rust’s little
adventure, the likes of Sergei Sokolov, the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.120
Minister of Defense Marshal, and Alexander
Koldunov, the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.530
Air Defence Forces, were dismissed from their
positions, among others- according to Odom

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.110
helping to expedite the collapse of the Soviet
Union.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.080
Upon returning home to Germany, Rust managed
to make a cool 100,000 DM (adjusted for inflation

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.150
and converted to U.S. dollars, about $102,000
today) by granting Stern magazine the exclusive

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.830
rights to interview him for his official version
of the story.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.800
Hopefully he saved some of that for a lawyer,
because just two years later Rust was arrested

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.240
for stabbing and nearly killing a female co-worker
at West German hospital where he was doing

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.240
community service.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.420
The woman in question had reportedly rejected
Rust’s romantic advancements.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:22.300
Rust ultimately served 15 months in prison
for attempted manslaughter.
