Before I tell you the answer, I want you to get off your chair and push down on the ground.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When you do, you can actually feel the ground pushing back on your hand.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It may be confusing at first to think that the ground can somehow push on something,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but it can--it absolutely can, and it does,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it's this pushing of the ground that prevents this ball from falling through the earth

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or you from fall through your chair.
