1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.380
What is the solution?
Is there any solutions to this?
Well,

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.730
I mean again,
I think a lot of people,
carbon is you get very weary.

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:11.340
You want to see solutions.
Yeah.
Um,

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.630
you want to find solutions and you want to come with that optimism of finding

5
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:18.530
solutions and you want to justify why you doing this.
Um,

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.230
what you're doing is for which is to tell the stories but to look for solutions

7
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:26.190
to this.
Um,
and it gets worried about there is three areas.

8
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:27.570
I believe that our solutions,
first,

9
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:30.870
I do agree with you on the idea of drug policy reform.

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.140
Again,
it is tough uphill battle.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
I mean going back to 2012 I wrote editorials about,
you know,

12
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:41.910
one of the reasons you should legalize marijuana is because of the marijuana

13
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:45.720
come from Mexico,
which goes to cartels,
which pays for killers,

14
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:46.890
which pays for corruption.

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.330
But the same time marijuana,

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.960
a lot of United love is legalized in the United States and the violence as she

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.990
just got worse in Mexico.
So you've also got the issue of heroin,

18
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
cocaine,
crystal Meth,
fentanyl,
and you've got,

19
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:08.490
the cartels had gone to a bunch of other rackets.
Now they still crude oil,

20
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:09.360
which is a big deal.

21
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.260
They still billions of dollars worth of crude oil criminals down there from

22
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.640
pipelines can tap into a pipeline or something.
Yeah,
you could have a pipeline.

23
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:20.880
You have,
you already put in two taps,
you drill two holes in the pipeline,

24
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.780
you drill a hole to put,
to take the oil out.

25
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:28.770
You'd drill a hole to put water in to try and keep it a,
uh,
the,
the pressure,

26
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.890
the same Debbie saw as a crazy video recently,
uh,
in a,

27
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:36.240
in a small town in Mexico where a bunch of,
there was a tap open,
a really,

28
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.260
really bad tap,

29
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.190
which they always just spreading out and a bunch of people were lining up just

30
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:46.191
to pick up the oil from the pipeline and exploded and it was just like crazy

31
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.940
death toe.
Yeah,
I did see that from,
from,
from Nevada.

32
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.360
But a better way that I do believe in,
in a,
in drug policy reform,

33
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:57.510
we have to talk about this has to be on a table.
I mean,
Americans,
there's,

34
00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:01.810
you know,
no one knows really what American spend on drugs,
but as the survey,
uh,

35
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.710
which you can find online if you just tap in,

36
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.660
what do Americans spend on illegal drugs?

37
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.520
And it is an estimate of $100 billion a year.
So you know,

38
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.020
that amount of money.
I haven't,
that's an estimate.
I mean it could be right.

39
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.700
You know,
it's hard to know.
It's a very round number,

40
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.580
but like $100 billion a year.
Now,

41
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:23.640
if you think about that pumping into these cartels year after year,

42
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:26.280
I mean decades.
You know how much of that,

43
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.900
if it's 30 billion of that guide down in Mexico,
then over 10 years,

44
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:35.550
300 billion over 30 years,
close to a trillion dollars,
that really creates this,

45
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.870
this monster.
But I know a secondary,
so I'm not believe in drug policy reform.

46
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:41.860
I mean,
I don't know how,
I mean Rehab,

47
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.890
I want to needs it because heroin addicts by a lot of heroin,

48
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.110
so everyone you save from that you can,
uh,
you know,

49
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:51.540
you can stop a lot of heroin and a lot of that money,

50
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:54.000
which does money goes to these people who are doing this stuff.

51
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.220
But a secondary I believe is his social work.
Uh,

52
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.210
in the neighborhoods I like I've talked to,

53
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.360
I've done a lot of interviews with particularly with the assassins,

54
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.320
with the killers,
um,

55
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.880
in cartels in Mexico and also around Latin America.

56
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:14.650
I've been traveling around Jamaica,
um,
Brazil,
Central America,
Colombia,

57
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.640
talking to law of the killers especially.
And when I sit down with them,

58
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.730
I try and get their life story.
Like how did they first get into this?

59
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.500
Because you're not born doing this stuff.
And often,
I mean,

60
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:29.530
in some cases that is the different profiles.
There's some of them.

61
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.630
Uh,
and that is one,
one guy,
this is done in Honduras,

62
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.380
which is also crazy situation,
was a guy there.

63
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.220
I'd actually met him before I'd met him when I was doing some reporting down

64
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:47.221
there back in 2015 and he was driving for us and he was also carrying a gun to

65
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:53.020
help protect us with a journalist too,
that I had had,
had been hit before.

66
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.470
We've been actually shot before.
And uh,

67
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.650
then I met him again after he was in Guam to tell his story,

68
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.960
which is kind of typical of a lot of these guys.

69
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.130
And he described how he been abandoned as a kid by his parents and had this real

70
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:18.310
hate that he had with the world.
Like,
and I just fucked a world.

71
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.800
Um,

72
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.550
and he described the first time that he cared out murders.

73
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.600
Um,
and it,
this is just the,
I mean,
he cared out late,
already did talk.

74
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.340
He documented all these hits he'd done and to capitations he'd done in this kind

75
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:34.174
of crazy stuff.

76
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.790
But the first time a cat or a murder was probably the free case when he was 14,

77
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.770
and they got a family,
they went into a house,

78
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.260
can know they got a family and they booked to the family.

79
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.870
And he described when he described that and then describe later on,
you know,

80
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.370
how he became a higher killer.
And the thing about him,

81
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:59.560
like some of these people who think they're psychopaths,
they just,

82
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.270
they really don't care.

83
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.350
But some of them really do have these conflicts inside the heart.

84
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:09.370
I think he was someone or at least about to that interview.
And he had,

85
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.691
it's hard to,

86
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:15.430
to balance that someone who does evil but also has been a victim as well,

87
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:18.780
a victim and the victimizer.
And you feel that pain since,

88
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:23.770
since then he's himself been been murdered.
Um,
but uh,
yeah,
he's uh,
he was,

89
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:28.360
he no one.
So how do you get social work to reach people from a very young age?

90
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:32.950
Because often they recruited into organized crime when they're 12,
13 years old.

91
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.440
So he butchered his family when was 14 when he,
was he stealing money from them?

92
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.340
Was He,
so the story would,
that was,

93
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.420
he said that he was hanging around with these basically street kids and one of

94
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:46.120
the other kids said,
I know where there's some money in a house,

95
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.490
we can get some money.
And a house.

96
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.240
So they went in there and killed his family and it turned out there was no money

97
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:55.900
there.

98
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.780
And the reason the other kid had go there was because he'd actually been living

99
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.720
with his family and he said they'd been abusive to him.

100
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.380
So he wanted to like river have revenge on his family.

101
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.060
Well what was so really sick of that is to when he was describing it was they

102
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:16.061
had this family and they would stop them defending themselves.

103
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.610
They would like take them one by one,
like pinned them in a,

104
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.400
in a room and take them one by one.
I'd take them out,
butcher them,

105
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.120
how the other ones didn't really know what was going on and think,

106
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:30.290
I mean the action itself,
but how like teenage kids can think about that stuff.

107
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.110
And then later on when he was talking about the uh,

108
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.390
decapitations he was talking about they get contracts with the capitation inside

109
00:06:39.391 --> 00:06:42.960
the court.
Like they sailor,
we want this killing.
We wanted to capitate a guy.

110
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.680
We want this talk.
We want to see video of the guy being the CAPITEC.

111
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.260
We want that.
We want the guy to suffer.
Um,

112
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:56.090
when he hacks the heads off,
there's sometimes still be a moment when,

113
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.590
like,
when the life goes out of them and when the body is still luck,
twitching,

114
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.310
like he says,
they can still see luck was,

115
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.290
there's a bit like nerves and was like a chicken,
like a headless chicken.

116
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.250
There's a bit as a part when there's still like twitching a bit.
Even after they,

117
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:14.210
uh,
you know,
they've lost a kind of seven connections there.

118
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.730
<v 1>Ooh.</v>
