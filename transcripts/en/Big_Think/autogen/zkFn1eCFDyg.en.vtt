play okay great and I started learning
how to play with others I started

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
how to play with others I started
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.520
how to play with others I started
playing in jazz bands and wind ensembles

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
playing in jazz bands and wind ensembles
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.369
playing in jazz bands and wind ensembles
and so what I started feeling is that I

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
and so what I started feeling is that I
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.240

in producing a song that none of us by

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
in producing a song that none of us by
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.610
in producing a song that none of us by
ourselves could play and so this common

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
ourselves could play and so this common
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.830
ourselves could play and so this common
goal of working together was produced by

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
goal of working together was produced by
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.950
goal of working together was produced by
a musical experience and so that's kind

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
a musical experience and so that's kind
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899
a musical experience and so that's kind
of how I look at that flow state if you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
of how I look at that flow state if you
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.000

that's what a flow state is

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670
that's what a flow state is
 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.850
that's what a flow state is
it tends to there's a lot of skills and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860
it tends to there's a lot of skills and
 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.979
it tends to there's a lot of skills and
tools a lot of tools you can use to get

into a flow state more frequently we've

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900
into a flow state more frequently we've
 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.710
into a flow state more frequently we've
done research at Yale using fMRI is to

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720
done research at Yale using fMRI is to
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.559
done research at Yale using fMRI is to
analyze what goes on in the brain and

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569
analyze what goes on in the brain and
 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.260
analyze what goes on in the brain and
you can see when people are in a present

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270
you can see when people are in a present

contemplative skills so the skills of

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
contemplative skills so the skills of
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.620
contemplative skills so the skills of
mindfulness meditation contemplation you

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630
mindfulness meditation contemplation you
 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.930
mindfulness meditation contemplation you
can get there with yoga you can get

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940
can get there with yoga you can get
 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.940
can get there with yoga you can get
there lots of different angles your

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950
there lots of different angles your
 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.589
there lots of different angles your
training your mind and we're actually

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599
training your mind and we're actually
 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.770

this is the University of Wisconsin this

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709
this is the University of Wisconsin this
 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.580
this is the University of Wisconsin this
is through Harvard research and so how

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590
is through Harvard research and so how
 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.800
is through Harvard research and so how
can you get individuals to experience

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810
can you get individuals to experience
 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.890
can you get individuals to experience
this flow state by going into deeper

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900
this flow state by going into deeper
 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.830

contemplation being quiet the average

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840

number of thoughts that go through your

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569
number of thoughts that go through your
 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.570
number of thoughts that go through your
mind you can actually allocate them out

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580
mind you can actually allocate them out
 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.920
mind you can actually allocate them out
and a lot of different studies have gone

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930
and a lot of different studies have gone
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.620
and a lot of different studies have gone
through it and 70% of them on average or

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630
through it and 70% of them on average or
 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.370
through it and 70% of them on average or
about the past 20% of those thoughts are

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380
about the past 20% of those thoughts are
 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.710
about the past 20% of those thoughts are
about the future 10% are about now so

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720
about the future 10% are about now so
 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.640
about the future 10% are about now so
what if you can make that 10% larger and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
what if you can make that 10% larger and
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.360
what if you can make that 10% larger and
that's really what flow States about is

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
that's really what flow States about is
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.770
that's really what flow States about is
dropping those thoughts you know how do

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780
dropping those thoughts you know how do
 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.060
dropping those thoughts you know how do
you drop thoughts I don't know how to do

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070
you drop thoughts I don't know how to do
 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.729
you drop thoughts I don't know how to do
that well by being quiet and letting

that well by being quiet and letting
 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:33.930
that well by being quiet and letting
those thoughts just happen but letting

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940
those thoughts just happen but letting
 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.270
those thoughts just happen but letting
them go there's lots of tools and

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280
them go there's lots of tools and
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.979
them go there's lots of tools and
techniques for doing that and go online

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989
techniques for doing that and go online
 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.069
