KELLY CAYLOR: We need
to be cooking and be

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.800
very efficient with
our time as we're

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.430
cooking the dinners tonight.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.480
I know you guys have all looked
at your menus and studied them.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.100
FRANCES LODGE: The reason I took
this class is because I hadn't

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.040
taken a freshman seminar yet.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.870
And I kind of looked
at the course offerings

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.050
and thought, how
could I not apply

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.640
for such a cool opportunity?

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.150
I came in with no cooking
experience at all.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.320
And I think freshman
year is a good time

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.180
to learn such a
basic life skill.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.550
And I thought, like, what was
a better opportunity than now?

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.410
So, yeah.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.650
ANGELA WANG: It's
practicing science

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.360
when you're cooking--
like, whenever

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.340
you have a question, like, he
incorporated the answer into,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.680
like, teaching while
teaching you how to cook.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.750
And whenever they
bring experts, you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750
don't want to miss anything
that they're saying.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.650
INSTRUCTOR: Yeah.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.150
OK?

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.100
You have reserved
juice, if you think

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.700
it still needs more cooking.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.530
Follow?

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.410
STUDENT: Will you do that?

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.460
STUDENTS: --42, 43, 44, 45, 46--

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.170
DANIEL SHEPARD: We've
talked a lot about,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.470
like, gastronomy and
the way flavor works.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.740
So, olfactory perception,
retronasal effects of,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.490
like, how you eat food.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.700
So when I eat this bread with
this delicious butter on it--

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.620
mmm-- not only is my tongue
tasting these flavors,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.520
but my olfactory glands
are picking up perceptions.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.450
That's going
straight to my brain.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.710
And so we've talked a lot
about that kind of science

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.630
and then also about
agricultural sustainability.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.430
