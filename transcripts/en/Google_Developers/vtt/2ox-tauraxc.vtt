DAVE DAY: Good afternoon
everyone.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.440
My name's Dave and
this is Patrick.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.270
PATRICK HOFMANN: Hi there.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.200
DAVE DAY: And today we'll
be talking about design

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.710
principles for Maps.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.460
So we're really hoping we'll get
right back to the basics.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.170
We'll talk about some of the
fundamentals of design.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.340
So our presentation today is
very pure, it's very basic.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.170
There's not too many
flashy demos or

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.500
animations to blow you away.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.380
But hopefully, we can give you
some insights in ways you can

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.340
improve the design of your map
and also the page around it.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.070
So as I said, my name's Dave
and I'm a JavaScript tamer.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.930
I'm one of the engineers
on the Google

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.850
Maps API down in Sydney.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.550
And this is Patrick, and
honestly, I don't think anyone

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.960
in the office knows
what he does.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.400
PATRICK HOFMANN: I'm a UX
designer, User Experience

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.030
Designer on Google Maps and lots
of things on the local

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.660
side of things.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.600
And thanks for the intro.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.750
We are two different eggs.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.500
I hurl things at him
and I say, is

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.590
this technically possible?

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.090
He goes, no.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.530
But seriously, this picture
isn't all that accurate.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.700
I've actually got the world's
biggest zip as of yesterday on

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.800
my nose and I hope the
camera catches it.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.490
And also, outrageous stress
stains or pit stains there.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.100
So just to make sure that's
all accurate and clear.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.130
I also wanted to mention two
different eggs in that at

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.700
Google we're constantly trying
to figure out nuances of who

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.040
our users are.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.680
And when we're designing, we
just don't design in a bubble.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.600
We actually conduct lots of
usability research, and trying

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.760
to figure out, not just
demographically who our users

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.520
are, but what do they
fundamentally want to get out

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.620
of life and out of
our products.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.450
I wanted to introduce a
different set of users and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.160
that's two different
eggs here.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.040
I'm a triplet, which is odd.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.590
My brother and I are identical,
my sister is

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.300
obviously fraternal.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.020
So you get two eggs, one split,
you get the picture.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.160
There is your biology lesson.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.530
But because we're genetically
virtually the same,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.100
are we the same user?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.740
Are the three of us all
going to interpret a

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.280
map in the same way?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.990
Are we going to look at icons on
the map and interpret them

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.630
in exactly the same way?

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.350
And the fundamental
answer is no.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.580
Any experiences that
we had between the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.550
ages of four or 17--

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.290
puberty is ravaging--

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.640
and then up until we were 40, we
have all these experiences.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.340
We all read different books, go
to different websites, look

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.370
at different TV programs,
whatever.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.880
And all of those stimuli have
a fundamental impact on how

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.000
we're going to interpret
the map.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.790
However, ironically, our
differences in vision and in

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.810
eyesight might also contribute
to how we interpret

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.870
a map and so on.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.430
But the fundamental principles
are still relatively the same.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670
When we design, we are still
trying to shave nanoseconds

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.060
and milliseconds off of
your processing time.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.370
We want to get you to
the information

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.960
as quickly as possible.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.120
So how can we fundamentally
do that?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.530
And so I want to pose this
question to you, what does

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.430
this map say?

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.860
It's kind of difficult to see.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.440
And so one could conduct a lot
of usability tests and in lab

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.480
usability studies and so on, but
one of the easiest ways,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.580
if you're integrating any type
of information into your

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.250
content, especially map
content, is to squint.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.300
And look at that picture
up there and

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.720
intentionally try to blur it.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.080
And what do you see?

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.020
You see snow.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.350
Snow was probably, that big
blotch of white, is probably

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.020
the most prominent thing on the
map if you were to squint.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.440
And in squinting actually
there's a bit of obscuring

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.510
happening and so on.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.340
But in actual fact, is the
snow the most important

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.930
element or most appropriately
a prominent

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.740
element on the map?

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.960
And in this case, it isn't.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.210
This map is trying to show all
of the spottings of Godzilla,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.260
Bigfoot, and Sasquatch in the
Western United States.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.470
In actual fact, if that's the
message of my map, I should be

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.760
trying to elevate those
components.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.390
And the photographic
information, that rich

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.700
satellite imagery in the
background, is too prominent

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.490
and it's competing too
much with that

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.339
information on the map.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.540
And that's one of the
fundamental principles.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.860
And yes it's common sense,
but it's one that we are

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.720
constantly asking
all the time.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.920
And that is, what should
the map be saying?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.470
So what are the foundational
design

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.130
principles in getting there?

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.880
And fundamentally, it's CRAP.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.380
So it's designing with CRAP.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.770
I'm going to talk about
things beyond CRAP.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.280
And Dave's going to pipe in
about how we actually apply

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.480
all of these rules.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.320
So what is CRAP exactly?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.580
And I don't take credit
for CRAP.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.940
Robin Williams takes
credit for CRAP.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.520
Robin Williams, not the
comedian, but the wonderful

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.700
author who wrote "The
Non-Designer's Design Book"

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.040
back in 2003.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.350
And what she did was
fundamentally break down the

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.050
principles of design, really
where design meets usability.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.570
And she had said, she
pontificated this, she said

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.640
the purpose of design is to
communicate, to organize, and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.560
to attract.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.560
So we don't create designs just
to make them sit there

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.920
and look pretty.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.510
There's this fundamental
message that has to be

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.320
conveyed in anything
that we design.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.430
We want as much as possible to
guide the human eye through a

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.050
space in a very, very
appropriate way.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.870
And we often refer to this space
that the human eye goes

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.710
through as rivers
of information.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.480
And those rivers tend to meander
and they tend to

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.390
obscure and they tend
to pop out at you.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.280
How can we guide the eye to the
place that we want users

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.520
to go to most?

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.830
And how do we maintain
their attention?

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.150
How can we avoid them from
clicking away to soon before

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.980
they found the information that
they were looking for?

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.590
So where does CRAP fit in?

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.060
Well CRAP stands for contrast,
repetition,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.360
alignment, and proximity.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.050
And those, for me personally, I
really follow these rules as

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.070
much as possible.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.590
On a map where you've got lots
of unpredictable data, it's

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.870
really, really hard to say,
well how do I introduce

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.080
alignment when my
data doesn't?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.750
I can't just say all of these
buildings on this street

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.090
should be aligned.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.730
But in actual fact, there are
ways of ensuring that you can

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.280
get your users to the
information in the right way.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.370
So let's start with contrast.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.480
One more time.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.390
There we go.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.510
Contrast is a pretty simple
fundamental principle.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.910
And that is, if you've got
different information types on

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.630
the page, you want to make those
different information

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.540
types distinct from
one another.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.040
And contrast, whether it be
through color, through stroke,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.180
through weight, through
saturation or tone, those

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.760
things will help make the
contrast different elements

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.660
from one another.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.460
So you'll look at this map and
you've got primary roads,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.480
you've got secondary roads,
you've got information off the

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.240
map, and hopefully, you'll
notice that this was a very,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.050
very, very old screenshot
of Google Maps.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.870
This is actually about
from two and a half

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.240
to three years ago.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.990
We've come a long way baby, as
you noticed this morning.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.070
So what we try to do is make
sure, especially on the map,

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:30.160
that transit stops, for example,
embody a type of

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.000
contrast, that roads have a
certain type of contrast so

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.850
that they're distinguishable
from the base layer, that

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.170
Links in the left hand column,
as you can see, are

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.770
distinguishable from non-linked
content and

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.040
so on and so on.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.050
And so what we try to do is
contrast is one of those

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.030
fundamental principles
that we always use.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.800
One of the things that's really,
really important is

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.940
that if you've got high contrast
colors that are

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.120
really, really close to each
other like red and green or

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.730
red and blue, they can often
cause a lot of visual

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.790
dissonance.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.510
And so we try to avoid those
as much as possible.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.520
But in this case, generally
speaking, contrast is all

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.520
about making the information
components distinguishable

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.870
from one another.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.540
And here is how much we've
transformed from two and a

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.420
half years ago to yesterday.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.630
This morning you saw something
dramatically different.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:23.810
And that's taking things a
beautiful step further where

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.890
the new Google Maps that you saw
this morning are actually

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:33.000
even a more toned down version
of the map that you see here.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.539
And again, here's a map of
Bangalore, India from about

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.780
two and a half years ago.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.039
And you can see how thick
and bold the roads were.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:43.919
And all of those thickly stroked
roads seem to be the

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.680
most prominent thing
on the map.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.410
And we really, really, really
toned it down to make sure

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:54.803
that there wasn't this huge
colorful assault on the eye

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:58.010
because it really made things
hard to scan and hard to read

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.130
because everything seemed to
be the same saturation

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.610
and the same tone.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.500
So contrast is fundamentally
important.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.260
What about repetition?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.310
Repetition is an easy one too
and it's quite similarly

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.610
related to contrast.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.510
And that is, if you've got all
the different information

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.310
types that you've got on your
page, headings, links, body

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.570
text, and on the map you've
got points of interest,

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.805
primary roads, secondary roads,
neighborhood names, all

00:09:27.805 --> 00:09:30.130
of those are different
information types.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.530
If you give one of them a style,
make sure that that

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.150
style is repeated all
the way through.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.540
And yes, that's common sense.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.200
I know that, but it's one of
those principles that we

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.120
always seem to fail.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.970
We keep adding exceptions
to every rule.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.400
And repetition, the foundational
principle of

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.230
repetition, reminds us that
we should not keep adding

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.250
differences or exceptions
to these rules.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.480
So it's like creating a style
sheet and following it as much

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.820
as possible.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.760
Robin Williams had the argument
that too much

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.260
repetition can be boring, too
much repetition can be boring,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.165
too much repetition can be
boring, too much repetition

00:10:07.165 --> 00:10:08.910
can be boring.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.050
On a map, that repetition
is required.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.400
It's the style guide.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.730
It's the style sheet.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.870
It's the visual lexicon that we
want to remind users of as

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.520
they scan a map of Bangalore
versus a map of San Francisco

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.340
versus a map of Sydney,
Australia.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.090
We want to make sure that they
can easily scan the map and

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.550
without any effort, they know
what a point of interest is

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.120
versus a different type of
landmark versus a road versus

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.265
a neighborhood.

00:10:39.265 --> 00:10:41.730
Of all of those different
information types that fill

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.380
the page, we try as much as
possible to ensure that that

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.120
style guide remains intact.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.960
Alignment on the map, again
as I said before,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.190
is a bit of a problem.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.990
Off the map, it's fundamental to
creating these rivers that

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.915
guide the eye through
the page.

00:10:59.915 --> 00:11:02.550
And we don't just position
things on the page just

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.310
arbitrarily.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.650
What we actually try to do is
follow a grid system, or in

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.880
addition to the grid system,
trying to make sure that

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.270
things align with
other things.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.250
So buttons being in place,
they're not just sort of two

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.100
or three or four pixels off.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.330
It might seem like that two
or three or four pixels in

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.630
dissonance is not that big a
deal, but in actual fact, it

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:30.390
adds weight or slowness
to how we scan a page.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.330
And if we keep things aligned,
it adds a basic uniformity to

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.740
the page and a basic
unity to the page.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.530
And that's why we've got these
rivers of the 40 pixels of

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.160
white text to the left hand
side of the left hand

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.850
panel and so on.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.470
Last, not last, but not least.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:58.280
Off a map, look, I encourage you
go out, look in any of our

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.720
Google I/O content, whether it's
digital or in print, go

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.290
out and look at the
bus shelters.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.390
If you see advertisements
in the bus shelters, the

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.880
positioning of all of those
elements, especially in an

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.980
advertisement, are
not arbitrary.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.410
Look for those invisible
lines.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.660
And you'll notice that nothing
is as arbitrary or as random

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.560
as it seems.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:25.220
In this case, I actually tried
to create some alignment with

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.070
the elements of my face
in that photograph.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.730
And so, again, it's
not arbitrary.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.950
And what it does, as I
said before, is add

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.850
unity to the page.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.270
Proximity is the last bit, and
that is all about putting

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.370
things that are of like
importance or like meeting

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.180
closer to one another so that
we can identify groups of

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.170
information so that the
can scan things.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.950
If you're not interested in
looking at a bunch of links,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.660
then we can immediately scan
past that group of four links

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.870
on the left hand side.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.620
If you're interested in photos,
wow, it's great that

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.780
we grouped all of those photos
and put them really, really

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.260
closely together.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.990
Yes, it sounds like common
sense, but it's one of those

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.330
principles where if you're
trying to decide how to space

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.750
your information, group the
information like elements of

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.930
information more closely
together.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.470
And what this does is it shaves
those nanoseconds and

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.760
milliseconds of processing
time and scanning

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.080
time off of your user.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.840
So beyond CRAP, there's
other things

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.190
other than CRAP, obviously.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.570
We have some other general
design principles when it

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.810
comes to Maps.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.080
If you're putting Maps on your
site, if you're creating

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.660
mobile applications and so on,
obviously size matters.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.460
I had a really, really awesome
sexy slide here but I

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.710
had to remove it.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.120
Again, it's trying to be
adaptive to the devices,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.240
thinking about the destination
device that you're using, the

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.800
size of the map fundamentally
matters.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.820
But in those fluctuations of
size, you have to ask yourself

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.580
how much information does the
user need at any given time?

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.070
If I have a map on my phone
should I be showing a

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.850
different type of information
than the map

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.070
that's on my desktop?

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.600
What can I take away in that
smaller amount of real estate?

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.690
And Dave is going to provide
some examples later.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.620
On the desktop side, you'll
notice like at sites like

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:21.290
Google Flights, that default map
really is quite a lovely

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.790
stripped down version
of a map.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.250
We don't need to show all of the
state names on that map.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.840
We can just show the slight
little nuances of political

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.230
borders, show the origin and
destination, and make that the

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.350
most prominent thing on the map,
and everything else on

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.500
that map is very, very,
very much muted.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.220
Again, with the exception of
some wonderful little helpful

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.990
serendipitous destination names,
they say, hey on that

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.670
budget I could fly to Billings
or I could fly to Portland,

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.230
Oregon or whatever.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.570
So we try to really, really
strip back the

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.620
information on that map.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.330
And again, try to keep
everything above the fold,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.810
especially in this case.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.990
And above the fold is a reminder
to us that position

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.320
is not just about size, but
also about position.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.360
So make sure, obviously, that
people do not need to scroll

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.130
down the page.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.320
Try to keep everything
above the fold.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.250
And again, on the mobile side
of things, above the fold

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.560
usually means it's going to take
over the entire screen

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.860
real estate.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.940
But again, it's often in a lot
of sites we notice that that's

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.550
a consideration that's
often overlooked.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.660
Not only do size and position
matter, but message.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.390
A map isn't there just
to physically exist.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.430
Always, always ask what the
primary message of the map is.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:45.060
So this is a stationary
map that you see here.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.870
I photographed it in
Christchurch, New Zealand as I

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.750
was approaching the Christchurch
Botanic Gardens.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.430
And the first thing I
wanted to know was,

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.570
where the heck am I?

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.760
There were all these different
entrances on the map and I

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.040
couldn't quite see where
I was on that map.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.630
That little red thing that
you see there in the

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.590
middle of the map--

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.370
again, if you do
the blur test--

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.960
that red thing does come out
quite prominently, but that

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.540
was just an information
center.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.030
But if I can't identify where I
am, how am I going to get to

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.600
the information center?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.980
What's also interesting in this
case and this is a trap

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.650
that I myself even fallen into
when I do a lot of data

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.670
visualization, is if you've
got a lot of data and it

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.370
doesn't correspond to the
message of your map, you

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.200
really don't need to show it.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.430
This map beautifully,
beautifully illustrates all of

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.410
these wonderful trees
that fill the

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.420
Christchurch Botanic Gardens.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.920
They're getting in the way of
fundamental element of the

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.970
maps, and that is, the pathways
to see those trees.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.110
The pathways to get to the
different areas of the

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.570
Christchurch Botanic Gardens.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.870
And it's a beautiful map,
they've done a beautiful job,

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.700
but what should the focus
of attention be?

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.270
What is a thesis of the map?

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.170
It's not just about here's a
[INAUDIBLE] views of trees.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.339
It's how do I guide my users
to those different elements

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.490
and places in the park?

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.619
So just because you've got a lot
of tree data doesn't mean

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.890
you have to show it.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.500
And this leads to this other
principle which is people

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.829
don't read a map.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.150
I'm not going to go this is a
tree, this is a tree, this is

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.410
a tree, this as a tree,
this as a tree.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.550
I'm going to scan the map to
find out where I am and find

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.850
out where I want to go.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.580
So optimize your maps for
scanning as much as you

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.760
possibly can.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.170
Distinguish the message or the
thesis of the map from the

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.830
base contents of the map.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.720
And in this case, really the
pathways should have been

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.830
much, much, much
more prominent.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.340
And in making things easy to
scan, you'll notice that it's

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.150
all about taking things away.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.510
It's not necessarily deciding
what you want to add to the

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.620
map, but what's the most minimal
form of map I need and

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.510
what's the fundamental
information that I can

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.000
reintroduce to it.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.640
And so David's going to talk
about that a bit more later.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.610
And as I outlined earlier, the
blur test is a great way of

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.950
figuring that out.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.490
So if your message of the map
is, in this case, sighting of

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:21.200
Bigfoot, Sasquatch, and Godzilla
in the Western United

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.670
States, wow, if I do this
blurred, those pink markers

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.370
really, really blend in the map
way, way, way too much.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.880
They're not the most prominent
thing on the map.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.310
So let's bring them out.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.200
But then if I bring them out,
I need to ask myself a few

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.540
other questions.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.580
And that is, if every element
could speak for itself, what

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.100
would it say?

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.260
I'm a pink marker on a map.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.310
I'm a pink marker on a map.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.460
I'm a pink marker on a map.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.550
I'm a pink marker on a map.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.470
But I want it to say, I'm
Godzilla on the map.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.500
I'm Godzilla on the map.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.340
I'm Godzilla on the map.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.300
So here's where you've got a
great opportunity to change

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.550
the iconography on
the map as well.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.680
Markers aren't bad, but maybe
adding more information to

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.900
those markers would
be a great idea.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.420
Also ask how loud would
that map be talking?

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.690
If I reduce this zoom of this
image and I was showing most

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.470
of the continental United States
and I had all of these

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.790
markers there, those markers
would be like actually rather

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.980
large and they would be like
I'm a bunch of markers!

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.400
Again, try to test the things
out as much as possible at

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.530
multiple zoom levels.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.100
So the blur test and the
vocation test are key.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.920
And we do this a lot.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.940
So make it obvious.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.170
What's the map supposed to say,
sightings of Godzilla,

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.490
Sasquatch, and Bigfoot.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.490
But also ask yourself, what are
the outcomes of the map?

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.530
What do you want users
to do with this map?

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.700
If you want users to
drive to these

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.160
sightings, add the roads.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.470
And so here, this doesn't
provide any information.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.830
It's not even showing me
the states that these

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.710
sighting are in.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.200
So try to introduce a little
bit more information and a

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.020
little bit for more information
and a little bit

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.530
more information from a base
empty map, essentially.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.590
And so Dave will get into
that later as well.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.410
And what this ends up with is
a map that's meaningful, but

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.400
also so fresh and
so clean clean.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.080
So you've removed visual
traffic, you've distinguished

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.380
the meaning of the map from
the base map, and it's

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.800
something that, again, is easy
to scan and something that

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.900
users will be able to get the
information that they need to

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.010
glean from it.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.980
And again, as I said
before, test it at

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.360
multiple zooms and regions.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.868
So how do I apply all
these rules, Dave?

00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:37.290
DAVE DAY: OK.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.680
So I'm going to be talking about
two major things that

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.870
you can be doing as developers
with your map to help make

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.650
your map sell its message so
that users can quickly see

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.310
what you're trying to explain.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.070
And these fall into two
categories basically.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.790
What are you going to do with
the base map to help this?

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.550
And what are you going to do
with the data you put on top?

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.630
And mostly, I'll be focusing
on desktop maps in my

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.740
examples, but this applies
across the board, whether

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.940
you're talking about
mobile or desktop.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.050
Or any way you try and deliver
maps, you have to be asking

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.020
yourself both of those
questions.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.980
So when we're talking about the
base map, it's really the

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.470
styled map capability that we
introduced a couple of years

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.070
ago, which gives you the ability
to customize the

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.980
message your map is saying.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.160
And so one thing that we allow
with the styled maps is you

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.710
can target specific features
of the map.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.390
For example, you could target
geometries or labels.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.500
And in this case, I've decided
that my map doesn't actually

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.040
need the context of maybe road
names or anything, I'm really

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.730
interested in the geometries.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.450
So I've targeted the labels and
I've turned them all off

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.000
on the map.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.410
You can actually be more fine
grained in the way you're

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.080
targeting features and target
specific feature types as well

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.290
as just elements.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.780
So if we want a little bit of
context for the user so when

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.280
they look at it they know hey,
I'm looking at Sydney or I'm

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.280
looking at this specific city
or country, then we can turn

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.880
those specific labels on, the
administrative labels, I can

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.130
turn them back on.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.900
Another way that we can help
change the message of the map

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.340
is to reduce the visual noise by
making the features on the

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.300
map less distinctive,
less bold.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.890
And in this case, I've turned
down the weighting on all my

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.570
roads to 0.8.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.020
So the roads themselves are
taking up much less space and

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.550
they're occupying less
of my attention.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.850
And when I was explaining that
we were turning things on or

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.960
off, we actually have three
separate states of visibility

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.910
in the Google Maps API.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.860
So by default, this is what you
get in the standard map

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.730
and that's with your roads
set to visibility on.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.150
There's a second state which
we call a simplified

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.070
visibility.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.790
And in this one, we still have
road information, but we've

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.940
tried to simplify it as
much as possible.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.710
The geometries are
a little simpler.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.370
We've stripped out the labels.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.120
There are still some
important markers.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.610
There are still some direction
signs, but overall, visually

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.330
they're much, much simpler.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:08.720
And then, of course, you can
turn off the roads altogether.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.370
But as you can probably tell in
this case, that makes this

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:12.870
map useless.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:13.620
Pretty much useless.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.540
PATRICK HOFMANN: The
map is crap, but a

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.700
different type of crap.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.240
DAVE DAY: So you can turn things
on and you can turn

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:20.690
things off.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.980
That's fantastic, but really
the power of it is when you

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.550
can start to change
the stylistic

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.130
elements of the map too.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.110
So here I've got five
different maps

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.510
showing off New York.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.060
And in the first one that's the
standard new Google Maps

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.540
that we're showing off.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.080
One of the variables we let
you affect is this hue.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.500
So you can say I'd like my map
or a specific feature to be

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.280
colored this way.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.560
So I've asked for
a red New York.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.180
The second variable in the
third panel there is

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.320
saturation and that lets you
either tone down the color so

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.850
eventually it would wash out
to gray, or if you want the

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.980
opposite effect and you really
want to make something vibrant

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.510
because that is the message that
you're trying to send,

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.130
then you can scale it right
up for bright colors.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.370
The fourth panel is showing off
lightness, which is where

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.470
we could either scale the map
right out to a white, or at

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.920
the other extreme, it would
scale it make it completely

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.030
dark and black.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.750
And so this way, again, you can
adjust how much contrast

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.930
is on your map and which
elements are standing our or

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.340
fading away.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.970
And the last variable we
have is allowing you

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.230
to invert the lightness.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.730
So the traditionally dark
elements of a Google Map

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.740
become light and the light
elements become dark.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.410
And it's not until you combine
all those different features

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.150
that you can really have control
over what you want

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.070
your map to say.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.410
So here's an example of
all those features.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.990
I've chosen a very, very
stark palette.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.980
And again, this is a map of
Sydney, but this is telling a

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.420
quite different story
to the one before.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.630
I've emphasizes the highways by
coloring them red and I've

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.470
emphasized the secondary roads
by coloring them yellow.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.720
And I've removed a lot of the
labelling and other geographic

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.160
information from the map.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.840
So if you were looking at this
map, it's very clear for you

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.070
to see how do the roads of
Sydney connect together?

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.380
What are the major arterial
roads through Sydney?

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.120
How would you get around?

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.990
It doesn't give you much other
context, but in the context of

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.200
how does the traffic
system work?

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.360
It's the perfect map.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.190
Here's another example in New
York where this time we're

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.780
trying to emphasize
how the transit

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.140
system connects together.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.040
And here, pretty much everything
has been taken out

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:33.340
of the map.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.660
It's a very muted palette.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.990
There's no labels, but we've
turned on transit and that's

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.270
brightly colored
with its label.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.550
So it's the feature
of the map.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:42.800
It's the hero.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.450
One rule of thumb, if you're not
sure, if you are worried

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.430
that your map is too busy, is to
try to turn everything off

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:56.630
and then slowly introduce
levels of detail until

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.650
everything you want your users
to be able to do with the map

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.250
is possible, but none of your
information gets in the way.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.870
So try turning off all
administrative regions or all

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:11.230
labeling, all roads, bring them
back up and see at what

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.695
point your data becomes
comfortable.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.050
So you've got your base map
and you're happy with it.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.390
The next thing is, how are
we going to make the

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.790
data on that map sing?

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.900
How are we going to make it
tell the story that we're

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.930
hoping for?

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.180
So here I have a beautiful
map of?

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.270
Anyone want to hazard a guess?

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.550
Somewhere near Paris.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.470
Definitely very French.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:44.900
It's actually, I'm trying to
highlight the famous cuisine

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.260
restaurants of Paris
or France.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.020
In this case, we have three
cuisines that we know the

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:55.960
French are famous for, that's
hamburgers, pizza, and fish.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:01.250
So where in town should I go
if I want to get a pizza?

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.960
Where shall I be?

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.760
And again, of course, this
map doesn't give you any

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.380
information.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.140
If there was a legend to the
side, you'd spend time

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.600
scanning between the two trying
to work out where

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.661
exactly all the pizza
restaurants are so you can

00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:15.400
wander around.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.930
A little bit of simple
iconography, a little bit of

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.050
simple coloring, and all of a
sudden, I don't need to tell

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:22.380
you what the map's about.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.640
I don't need to provide
a legend.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.220
That maps says for itself
exactly where each of these

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.885
restaurants are, exactly what
type of food that I'm likely

00:27:29.885 --> 00:27:32.490
to find there, and where I
should wander tonight if I'm

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:36.850
after a pizza, a famous
French pizza.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.580
Of course, if I was referencing
these elements

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.460
outside my map on the web page
itself, I would use the same

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.630
vocabulary and use the same
coloring, the same

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:50.430
iconography, but you can see,
just a simple choice of colors

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.260
and shapes already
has made that map

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.510
infinitely easier to scan.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.620
Here's another example.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.730
I'd ask you to guess but I
guess you get the point.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.720
This time I'm trying to show
where all the large airports

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.170
are in the States.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:14.280
And instead of using specific
coloring or specific types of

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.480
marker to display information,
instead I can use vector

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.390
symbols to give you a sense
of data that goes

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.010
into another dimension.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:28.550
So here, I've placed airplanes
on the map at each of the

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:32.830
major airports in the US and
I've sized that symbol

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.000
corresponding to how many people
board planes in that

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.910
airport every year.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.700
And so straight away,
again, you know I'm

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.250
talking about airplanes.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:45.680
And you also get a sense
of which airports

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.100
are the most important.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.730
It's obvious that Atlanta
is, by far, the

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.070
largest hub in the US.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.530
And then you can see things
like LAX and San Francisco

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.910
standing out.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:01.190
And in terms of code,
this isn't an

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.190
impossible task at all.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:03.690
It's actually quite simple.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:09.140
Really I've started with a
vector path that Patrick,

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.490
beautiful designer that he
is, designed for me.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.580
And then it was a simple little
bit of math where I

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.360
took how many passengers went
through that airport annually,

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.260
divided it by the maximum, and
scaled it so I had a number

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.875
between, I think I went between
a quarter and one and

00:29:22.875 --> 00:29:25.660
a quarter so I had a good
range of sizes.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.190
And then, as I created the
marker, I just gave it that

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.660
vector path and I told it
how large its scale

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.070
was supposed to be.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.110
And it was that simple
to add that level of

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.360
information onto the map.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.290
Now sometimes, as Patrick said
with the trees, you have

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.460
beautiful data, but putting it
all on the map at once is not

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.390
going to help your
users at all.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.420
This is a little screenshot from
the Google Hotel Finder.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.040
And you can see that or you can
imagine that hotels have a

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.210
lot of variables associated
with them.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:58.520
What star rating at they?

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.110
What the users think of them?

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.540
How costly are they?

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.760
Are they available right now?

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.710
Do they have a pool?

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:05.510
What brand are they?

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:09.410
And if we tried to come up with
a language in our icons

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.230
or our symbols that expressed
every single one of those

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.520
variables, again, we'd have the
user scurrying backwards

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.510
and forwards between a really
complicated legend on one side

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:22.140
of the map and a complicated
map with a lot of

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.120
information on it.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.060
And it would take them a long
time to try and decipher what

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.740
it is they were trying to
get out of the map.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.520
So sometimes the simplest
decision is to not make a

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.030
decision at all and let the user
be the one that drives

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.020
the experience.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.960
So you can target specific hotel
groups, prices, star

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.880
ratings, that you're interested
in, reduce the

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.070
data, and then it's very simple
for the user to scan

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.320
that and find what they need.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.830
PATRICK HOFMANN: Takeaways.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.960
Reminding me of food
in Paris and so on.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.530
We're doing very good on time.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.650
So a few takeaways.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.500
Obviously, you saw the
presentation this morning on

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.470
the new Google Maps and
as I said before, it's

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.760
come a long way baby.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.930
If you're creating your own
maps especially trying to

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:14.810
build and visualize your own
data, it's amazing to see how

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:18.480
much process and how much
thought has to go into or

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.850
analysis that needs
to go before you

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.340
even get to the design.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.780
And so this is just
a few examples--

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.810
and this is in a previous
redesign of Maps where we just

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.710
covered walls upon walls
with lots of--

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.710
and sorry to all the forests
and trees out there in the

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.390
making of this redesign--

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.510
but it's amazing.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.270
If you take stock and you really
catalog all of the

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:44.050
things that are on a map, it's
compelling, it's overwhelming.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.090
But you have to take
stock of them.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.130
And that refers to all the
information types I was

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:51.050
talking about earlier.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.950
And so as you're assembling
different types of data, and

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.490
in this case we've got like
transit icons, municipal

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:00.800
transit icons, it's amazing to
see what role they play.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.130
And again, that role they play
is dependent upon the type of

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.620
map that you're creating.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.080
And so as you take stock of
those elements and information

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:14.080
types, you begin to decide,
OK, how prominent should

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.830
transit be on a map
of San Francisco?

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:21.380
Or on a map of Prague?

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.170
Or on a map of Sydney,
Australia?

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.140
And so if you want those
elements to really, really pop

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.490
out, of that contributes to the
effective meaning of your

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.480
map, then make those components
high contrast.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.990
So taking stock of the elements
and information

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.600
types, what it does is it
forces you to prioritize

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.450
what's most important
and least important.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.730
What should be really, really
high contrast on the top of

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.350
the map and what should be
fundamentally burned into the

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:46.510
map in a little bit more subtle
or lower contrast.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:48.710
Also take stock of the colors.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:53.090
When we first went through the
redesign exercise, I think it

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.570
was something in the
neighborhood, we had like 350

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:58.700
different colors on Google Maps
and it was like, why so

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.290
many when the color wheel, even
the color wheels that

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.580
we're showing here don't
have 350 colors?

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.500
But we just had all of these
different slight subtle

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.390
variations of graphics
and images.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.500
And we were like, in order to
help people scan, in order to

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.270
apply that fundamental principle
of repetition, we

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.920
couldn't have 350 for 360
forms of repetition.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.440
Let's have eight forms
of repetition.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:23.890
Right?

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.720
Let's have eight primary colors
on the map and let's

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.300
use them as much as possible.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.650
And then, if we're going to add
road labels and things,

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:33.490
maybe it'll go up to 16.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.360
But again, it's about taking
stock of all of the different

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.760
colors and trying to decide, OK,
what's my smallest palette

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.880
going to be.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.100
And try to establish a
consistent policy just like

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.330
you would establish a very,
very strict style sheet in

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.690
your content.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.730
Take stock of the strokes,
not the band, but the

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:55.680
elements of the map.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.860
So there are tons and tons of
line segments on a map and as

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.780
we build ways of guiding the
eye through the map and

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.220
realizing that those strokes
are totally unpredictable,

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.860
they're going to take different
shapes, different

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.489
directions, how can we
fundamentally move forward in

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:15.600
a way that's going to work
for the entire planet?

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.850
And in this case, you'll see a
map of, I think it's Emmaus,

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:25.480
Pennsylvania on the left in
about, I think it was 2010,

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.100
another one in 2013,
and another

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.100
one as of this morning.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.639
And things have fundamentally
changed.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:38.860
And its all because we're
trying to improve the

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.659
experience, trying to give
people the information that

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.840
they need at any given time,
and trying to satisfy those

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.650
fundamental principles,
which are CRAP, right?

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.820
Contrast, repetition, alignment,
and proximity.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.620
Don't forget it.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.179
Also remember that
maps aren't read.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:59.930
People don't read maps,
they scan them.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.340
And ask yourself who
is your user?

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.600
Is it going to be my brother?

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.740
Is it going to be my sister?

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.590
Is it going to be me?

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.290
Is it going to be someone with
really, really good eyesight

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.030
or really, really
poor eyesight?

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.070
And irrespective of that, how
are they going to use that map

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.750
that you stick in
front of them?

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.370
And try to emphasize what
that message is.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.210
That message of the
map is the thesis.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:24.510
It's the focus of attention and
those design choices you

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:27.290
make should be built
upon that thesis.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:31.030
But if anything, no matter what
the message of the map is

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:34.900
and so on, try to minimize
that visual traffic.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.080
It's amazing to see in eye
tracking studies how much the

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.460
eye pops back and forth on a map
when you give them certain

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.700
different levels of stimuli,
different colors, and so on.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.060
But again, in an effort to avoid
all of that testing and

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.560
so on for you, just do the
blur test and you can see

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.500
where you're headed.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.390
And that's about it.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.720
So we are three minutes
ahead of schedule.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.840
So if you have any questions,
please come up to the mic and

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.556
we're happy to answer
any of them.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.640
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.405
My name is Yarin, and I wanted
to ask Dave, you're a

00:36:16.405 --> 00:36:17.500
JavaScript programmer,
correct?

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:17.920
DAVE DAY: Yes.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.990
AUDIENCE: I wanted to know if
any of these features like

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.430
removing the rows or changing
the colors or any of these

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:23.850
things are available
on Android.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.320
And if they're not, is there
any plan for that?

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.390
DAVE DAY: At the moment they're

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.310
not currently available.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:31.310
We don't have the styled map
typing in Android yet.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:34.210
But definitely, that's something
we're interested in.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.530
Obviously, the styling, as we
saw, is a really important way

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.320
of telling a story.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.490
So at the moment, we've focused
those on the desktop.

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.970
But watch this space.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.920
My name is Mohamed.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.380
You guys made a lot of really
great points about the map

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.920
design and some great
tips about the pins.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:59.010
I was wondering if you had
anything to share about call

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.100
out design?

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.030
I've noticed that you guys have
started to move away from

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.920
the kind of the pop up call out
and you're doing something

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.530
slightly different, well
actually, very different on

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:12.270
the mobile apps and now
also on the web.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.730
Thanks.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:13.430
PATRICK HOFMANN: Yeah.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.040
So the call out is an
interesting one in that

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.130
especially when you're working
with small areas of real

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:20.820
estate like on Mobile, the
call out ends up becoming

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.210
something that you transition
usually laterally from side to

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:26.380
side or up and down.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.540
And so what's really important
in that space is to always

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:34.740
provide that tiny little bit
of the teaser that says the

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.840
call out is going to happen if
you come down in the space or

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.530
if I swipe across this space.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:43.070
And it's always to provide
the before and after.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.210
So the before being that little
call to action or that

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.500
little visual indicator that
says there's going to be more

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.490
information beyond here.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:53.860
And as soon as that transition
occurs, there's going to be an

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.060
easy way for me to get back
to that original view.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:01.530
So that permanence or prominence
of that before and

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.930
after, that teaser that says
here's my destination and

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.260
here's my way back is really,
really important in that small

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.030
piece of real estate.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:14.100
As you saw this morning, you'll
notice that photos that

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.660
are added to maps or it was, I
believe this morning you may

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:23.810
have seen the the Basilica in
Vatican City, and you'll

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:25.330
notice that we have
this new style of

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:27.100
call outs which point.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.160
So we have an actual grid of
information, so a bunch of

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.950
thumbnails at the bottom of the
map and pointing to the

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.500
elements on the map, as opposed
to having huge info

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.270
windows that say hey this photo
exists here and this

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.350
photo exists here and this photo
exists here and this

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:42.680
photo exists here.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.230
So we've noticed that there's
ways of, again, following the

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:49.460
fundamental principle of
proximity, of grouping the

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.910
information away from it.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.020
So take all of those--

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.370
because photos and thumbnails
are actually quite visually

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.930
rich, taking those photos and
actually grouping them

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.285
together and just providing
those annotation lines or call

00:39:01.285 --> 00:39:04.550
out lines to that information.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.630
And so to me, those are the two
fundamental principles or

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.800
the biggest most significant
changes that we've seen.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.280
I think for Mobile is probably
the more challenging because

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.110
of the limitations
in real estate.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:19.840
But those are two examples
anyway of how we've sort of

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.890
overcome the problem.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:26.510
Because you know how prominent
our info windows or call outs

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.480
used to be.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.800
We've come a long way baby.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.470
Yes.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:31.822
Yes?

00:39:31.822 --> 00:39:33.360
AUDIENCE: Hi, Patrick,
a fellow UXer.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.200
I appreciate keeping
the faith.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.840
With respect to the data
visualization the extent to

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.410
which Maps is becoming a kind
of data visualization canvas

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:50.210
that's open to kind of receive
and render data, there are big

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:52.620
enterprise data visualization
things are just like throw

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.410
anything at me, I'll
render it.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:56.932
But your point is it works
better if you actually kind of

00:39:56.932 --> 00:39:58.280
curate and think about
the message?

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:58.640
PATRICK HOFMANN: Yep.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.540
AUDIENCE: And where does
are that exist in the

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.880
roadmap tool suite?

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.105
I know, I understand it could
exist in the raw code, but is

00:40:06.105 --> 00:40:09.860
that part of vision for Google
Maps, how it sits with

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.610
spreadsheets or other kind of
data serving platforms?

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:14.410
PATRICK HOFMANN:
You've inspired

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:15.540
me to create something.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.770
Because right now,
there isn't--

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:23.250
I mean, the principle
is there.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.450
We want to try to offer you as
much freedom as possible.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.650
We can't ever predict what all
of the messages will be.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:29.390
Right?

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:31.950
And what all the messages are
at any given piece of data

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:32.960
visualization.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:38.790
The topics are just too
uncountable and innumerable.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:43.410
So that said, you've triggered
an interesting little project

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.560
in my mind, my next
20% project.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:50.960
In order to maybe rein in
on some of the actual--

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.610
what are the most common sort
of pitfalls in showing too

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:55.640
much information?

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.210
And do they fall under a
specific category or genre of

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.200
data visualization?

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.320
So for example, I did a lot
of work on crisis maps.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.700
And what I noticed was in an
effort to provide the most

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.440
accurate information possible,
especially because it usually

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.310
involved life threatening
situations like tsunamis and

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.400
fires and so on, the

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.750
information had to be accurate.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.470
Therefore, it had to
show everything.

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:28.970
I'm like, well, I'm trying to
get through a flood and I need

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:32.380
to show how severe the floods
are, what the height of the

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.470
water is, the height of the
water is important, but is

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.730
that road impassable given
that height of water?

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:44.770
And so maybe what we need in
those situations in those

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:49.350
genres is the reminders of, what
are you trying to say?

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.120
You've inspired me.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.220
Thank you for that.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:51.560
Yes.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.500
So the answer is no, we don't
have anything yet, but I think

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.890
you've inspired me
to do something.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:59.040
DAVE DAY: So we're actually over
time now, unfortunately,

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.705
but if you want to come and grab
us afterwards, we're more

00:42:00.705 --> 00:42:02.550
than happy to answer
your questions

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:03.930
and thank you everyone.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:04.230
PATRICK HOFMANN: Great.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.480
Thank you.
