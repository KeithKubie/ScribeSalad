00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:01.979
- Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.222
Previously I had covered
three of the basic aspects

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:10.013
of English and that's simple,
perfect and progressive.

00:00:10.013 --> 00:00:12.381
And so there's just one
more and it's a combination

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:15.231
of the last two and it's
called the perfect progressive.

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:17.091
And to recap what those two things do,

00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:19.382
is what the perfect does is
it denotes something that

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:22.036
is complete and the progressive notes

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:24.010
something that has been ongoing.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.141
And it seems like those
two things together don't

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:28.775
make a whole lot of sense
but I promise that they do.

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:32.647
You can use the perfect
progressive aspect to say

00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:35.832
that you've been doing
something for a long time,

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:38.539
or you will have done
something for a long time,

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.661
or that you had been doing
something continuously

00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:43.856
in the past and now it's stopped.

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:45.232
So let me explain how the

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:47.619
perfect progressive is constructed.

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:49.858
You take the verb "to have"
and then you combine it with

00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:54.858
the word "been," and then
the verb in question,

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.635
and then the ending "ing".

00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:02.968
So, as with all of our aspects,
the only part that changes

00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:04.360
is this "have" stuff.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.620
This is the only word that
changes depending on which

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.324
tense you situate it in.

00:01:12.324 --> 00:01:14.100
So in the past you would say, "I had."

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.933
"I had been eating cookies."

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:20.973
In the present you would say,
"I have been eating cookies."

00:01:20.973 --> 00:01:22.959
In the future you can say,

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.016
"I will have been eating cookies."

00:01:25.016 --> 00:01:26.920
So you can use the
perfect progressive aspect

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.139
in a couple of different ways.

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:29.962
You can say that something
had been ongoing in the

00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:32.156
past and is now done, you
can say that it's been

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:34.914
ongoing in the past and
is still happening now,

00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:37.206
you know, "I have been eating
cookies all morning and

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:38.762
"I have no intent to stop."

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:41.377
Or you can use the perfect
progressive to say how long

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:42.501
something has been going on.

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:45.961
So you can say, "I will
have been eating cookies for

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:49.327
"40 years come next Thursday
and I have no regrets."

00:01:49.327 --> 00:01:51.359
You know, you can say how
long something has been

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.862
going on using this aspect.

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:55.971
But you get the idea, so
the perfect progressive is

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.784
formed by combining "have"
and have is the part that

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:02.935
changes, I had been, I have
been, I will have been,

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:05.442
with been and the verb in question with an

00:02:05.442 --> 00:02:07.562
"ing" ending.

00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:10.682
You can learn anything, David out.
