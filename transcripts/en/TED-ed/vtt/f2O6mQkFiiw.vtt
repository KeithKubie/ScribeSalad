00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.191
Mastering any physical skill,

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:12.001
be it performing a pirouette,

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.080
playing an instrument,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.671
or throwing a baseball,

00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.100
takes practice.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.371
Practice is the repetition of an action
with the goal of improvement,

00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.580
and it helps us perform with more ease,
speed, and confidence.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.870
So what does practice do in our brains
to make us better at things?

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.550
Our brains have two kinds 
of neural tissue:

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.443
grey matter

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:35.070
and white matter.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.881
The grey matter processes information
in the brain,

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:41.671
directing signals and sensory stimuli
to nerve cells,

00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:46.701
while white matter is mostly made up
of fatty tissue and nerve fibers.

00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:48.650
In order for our bodies to move,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.551
information needs to travel from
the brain's grey matter,

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.948
down the spinal cord,

00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:56.191
through a chain of nerve fibers
called axons

00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:58.193
to our muscles.

00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:04.113
So how does practice or repetition
affect the inner workings of our brains?

00:01:04.113 --> 00:01:06.262
The axons that exist in the white matter

00:01:06.262 --> 00:01:09.262
are wrapped with a fatty substance
called myelin.

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:14.721
And it's this myelin covering, or sheath,
that seems to change with practice.

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:18.422
Myelin is similar to insulation
on electrical cables.

00:01:18.422 --> 00:01:22.612
It prevents energy loss from electrical
signals that the brain uses,

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:26.243
moving them more efficiently
along neural pathways.

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:30.653
Some recent studies in mice suggest
that the repetition of a physical motion

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:36.013
increases the layers of myelin sheath
that insulates the axons.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:40.453
And the more layers, the greater
the insulation around the axon chains,

00:01:40.453 --> 00:01:43.313
forming a sort of superhighway
for information

00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:46.163
connecting your brain to your muscles.

00:01:46.163 --> 00:01:48.112
So while many athletes and performers

00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:50.893
attribute their successes 
to muscle memory,

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:54.003
muscles themselves 
don't really have memory.

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.263
Rather, it may be the myelination
of neural pathways

00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:00.215
that gives these athletes 
and performers their edge

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:04.743
with faster and more efficient 
neural pathways.

00:02:04.743 --> 00:02:06.593
There are many theories that attempt

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:10.715
to quantify the number of hours,
days, and even years of practice

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:13.318
that it takes to master a skill.

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:15.747
While we don't yet have a magic number,

00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:20.368
we do know that mastery isn't simply about
the amount of hours of practice.

00:02:20.368 --> 00:02:24.268
It's also the quality and effectiveness
of that practice.

00:02:24.268 --> 00:02:26.083
Effective practice is consistent,

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:27.596
intensely focused,

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:29.947
and targets content or weaknesses

00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:34.153
that lie at the edge 
of one's current abilities.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.244
So if effective practice is the key,

00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:39.315
how can we get the most 
out of our practice time?

00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:41.085
Try these tips.

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:43.305
Focus on the task at hand.

00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:47.175
Minimize potential distractions by turning
off the computer or TV

00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:49.844
and putting your cell phone 
on airplane mode.

00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:54.304
In one study, researchers observed 260
students studying.

00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:55.364
On average,

00:02:55.364 --> 00:03:00.275
those students were able to stay 
on task for only six minutes at a time.

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:03.155
Laptops, smartphones, 
and particularly Facebook

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.655
were the root of most distractions.

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:07.855
Start out slowly or in slow-motion.

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:12.865
Coordination is built with repetitions,
whether correct or incorrect.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:16.465
If you gradually increase the speed
of the quality repetitons,

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:18.985
you have a better chance 
of doing them correctly.

00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:23.796
Next, frequent repetitions with allotted
breaks are common practice habits

00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:26.186
of elite performers.

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:29.606
Studies have shown that many top athletes,
musicians, and dancers

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:34.816
spend 50-60 hours per week on activities
related to their craft.

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:37.637
Many divide their time 
used for effective practice

00:03:37.637 --> 00:03:41.906
into multiple daily practice sessions
of limited duration.

00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:45.457
And finally, practice in your brain
in vivid detail.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:48.148
It's a bit surprising, but a number
of studies suggest

00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:50.898
that once a physical motion 
has been established,

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:54.304
it can be reinforced 
just by imagining it.

00:03:54.304 --> 00:03:59.917
In one study, 144 basketball players
were divided into two groups.

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:03.577
Group A physically practiced 
one-handed free throws

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.977
while Group B only 
mentally practiced them.

00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:09.816
When they were tested at the end
of the two week experiment,

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:13.247
the intermediate and experienced
players in both groups

00:04:13.247 --> 00:04:16.977
had improved by nearly the same amount.

00:04:16.977 --> 00:04:20.287
As scientists get closer to unraveling
the secrets of our brains,

00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:24.458
our understanding of effective practice
will only improve.

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:27.788
In the meantime, effective practice
is the best way we have

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:29.698
of pushing our individual limits,

00:04:29.698 --> 00:04:31.199
achieving new heights,

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.748
and maximizing our potential.
