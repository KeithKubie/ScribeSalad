00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.410
Whenever people talk
about investing,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.470
the terms risk and reward
tend to come up a lot,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.810
and they usually tend
to come up together.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.820
Somehow implying that
the more risk you

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.724
take, the more reward that
you might be able to get.

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:15.390
And that's actually
what it is implying.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.600
But what I want to
do in this video

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.110
is give a little bit of
an introduction to that,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.151
or a little bit of context,
and a little bit more

00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:23.240
structure on how do you
think about risk and reward.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.050
So let's say that
we have $1,000,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.150
and we want to figure out what
we can do with this $1,000.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.790
Well, one option
is we could just

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.880
put it into a savings account.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.770
So here is one option.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.500
So we could put it
into a savings account.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.210
And in this situation,
our reward--

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.150
I'll start with
the reward first--

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.170
is we'll get-- I don't
know-- 1% in interest

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.910
per year, 1% annual interest.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.680
So after a year, we'll
have roughly $1,010.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.490
We got 1% on our $1,000.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.020
So we get a little
bit of a reward.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.640
What's our risk?

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.150
So the risk here--
I'll write risk

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.470
in a different color--
what is the risk here?

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.510
Well, if I'm putting it
into a savings account--

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.550
and I'm assuming I'm putting
it into an FDIC insured savings

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.050
account.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.506
Let me put that over here.

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:18.880
If you do open a
savings account,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.750
it should be FDIC insured.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.060
That means that it's being
insured by the Federal Reserve.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.140
Which means that if
for whatever reason

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.710
that bank were to
fail, below some limit,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.210
the Fed will insure your money.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.820
So even if this
bank fails, and it

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.820
loses all of its
money and everything,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.850
you'll still get
your deposit back.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.410
So if you're
investing, or if you're

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.630
putting money in an FDIC
insured savings account,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.870
your risk is essentially 0.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.140
You are guaranteed to
get that $1,000 back,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.630
regardless of what
happens to that bank.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.540
So you have very
little risk there.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.360
But you might say, look, you
know, this is a good risk,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.760
but I feel like I can get
more than 1% on my money,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.610
let me think about the other
places that I could invest it.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.699
Well, you could--
and obviously I'm

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:09.240
not going to be exhaustive on
all of the different investment

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.410
options, I just want to give
you a sense of risk and reward.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.470
You could say, well, maybe
I could lend to the money

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.480
to a very reputable company.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.750
So let me say, lend money
to reputable company.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.930
And maybe this company
has billions and billions

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.030
of dollars in assets.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.020
It's been around for
hundreds of years.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.640
It generates cash
on a regular basis.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.350
There's really very
few circumstances

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.600
in which you could imagine
that this company would not

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.710
be able to pay off its debt.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.700
And you lend money to
a reputable company

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.280
by essentially
buying their bonds.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.620
When you buy a
company's bonds, you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.640
are lending money
to that company.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.710
So that's just the way
you should think about it.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.220
So the reward here, if you lend
your money to this company,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.730
they will pay you 6% in annual
interest on your $1,000.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.000
So 6% on the first
year, you'd get $60.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.500
This is six times
more than what you

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.260
were getting in the
savings account.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.750
What's the risk here?

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.690
Well, it's not 0 anymore.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.250
It's not FDIC insured.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.470
The Federal Reserve isn't
saying that they'll either

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.670
give the money if the
bank goes out of business,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.920
or they'll print the money
if they don't even have it.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.980
Here, the risk is that the
business defaults on the loan.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.030
So the company itself
might go bankrupt.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.560
If it goes bankrupt,
then all the people

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.580
that the company
owes money to will

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.730
go after that company's assets.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.580
But maybe you are low
on the pecking order,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.954
or maybe the
company doesn't have

00:03:50.954 --> 00:03:52.560
enough assets to
pay everyone back.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.730
So there is some risk.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.650
Any business could
go out of business,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.420
you never know
what might happen.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.530
But since this is a
very reputable company,

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.440
and as we said it
has a lot of assets,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.580
it has a very stable business,
it does good in boom times

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.440
and in recessions, this is a
low risk of business default.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.240
So I'll write, low
risk, right over here,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.269
because we're assuming it
is a reputable company that

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.790
has a lot of assets,
and all the rest.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.610
Now let's say that even that
6%, you know, it's all right,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.300
but you feel like
you could get more.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.570
You could do better.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.310
So let's say that
you have a friend who

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.840
is a-- let's say that
he's just starting

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.830
his career as a doctor, so he
says he has a nice, stable job.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.280
So he's just starting his career
as a doctor, so stable income.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.750
He's making $200,000 a year.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.250
But he's just out
of medical school,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.170
and he figures he
wants to buy a house.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.210
So he's just
starting, and he wants

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.800
to find people who can help
him with the down payment

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.260
on the house.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.930
So here, your reward.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.620
And he says, anyone who's
willing to lend to me,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:20.110
I will give them 8% annual
interest on their money.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.660
And it looks pretty good,
stable income, it's only $1,000.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.230
He's not buying an
outlandishly expensive house.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.720
He's buying a $200,000
house on which

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.050
he wants to put a
$40,000 down payment.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.360
Seems well within
his means to pay it.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:41.070
But there's always some
risk that he doesn't pay.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.817
Who knows?

00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:43.900
Hopefully this doesn't
happen, but maybe something

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.940
happens to him, himself.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.606
Maybe he's not able
to work as a doctor.

00:05:46.606 --> 00:05:48.760
Maybe something
happens to his health.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.050
Maybe he has of some type
of addictive personality,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.397
and he likes to drink
away all of his money.

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.480
Or he likes to gamble it
away, and that's actually

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.270
why he needs loans
to begin with.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.840
So there is some risk.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.430
There's a risk that
he doesn't pay.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.260
But by all indications, he looks
like a pretty safe character.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.250
But it's definitely
riskier than this company,

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.270
because you have no assets to
go after if he doesn't pay.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.100
Companies can't randomly get
hit by a bus, a human being can.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.410
Companies, for the most part,
cannot become alcoholics,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.170
a human can.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.880
Who knows?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.632
We don't know.

00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:23.090
But there are
definitely more risks

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.970
associated with this
individual doctor who does not

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.790
have assets you can go after.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.570
But maybe this is also
not enough reward.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.330
You're like, you
know, I heard that I

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.150
can do even better than
this in the stock market.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.410
So you look at another option.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.255
So let's say you
invest in the market.

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:49.790
And you're just going
to invest in a bunch

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.750
of-- a broad portfolio,
kind of investing

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.260
in the market as a whole.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.400
The reward here would be
expected return of the market.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.410
So you look at historical
results in the market

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.500
and you say, look it, goes
up and down every year.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.716
But over long periods of
time, it looks like people--

00:07:03.716 --> 00:07:05.090
and this isn't
the exact number--

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.250
but it looks like people have
averaged approximately 10%

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.180
per year.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.690
So that looks pretty
good, but what's the risk?

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.220
Well, the risk is that
this expectation is just

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.680
based on what the historical
returns in the market were.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.830
There are huge periods of
time in the market-- I'm

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.850
talking 10, 20, 30 years
where the market is flat.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.530
Where the market
could even go down.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.240
In any given year, the market
could go down in the double

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.240
digits or in the 30 , 40% even,
in a really, really bad year.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.170
You really aren't
sure whether you're

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.330
going to get your 10% per year.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.747
So I would say the risk
here is volatility.

00:07:44.747 --> 00:07:46.830
And volatility just means
it could go up and down.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.970
It jumps up and down.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.864
It's not going to be a constant
upward trend, like your savings

00:07:50.864 --> 00:07:51.530
account will be.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.030
Volatility.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.980
And you have a good chance
that you could actually

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.160
lose the money that
you're investing.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.160
It could go down in any year,
in any month, in any five years,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.880
in any 10 years.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.520
So once again, it seems
like a kind of risky thing.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.780
And you can very
easily lose everything.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.916
And let's say that even
10% isn't enough for you.

00:08:11.916 --> 00:08:14.040
You say, hey, I want to
look at things that maybe I

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.800
can get even a better return.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.980
So you have your brother-in-law,
who's been out of work

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.480
for a little bit.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.810
So let me write the
brother-in-law right over here.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.270
Your brother-in-law has been
out of work for a little bit,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:33.539
and he says that all he needs to
start his new guaranteed money

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:38.650
making scheme is $1,000, so
he can buy the equipment,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.789
so that he can start
it up in his garage.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:44.015
And the reward-- And
there's multiple ways

00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:45.140
we could set up the reward.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.580
We could make it so that
he borrows money for you.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.392
We could make it so that you
own part of the business.

00:08:50.392 --> 00:08:51.850
So let's say the
reward is, you get

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.330
a 50% stake in the business.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.130
And, let's say that your
brother-in-law is right,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.130
and this becomes a
million dollar business.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.940
So this is a very, very,
very, very high reward,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.190
if what your brother-in-law
is telling you is correct.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.820
But what's the risk?

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.890
Well, the risk here is
obviously that he's not correct

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.900
and that he squanders
all of your money.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:24.740
So lose everything.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.060
And not only could you lose the
monetary money that you put in,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.850
it could also ruin
your relationship

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.920
with your brother-in-law
and maybe your spouse.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.190
So, risk relationships.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.540
Maybe I should put, you
risk family happiness.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.900
Once your brother-in-law
loses all of your money,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.950
it won't be so easy at
Thanksgiving anymore

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.590
to have a civil conversation.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.450
So in general, the
overlying-- I probably

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.960
did more of these
scenarios than I

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.570
needed to-- but I think
you see the general trend.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.290
The more risk you take in
general, the more of reward

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.660
you should expect to get.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.720
Or the more reward that
you're expecting to get,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.790
there's probably
some risk there.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.600
And if there's
something that looks

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.240
like it's really safe with
the really high reward,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.280
one of those two things
are probably not true.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.390
So if we were to
plot all of these,

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.420
and I haven't
really quantified--

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.850
I haven't given you a
way of measuring risk.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.770
In future videos we
can think about that,

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.190
and academics have thought
about ways of measuring risk.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.880
So that's risk and reward,
if you plot it all over here.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.140
So the savings account.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.850
It's 0 risk.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.760
So this is the savings
account over here.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.240
It's 0 risk, and
your reward is 1%.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.520
So this is 1% right over here.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.740
The lending to a
reputable company.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.664
It's a little bit higher risk.

00:10:47.664 --> 00:10:48.830
So this one right over here.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.670
It's a little bit higher
risk, and your reward is 6%.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.150
So let's say this is
6% right over here.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.770
So it's a little
bit higher risk.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.870
I'm just saying
risk is increasing.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.400
If you lend to the doctor.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.010
So let me pick another color
here, that I haven't used.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.220
If you lend to the doctor,
once again, the risk

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.110
is a little bit
higher than lending

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.380
to that company or
the savings account.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.790
Once again, a little
bit higher reward.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.110
Little bit higher reward.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.370
You now have an 8% reward.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.650
Investing in the stock market.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.360
Let me pick a color
I haven't used yet.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.570
Investing in the stock
market, Once again,

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.470
higher risk, but
also a higher reward.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.490
Maybe 10 per year.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.880
That's 10% right over there.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.560
Your brother-in-law,
super high risk,

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.100
probably off the
charts over here,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.630
but also super high reward.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.450
So maybe it might be like that.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.210
But the general idea is, the
more risk, the more reward.
