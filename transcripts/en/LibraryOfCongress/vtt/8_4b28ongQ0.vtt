&gt;&gt; Tycely Williams:
Good afternoon.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.210
It's wonderful seeing so many
book lovers in the house.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.560
I'm really excited to
introduce an American treasure

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.560
who is going to keep a
wonderful conversation going.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.750
Before we start, I'd
like to introduce myself.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.740
I'm Tycely Williams,
the president

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.130
of the Junior League
of Washington.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.200
We represent the
volunteer force,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.740
that over the last 16 years
has helped the book festival

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.040
with book lines.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.430
So, we are delighted
to be with you today.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.040
I'd also like to thank the
Library of Congress for all

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.810
of their works as well as the
National Endowment for the Arts

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.710
for sponsoring our
time together.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.960
I'd like to introduce
James McBride

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.750
who is a beloved American
writer and musician.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.750
Many of you know
him as the recipient

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.970
of the 2013 National
Book Award for Fiction

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.870
for his novel "The
Good Lord Bird".

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.510
He is currently a
distinguished, yes, snap, snap.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.940
He's currently a distinguished
writer in residence

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.120
at New York University.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.130
He's a graduate of
Oberlin College, father --

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.420
yay, Oberlin in the
house, all right --

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.100
and father to three children.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.790
Let's warmly welcome
our distinguished artist

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.770
for the time being.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.990
Mr. McBride, we'd love to hear
more about "Five-Carat Soul"

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.290
and all that you've got.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:46.880
And, as he's coming, he
will speak for 25 minutes,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.790
and we will open it up to Q
and A for the remaining 20.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.090
Enjoy. Thanks.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.390
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Thank you.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:04.150
[ Applause ]

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.450
You like me.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.750
You really like me.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.160
Thank you so much.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.510
It's so nice to see
so many white --

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.890
I mean, I nice people
here today.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.020
I really feel touched
and honored.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.420
You know, I forgot
I was chewing gum.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.030
You know, my mother told
me when I was little

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.020
that if you chew gum and swallow
it, your rear end will close up.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.230
So, I've always been
cognizant, never --

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.360
you know, my brother said, "What
happens when you blow a bubble?"

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.700
That's too much information.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.400
Anyway, I want to talk
today about my latest book,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.410
and I know, like, you know,
when you go see someone talk,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.520
you know, like, Willie Nelson
used to say, "If they ask me

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.720
to sing that song, "To All
the Girls I've Loved Before",

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.100
I'm going to kill somebody."

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.750
But, that's what they
wanted to hear him sing.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.130
So, I know a lot of you want
to hear me talk about "Color

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.290
of Water" and Good Lord
Bird which I'll do,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.790
after I finish hawking
this first,

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.820
but I won't shamelessly hawk it.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.690
I'll just give you a
brief synopsis of it

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.930
and then share some
ideas with you about some

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.510
of the other books,
the other two books

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.790
that you might be interested
in, and then I'll be happy

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.390
to entertain any questions that
you might have or conversation

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.750
that you want to offer.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.810
I'm delighted to see so many
of you here, and I'm cognizant

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.510
that this is the year
that Barbara Bush died,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.800
and Barbara Bush and
Laura Bush have a lot

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.530
to do with why we're here.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.160
They were big book lovers
-- and Michelle Obama --

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.040
they were huge book lovers,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.480
but I know Laura Bush was really
a big reason why the National

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.510
Book Festival became what it is.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.070
[ Applause ]

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.710
And, it, you know, it
doesn't take a lot to make --

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.810
to acknowledge someone,
just to say thank you

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.820
or to say they did
something good.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.300
It really doesn't take
a whole lot to do that.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.940
All you have to do is say
it and feel it and that's --

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.060
and you feel better, you know?

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.280
So, we buried Aretha
Franklin yesterday I guess

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.570
and Senator McCain today or
tomorrow, whenever that happens,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.540
and we're a little bit
smaller because of it,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.070
but we're a lot larger
because of what they are

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.510
and what they'll always be and
always represent, and that's--

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.340
I feel like I'm talking
to congress.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.410
I'm like okay no.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.780
Applause [inaudible] got
to shake everyone hand.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.690
All right, so my latest book
is called Five-Carat Soul.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.030
It's a book of short
stories and these --

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.930
some of these stories
happened long ago.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.280
Some of them I wrote
when I was in my 20s,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.110
and some of them
I wrote recently.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.340
The most pertinent one to where
we are is a story called "Mr. P

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.900
and the Wind", and I wrote
this when I was a reporter

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.930
at the Washington Post.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.110
I worked in the style section
here at the Post and that's

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.410
when Ben Bradlee
ran the newspaper,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.300
and so I had the
pleasure of working

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.670
with some really
talented people.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.090
By the way, I'm very proud
of what the Post has become

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.610
in the last three or four years.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.870
It's really, really gotten, just
become a fantastic organization.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.520
Plus it wasn't any
good when I was there,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.110
but that's not the point.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.130
No, it was always
a high standard

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.370
of journalistic excellence
but now even greater.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.330
It's even more important that
you subscribe to the paper.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.070
And, if you have to decide
between buying one of my books

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.200
and subscribing to the paper,
decide between another book

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.270
and just make sure --
all right, so I was --

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.570
when I was here in Washington,
DC, my brother's sons were

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.830
like nine and eight,
nine or something

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.620
like that respectively, and I
took them to the national zoo.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.350
They wanted to see some animals.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.110
So, we went to the national
zoo here, in Washington DC,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.510
and I saw, that was the
last zoo I ever visited,

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.420
because it was just,
really, just painful

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.370
to see these magnificent
creatures --

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.670
I don't need to tell
you the rest.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.430
It just was -- I didn't like it.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.020
So, I wrote a short
story about it.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.460
It became a novella, and I wrote
the whole thing when I was here

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.470
in Washington, DC, and I'll
read you the beginning of it,

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.960
and it's called Mr.
P and the Wind.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.260
And, essentially, this is a
story about a lion who lives

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.340
in a zoo in Washington, DC, in
a world where animals can talk

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.720
to each other through the mind.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.170
And, so this is how
the story begins.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.470
I am a lion.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.120
I live in a zoo, but I was once
a free lion and never forgot it.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.620
Many years ago, before I
was captured and brung here,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.710
I knowed a lion who ate a man.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.010
His name was Box.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.010
I don't know how Box
came to that name,

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.730
for violence got their own
names for their own purpose,

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.930
and that name was
a puzzlement to me.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.550
Box is a human name, you see,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.010
and it stands the reason maybe
a human gived him that name.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.270
However it happened or whether
Box got a reason for telling it

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.210
or not telling it, it
ain't my business to know,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.270
for most lions know that
man things often ain't got

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.570
no purpose.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.590
And, no creature of the
jungle is going to sniff

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.650
around something that
ain't purposeful,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.760
especially something
big as a name,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.940
for lions got their own names
that's particular to them,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:26.330
like Monkey Tricked Him or His
Wife Don't Visit or Orange Head

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.770
or Feet Smell Funny
or Don't Trust Her

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.500
because She's a Sun
or names like that.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.180
For example, humans call me Hal,

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.910
but my real name is
Get Along Go Along.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.880
I never knew Box's
real name, by the way.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.300
I was never stupid enough
to ask about it neither,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.810
for Box was what you call, a
plain old dry long soul lion.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.570
He was a hard lion,
set in his ways.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.530
He didn't take no
shit off nobody.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.040
Now, Box was hard
set in his ways.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.340
He couldn't adjust to nothing.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.770
He didn't like fancy things,
no spring box rhinos, ostrich,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.970
monkey, and all that
kind of jazz for him.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.680
Just straight out bloods and
guts, zebra, snake, snake,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.630
zebra, whatever he could get.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.510
He was, what you
call, old country.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.810
He didn't slaughter a lot,

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.130
but what he did slaughter,
he did eat.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.820
Most of what he ate
was bigger creatures,

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.950
so the smallest scarcer
ones could grow big enough

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.250
for bigger eating later.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.410
He didn't waste nothing,
including time.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.390
So, when he see me walk
around one day when I was

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.690
but a little cub, he
said, "Sit here a minute.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.980
I got something to tell
you," I sat down to listen,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.660
for Box wasn't nobody to ignore.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.830
Now, I've heard many
of story told to me

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.320
when I was a cub running free
back yonder in the plains

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.060
of Africa, and a bunch
of them stories was lies,

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.580
for animals ain't no
different than man that way.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.080
The story starts out one day,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.750
and five days later it grows
tree branches and leaves.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.670
And, before you know it it's the
size of a mountain with caves

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.670
and rocks and you can't
see the top or the bottom

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.010
of the thing while
standing on top of it.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.400
But, Box told me this story his
self, and Box wasn't the type

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.920
to lie and this is
what Box told me.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.550
He was coming through
the jungle one day

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.100
and a hunter surprised
him, got the drop on him.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.310
Box walked right past
him, never smelled him

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.740
or sensed him, nothing.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.560
The man jumped out of a bush
from behind Box holding a spear

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.740
with dead lion scent
all over it.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.190
He had Box dead to rights.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.540
He had old Box cold.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.910
There was nothing Box could do.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.310
Box knew his big head was
going to hang from the wall

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.100
of that man's lair
for the rest of time,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.830
while the man apologized to
Box and all his relatives

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.180
for taking his life
and so forth.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.910
That's how the old-time
hunters did it.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.070
They put to the big sleep and
thank your relatives afterwards

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.100
by praying and so forth, so
your souls can live together

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.750
for the rest of time, while
he uses your claws as plates

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.310
for his smoking sticks
and so forth.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.310
There wasn't nothing Box could
do, so he said to his self,

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.880
"It is a good day to die," and
turned on the man and waited

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.750
to sleep, but this
man knew too much.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.930
Instead of throwing his
spear, when Box turned on him,

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.640
the man spoke to
Box in thoughtspeak

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.940
and you know what he said?

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.470
He said this, "I know it
ain't your 24th hour."

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.010
Well, that threw old Box.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.820
I don't know what
threw old Box more,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.610
man talking in thoughtspeak,
which is how animals speak,

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.300
or man speaking about
the 24th hour.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.850
Both had never happened to Box
before, but man spouting off

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.290
about that 24th hour
put the whole thing

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.590
in a different light.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.250
See, a lion won't sleep
but one hour a day.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.800
The other 23 hours we mostly
sleep or look for fun or sex.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.160
That's our game.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.680
Lions is higher orders which
is all animals call our self.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.420
It's mostly a pleasure trip
being a higher order, except one

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.500
or two rules you
got to stick to.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.350
Box old fashion soul that
he was, was just floored

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.830
by that whole business.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.490
He just didn't know what to do.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.850
First here a man throw
thoughtspeak around like that,

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.070
then him going on
about the 24th hour.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.880
Box got chickenhearted,
so he said, "Excuse me?"

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.430
"You heard me," the man
said in clear thoughtspeak,

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.490
"I know this ain't
your 24th hour.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.790
You know how I know?

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.510
I've been tracking you, Box.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.260
You're still in your 23 hours
of wandering around, sleeping,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.290
looking for water and
fun and girls, all that,

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.970
so I won't kill you, for I
don't want your head now.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.380
I want your head in the 24th
hour when you're hunting,

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.970
for I am a great chief
myself, and I'm looking

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.730
for something mighty like me.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.420
So, I'm going to let you live.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.470
I'm even going to suggest
a few things for you to do

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.900
in your three 23 hours, Box,
for I have traveled many places

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.650
and I know as many things,
and I can help you."

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.890
Then he padded Box on the
shoulder and turned him away.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.010
That's when Box jumped him.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.950
He knocked the man down, grabbed
the man's spear with his mouth

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.660
and stuck tooth in
down into the earth,

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.460
so the stick stood
up like a pole.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.050
Then he snatched him up in
his mouth and whipped the man

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.600
across the stick back and
forth, beating the man

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.610
with his own stick, beating
the stick with the man,

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.010
and when he was done, he threw
him down and tore him up,

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.240
ripped him up, ran a paw
across the man's face

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.970
and killed him dead, then he
ate him or a good part of him

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.850
and slept a good two
days without waking up.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.620
Many a day thought about Box
while sitting in this cage,

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.500
pacing back and forth
night and day, year in

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.630
and year out, thinking about it.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.110
That hunter did no
harm to Old Box.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.080
The man had him cold
and didn't kill him.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.740
He even offered to
school Box on how

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.530
to live good in his free time.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.810
Still, Old Box killed him.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.260
You know why?

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.850
He was insulted, see.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.090
If man had walked off and said
nothing, Box would've walked

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.390
on into the jungle and
gone about his business,

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.900
but man had to turn around
and tell a higher order,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.220
a grown lion, what
was in his head.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.800
Box didn't want that man to
find him and tell him who he was

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.020
and what all his plans was and
what Box was supposed to do

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.150
with his free 23 hours and how
man knew everything Box was

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.950
supposed to do in
his free 23 hours.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.290
That was Box's 23 hours
to do with as Box pleased,

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.870
and just as long as
man wasn't fooling

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.370
around that magic 24th hour,
that one hour when nothing

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.170
in the world is safe from a lion
who's got to eat, then, well,

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.290
he was all right,
but he threw himself

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.520
in Box's business
them other 23 hours,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.490
telling Box what he
could do with his time

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.970
and how he's supposed to
be sleeping and so forth.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.440
He was counting Box's 24th
hour like it was his own.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.160
Well, Box didn't like that.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.420
He figured if the man was so
big in his breaches to count

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.990
up his 24th hour, he
might want to tell him how

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.880
to count his 23 hours
and tell him what to do

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.290
with his 22nd hour, and
the 21st, and so forth.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.590
So, Box cleaned him up, beat him
with his own stick, and sent him

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.540
to the big nap, because he knew
it wouldn't be long before the

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.400
man told him what to do
with his one eating hour

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.700
and every other single hour.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.560
I asked Box later, "What
did man sound like?"

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.770
for I had never spoken to man.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.070
"You can't handle it."

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.170
he said. "What do
he taste like?"

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.050
I asked, for I had never
tasted man neither.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.010
He said, "Tastes like chicken."

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:45.510
So, that's the story
called Mr. P and the Wind.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:52.610
[ Applause ]

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.110
I'll just quickly summarize
the other stories for you

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.450
without reading them, unless you
want to hear some more reading.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.780
I'm not -- some audiences want
reading, some don't, you know.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.870
"The Underground
Railroad Box Car Set" is

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.280
about a toy collector,
and it's about a guy

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.710
who collects antique toys.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.960
He's a Jewish guy from New
York, and he's the most famous

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.140
and most well-known, most well
regarded toy collector ever.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.170
Like anyone who has toys,
who wants to sell their toys,

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.210
Softies, Christie's, they're
all scared of this guy.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.260
Leo Bankskoff is the
best at what he does.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.580
He's made a pretty good
living selling toys

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.380
and then he discovers that
there's a toy he finds

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.190
by accident, like the
Mona Lisa of toys,

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.160
and it's called the Underground
Railroad Box Car Set.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.330
It's a box car set that's
related to General Lee

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.840
and it's a story of underground
slavery and all this.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:55.050
But, it's the most valuable toy
train in the world, and he finds

00:14:55.050 --> 00:15:00.250
out that it still exists and the
guy who owns it is a preacher

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.380
from a little storefront
church in Queens.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.680
And, so Leo Bankskoff,
this great toy collector,

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.980
walks to the guy's house.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.440
He's got 90,000 dollars
in cash ready to drop it

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.080
on this poor preacher and
his Amazon wife and his kid.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.700
They live right at
Kennedy Airport.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.290
Planes are flying, like, planes
are turning in his yard, okay?

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.400
And, he offers this guy
oodles of money for this toy,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.060
and the guy, blows his mind,
says, "I don't want any money.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.130
Take it." And, what, you know,
"Just take it, take the toy."

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.480
First, he has to find the guy,
because he can't find, you know,

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.700
he's got prayer meeting here.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.140
He's doing the, you know,
willing workers here,

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.890
on Thursday preaching here,
he's in Newark on these --

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.800
and he's spreading
the Lord's Word,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:49.270
spreading the Lord Jesus -- so,
he finally convinces the guy

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.860
to sell the toy, and after he
convinces him to sell the toy,

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.300
and now Leo can retire
forever, but he can't take it.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.260
Why is this, you know, what this
is about, because the guy says,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.710
"I'll let you sell it, but you
can't tell my wife or my son."

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:07.240
And, he agrees, and then
he, just by accident,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.980
he finds out why,
and so you have

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.780
to read the story
to figure that out.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.160
[ Laughter ]

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.100
"The Five-Carat Soul Bottom
Bone Band" is a story of a band

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.910
of boys in a small town in
Pennsylvania called Uniontown.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.880
Uniontown is a little
town in Pennsylvania.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.490
For those of you who
don't know Pennsylvania,

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.870
it's in Western Pennsylvania
close to Morgantown

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.640
and Pittsburgh, and
my brother-in-law,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.520
who is a gastroenterologist, it
took me a long time to know how

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.550
to say that, but that's when you
go get your enema and all that.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:42.510
Whatever that is, he is the
guy, and he's very successful.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:43.810
He went to Howard.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.770
You know, he comes from a little
-- he always say, you know,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.760
"I came from this little
country town and, you know,

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.060
it's just two blocks long.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.860
Me and Vivian Stringer,
the basketball coach."

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.970
And, so he used to talk about
it all the time and how they go

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.840
to Uniontown and how
blacks and whites lived

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.650
in this town all together.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.020
Is that the ten-minute sign?

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:08.990
It was just -- well, anyway,
so I decided to create a story

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:14.140
in this town, because I like
working-class people whatever

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.610
that amorphous term means.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.280

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.620
in that Five-Carat
Soul Bottom Bone Band.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.520
The first one is about a kid
named Buck Boy who got shot,

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.180
who was shot and killed
robbing a Korean grocery store.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.710
The second one is "Ray
Ray's Picture Box" which is

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.240
about a little boy
who was mentally,

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.450
I don't know what you say,
mentally challenged who --

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.260
the kids convince to get a box

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.260
of his father's pornographic
pictures.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.820
And, they start selling
around the neighborhood,

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.680
and they really get in a lot
of trouble because of it.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:51.660
The next one is about Blub,
a kid named Blub, who gets --

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.310
he gets himself tied up in a --

00:17:54.310 --> 00:18:01.040
accidentally, gets tied
up in a horrible murder.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.650
And, "Goat" is about a little
boy who is the fastest kid

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.530
in this fictitious
neighborhood called the Bottom

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.750
in this town of Edenborough.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:16.090
And, so that's the Five-Carats
Soul Bottom Bone Band stories,

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.730
and then "The Moaning Bench"
is about five people who are

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.410
at the gates of hell,
and they're all

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.310
from all different
walks of life,

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.640
and the last of them is a boxer.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.850
And, you know, they're
dealing with the devil,

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.230
and the devil is just ruthless,
and he's just talking, you know,

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.310
he's just cracking
jokes on them, you know,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.080
makes fun of them, you
know, your teeth bad

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.360
and you have white cheese on
you, sucker and what, you know.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.090
And, he has to decide
whether they go to hell or not

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.810
and when he gets
to the fifth guy,

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.490
and he yanks him
right out of life.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.560
He just yanks wherever
they are, he pulls them

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.250
out like a little guy
got hit by a truck.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.060
So, they're just yanked out of

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.260
where they are on
the Moaning Bench.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.240
In the Baptist church, for those
of you who go to Baptist church,

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.890
they have -- nowadays,
they pull out a chair,

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.310
but in the old days they
would bring a moaning bench,

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.550
and when you accepted Jesus
Christ you sat, you know,

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.850
when someone would -- you know,

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.740
after the minister
delivers the sermon.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.040
Then they pass around the tray
and that's when those of us

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.340
who played in church would --

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.640
you better play something
pretty.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.110
And, when the music was playing,
they'd say does anybody want

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.370
to come, you know, is there one
and whoever came up would sit

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.680
on the moaning bench, and then
the elders and the deacons

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.280
and the deaconess and
the, well, you know,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.460
the willing workers
would pray over them.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.350
And, so this is called
the Moaning Bench

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.400
and these people are
sitting on this bench,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.810
when the devil is deciding
whether or not they should go

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.070
through the door or up to,
you know, with the other guy

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.560
who is a person who thinks
he knows what he's doing.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.890
So, when he gets to
the to the last guy,

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.430
he had yanked this boxer up,
who had gotten knocked down,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.410
knocked unconscious,
and so the boxer stands

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.710
up and says, "What?"

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.860
And, then they have
this back and forth,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.310
and so the boxer
tricks the devil

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.740
into boxing for their lives.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.110
So, this is all about this boxer
who tricks the devil into boxing

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.580
for his life and the lives
of the other four people.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.760
"The Christmas Dance" is based
on a true story of a judge

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.060
in New York that I used to know

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.600
and a Puerto Rican man
that was his friend.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.130
They were veterans of
WWII in the 92 Division.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.010
The man's name was
Florentino Lopez.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.490
He was a Puerto Rican,
and the judge's name was

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.790
Florentino Lopez.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.860
Those of you who saw "Miracle
at St. Anna" will remember,

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.070
the three of you who saw
it, that the protagonist,

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.250
the one who survives at the
end, is a black Puerto Rican

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:32.350
from New York, and
this is closer

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.480
to what really happened
to Florentino Lopez.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.360
Florentino Lopez and Skiz Watson
were involved in this fight

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.640
in the town of Sommocolonia,
Italy in which an American --

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.010
a group of black
soldiers were surrounded.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.290
During the Battle of the Bulge,
that wasn't the only place

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.790
where the Germans
attacked the Americans.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.730
They also, they had a
gigantic push in Italy as well,

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.090
and of course no one knows about
that, because it's, you know,

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.070
black history -- nothing in this
world happens unless white folks

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.560
says it does.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.840
So, but this battle in the town
of Sommocolonia was something

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.820
that Italians never forgot.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.740
And, there was a soldier who
was involved in that battle

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.650
who had to, who was, he
acted extremely heroically,

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.840
and he later on got
the Medal of Honor

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.440
from President Bill Clinton,
but the ones around him did not,

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.740
and so this is based on that.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.520
And, basically, what the
story is, is why these guys go

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.900
to this Christmas dance.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.840
Every year, these two guys,
this judge, who is a lame

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.850
and this old Puerto Rican,
who have nothing in common,

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.500
every year they go to
this Christmas dance,

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.000
and this is revealed
to a doctoral student

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.930
from Columbia University
who is trying to figure

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.120
out what this dance
is all about.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.800
And, the other two stories
are "The Fishman Angel" is

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:52.750
about a slave who meets an angel
who tells her that one day,

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.080
he tells this woman, "One
day you will be free,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.380
free and free indeed."

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.110
The language I used
I can't remember,

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.760
and that gets communicated
vis a vis the story

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.050
to Abraham Lincoln, and he
ends up dropping those terms

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.990
into his -- dropping
the exact phrase into --

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.020
was it Gettysburg Address?

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.110
I can't remember.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.740
You know, what's [inaudible]
the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.300
Somebody here went to
college, thank you very much.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.920
Thank you very much, and
then the other is one

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.220
of my favorites.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.940
It's called "Little
Abe", I think.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.630
It's about a little mixed
race boy who believes

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:39.480
that Abe Lincoln is his father,
and it's called "Father Abe",

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.730
and he's discovered
by some black soldiers

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.740
from the Union army who are

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.070
in Richmond right
after Richmond fell.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.180
And, it's just one
of my favorites,

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.200
because they don't know
what to do with this kid.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.530
He runs away and they find him,
and they don't know what to do

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.920
with him, and they
don't know what to do,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.720
because they're supposed
to be free.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.340
And, this kid starts asking
questions about freedom,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.470
and it's very, very,
very interesting,

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.460
and it's very pertinent to some

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.700
of the language that's
used now today.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.270
I don't really write books.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.540
I mean, you know, they put me in
the race and politics category,

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.630
but really, I belong
in the human category.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.530
I mean, you know, race and
politics will always be there.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.490
They're part of our lives and
they're part of what we have

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.110
to negotiate, but the fact of
the matter is all my books deal

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:28.440
with the commonality of
the human experience.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.480
You know, one of my --
I mean, I've had many --

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.880
I've done a lot, you know,
unfortunately, but I remember

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.930
when I did one of these events,
and I don't do this that much.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.530
I don't go out and talk anymore.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:44.740
I just finished the novel, so
I did, you know, I mean, I'm,

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.750
like, into, like, the fourth
draft or something and --

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.500
but, even if I -- I just don't
like to talk about this anymore.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.030
I think you should do it.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:59.070
You do, you don't talk, you
do, and, you know, for me,

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.690
what I do is I run a
little program at my church.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.500
I have 25 kids that
we train, you know,

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.120
to play piano and
drums and bass.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.200
We train them, like, real,
like they train us, you know,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.150
I'm training to get into
the Open Conservatory.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.450
I mean, they won't.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.470
Maybe one might, but
it doesn't matter.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.580
If they get into City College
of New York, that's I mean,

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.840
because the discipline of
music teaches you everything.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.350
It teaches you everything
you want to know

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.040
about being a writer,
because writing is the act

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.320
of continually failing
at something.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.720
There's always going to be
someone who writes better,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.840
who's faster, who's
clear, whose language is,

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.540
and there's always somebody
who's going to be smarter,

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.860
slimmer, blonder, heavier,
blacker or whiter than you,

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.150
but you can't be
you more than you.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.120
No one could be you
more than you.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:47.500
And, so, you know, all this talk
about, you know, all this talk

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.710
about this -- I remember
when I did an event one time

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.820
with Kurt Vonnegut, and this
lady raised her hand and said,

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.520
"Mr. Vonnegut, you writers
you've got the [inaudible]."

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.570
And, Kurt said, he said, "Miss,

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.990
we don't have the power
you think we have.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.720
It begins with you,
not with us."

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.930
And, I always remembered that,
because I feel that when you --

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.550
our job, as writers, is
to illuminate and try

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.550
to make people see that
we are all the same,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.850
but if they don't
want to see it,

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.660
it doesn't mean we
stop doing what we --

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.700
it should make us do it more.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.300
We live in a time now when
we all have the same wall

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.600
to push against.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.370
I mean, it used to be just black
people had the wall, because we,

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.890
you know, black New Yorkers
knew who Number 45 was.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.150
We were very familiar with
him, and now everyone knows.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.290
Okay, well, okay, it
doesn't matter what you knew

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.590
or what you did not know.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.840
It just matters what you do
now in your own little world.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.660
You know, when I was
writing the Color of Water,

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.180
after I finished writing it --

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.590
well, during the
time I was writing,

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.220
I was in Little Jimmy
Scott's band.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.990
Jimmy Scott is a singer.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.200
He's famous because he sounds
like a girl, like, you know,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.000
he sounds like Nancy Wilson.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.700
He never had a -- like his
thyroid never developed,

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.150
so he sounds like a girl.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.300
Well, he sounded like a
girl, when he was alive, and,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.560
you know something, we were
playing in Philly one time.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.980
I was in Jimmy's band, and
so, you know, we're playing,

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.930
and my brother Richie came,
and my brother Richie was like,

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.960
he was like the jazzman
of the family, you know?

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.540
Culture and Sonny Rowlands.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.080
So, after the set was over,
I went to Richie and said,

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.380
"Richie, what do you think, man?

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.680
What do you think of
the band, Richie?"

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.980
"You guys sound all right."

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.330
he said, "And, that
girl singing, she was--

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.060
" And, I said, "No, no.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.360
man. Jimmy is not a girl."

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.660
He said, "No, no, man.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.610
That is a girl.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:38.910
She's little.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.210
She got short hair.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.510
She's an Indian.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.810
That's a girl."

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.990
So, I said no.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.250
He said, "Well, have you ever
seen him go to the bathroom?"

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.580
And, I, you know, it
never occurred to me,

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.230
and I said, "Well, no."

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.820
But, we were leaving,
went to Boston the --

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.160
that night we left to go to
Boston and we were in a van,

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.680
you know, those vans
where you can --

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.940
there's, like, sit eight people,
and Jimmy was in the front seat.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.240
He said, "Pull over, baby.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.540
I got to go to the
bathroom, baby."

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.830
So, the guy, the driver,
pulled over and went to one

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.130
of those rest stops, you
know those rest stops

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.940
where they hand you the key
on a wooden block like this,

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.950
and you know you don't want to
touch that wooden, you know,

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.960
who had, you know,
they hand it to you.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.100
So, I say, "I got to the
bathroom too, Jimmy."

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.960
So, I went out, went
around to the side,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.200
and he went to the bathroom
and he closed the door on me,

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.940
slammed it in my face.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.060
So, I said, "Maybe it's
something to that."

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.530
Then when we were coming
back from Boston and we were

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.270
on a turnpike somewhere
and we went to one

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.750
of those bathrooms
where it was open.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.830
And, then I just -- just out
of curiosity, and I looked

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.160
and I realized, well, his
thyroid hadn't developed,

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.400
everything else was
very much in place.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:55.270
And ,I don't really know how I
got into telling you that story

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.230
but -- I know, I know.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:04.360
I was in Jimmy Scott's band
and we were flying to Montreal

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.670
to open for Rosemary
Clooney who was a jazz singer

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.120
who was very talented.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.580
You know, she sang with Duke
and all these great singers.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.070
So, we -- and what
happened was we were late,

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.720
because the plane couldn't land,
and while we were flying, like,

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.980
I wasn't telling anybody in
the band I was writing the book

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.280
about my Jewish mother.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.830
I didn't say anything
because this is just --

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.910
you don't bring your, you know,
you're playing in a group,

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.880
you're getting paid, you don't
bring your business to your job.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.500
So, I never -- but
I was, you know,

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.000
I was learning all
this history especially

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.770
about anti-Semitism
in the South.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.660
It was just disturbing,
you know,

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.420
and there was a little
Hasidic Jewish boy sitting

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.780
across the aisle from me, and
when the plane was circling,

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.330
they decided to feed us, and
they tried to give some --

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:44.630
I said, Well, don't
give him any.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:45.930
He's not going to eat.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.230
Just give him, you know,
give him some water,"

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.870
and so they gave him a glass
of water, because, you know,

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.140
he had the little pious
little braids and the yamaka

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.570
so they gave him the water,
and the kid took the water,

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:54.870
and I was grinning at the kid.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.670
He did one of these, look.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.670
[ Laughter ]

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.970
You know, he was smart.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.080
His mother taught him don't
talk to strangers, you know,

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.700
which is what my mother told
-- so, anyway, we got to --

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.920
one of the guys in the band made
a crack about the kid, you know,

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.030
while we were flying, and we got
into an argument, me and him.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.330
It was bad.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.630
You know, when you're
traveling with somebody,

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.620
you're sick of them anyway,
and so the bass player

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.920
who was the straw boss

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.220
of the band was sitting
right next to me.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.200
He's the guy who hires
everybody in the band.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.500
His name was Hill Green
[assumed spelling],

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.800
and Hill didn't say a word.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.890
He just looked grim, and
so we got to the event.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.170
We were supposed to change
into tuxes, but we were so late

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:36.140
that we just did the soundcheck
in our street clothes.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.530
We were just -- and
people were coming in

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.470
and we were doing a soundcheck,
and Hill was back there leaning,

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.770
he was playing his bass.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.070
He was behind me.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.330
I was in front, you know, I
was playing tenor in the front,

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.590
and Hill leaned over to me and
said, "You know what, James?"

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.580
he said, "That joke, that
wasn't funny to me neither."

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.370
And, he went back and he kept
warming up, and I'm saying

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:58.890
that to tell you that it's easy
to talk, but when you live it,

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.040
you inch the world for
just that much more,

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.890
and that's really
why we read books.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.520
We read books to edge the evil

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.930
out of our lives just a
little bit, every day,

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.450
just a little at a time.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.700
I'm not asking you to
sacrifice your mortgage,

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.590
but if you send ten dollars
to somebody who's running

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.190
for Congress who you believe
in, that's a good thing.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.690
You don't have to beat
someone over the hip

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.960
because you don't agree
with them politically.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.260
That's not the way.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.400
You just move to the right,
move to the right way,

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.920
whatever way is right.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.140
You know, hating on
people and one-upping

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.110
and putting comedy
shows and making fun

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.870
of people, it doesn't help.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.170
It doesn't help.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.470
People watch what you do.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.160
The kids in my housing project
where I work, in the same church

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.280
that my mother started 65 years
ago, they don't know anything

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.970
about who the president is.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:49.790
They don't care, but they
deal with despair and hatred

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:54.410
and disaster with so much
grace and so much kindness

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.760
and their parents, too, that it
just says, it just says to me,

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.940
you know, you just have
to keep living good.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.550
You have to live better,
and so that's what gets me

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.850
out of bed in the morning.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:09.740
Now, about my mother, my mother
died in 2010, January Ninth.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.230
She died at home in bed.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.240
My brother was in Puerto
Rico on his honeymoon,

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.840
and my mother waited for him
to get home and then she died.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.500
I mean, at one point
she said, "Am I dying?"

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.510
and, you know, it was the most
difficult thing in the world

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.040
to say, "Yes," you know.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.340
So, what I did was,
I said, "Well,

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.640
you know, Jesus is waiting.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.940
He's coming.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.240
He's waiting for you
on the other side."

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.030
You know, Jesus, you
know, she was a real --

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:41.430
the same religious fervor that
she had as a Jewish person,

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.760
she just transferred
it to Christianity.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:50.790
So, she was very religious, and
she, you know, she just held God

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.290
in whatever form
he happened to be.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.590
Now, I mean, you
might get up there,

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.430
you might find Rudy
Giuliani is running the show,

00:31:55.430 --> 00:32:00.110
you never know, but whatever she
saw, she came to it peacefully.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:05.210
And, it was an honor to be
raised by someone who was

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.610
so good and so kind
and so generous.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:13.180
And, yes, of course, you know,
I'm a little more partial

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.120
to Jewish people than I might
be to, you know, I don't know,

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.610
Irish Catholics but not really.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.500
You know, I mean, what
difference does it make.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.320
Really, what difference
does it make?

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.280
So, in any case, that book
came out, and the only people

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.670
who read it in the
early days, really,

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:35.010
were young Jewish women
aged 20 to 80, honestly.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.620
And, you haven't lived until
you've been to a coffee klatch

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.930
in [inaudible] New
Jersey or something.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.810
"Let's check his teeth, wait a
minute, okay, it's all right."

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.360
It is okay, you know.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.350
And, then, you know, gradually,
mothers came around to it

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.230
and then last but not least
here come the black readers.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:56.530
They find, you know,
black women,

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:59.580
thank God that black
women read books.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.880
Most of my friends have not,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.120
my black men friends have
not read many of my books

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.130
and that's not because
they're bad.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.380
It's just because they like
Dallas Cowboys, which I --

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:13.020
who cares, you know, really.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.550
So, and then, and as a result

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.760
of that being successful I've
been kind of like the poster boy

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.710
for the mixed race
-- I mean, that's --

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.280
but see, I never really
accepted that role,

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.000
because I don't really care.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.600
We're all mixed.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.900
What difference does it make?

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.950
They call Barack Obama
the first black president.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.370
No, he's just, he was
just a great president.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:35.780
You know, I don't get
-- words, you know,

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.750
[applause] he was
a such a good man.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.050
He was so smart.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.720
He tried so hard.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.500
You know, he was willing to
forgive, he never struck back.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.480
He had such class and dignity.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.160
If your daughter brought home
a son like that, you say,

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:53.120
"If you don't marry,
I'm going to kill you."

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.900
So, I mean, it's good that
people need to do that,

00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:00.540
you know, but I don't think, I
think you politicize and gender,

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.340
and when you politicize
race and gender

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.230
and religion, you
make a mistake.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.570
You have to humanize
it however you can,

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.470
and if people don't
accept it, so what.

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.970
It doesn't matter, and then "The
Good Lord Bird" really resulted

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:17.170
in -- I wanted to write a
book about Abraham Lincoln.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.990
But, when I read Carl
Sandburg's books on him,

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:23.390
I was like forget it man,
because think Carl's --

00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:27.360
so, I ended up writing
"Song Yet Sung",

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.080
which was about the underground
railroad, and then I came

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.040
to the John Brown
story while doing that,

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.340
and I went to Harpers Ferry.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.000
I spent a lot of time on Harpers
Ferry, and I was fascinated

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.940
with John Brown, but I
wanted to do it in a way

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.570
that was really funny,

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:44.120
and so that's why Good
Lord Bird is a funny book.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.300
I must've read about 25 books
when I wrote the Good Lord Bird,

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.710
and my next book, which is not
out yet but next year, is --

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.510
it's going to be about
-- it's funny as well.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.860
It's about an old man, an old
quirky old man in the projects

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.000
who shoots like the most
ruthless drug dealer

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.300
in the project.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.670
And, it's all about the projects
and the people who live there,

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.890
and it humanizes a part of that
world that most of us only see

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.770
from behind the wheel
of a locked car.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:11.700
And, part of the reason why I
wrote that is that most of us,

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.100
when we write past
a housing project,

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.620
you know, we see "The Wire".

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.100
We see David Simon's version of
it, and David Simon is talented.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.400
I worked with him.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.040
He's a very talented person, and
I have no disrespect for him,

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.810
but there's another side
of poverty and hardship

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.550
and urban life that
most people don't see.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.460
The people who work, the
people who, you know,

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.080
have second cousins who pull
out their teeth at Christmas

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.380
and go [cracking noise].

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.460
You know, there's a
whole world of humanity

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.140
that most people don't see,
and it's been my privilege

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.810
to see this in the
last six years

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.950
that I've been running
this program in Red Hook.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.320
You know, I see people that I
knew grow up, some of them die,

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.340
and the dignity and the humor
and the joy of it and, you know,

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.610
it's just been a,
it's been wonderful.

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.020
Anyway, I got the
15-minute-queue

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.450
which means it's
time for questions.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:04.210
So, you came a long way
to come and, you know,

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:08.240
if you want to ask a question,
just go right ahead, you know?

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.260
Just step to the mic and--

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.710
&gt;&gt; Can you hear me?

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.010
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Yes.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.070
&gt;&gt; So, I just wanted
to share with you

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.130
that I had Five-Carat Soul from
the library and the audiobook,

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.430
but I didn't get to it.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:23.750
I had to return it, so
I haven't read it yet,

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.570
but I read the James Brown
book in audio and before

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:29.630
that I read the Good
Lord Bird in audio.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.890
And, I just want to know
what you think of the fact

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.420
that my full exposure
to your work has been

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.720
through audiobooks.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.150
Are you in, are you -- I don't
know if I'm alone in that.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.180
I just wonder if you're involved
with it, because there's got

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.480
to be other people like me.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.780
We come to your books.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.150
It's kind of a mediated format.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.260
It's not -- you didn't
read, I don't think,

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.560
any of the audiobooks.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.860
&gt;&gt; James McBride: No, I didn't.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.160
I didn't read any of them.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.460
I don't mind it.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.760
I listen to audiobooks myself.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.960
I'm reading -- right now, I'm
listening to Shriver Laurence,

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:06.970
Lionel Shriver's book
"Property", and I'm enjoying it.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:08.270
So, I don't mind.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.570
I mean, I don't want
to read my books.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:13.600
I just feel like, you know,
I'm just not qualified.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.900
I just can't do it, you know?

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.500
Once I finish a book, I never
have -- I had to reread this,

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.610
as I was coming here, to
figure out what happened.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.120
I swear to god, I've given
readings, fiction readings --

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.990
I gave a reading one
time I told the lady --

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:30.330
the lady stood and she said,
"Why did you let her die?"

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:31.980
I was like, "She did not die."

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.790
And, the lady went like
this, "Right here, she died."

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.580
Okay.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.070
[ Laughter ]

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.560
But, you have to remember
when you're writing fiction,

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.740
you know, fiction,
you don't really know,

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.580
you don't know what's
going to happen.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.030
You just, you know,
it's in the air.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.450
It's in the air and you ride
it, you know, and then it comes

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:54.460
to -- it just, it
settles where it settles

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.390
and then you get out, you leave.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.660
You close the door, you thank
the people, you tip the waiters

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.300
and waitresses and you get out.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.400
So, I just couldn't remember,
and that's really, you know,

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.700
that's really -- but in terms

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.990
of the actual audio
experience I don't mind it.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:12.840
I mean, I would like
one day to do a book

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.760
where I would provide the
music and the sung lyric

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.060
and you sing it through.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.510
I've tried it, you know, in the
case of one piece that exists.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.500
I haven't published it
yet, because nobody,

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.080
no publisher is interested.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.040
You know, they just
believe in music or book.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.340
They don't -- there's no --

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.930
they don't believe that
you can combine them.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.230
I know you can.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.120
I mean, it's called opera, but
I don't really call it that.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:39.650
I call it bopera, you know, it's
a way of combining good music

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:44.000
with good story, because
in any show that you see,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.300
if the book doesn't work,

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.940
it doesn't matter how
good the music is.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.680
So many good music songs come

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.650
from Broadway shows
that are gone.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.160
The books carry the show.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.820
I mean, I used to
do musical theater.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.580
You know, I used to know,
I know Stephen Schwartz,

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.680
all those guys, you know,
when I was young and had hair,

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.270
you know, and wasn't afraid
to be broke, you know.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:06.330
It was great, but anyway,
did I answer your question?

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you have
no involvement?

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.230
Like, you haven't
listened to one of them

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.720
and gone this guy screwed
up the way he read my book

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.750
or I wish I had done it
or anything like that.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:21.450
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Well,
I listened to this one,

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:25.090
Five-Carat Soul, and they
had different people reading.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:29.200
I liked the guy who read
The Christmas Dance,

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.890
Dominik something.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.040
He was my favorite.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.190
I can't remember his name.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.920
All of these actors
are very talented,

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.220
but it doesn't matter to me.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.880
I'm not that picky about --
as long as the person is clear

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.180
and has, you know --

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.850
like I heard this actor reading
"The Old Man and the Sea",

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:51.180
Donald Sutherland read or --
and I just, I was fascinated,

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.840
because he talks with the
lisps, so everything --

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.510
and then I just thought
I'd focus on.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:58.980
So, I couldn't listen to it,

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.590
because it just started
messing with my mind.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.900
I was like, you know.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.250
So, that's a book
I couldn't listen,

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.420
because I know his
work, and he's great.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.930
He's a great actor, you know,

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.780
but then I just kept
thinking about that.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.580
So--

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.240
[ Laughter ]

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.260
If Donald Sutherland has
any friends in the audience,

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.760
just tell him I,
honest to Jesus,

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.160
he's a good, he's a great actor.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.090
I just -- it's not him.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:30.370
I did listen to a "Moby
Dick" one on tape,

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.430
and that was wonderful man.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.300
The last three chapters of
Moby Dick are the most exciting

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.600
chapters of fiction writing
that I personally can think of.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.230
You have a question there?

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:45.570
&gt;&gt; I do. The Good Lord
Bird, which was magnificent,

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.480
I truly enjoyed it, but the
character, the little boy,

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.710
who's in the book, how
did you develop him

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.990
and where did you get
your idea for him,

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.580
because he was captivating?

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.530
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Well,
actually what I wanted

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.460
to do was I wanted
him to be a girl,

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.660
but I didn't feel confident
enough to write about a girl,

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.590
to write from a girl's
perspective.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.790
And, so I said, "Well,
how can I do this?"

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:14.090
So, I just decided to make him
a boy and this would be good,

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:18.040
but then when I decided to
make him a boy, he just started

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.080
to really create himself.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:25.870
Now, you should know that when
I read earlier from the Mr. P

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.060
and the Wind about the lion,
that's when the language

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.960
of The Good Lord Bird
began, because you'll notice

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:40.110
that in the language of Mr.
P and the Wind, "I'm a lion.

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:41.410
I live in a zoo.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:44.160
But I was once a free
lion and never forgot it."

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.910
It looked to the similarity
of The Good Lord Bird.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.310
I can't remember how it
begins, but I was once a slave

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:54.340
and something and --
but also the language

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.000
of the South was really crucial
to making that character to work

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.770
and that took a long
time to develop.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:03.740
That started with that short
story, and for those of you

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.400
who are young writers, I
mean, not in age but young

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.430
in experience, oftentimes
your failures teach you things

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.310
that can help you later on,
if you're wise enough to hang

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:15.500
on to them and not throw
them in the garbage.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.790
So, that boy just -- and
then I just read lots

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:21.280
of slave narratives,
and then after a while,

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.640
he came to life, you know?

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.940
Does that answer your question?

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.240
&gt;&gt; Well, it does, yeah.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.870
He's just -- you just need
to know he's unforgettable.

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.170
You gave life

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:32.540
to an unforgettable
character, in my mind anyway.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.110
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Well,
I mean the innocence

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:38.320
of children is a really
effective literary tool

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.230
if it's not overused, and
part of the reason why

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.440
that character works
for you, thank you,

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.420
is because he's an
old man talking

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.890
about the innocence
of his childhood.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:52.670
So, he could talk like an old --
dirty old man but still recall

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.070
when he wasn't, not dirty
old man but just, you know.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:57.370
&gt;&gt; I got it.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:58.670
I got it.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:59.970
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Not a
dirty old man, you know.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:01.270
Yes, Sir?

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:05.350
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just wanted to tell
you, you are a treasure,

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:10.490
and I'm Jewish, and I love
jazz and am a teacher.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:14.370
And, when I was listening
to the story about the lion,

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:17.970
I could see that story
being told to kids

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.260
and then really learning
something from.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.960
The problem now is the language
and the limitations that are put

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.510
on you as a -- when
you're working with kids.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.430
You can't, they can use the
language, but you can't,

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:41.570
and I -- the basic question is
how do you compare your jazz

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.900
love to your writing?

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.330
Where does that fall in?

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.150
&gt;&gt; James McBride:
Well, the short answer

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:50.190
to your question is I actually
wrote this wrote this story

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:54.960
for kids, but nobody
wanted it back then.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.260
Shall I name them?

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:00.030
I shall not, but, you know.

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.700
What I use music for is I use
music to teach me structure,

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.210
because music requires
that you, you know,

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.200
at least jazz music
requires that you lay

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.920
out certain light points that
you have to hit as a soloist

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.850
and as an instrumentalist.

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:18.130
And, then I just, and then I'm
free within, you know, from one,

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.280
moving from one point to the
next, and that helps me --

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.420
it helps me create structure,
and once I know the structure

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:29.170
in my mind, then I can
go to it as a writer.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:32.480
And, also story structure
comes in, an enormous amount

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.050
of it comes out of character.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:35.350
I write character bios.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:36.650
I do an enormous work

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.150
on my characters before I
write, before I do anything.

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:40.700
Now, with the lion
story I didn't,

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.530
because that was
just pure emotion.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:45.710
It was based on my, just,

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.580
disgust with seeing these
beautiful creatures locked

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.650
in these cages, and that was
just, you know, sometimes,

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.920
every once in a while,
not a lot, but every once

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.350
in a while, the thing happens.

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.090
But, normally -- and for kids,
by the way, with my kids,

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.400
the kids who come to my program,
I don't allow cellphones,

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.760
and if I see a cellphone, I take
it and I put it in my pocket.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.710
I mean, what we really
have to do with kids,

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.360
and I have enormous
-- first of all,

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:16.970
we don't pay teachers enough,
teachers and cops and firemen,

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:20.110
they just don't, you know,
it's just ridiculous.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:21.410
I sense a schoolteacher
or two here.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.710
I do it, I feel it.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.400
No, but we don't pay them
enough and part of the reason

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:29.600
that that job is so difficult
is because kids can't focus,

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.030
and they can't focus,
because they're looking

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.760
at that cellphone all day.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:36.090
You got to, you know, we
have to monitor the behavior.

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.190
Anyway, we have time
for one more --

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:39.490
did I answer your question?

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:40.790
All right, thank you.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:42.370
One more question, and then
we only have two minutes

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:45.350
and then the next
group comes in.

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:46.650
Go ahead, yeah.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:48.180
Is this -- I'm sorry.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.760
Go ahead. I'll answer both
very quickly if you just--

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.060
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.050
I've been in a book
club for 23 years,

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.760
and of our first books we
ever read was, you know,

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.470
The Color of Water, and
whenever I get a chance,

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:01.850
I pick one of your books,

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.510
and next month we're
doing Five-Carat Soul.

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:12.500
So, my question is what should I
tell my gang what you personally

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.350
would like to share with
us about writing the book

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:18.510
and what you haven't
shared with other people?

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:23.240
[ Laughter ]

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.190
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Now, that's
a book club I want to go.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:28.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We're having lunch

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:35.500
at the Stratford
Hall on October 13th.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.960
&gt;&gt; James McBride:
No, that would be --

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:43.950
we've got to build that wall.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.250
That's all there's to it.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:50.360
We've got to build that wall
and keep them out and all right.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.700
Well, I had a hard time figuring
out the order of the stories,

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:59.280
and I had a really hard time
putting together the Christmas

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.870
Dance, because that book,

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.600
that story is really,
really disjointed.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.980
It's really structured in a way

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.710
that took an enormous
amount of work.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:11.170
You can tell them that,
and it's all true.

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:12.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:13.770
&gt;&gt; James McBride:
All right, last one.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:15.970
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what's your
experience been creating

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:17.270
in different art forms?

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.050
So, I was trained as, I've been
trained as an opera singer,

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:23.590
and that's taken a lot of --
just a lot of effort and focus

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:27.510
on that field, but I want to
do so much more artistically.

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:28.910
&gt;&gt; James McBride: Okay,
that's a good question.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:32.460
Well, I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:35.510
The amount of discipline
required to hone

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:39.870
that great instrument that
you have, you have to start

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:43.230
to just translate, just push
that into something else

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:48.340
that gives you some
creative umph.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:53.810
Most musicians like yourself
don't realize how well they

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.110
can write.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:58.800
Musicians, opera singers,
classical players,

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.850
jazz player as well,
they're so faithful

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.340
to what the creator has
done that a lot of --

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.540
and training to recreate what
has been done so magnificently,

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.530
they shut off the valve
to their own creativity,

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.820
and there was a very interesting
article about Ethan Hawke today

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.450
in the Times, and I know Ethan.

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:19.320
Yeah, me and Ethan we
just kick it, you know?

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.620
We grooving and grooving.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.950
No, he's making The Good
Lord Bird into a tv series.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.030
It's funny, he came to the
church, and when he came

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.170
to the church -- because I
said, "I'm not going over.

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.860
I'm at the church down the
street from you, come on over."

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.140
He came to the church and
he walked in the door,

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.100
and one of the ladies
said, "Are you here

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.240
to fix the air conditioner?"

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:42.810
But, the reason why I
bring that up is that --

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.110
and he was cool about.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:48.470
He was good, but the
reason I bring that up is

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.350
that you spend years training
this instrument of yours

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:55.530
to do this, you know, this
wonderful thing without knowing

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.400
that while you are
singing [inaudible]

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:01.780
or whatever it is you're saying
that you're tightening the valve

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.950
to your own creativity,
so that a mistake

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:07.840
in that is actually the
beginning of a melody here.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.300
And, so you have to kind of
figure out where in that,

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:15.190
in your genre where
your strengths are.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:18.190
Are they in the storytelling
side or on the music side?

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:19.930
Probably a bit of both.

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.090
So, if I were you I
would just take a --

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:23.390
if not take a writing class,

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:27.010
take a creative writing
situation for yourself

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.000
that forces you to study the
works of some of these great,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.290
you know, some of these
great librettists,

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.540
so that you would say,
"Why does this work?"

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.980
And, then just read something
like, you know, read something

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.750
like -- like "Bird by
Bird" by Alice Monroe

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:43.410
and Richard Key's
book on screenwriting,

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.980
stuff that just gives you
technical things to think about.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.310
The thing is that
you don't need --

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:52.510
you don't need talent,
you just need skill.

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.870
You have the talent, so
you have to find the skill,

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:59.390
and if you can sing opera, if
you can sing classical music,

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:01.240
you certainly can write a book.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.020
And, on that note,
thank you very much.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.510
Thanks for coming out.

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:09.400
