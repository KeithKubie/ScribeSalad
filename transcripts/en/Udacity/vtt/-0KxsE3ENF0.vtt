Classes have features. By that we mean its attributes, and its, its operations.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.960
While classes, really describe the real world, that is,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.800
the problem that you're solving, features are something that are going to end up

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.208
inside the computer. Obviously, your attributes are going to translate,

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:26.820
into instance variables in your object oriented programing language. And

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.390
your operations are going to be translated into methods.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.350
We're going to look a little bit at the attributes and the operations.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.530
But, in general. In addition to the names of the attributes and operations,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.090
we are going to have some type of information. And possibly also some, some

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.170
names for the attributes so that they can be referred to in, in, in your models.
