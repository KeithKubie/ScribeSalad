I think first and foremost we have to
come to terms of the fact that because

come to terms of the fact that because
 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.370
come to terms of the fact that because
we don't have a blood test and because

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380
we don't have a blood test and because
 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.289
we don't have a blood test and because
it's hard to see why someone may have a

we might shun them We certainly have
 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.220
we might shun them We certainly have
some kind of sympathy for them yet when

to be able to get control of her somehow
 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.640
to be able to get control of her somehow
it must be her poor management skills

it must be her poor management skills

unfortunately the public is always very

unfortunately the public is always very

unfortunately the public is always very
very far behind the real science so for

very far behind the real science so for

instance you know Sigmund and Anna Freud

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089
instance you know Sigmund and Anna Freud
 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.969
instance you know Sigmund and Anna Freud
believed that almost all psychiatric

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979
believed that almost all psychiatric
 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.160
believed that almost all psychiatric
illness was caused by something your mom

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170
illness was caused by something your mom
 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.720
illness was caused by something your mom
and dad did whether they did it on

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730
and dad did whether they did it on
 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.800

purpose or not didn't make a difference

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810
purpose or not didn't make a difference
 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.960
purpose or not didn't make a difference
but somehow there was a traumatic event

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970
but somehow there was a traumatic event
 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.140
but somehow there was a traumatic event
that changed the trajectory of your

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150
that changed the trajectory of your
 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.690
that changed the trajectory of your
lives and therefore you needed a

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700
lives and therefore you needed a
 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.390
lives and therefore you needed a
therapeutic experience that you could

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400
therapeutic experience that you could
 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.680
therapeutic experience that you could
get unconsciously with your

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690
get unconsciously with your
 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.210
get unconsciously with your
psychoanalyst and between you and it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220
psychoanalyst and between you and it
 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.620
psychoanalyst and between you and it
could take a very long period of time

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630
could take a very long period of time
 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.230
could take a very long period of time
and those symptoms would disappear and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240
and those symptoms would disappear and
 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.399
and those symptoms would disappear and
it didn't make a difference if the

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409
it didn't make a difference if the
 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.719
it didn't make a difference if the
symptoms were inattention hyperactivity

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729
symptoms were inattention hyperactivity
 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.880
symptoms were inattention hyperactivity
or whether it was sadness and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890
or whether it was sadness and
 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.420
or whether it was sadness and
irritability or anxiety and worry so the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430
irritability or anxiety and worry so the
 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.969
irritability or anxiety and worry so the
public still believes very much that

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979
public still believes very much that
 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.120
public still believes very much that
these are not as real and are

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130
these are not as real and are
 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.490
these are not as real and are
unfortunately they haven't grasped the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500
unfortunately they haven't grasped the
 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.230
unfortunately they haven't grasped the
fact that we know they're know these are

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240
fact that we know they're know these are
 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.480
fact that we know they're know these are
no-fault brain disorders with very

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490
no-fault brain disorders with very
 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.570
no-fault brain disorders with very
strong genetic influences and how do we

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580
strong genetic influences and how do we
 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.910
strong genetic influences and how do we
know that the genetic and there's lots

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920
know that the genetic and there's lots
 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.820
know that the genetic and there's lots
of evidence so that if I have ADHD and I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830
of evidence so that if I have ADHD and I
 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.399
of evidence so that if I have ADHD and I
have a twin brother who's identical

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409
have a twin brother who's identical
 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.649
have a twin brother who's identical
which means we share identical genetic

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659
which means we share identical genetic
 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.950
which means we share identical genetic
material there's a 99% chance that he

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960
material there's a 99% chance that he
 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.850
material there's a 99% chance that he
will have ADHD and if I have a fraternal

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860
will have ADHD and if I have a fraternal
 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.460
will have ADHD and if I have a fraternal
twin brother what did the channel

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470
twin brother what did the channel
 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.960
twin brother what did the channel
fraternal twin brother

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970
fraternal twin brother
 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.940
fraternal twin brother
sister we share the same amount of

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
sister we share the same amount of
 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.220
sister we share the same amount of
genetic material as any set of siblings

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230
genetic material as any set of siblings
 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.970
genetic material as any set of siblings
and therefore if I have ADHD he has

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980
and therefore if I have ADHD he has
 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.480
and therefore if I have ADHD he has
about a 70% chance of having ADHD so

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490
about a 70% chance of having ADHD so
 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.730
about a 70% chance of having ADHD so
quite clearly there's a very strong

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740
quite clearly there's a very strong
 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.440
quite clearly there's a very strong
genetic component the other way we look

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450
genetic component the other way we look
 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.070
genetic component the other way we look
at is adoption studies so if I have ADHD

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080
at is adoption studies so if I have ADHD
 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.800
at is adoption studies so if I have ADHD
and I produce a child that is put up for

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810
and I produce a child that is put up for
 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.990
and I produce a child that is put up for
adoption that child will have the same

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000
adoption that child will have the same
 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.570
adoption that child will have the same
risk of having ADHD whether he grew up

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580
risk of having ADHD whether he grew up
 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.770
risk of having ADHD whether he grew up
my house or not

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
my house or not
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.500
my house or not
he will have nothing to do with the risk

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
he will have nothing to do with the risk
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.810
he will have nothing to do with the risk
that his adoptive father brings to the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820
that his adoptive father brings to the
 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.170
that his adoptive father brings to the
table and his parenting style so we know

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180
table and his parenting style so we know
 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.830
table and his parenting style so we know
that genetic influences affect whether

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840
that genetic influences affect whether
 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.660
that genetic influences affect whether
or not you get these illnesses and by

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670
or not you get these illnesses and by
 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.460
or not you get these illnesses and by
those genetic influences will affect

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470
those genetic influences will affect
 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.710
those genetic influences will affect
brain structure and will affect brain

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720
brain structure and will affect brain
 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.710
brain structure and will affect brain
functioning and therefore put you at

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720
functioning and therefore put you at
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.410
functioning and therefore put you at
risk for her psychiatric illness
