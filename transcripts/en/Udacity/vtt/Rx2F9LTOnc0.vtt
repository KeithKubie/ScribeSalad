00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.480
So ALDH2 is the main regulator of the alcohol flush reaction. Let's learn a bit

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.850
more about how its turned from gene into protein. The ALDH2 gene is located on

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.290
chromosome 12 on the human genome. Chromosome

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.500
12 has about 143 million base pairs and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.470
ALDH2 is about three quarters down the length

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.700
of the chromosome. The gene itself has 13

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.940
exons, spanning over 40,000 base pairs of DNA. After transcription

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.750
and splicing, the mRNA has 1554 nucleotides of coding

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.880
region between the start and stop codons. And after translation, there's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.926
a protein with 517 amino acids. There's one

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:50.950
allele of ALDH2 that's known to associate with a severe alcohol flush

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.900
reaction and it's shown right here. What I want

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.650
you to do is use the genetic code that we

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.690
learned about in lesson three and that you can find

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.390
in the instructors notes on this page. To determine the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.930
expected amino acid change in the sequence, and then select

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.460
the type of mutation that best describes the A allele

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.330
from the list below. Remember, if you have trouble answering

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.540
this, you should probably review some material from lesson six.
