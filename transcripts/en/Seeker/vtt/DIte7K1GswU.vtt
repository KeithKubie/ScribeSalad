00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.690
- There's a saying that EOD techs,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.030
we're a jack of all trades, but
we are masters of demolition.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.300
Blowing stuff up... that's
the crème de la crème

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.330
of being an EOD tech.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.460
- There are
likely over 100 million

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.250
unexploded bombs scattered
across the globe.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.040
Every day, U.S. Air Force members

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.800
are putting themselves in harm's way,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.470
working to disarm, disable,
and dismantle them.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.970
- Absolutely it's a scary mission.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.870
These devices can explode at any time.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.890
The service men and
women who use our robots

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.940
are always putting their life on the line.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.110
- Every single step you're thinking,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.570
'is there something else I could be doing?

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.400
Is there something else that I should do?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.500
Is this the best choice?'

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.020
- These bombs
could explode at any moment,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.088
hurting or killing anyone around.

00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:50.990
- The only thing the suit's gonna do

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.090
is just keep the pieces together.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.480
Start remote, stay remote is one

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.930
of our big mantras.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.350
- At Endeavor Robotics,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.300
they build robots that allow service men

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.960
and women to do just that.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.590
Their bots let military personnel

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.510
dismantle bombs remotely instead of

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.890
having to go in themselves.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.260
- We wanna remove folks from harm's way.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.950
We take this job very seriously

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.470
as robot designers and as human beings

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.875
to make sure that we're
really helping personnel

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.460
avoid those dangerous situations.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.170
- The robot goes down range to interact

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.380
with the device and the
operator can do that

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.873
from a safe distance away.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.380
We want to give them the
best technology that we can,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.030
the most cutting edge technology.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.330
- Our robots are equipped
with a manipulator

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.200
that allows the operator
to interrogate the device

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.740
and move it, open it up and look inside.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.060
- It's a lot of fun, honestly.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.410
You get to drive around this robot

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.820
and go do all kinds of cool stuff.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.300
- If a robot is equipped with a disruptor

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.460
than it's able to fire the disruptor

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.170
and neutralize the device.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.740
It can shoot out a water shot

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.920
and destroy the suspicious object.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.490
- Our robots contain a variety
of different technology.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.600
They're packed with computers

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.730
that can run sophisticated algorithms

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.160
so that they can navigate autonomously.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.330
They can build their own maps,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.470
they can do object recognition
through their cameras.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.750
They can detect radiation and toxic gases.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.960
- These robots
are incredibly high-tech,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.773
but it wasn't always this way.

00:02:16.773 --> 00:02:19.391
- When we started out we had a 700 pound,

00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:20.224
it looked like a tank,

00:02:20.224 --> 00:02:22.380
rumbling down the road to where as now

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.580
we have robots that are small enough

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.683
we can throw in a backpack and just go.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.330
- Our FirstLook robot is a
five pound throwable robot

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.790
so you can imagine a scenario

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.850
where we've got troops
coming up to a structure.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.510
Well, we don't know
what's in that structure

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.910
and we wanna avoid putting our service men

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.020
and women in harm's way.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.200
We do that by just throwing the FirstLook

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.960
through a window or an opening

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.800
and the letting the robot be the first set

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.610
of eyes inside the building.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.300
- Small robots
serve their purpose

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.540
but sometimes bigger
robots are the only way

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.663
to get the job done.

00:02:55.488 --> 00:02:57.190
- Every situation's a
little bit different.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.050
Sometimes you need a big robot

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.330
to go interrogate a
vehicle because you think

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.350
there might be a vehicle-based IED.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.850
Is that car laden with explosives?

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.320
You might have to tear open the trunk.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.710
You might have to smash through the window

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.660
or tear open the door to figure out

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.363
if in fact that car was a threat.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.500
- Whether
they're five or 500 pounds,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.780
robots of all sizes are crucial
players in military tactics.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.060
- Robots can never replace a person.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.870
The robots will really allow personnel

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.387
to focus on their jobs, allow removing

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:33.025
the really dull, dirty, and dangerous jobs

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:34.890
and letting the robots do that.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.273
- It's not just your
life that depends on it,

00:03:36.273 --> 00:03:39.550
it's the life of your
brother standing next to you.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.970
- It's absolutely critical that we employ

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.600
the best technology, the
best robotic technology

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.090
to keep our Air Force personnel safe.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.520
Handling dangerous devices

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.780
and this is the type of technology

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.460
that can keep them out of harm's way.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.060
- Everyone here at Endeavor Robotics

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.660
is proud to be helping
our service men and women

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.050
with their jobs and help
bring them home safely.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.320
Even on those tough days you're like

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.050
'hey, at the end of the day
we're supplying robots

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.800
that will help save a persons
life and that's worth it.'
