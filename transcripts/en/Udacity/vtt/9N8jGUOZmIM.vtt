00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.480
So trusted path means that you really
talking to the trusted computing base or

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.100
the operating system, okay.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.340
So path that connects
you typing the keys and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.180
where these keystrokes
are being captured.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.460
That path is really connecting you and
the trusted computing base and

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.560
there's no one else in between.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.700
If that is the case,
you have a trusted path.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.670
How do you make sure you
have a trusted path?

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.890
We're going to talk about
a couple different ways.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.290
This trusted path really has to be
provided by the operating system,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.750
maybe some combination of
hardware as you look at

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.230
combination of the operating system and
the hardware as we're going to see.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.280
So for example, if you login to Windows,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.840
you have to press this key sequence,
Ctrl+Alt+Del.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.360
The idea is that you
press this key sequence.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.760
This sequence cannot be
trapped by any other program.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.600
Great, this is going to take
you to the operating system.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.740
So the display and the keyboard has
to be connected to the CPU on which

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.280
the operating system is running in
a way that there is no one in between.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.250
Display is not under
control of somebody else.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.400
And somebody else is not able
to capture the key strokes and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.040
perhaps even alter them and
things like that.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.770
So generally these are sort
of physically connected,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.580
isn't it and they're in close proximity,
they're right next to your CPU,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550
both the display and the keyboard.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.010
So we assume there's no
one else in between.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.020
But if you're paranoid we can do sort of
couple of different things to make sure

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.830
that really we're not talking to
somebody else but the operating system.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.880
People had to propose a bunch
of different ideas to make sure

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.440
that when you're authenticating
yourself you have a trusted path.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.470
They said there's a special part of
the display that only the operating

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.920
system can write.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.510
So for example you could indicate on
the display when you're talking to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.860
the operating system and when you're
not talking to the operating system.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.550
Or actually have a light
on the keyboard.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.498
Okay, that will light up when you're
talking to the operating system and

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:04.950
it will be off when you're not.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.080
So this way the user would
know that when it's providing,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.920
I don't know, his or her password,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.530
it is actually going over a trusted
path to the operating system.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.470
The other entity, or
the entity at the other end actually,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.410
is the trusted computing base.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.860
So one challenge with these kind of
things is, do users pay attention to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.820
something you display, or a light on
the keyboard or something like that.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.435
If it's a red, flashing light maybe
they do, or something like that.

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:37.610
But the idea here is I think
the concept of a trusted computing path

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.150
is something we want to understand.
