I'm I guess its must have played havoc
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.240
I'm I guess its must have played havoc
with the plans for the day but that's

I badly need if you had video I'm sure

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
I badly need if you had video I'm sure
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.960
I badly need if you had video I'm sure
you would agree but instead I have a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
you would agree but instead I have a
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.289
you would agree but instead I have a
news conference to do so the haircut

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
news conference to do so the haircut
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.600
news conference to do so the haircut
will have to wait a day or two but in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610
will have to wait a day or two but in
 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.140
will have to wait a day or two but in
addition to the people on the lab

everybody you know putting the people
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.469
everybody you know putting the people
are just walking in a you know

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
are just walking in a you know

are just walking in a you know
colleagues and that have known me for

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
colleagues and that have known me for
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.420
colleagues and that have known me for
years and I sensed this tremendous sense

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
years and I sensed this tremendous sense
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.969
years and I sensed this tremendous sense
of institutional pride we've not had a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
of institutional pride we've not had a
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.370

Nobel Prize at Duke we're a relatively

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
Nobel Prize at Duke we're a relatively
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.120

young institution at 75 years which

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
young institution at 75 years which
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190
young institution at 75 years which
pales by comparison with things like

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
pales by comparison with things like
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.300
pales by comparison with things like
Javed or Princeton this kind of thing so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
Javed or Princeton this kind of thing so
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.819
Javed or Princeton this kind of thing so
I think for everybody the institution I

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
I think for everybody the institution I
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.609
I think for everybody the institution I
think everybody is sort of feeling real

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
think everybody is sort of feeling real
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.980
think everybody is sort of feeling real
good about it and indeed there seems to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
good about it and indeed there seems to
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.779
good about it and indeed there seems to
be a bit of a worldwide celebration

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
be a bit of a worldwide celebration
 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.309
be a bit of a worldwide celebration

and the whole field seems to be happy
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.040

that there's an award now I think so and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050
that there's an award now I think so and
 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.440
that there's an award now I think so and
I think you know as you probably know

are often seen of course as awards to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350
are often seen of course as awards to
 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.550
are often seen of course as awards to
individuals but beyond that their

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
individuals but beyond that their
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.160
individuals but beyond that their
recognition often of a field and so

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
recognition often of a field and so
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.810
recognition often of a field and so
everybody in the field feels good about

it especially if they feel good about
 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.990
it especially if they feel good about
the particular people from the field who

are getting the award and you know I
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.650
are getting the award and you know I
read to think that you know the kind of

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
read to think that you know the kind of
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.750

contributions that Brian and I have made

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
contributions that Brian and I have made
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.540
contributions that Brian and I have made
over the years uh generally you know

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550
over the years uh generally you know
 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.910
over the years uh generally you know
regarded you know very positively and as

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920
regarded you know very positively and as
 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.130
regarded you know very positively and as
being important in the field and so I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140
being important in the field and so I
 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.810
being important in the field and so I
think everybody in the field I really

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820
think everybody in the field I really
 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.910
think everybody in the field I really
feels good about it those four decades

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920
feels good about it those four decades
 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.470
feels good about it those four decades
really have a been a sort of golden era

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480
really have a been a sort of golden era
 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.450
really have a been a sort of golden era
so discovery of neurotransmitter

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460
so discovery of neurotransmitter
 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.090
so discovery of neurotransmitter
receptors and absolutely and you know

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100
receptors and absolutely and you know
 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.070
receptors and absolutely and you know
the whole idea that there might be such

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
the whole idea that there might be such
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.980
the whole idea that there might be such
receptors goes back a century but you

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990
receptors goes back a century but you
 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.480
receptors goes back a century but you
know interestingly when I started doing

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490
know interestingly when I started doing
 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.430
know interestingly when I started doing
my work 40 years ago they were still

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440
my work 40 years ago they were still
 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.130
my work 40 years ago they were still
huge skepticism as to whether the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140
huge skepticism as to whether the
 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.080
huge skepticism as to whether the
receptor whether things like receptors

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
receptor whether things like receptors
 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.700
receptor whether things like receptors
really existed even from some of the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710
really existed even from some of the
 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.770
really existed even from some of the
people who were central in pharmacology

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780
people who were central in pharmacology
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.710
people who were central in pharmacology
and in the very early years of the work

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720
and in the very early years of the work
 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.950
and in the very early years of the work
there was a lot of pushback in terms of

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960
there was a lot of pushback in terms of
 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.840
there was a lot of pushback in terms of
well can you really do this you're

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850
well can you really do this you're
 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.580
well can you really do this you're
really isolating receptors how do we

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590
really isolating receptors how do we
 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.760
really isolating receptors how do we
know their receptors and now of course

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770
know their receptors and now of course
 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.220
know their receptors and now of course
it's you know to my students and fellows

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230
it's you know to my students and fellows
 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.750
it's you know to my students and fellows
that they're surprised to hear there was

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760
that they're surprised to hear there was
 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.020
that they're surprised to hear there was
ever such skepticism yes because I mean

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030
ever such skepticism yes because I mean
 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.940
ever such skepticism yes because I mean
your isolation and then sequencing of

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950
your isolation and then sequencing of
 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.699
your isolation and then sequencing of
the beta 2 adrenoceptor really well it

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709
the beta 2 adrenoceptor really well it
 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.740
the beta 2 adrenoceptor really well it
was the first isolation and it it sort

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750
was the first isolation and it it sort
 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.630
was the first isolation and it it sort
of gave the rosetta stone through which

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640
of gave the rosetta stone through which
 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.430

everybody else was able to decode the
dozens of other I think terrific exactly

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600
dozens of other I think terrific exactly
 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.500
dozens of other I think terrific exactly
right and you know like so many

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510
right and you know like so many

took us a decade to get these receptors

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010
took us a decade to get these receptors
 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.610
took us a decade to get these receptors
isolated and then another number of

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620
isolated and then another number of
 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.040
isolated and then another number of
years to get them cloned so we're

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050
years to get them cloned so we're
 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.930
years to get them cloned so we're
talking 15 years to get to that point

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940
talking 15 years to get to that point
 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.449
talking 15 years to get to that point
and similarly with co bill cos recent

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459

crystal structures you can throw in

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680
crystal structures you can throw in
 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.150
crystal structures you can throw in
another 10-15 years there so I mean it's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160
another 10-15 years there so I mean it's
 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.150
another 10-15 years there so I mean it's
tough it really is yeah it takes time it

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160
tough it really is yeah it takes time it
 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.180
tough it really is yeah it takes time it
takes perseverance exactly now it was

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190

Joe lab and exactly he was a fellow

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620
Joe lab and exactly he was a fellow
 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.620
Joe lab and exactly he was a fellow
working in my laboratory we were

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630
working in my laboratory we were
 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.570
working in my laboratory we were
collaborating with a lab in at Merck and

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580
collaborating with a lab in at Merck and
 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.939
collaborating with a lab in at Merck and
we had already purified the receptor and

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949
we had already purified the receptor and
 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.920
we had already purified the receptor and
together with them we had gotten these

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930
together with them we had gotten these
 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.719
together with them we had gotten these
little stretches of protein sequence

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729
little stretches of protein sequence
 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.700
little stretches of protein sequence
which was truly the rosetta stone which

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710
which was truly the rosetta stone which
 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.640
which was truly the rosetta stone which
allowed the cloning the whole key to the

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650
allowed the cloning the whole key to the
 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.379
allowed the cloning the whole key to the
whole thing was that decade of work to

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389
whole thing was that decade of work to
 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.279
whole thing was that decade of work to
get the receptors purified and so

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289
get the receptors purified and so
 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.620
get the receptors purified and so
kobilka was sort of in my lab was the

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630
kobilka was sort of in my lab was the
 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.310
kobilka was sort of in my lab was the
fellow leading the the cloning work not

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320
fellow leading the the cloning work not
 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.500

the original biochemistry and then we

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510
the original biochemistry and then we
 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.830
the original biochemistry and then we
were collaborating with a group at at

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840
were collaborating with a group at at
 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.740
were collaborating with a group at at
Merck but that was sort of his baptism

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750
Merck but that was sort of his baptism
 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.840
Merck but that was sort of his baptism
of fire so to speak and so he was very

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850
of fire so to speak and so he was very
 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.659
of fire so to speak and so he was very
active in that research and he was in my

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669
active in that research and he was in my
 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.600
active in that research and he was in my
lab really for about five years old

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610
lab really for about five years old
 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.310
lab really for about five years old
together and had a very productive time

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320
together and had a very productive time
 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.680
together and had a very productive time
it was clear to me then that he was a

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690
it was clear to me then that he was a
 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.620
it was clear to me then that he was a
very very special guy yeah what is it's

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630
very very special guy yeah what is it's
 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.120
very very special guy yeah what is it's
funny because he's disarmingly quiet

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130
funny because he's disarmingly quiet
 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.999
funny because he's disarmingly quiet
he's such a such a self-effacing chan oh

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009
he's such a such a self-effacing chan oh
 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.990
he's such a such a self-effacing chan oh
my goodness I think he's painfully shy

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000
my goodness I think he's painfully shy
 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.990
my goodness I think he's painfully shy
and yeah I think that's why he's very

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000
and yeah I think that's why he's very
 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.689
and yeah I think that's why he's very
self-effacing and that's just his

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699
self-effacing and that's just his
 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.409
self-effacing and that's just his
personality I think I think I hope he

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419
personality I think I think I hope he
 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.339
personality I think I think I hope he
can really enjoy this freshly today in

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349
can really enjoy this freshly today in
 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.279
can really enjoy this freshly today in
the next month or two because this is

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289
the next month or two because this is
 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.409
the next month or two because this is
not his comfort zone i would say exactly

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419
not his comfort zone i would say exactly
 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.120
not his comfort zone i would say exactly
when in fact we spoke to him earlier and

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130
when in fact we spoke to him earlier and
 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.800
when in fact we spoke to him earlier and
yes he was he was expressing the fact

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810
yes he was he was expressing the fact
 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.300
yes he was he was expressing the fact
that he probably thought he probably

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310
that he probably thought he probably
 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.730
that he probably thought he probably
wouldn't enjoy what was about to come

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740
wouldn't enjoy what was about to come
 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.920
wouldn't enjoy what was about to come
yes i think that correct yeah but but

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930
yes i think that correct yeah but but
 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.180
yes i think that correct yeah but but
hopefully he'll enjoy the trip to

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190
hopefully he'll enjoy the trip to
 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.310
hopefully he'll enjoy the trip to
