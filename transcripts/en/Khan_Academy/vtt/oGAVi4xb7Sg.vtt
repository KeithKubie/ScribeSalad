00:00:00.463 --> 00:00:02.405
- [Voiceover] So if
this bar right over here

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:04.287
represents one whole,

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:07.217
so the whole thing is shaded
in with the purple color,

00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:10.541
my question to you is,
which of these other bars,

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:15.386
and there might be more than
one of them, represent 1/2?

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:20.386
So our goal, our goal is to see 1/2.

00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:24.417
So once again, like always,

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:27.252
pause the video and try it on your own.

00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:30.362
Okay, so you've tried it on
your own, let's work through it.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.569
If we're thinking about halves,

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.971
and we just have one of them,

00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:38.633
let me just try to draw another bar here,

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.687
it would look something like this.

00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:42.875
I'll try to draw it pretty close

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.526
to these other bars here.

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:50.526
I would divide it into two equal sections,

00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:52.917
and I would only care or I would really

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:56.105
fill in one of them, that
would be 1/2 of this figure.

00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:58.554
Actually, these sections
don't look quite equal,

00:00:58.554 --> 00:01:01.135
that looks a little bit off...

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:02.839
It's pretty good, I
think you get the idea,

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.865
that my intent is to
draw these to be equal.

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:11.865
Then, this right over here would be 1/2.

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:15.290
Now, none of these are
divided into halves.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.660
This one over here is
divided into fourths,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.651
this one over here is divided into

00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.934
one, two, three, four, five,
so it's divided into fifths,

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:25.886
this one over here is divided into

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:27.832
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:32.575
so it's divided into sixths,
this is divided into thirds.

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:35.806
We're going to have to really relate 1/2

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:39.894
to other - to breaking up your whole

00:01:39.894 --> 00:01:42.695
into different amounts,
not just breaking it up

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:44.224
into two equal sections,
breaking it up into

00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:45.928
four equal sections, five equal sections,

00:01:45.928 --> 00:01:47.507
six equal sections, and
three equal sections.

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.041
How do we do that?

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:50.360
The easiest thing might be to just

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.088
break this one up into
four equal sections.

00:01:53.088 --> 00:01:54.541
You break this up into
four equal sections,

00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:55.878
that's just taking each of these two

00:01:55.878 --> 00:01:58.309
and then breaking those up into two.

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:01.024
That's one equal section, and another,

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:05.651
let me use that blue color
actually, 'cause that's my...

00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:07.569
That's an equal section over here,

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.250
and this is an equal section,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.530
so this is the same thing as 1/2.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.523
Notice I didn't change
how much I shaded in,

00:02:14.523 --> 00:02:16.531
I just divided it into more sections.

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:18.701
So we see that 1/2 is the exact

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:23.467
same thing as two out of four.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:25.093
Well, how many do we have right over here?

00:02:25.093 --> 00:02:30.093
We have one, two out of
four, so this is one, two

00:02:30.247 --> 00:02:33.895
out of four, and this
is one, two out of four,

00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:38.362
so 2/4 and 1/2 are the same,
these two are equivalent.

00:02:38.362 --> 00:02:39.854
Now this might not be obvious,

00:02:39.854 --> 00:02:42.138
but if you took this
block right over here,

00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:44.629
and if you were to move this one over,

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.733
and so this one is painted
and this one isn't,

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.734
they would look the same,
so maybe that would help

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:53.734
to see that this also has
1/2 of the block filled in.

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:56.964
So this one is definitely 1/2.

00:02:56.964 --> 00:03:01.549
Now let's think about fifths.

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.696
So let me, well there's
two ways I could do it.

00:03:05.696 --> 00:03:10.423
Let me draw fifths, and
this right over here is 3/5,

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:11.638
so might as well just write it down.

00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:16.638
This is 3/5, this is 3/6, and this is 1/3.

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:22.585
Let me draw 3/5 right below this.

00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:27.012
Let me draw, I keep wanting
to change the color around,

00:03:27.012 --> 00:03:30.450
I'm using a new art tool
and color changing isn't

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.971
coming as naturally as my old one.

00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:37.462
This right over here, let
me divide it into fifths

00:03:37.462 --> 00:03:41.972
the best I can, so one,
two, three, four, five,

00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:42.932
and we're going to assume that these are

00:03:42.932 --> 00:03:46.697
equal sections, I know
my drawing isn't perfect,

00:03:46.697 --> 00:03:49.300
but if we have 3/5, where
are we going to get to?

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.831
We're going to get to one, two, three.

00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:55.372
One way to think about it,
this, what I just drew,

00:03:55.372 --> 00:03:56.419
is just a rearrangement of this,

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:57.825
I just took the three filled in sections

00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:59.534
and put them all to the left.

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:03.211
So I have one, two,
three, and when you look

00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:06.830
at it this way, it's clear
that 3/5 is more than 1/2.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.400
If we were to try to put the
3/5 onto this one right here,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.680
it would get us about this far,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.747
so 3/5 would go all the way over there.

00:04:14.747 --> 00:04:19.747
So 3/5 is definitely not
the same thing as 1/2.

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:24.264
Now what about 3/6?

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.944
Let's think about that a little bit.

00:04:25.944 --> 00:04:30.944
Can we take - let me draw
another one of these things

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.525
that I have to keep drawing
over and over again.

00:04:36.525 --> 00:04:39.963
We already know that if I split this

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:44.881
into two equal pieces, I shade
in one of them, that's 1/2.

00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:48.563
This right over here is 1/2.

00:04:48.563 --> 00:04:50.628
Could I turn this into sixths?

00:04:50.628 --> 00:04:52.827
If I take each of these
two and I split them

00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:54.502
into three equal pieces,
then I'm going to have

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:58.509
two times six pieces, so
I'm going to have sixths.

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.509
Let me do that, so I'm
going to use my blue color,

00:05:04.134 --> 00:05:06.480
there you go, and then there you go,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.137
I took each of the two and I split them

00:05:08.137 --> 00:05:10.223
into three, and now I have six pieces.

00:05:10.223 --> 00:05:14.428
I haven't changed how much
I shaded in, I have now -

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:16.105
it was 1/2 of the entire bar, but now,

00:05:16.105 --> 00:05:17.705
when I think in terms of sixths,

00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:22.705
it's one, two, 3/6, 3/6 is
the exact same thing as 1/2.

00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:26.558
We have one, two, 3/6, and once again,

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:28.735
if you took these two and
shifted them over here,

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:29.809
you would get something that looks

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:31.880
very much like that or like this.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.880
This right over here is
the same thing as 1/2.

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:40.915
Now what about 1/3?

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:43.278
All right, I think you
see where this is going.

00:05:43.278 --> 00:05:45.169
And always, you should just feel free

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.188
to pause the video and try
to work it out on your own,

00:05:47.188 --> 00:05:48.849
or frankly, if you get
what's going on in the video,

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.393
you don't have to watch it! (laughs)

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:56.393
All right, so let's divide it into thirds,

00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.764
and we're talking about 1/3.

00:05:58.764 --> 00:06:03.764
We're talking about 1/3 right over here,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.920
and very clearly you see
that 1/3 is less than 3/6,

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.862
and 3/6 is the same thing as 1/2.

00:06:11.862 --> 00:06:13.978
1/2 would take you about this far,

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:18.228
would take you that far,
1/3 is less than that.

00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:21.480
So 1/3 is not equal to 1/2.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.058
Hopefully you found that fun.
