You know Christian, I love that cube exercise, and and

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.020
the things that the students came up with was just

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.540
wonderful but, I mean, so what? I mean, it's, it's,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.730
you can't do anything with it. What's the use of it?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.570
&gt;&gt; Well, the use is in helping students understand what it means to be

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.030
a designer, what it means to actually

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.210
design these affordances. And the signifiers that.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I'm worried. So many designs I see

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.035
are this wonderful cube and one thing, but they actually

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:30.290
nobody can understand them when they don't function very well.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.072
&gt;&gt; Well function is only part of it. I mean you, you've gotta bring

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:37.650
in the other human elements too. I mean of course there's meaning and function.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.720
&gt;&gt; And then there's usable, it's also delightful. So

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.090
the real trick is to combine them. So we've

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.700
been talking about things like affordance and constraints and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.440
that makes it very functional and usable and understandable

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.970
but it's not necessarily interesting.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.010
&gt;&gt; And conceptual models, like how do you actually know how to use something.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that doesn't, so what you're trying to tell

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.770
me, the cube model is about making it more than that.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we're living in an era when this object, the

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.500
phone, wasn't very much ten years ago, wasn't much to talk about.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.060
It did things for you, it made phone calls. But now it's

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.040
become a big part of your life, and a lot of that.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.980
&gt;&gt; Is the enjoyment of using it.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and designers have made it even

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.270
delightful at times. So what we have to do is we have to manage

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.890
to combine the wonderful fun with the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.830
cube, with the functionality of the other principles.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's how you do design, it's about all these

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.010
things, and you've now taken the first steps at designing the world yourself.
