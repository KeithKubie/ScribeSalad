00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.780
In the next few sections,

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.980
I'll be covering how you'll create your
very first prototype within InVision.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.220
By combining the core aspects of speed,
interactivity, and

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.660
remote feedback, you'll see how your
static images can be brought to life

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.690
through the InVision platform.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.499
The five steps we'll go through
are create an invisionapp.com account,

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.910
create your project and
select a device type, upload your Wires,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
JPGS, or PNGs into the project via
drag-n-drop, browse, InVision Sync.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.980
Link your screens together, and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.920
finally, how to invite
collaborators into your project.
