00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.030
At the core of is the pod.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.800
Pods represent a logical application.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.530
Pods represent and hold a collection
of one or more containers.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.740
Generally if you have multiple
containers with a hard dependency on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.480
each other, they would be packaged
together inside of a single pod.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.200
In our example,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.550
you can see that we have a pod that
has the monolith and nginx containers.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.810
Pods also have volumes.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.110
Volumes are just data divs that
live as long as the pod lives and

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.710
can be used by any of
the containers in that pod.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.510
This is possible because Pods provide
a shared namespace for their contents.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.615
This means that the two containers
inside of our example pod

00:00:37.615 --> 00:00:41.225
can communicate with each other, and
they also share the attached volumes.

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:45.015
Pods also share a network namespace.

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:48.355
This means that a pod
has one IP per pod.

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:50.955
You know what?

00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:52.605
Let's take a deeper dive into pods now.
