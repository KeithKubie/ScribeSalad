00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.490
An ABO protein that is severely shortened, right,

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.920
shortened at close to the very beginning. It's only

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.870
got about 1/4th of what it would normally

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.990
have. It only got the like position 250 out

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.390
of a total of roughly a thousand. We

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.954
are most likely going to end up with a non-functional

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:21.810
protein. Right. At this point we deleted like

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.970
three quarters of the ABO protein from this single

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.100
letter change in the DNA code. And as a result, we end up with blood type O.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.220
Blood type O, the reason it's letter O,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.470
the O represents the absence. Of a molecule here

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.820
that would normally be added by a functioning

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.480
protien. So, the ABO protien would normally add an

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.965
antigen to the red blood cells. But, because it's

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:51.060
non-functional nothing gets added. And, so we call that

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.970
blood type O.
