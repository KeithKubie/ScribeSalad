Well, the height is just a change in vertical position. It's a Δy.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We can use this equation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In fact, I can say that height equals the initial velocity times the time,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and I've used 4 seconds, because it only takes half the time to get to the top,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the other half is spent going down,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
plus ½ times the acceleration times the time².

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I get a result of 80 m.
