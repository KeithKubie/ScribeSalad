00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.387
(beeping)

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:08.967
(uptempo electronic music)

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.470
- So as you know, life sciences are always

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.290
trying to make best use of light for many

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.110
different purposes.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.110
For instance we use x-ray
beam for crystallography

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.420
and the infrared light for
vibrational spectroscopy.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.740
But most biologists use visible light.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.210
And chromophore is a structure unit

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.250
so that can absorb certain visible light,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.830
and it is responsible for color

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.790
and in many cases it has
the Pi-conjugation system.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.650
And single and double
bonds appear alternately

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.470
so that the Pi electrons
can be delocalized.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.440
So, electrons oscillate
or sing on the chromophore

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.180
and that's quite important
for the interaction

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.024
with the visible light.

00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:05.780
And my laboratory is engaged in

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.200
technological innovation in bio-imaging

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.720
and principally using
fluorescent proteins.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.540
And I'd like to introduce to you,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.425
so the most classical
the fluorescent protein

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:16.938
Aequorea GFP.

00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:19.750
And long time ago, so in 1962

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.230
Osamu Shimomura discovered protein

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.900
and from the light-emitting
organ of the jellyfish.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.820
And just 30 years later in '92 it's seen

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.630
then it was cloned by Doug Prasher.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.630
And in '94, so the heterologous
expression with Aequorea GFP

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.190
was achieved by Martin
Chalfie at Columbia, okay.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.040
And then this is the primary
structure of Aequorea GFP,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.650
just 238 amino acid.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.340
So there's no chromophore
that I defined a moment ago

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.770
in the peptide.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.010
But from this three amino acid

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.860
get serine, tyrosine, glycine

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.464
so three reactions occur
spontaneously, okay.

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:04.500
And cyclization, dehydration
and oxidation reactions

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.570
to make the Pi-conjugation system.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.800
So this is the GFP's chromophore

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.197
and which observes blue light, okay?

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:14.147
But this light doesn't say
anything about its fluorescence.

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.490
This is a crystal
structure, the Aequorea GFP

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.270
and the beta-barrel structure.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.490
And the 11 stranded beta-barrel

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.730
with one alpha helix inside,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.180
and the chromophore is
formed on the helix,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.610
and that the barrel is very robust.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.250
And the chromophore is packed inside

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.250
and it takes very rigid structure

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.250
so that explains why GFP's fluorescence

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.020
quantum yield is very high.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.670
And the mutagen studies get
done by Dr. Roger Tsien,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.220
so produced quite a few color variance

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.460
and the more useful and brighter.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.360
And I stayed in Roger's
lab from '95 to '98

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.410
and I used CFP and the YFP

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.910
and as the donor and acceptor
for FRET so to create,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.820
so the genetically encoded
indicator for calcium ion,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.090
Cameleons as Mark mentioned kindly.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.600
So now I'd like to discuss
why calcium imaging

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.000
is so interesting and appealing.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.470
So there should be two major reasons.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.260
First, calcium signaling
is very, so dynamic.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.613
The concentration of free calcium ion

00:03:27.613 --> 00:03:30.814
it changes so greatly so it should be fun.

00:03:30.814 --> 00:03:35.814
To observe for instance
here calcium oscillations.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.330
The second, so due to the endogenous

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.180
and the very abundant
calcium buffering systems

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.400
we can express a huge
amount of calcium probes

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.560
so without affecting intracellular calcium

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.650
dynamics very much, okay?

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.184
We can increase the signals,

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:55.330
signal-to-noise ratio.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.400
Here we expressed a large
quantity of Cameleon

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.190
in excitatory neurons
with the forebrain mouse.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.950
And we signed the skinless
head with excitation light

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.730
and to get these calcium readout.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.430
And through this intact
skull and the video rate

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.760
and for more than 30 minutes.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.360
So this readout reflect
spontaneous neuronal activities

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.340
and which are composed
of multiple oscillations

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.680
of different frequencies
and very symmetrical.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.960
And the mouse was half awake

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.100
so when we gave visual stimulation

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.590
so we saw an evoked response in the path,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.640
in the visual cortex.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.560
Now back to, so this slide.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.580
GFP is chromophore

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.800
and it has a phenol ring.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.000
So it comes from tyrosine residue, okay?

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.050
Well, almost all of the

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.070
fluorescent proteins now available

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.910
so do have phenol rings in
their chromophores, okay?

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.326
And the exceptions, the CFP and the BFP,

00:05:02.326 --> 00:05:05.280
so they have indole ring or imidazole ring

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.870
coming from tryptophan and the histidine.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.360
But phenol ring containing
chromophore is most common.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.690
And that there is an equilibrium

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.510
between protonated and ionized state

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.400
of the phenol hydroxyl group.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.380
And that they then absorb
400 and 480 nanometer light.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.650
And in many cases, so the
ionized form fluorescent, okay.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.490
Therefore, GFP basically has

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.820
bimodal absorption spectrum.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.510
And now a circular permutation.

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.260
And a long time ago just serendipitously

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.150
Geoff Baird and in Roger's lab found,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.910
so this site 144, 145,

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.080
so the midpoint of the beta
strand number seven (mumbles),

00:05:55.996 --> 00:05:57.350
so circular permutation.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.070
So circular permuted GFP can synthesize

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.730
chromophore very well,

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.232
and now so the chromophore.

00:06:04.232 --> 00:06:09.232
The equilibrium is quite
sensitive to a neighboring event

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.790
such as a calcium-dependent
protein-protein interaction.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.790
So this is the operational
principle of GCaMP or pericam.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.750
The very important point is that

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.190
so that here calcium-binding
changes absorption spectrum

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.830
not fluorescence quantum yield, okay.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.710
As a kind of, a future perspective,

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.250
so the GCaMP should be well combined

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.400
with photo-acoustic imaging.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.420
Now I have to say and
not only the jellyfish

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.510
but some of them are done
in animals or marine animals

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.942
so can produce quite similar
fluorescent proteins, okay?

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:52.930
And while we have cloned
many new fluorescent proteins

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.340
from those animals.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.500
By using this, so these
green, red proteins,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.590
we some time ago we
developed cell cycle probe.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.220
And we used the Ubiquitin Oscillator.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.100
Cell cycle-dependent proteolysis,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.610
so to create the cell cycle probe

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.730
which labels individual
nuclei in genome phase red

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.150
and those in S, G2, M phases green.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.530
That's FUCCI and the
green and red indicate,

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.340
so the go and stop.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.750
The S phase entry, so
like a traffic signal

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.400
and when the FUCCI was
introduced into HeLa cells,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.000
so derived from malignant tumor

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.320
we observed a cell cycle operation

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.570
in the other time at
the single cell level.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.110
But when we did the same thing using

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.640
benign tumor-derived cell line

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.250
we saw very clear contact inhibition.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.110
And upon reaching comfortable area

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.690
all of the cells became red

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.300
and then stopped so their proliferation.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.950
And we introduced scratch
and so some of the cells

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.250
or that one in green
after some rate and time,

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:06.040
so they reenter the cell
cycle and to build a gap.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.900
And we prepared FUCCI transgenic mice,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.380
so this is a coronal section of an embryo

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.950
and in the brain, so neural stem cells

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.270
at the green nuclei line
in the ventricular zone

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.320
but post-mortem neurons
had only red nuclei

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.090
in the cortical (mumbles).

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.240
And the green and the red
signify cell proliferation

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.700
and the differentiation.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.520
And during the embryogenesis with time,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.640
so green to red ratio decreased,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.020
so the earlier the more proliferation,

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.210
the later the more differentiation.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.700
And after the burst so the
red signal became predominant

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.590
but even in adult tissue
so we can identify

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.250
very few green nuclei

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.130
and the cells with the green nuclei

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.400
corresponded to tissue stem
cells like a neural stem cells

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.400
found in the dentate gyrus, okay.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.370
And when we used zebrafish
embryo very transparently

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.170
so we can obtain cell cycle
profile in four dimensions.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.370
So this is a segmentation period of embryo

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.640
and a side view on head and tail,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.690
and again with time green
to red ratio decreased

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.500
but some other organs
like retina and the brain,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.460
so very green.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.216
And in top view in addition to two eyes,

00:09:24.216 --> 00:09:26.620
so we saw a notochord.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.820
So differentiating notochord

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.720
and in notochord we discovered,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.300
so the cell cycle
transitions moved, traveled

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.980
from head to tail like this.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.233
So G1, this transition moved towards here.

00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:47.960
And we think, so the cell cycle regulation

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.320
in the notochord is
linked to somite genesis

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.260
which is also characterized
by head to tail

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.010
progression of differentiation.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.570
But anyhow, it's quite very amazing

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.430
that we can visualize that
the middle of the body

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.630
from outside so that's just because,

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.630
so the fish embryo's a bit transparent.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.260
And by contrast, mouse embryos,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.320
well, mammary animals where
including us are turbid.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.850
Yes, visible light
scatters very much inside

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.880
so our body so like now mentioned, okay?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.520
Now, tissue clear identification

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.490
and long time ago we discover that

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.680
the membrane for Western Blotting analysis

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.650
it became transparent when
soaked in four molar urea.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.750
And we knew that, so the GFP beta-barrel,

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.560
it's a brave and tough, so rigid

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.850
and tolerant of high
concentration of urea.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.630
We started, so the clearing
and devolution in 2011,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.740
so with our paper on ScaleA2

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.794
which is the first and urea-based

00:10:59.794 --> 00:11:03.330
aqueous solution for tissue
clear identification.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.830
And then it was followed by many explosion

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.890
of many new techniques,

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.340
and also two years ago we
reported some modification

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:17.340
ScaleS, ScaleS that contains
sorbitol in addition to urea

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.770
and we verify that ScaleS can preserve

00:11:23.908 --> 00:11:28.908
the fluorescent signal
and also outer structures,

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.940
so subset of outer
structures like a synapse.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.920
I think researchers should be aware

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.410
of the critical trade-off

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.380
between effective clearing

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.750
and the tissue signal preservation.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.390
And also we invented AbScale method

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.010
so which enables three-dimensional
immunohistochemistry.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.690
And some time ago the Saito group at BSI

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.210
generated a single APP
knock-in mouse models

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.830
of Alzheimer disease.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.520
And we applied AbScale method,

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.570
so to the brain of aged APP knock-in mice.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.620
And to visualize A beta-plaques we used

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.220
Alexa488 labeled and antibody.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.140
And there was a brain got
prepared from a nine-month old

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.370
and APP knock-in mouse and very sparse.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.890
But in 18-month old, so we saw,

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.210
we observed so many
immuno-labeled A beta-plaques

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.540
and yes, even the experiment,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.550
we transcardially perfused
the entire vasculature

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.240
with Texas Red-lectin

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.030
to label blood vessels
with red fluorescence

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.360
and then we immune-stained
the A beta-plaques with green

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.300
and to obtain this, so the 3D perspective.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.980
Very comprehensive perspective of how

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.700
A beta-plaques interferes
with blood vessels.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.480
Then we took interest
in a special association

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.770
of A beta-plaques with microglial cells.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.180
And we applied so the dual color AbScale

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.960
so to a brain slice prepared
from APP knock-in mouse.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.070
And we analyzed the interaction

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.080
between these two object

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.240
by light sheet microscopy observation.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.240
And we measured the distance
from each microglia center

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.220
to the nearest plaque age in the 3D space.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.990
Those measurements should
provide the information about

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.100
stability of plaque
neuritis, inflammatory state.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.920
For instance, so two neighboring
plaques with similar size

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.390
but different association
with microglial cells,

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:50.390
very direct to contact
versus very isolated.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We think they suggest acute
neuritic state versus obsolete.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.410
And in a similar way we 3D imaged plaque

00:14:03.543 --> 00:14:07.170
microglia association in
post-mortem brain samples

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.350
of AD patient of more than 50 years old.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.850
And in these three brain
samples we observed,

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:19.330
detected very clear cored
plaques, green ones.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.050
And the cored plaques without

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.240
and with microglia association.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.610
But in the remaining
six of the brain samples

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.110
we didn't see any cored plaques.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.470
So then we became interested
in diffused plaques.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.370
So diffused plaques are
basically undetectable,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.410
not detectable in the
two-dimensional image.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.430
But our new software can re-slice,

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.610
so the 3D reconstruction systemically

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.480
and with different sizes,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.870
different thickness, okay?

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.890
And that helped us to identify

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.570
diffused plaques of different sizes.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.100
And the diffused plaques are usually

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.940
assumed to be very
primitive and very isolated

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.720
from any inflammatory cells,

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.440
but we found, so most of
them can show the sign of

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.900
neuritis with considerable

00:15:25.104 --> 00:15:27.470
association with microglial cells.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.550
Clinically, diffused plaques are ambiguous

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.750
but they're potentially
very, very important, okay?

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.970
And Scale plus FUCCI we
studied vascular niche

00:15:41.831 --> 00:15:44.780
for neural stem cells
in the dentate gyrus.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.080
And that we were able...

00:15:49.701 --> 00:15:53.290
So neural stem cells or
proliferative neural stem cells

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.420
we used FUCCI S, G2, M phase marker

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.690
and the blood vessels
were labeled with red.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.900
And the green nuclei,
so the neural stem cells

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.830
were indeed localized
inside the dentate gyrus

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:08.850
not outside of it.

00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:13.190
And we again performed
distance measurement

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.160
in a three-dimensional space.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.510
We measured distance
from each green nucleus,

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.380
so to the nearest blood vessel, okay?

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.920
And then we came to a conclusion,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.130
so the neural stem cells are more closely

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.750
associated with blood
vessels than matured neurons.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.430
And Rusty has been saying about

00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:40.730
hippocampal neurogenesis is operated by

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:43.940
exposure to enriched environment

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.290
and we performed the
comparative experiment,

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:52.290
comparative experiment and
large-scale 3D reconstruction.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:57.510
And our data showed the
enriched environment increased

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.550
so the number or density
of neural stem cells

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:06.090
but did not change so their
association with blood vessels.

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.610
This a comprehensive data I think, I hope.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.990
All right, so this slide is an interplay

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.230
between light and life.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.488
Well I remember that Roger Tsien,

00:17:22.488 --> 00:17:27.488
Roger used to remind us
nature is very kind to us,

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.010
to researchers

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.840
and that nature still
remains the best source

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.920
of bio-imaging tools, okay?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.630
And this is my last slide

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.960
and only a scientist
with a respect for nature

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.070
would have been permitted to surpass it

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.584
in English, Japanese and Chinese.

00:17:48.584 --> 00:17:50.699
And thank you very much for attention.

00:17:50.699 --> 00:17:53.866
(audience applauding)

00:17:54.838 --> 00:17:58.421
