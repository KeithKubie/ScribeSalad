00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.750
Zeus was the greek god of the sky and ruler
of the Olympian gods, but he also had quite

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.500
a knack for handling lighting.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.130
Could humans ever harness the power of a God?

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.650
Could we ever control lightning?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.369
Hey guys Julia here for Dnews

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.499
Lightning is one of the most fearsome and
enigmatic forces of nature.

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.869
Since Benjamin Franklin first flew his kite
into the stormy sky some night long ago, we’ve

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.119
be fascinating by the idea of taming lightning.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.809
Cloud-to-ground lightning bolts are a common
phenomenon—about 100 strike Earth's surface

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.690
every single second with a force of a billion
volts of electricity.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.969
Which can do some nasty damage to stuff on
the ground.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.530
and some studies show that lightning could
increase by 50% thanks to global warming.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.039
Lightning happens because storm clouds are
charged in the atmosphere.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.000
The top tends to be positive and the bottom
negative.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.769
But I won’t go into all the details because
Traces explains it all in this great episode

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:52.920
right here.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.940
With incidents of lightning on the rise, it
makes sense that we would want to control

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.940
it.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.640
What if we could direct the path of lightning?

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.870
Well not surprising, but scientists are working
on it.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.519
Specifically they are working on controlling
lightning WITH LASERS.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.500
Back in 2008 a bunch of French scientists
took huge lasers into the New Mexican Desert.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.460
When they fired them into storm clouds they
noticed that they increased electrical activity

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.460
in the cloud.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.229
Unfortunately, lightning didn’t happen.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.530
So they scaled things down and took it back
to the lab.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.720
In another experiment they fired an electrical
charge between two electrodes.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.799
Normally the charge would go straight from
electrode to electrode.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.190
But by firing a laser 5 to 20 centimetres
close to the electrode, the charge jumped

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.630
to the laser before hitting the other electrode.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.909
This showed that lasers could have some effect
on the trajectory of an electrical charge.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.840
Okay yeah so nothing that terribly exciting,
BUT in a more recent study published in the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.070
journal Science Advances, other researchers
harnessed more control over the trajectory

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.070
of an electrical charge.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.619
In a proof of concept experiment the researchers
fired charges between two electrodes only

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.200
centimeters apart.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.180
The fired a laser through that electrical
charge to guide its path.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.109
The lasers ionize the air, and as a charge
goes between the electrodes, it follows the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.619
path of the least resistance, along the trajectory
determined by the laser beam.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.920
They used several types of laser beams, to
create differently shaped paths.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.520
Gaussian beam, Bessel beam, and an Airy beam.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.720
In the Gaussian beam the charge looked kind
of like a normal charge (butuuuuuttt).

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.860
In the Bessel beam made the charge follow
a straight path.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.640
An airy beam made the charge follow a parabola
shape.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.280
Putting two airy beams together made the charge
follow a sweet s shape.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.910
But what’s really cool is that Airy and
Bessel type beams self heal.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.360
Meaning that once they encounter an obstacle,
they can go around it and reform like nothing

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.360
even happened.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.000
So the charge wasn’t stopped by something
in its way.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.160
So yeah we’re talking on the scale of centimeters.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.390
Nothing that dramatic, humans won’t be Zeus
quite yet.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.610
So while it’s a long way away from controlling
lightning it’s certainly a cool start!

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.240
So remember how I mentioned how global warming
is causing more lightning?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.300
Matt Lieberman has more on that in this DNews
episode right here
