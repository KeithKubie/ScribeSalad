00:00:01.045 --> 00:00:05.000
since we've been talking how stars formed and the evolution of stars

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.638
i thought it was about time that we looked at some cool pictures of stars

00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:12.214
forming or stars themselves, or evolution of stars.

00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:23.600
so this right here is from the Eagle Nebula,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.883
Just so you know, the word Nebula is kind of a general word for any interstellar cloud of gas or dust

00:00:30.883 --> 00:00:34.133
so when we're talking about the Eagle nebula, we're actually talking about a huge nebula

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.733
and actually, it's a nebula that expands.

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:44.400
and so that you have a sense, this is just one of the pillars of the "Pillars of creation"

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.133
This is just a small part of the actual Eagle Nebula

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.467
And just this pillar right over here, just this pillar here

00:00:52.467 --> 00:01:01.400
so that you have a sense of how large it is, just this pillar itself is 7 light years

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.551
it is 7 light years talls

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:06.467
so this is an enormous amount of distance

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:11.425
remember, the distance from earth to the nearest star was about 4 light years

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:13.839
it would take voyager, if it were pointed in the right direction

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:17.333
moving at 60 thousand kilometers per hour

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:21.333
it would take Voyager 80 thousand years to go 4 light years

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.822
just this pillar is 7 light years

00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:29.333
but i wanted to show you this because these type of nebulae, the plural of nebula

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.160
are where stars can form.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.400
so this right here, you actually see, is actually a breeding ground for the birth of new stars

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.933
this gas is condensing, just like we talked about a couple of videos ago. Until it gets to that critical

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:45.333
temperature, the critical density, where you can actually get

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:49.267
fusion of hydrogen

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:53.933
so this is just a huge interstellar cloud of hydrogen gas

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:59.200
and over here you can see its just this breeding ground for stars

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.159
and we don't even, we think that this structure doesn't even exist anymore

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.400
because remember, this thing is very very far away from us

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.267
in fact is, just so you have the number, this thing is 7000 light years away

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:17.416
7000 light years away

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:23.867
which means that what we are seeing now, the photons that are reaching our eyes or telescopes right now

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:28.492
left this region of space 7000 years ago

00:02:28.492 --> 00:02:31.133
so we're seeing it as it was 7000 years ago

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:36.533
so a lot of this gas, a lot of this hydrogen, may have already condensed into many many more stars

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.800
so the structure might not be the way it looks right now

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.267
and actually there was another

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:45.867
super nova that happened that might have blown away a lot of this stuff

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:49.000
and we won't even be able to see the effects of this super nova

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.085
for another thousand years

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:53.600
but anyway, this is just a pretty amazing photograph in my opinion

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
especially, and its beautiful at any scale

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.067
and it's even more mindblowing when you think that this is 7, this is a structure

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:02.200
that is 7 light years tall

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.667
and this is really just part of the Eagle Nebula

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.921
one of the pillars of creation

00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:13.236
this right here is a star field, and this is as we're looking towards the center of our galaxy

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:13.933
the milkyway

00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:16.162
this is the Sagittarius star field

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:20.267
the neat thing here you see is such a diversity in stars

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:24.916
this is also kind of mind numbing because every one of these stars, are inside of our galaxy

00:03:24.916 --> 00:03:27.933
this is looking towards the center of our galaxy

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:32.333
this isn't one of those where we're looking beyond our galaxy or looking at clusters of galaxies

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.000
this is just stars here

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.153
but the thing here is that you see a huge variety, you see some stars that are

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:40.467
shining red, right over here

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:42.819
and obviously, the apparent size, you cannot completely tell

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.933
because the different stars are at different distances and at difference intensities

00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:52.933
but the redder stars, these are stars in their red giant phase

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:55.400
or they're probably at their red giant phase

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.333
i haven't done specific research on these stars

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:58.957
but that's what we suspect

00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:00.467
those are in their red giant phase

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:04.933
the ones that are kind of in the yellowish white part of the spectrum

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:07.133
these are stars that are probably in their main sequence

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:10.892
probably not too different than own sun

00:04:10.892 --> 00:04:16.348
the ones that are in the yellowish white, closer to orange-yellowish-white part of the spectrum

00:04:16.348 --> 00:04:22.641
and the ones that look a little more bluish, or a little bit more greenish

00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:24.986
these are burning super fast

00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:27.867
let me see if i can find, this one looks a little big bluish to me,

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:34.800
these are burning super super fast, and so

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.218
the super massive stars, they burn kind of fast and furious and then just die out

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:43.000
but the smaller stars, the ones with less mass

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.020
they burn slower over a much much longer period of time

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.017
so the ones that are burning fast

00:04:50.017 --> 00:04:56.101
are emitting a lot of energy at the smaller wavelength part of the light spectrum

00:04:56.101 --> 00:05:00.267
that's why they look bluer or greener and these are going to be more massive stars

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.438
the ones that look white or bluer or greener

00:05:03.438 --> 00:05:04.933
while the redder ones

00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:09.800
the redder ones are less massive stars that are kind of in their super giant phase

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.000
and so they are at this point cooler than the main sequence stars

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.333
this right here, this right here is the cat's eye nebula

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.933
and the word nebula, this is actually a planetary nebula

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:27.680
this one here is a planetary nebula

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.019
and it's called a nebula because it is kind of this gas that's kinda floating out in space

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:38.067
but it's at a completely different kind of scale than this Eagle nebula

00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:41.200
that we drew over here

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.200
so when people talk about nebulas, they normally talking about something like the eagle nebula

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.467
these huge masses of interstellar gas

00:05:46.467 --> 00:05:51.318
when people talk about planetary nebulas; this is actually still a huge radius

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:53.267
but no where near 7 light years

00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:59.538
but this is the bi-product of a star shedding all of its outer material

00:05:59.538 --> 00:06:03.400
so at the center of this, we see kind of a mature star here

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.133
and it's shed of kind of its outer layers

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.174
and it did that in its red giant phase

00:06:09.174 --> 00:06:12.733
so the core would keep flaring up, having these hot explosions

00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:18.485
and every time you have one of these hot explosions, you had more and more of its outer layers getting

00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:21.156
pushed off, pushed off into space

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:23.467
forming this planetary nebula

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:25.267
so this as we see it right now

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:29.467
its still not yet a white dwarf, it is still an active star

00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:35.867
fusion is still occurring in this star, but it is well on its way onto becoming a a white dwarf

00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:37.502
once all its fuel runs out

00:06:37.502 --> 00:06:42.200
it's past its red giant phase, it's thrown all of this material into space and it's on its way onto becoming

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.333
a white dwarf

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:44.600
anyway hopefully you enjoyed that

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.267
i actually find all of these images to be pretty captivating

00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:50.800
especially the star field one

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.502
because this just inside of our galaxy

00:06:52.502 --> 00:06:55.933
hopefully it gives more appreciation for how many stars there are

00:06:55.933 --> 99:59:59.999
i mean this is just a small fraction of the 200 to 400 billion stars inside the milky way
