DYLAN THOMAS: Hello and welcome
to "What in the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.380
World," a show where
GeoGoogler's help you get the

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.500
most of your Enterprise
Maps products,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.079
with tips and advice.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.110
My name is Dylan Thomas.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.340
I'm a community manager
on the Maps team.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.590
And joining me today
is Dave McClusky.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.470
Dave is a solutions engineer,
helping Enterprise customers

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.900
architect and validate
their solutions.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.372
Hi Dave.

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:30.650
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Hi Dylan.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.920
DYLAN THOMAS: And so Dave,
today, is going to be talking

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.650
specifically about the Places
API, which is a set of APIs

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.050
that are part of the Enterprise
Maps solution set

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.950
product suite.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.280
So Dave, take it away.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.430
Let's see what we've
got today.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.830
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Sure, thanks.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.820
So yeah, Dylan mentioned today
I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.580
the Places API, which is a very
powerful API, that allows

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.010
you to integrate Google's
database of over 100 million

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.840
points of interest, into your
web or mobile application.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.690
If you're not familiar with the
Places API, it provides a

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.460
search capability to look for
local points of interest, like

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.080
restaurants, or any sorts of
landmarks, bring them into

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.480
your application.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.910
You can do a variety of searches
based off keywords,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.630
or text queries.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.310
And you can bring in some
detailed information about

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.530
these points of interest-- like
reviews, opening hours,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.730
costs, business photos, and
including Zagat reviews.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.230
So since we acquired Zagat
back in 2011, we've been

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.460
working to incorporate those
premium editorial reviews,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.280
into the Places API service.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.220
And allow you to leverage
those reviews in the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.510
application.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.960
Another really cool feature
about the Places API is the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.300
Autocomplete service.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.640
So this provides that type
ahead, address autocomplete

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.335
functionality that a lot of
users have come to expect from

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:55.580
a Google Maps service.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.560
Being able to type in an address
and select from a drop

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.500
down list suggested addresses.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.090
So I'll give you a quick demo,
just to show you here what I'm

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.699
talking about.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.390
OK, so this demonstration uses
the Places API to bring in

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.330
some local content into
a web application.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.130
So what you see here at the top
is the use of the Google

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.000
Maps API to show a Google Map
as well a street view image

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.250
here on the right.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.920
At the top the Google Map,
there's a search box.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.440
And this is using the
Autocomplete API.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.500
So you can use this Autocomplete
API not only to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.480
autocomplete an address query,
but also categories, or

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.230
restaurant names.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.100
So in this example, I'm
searching for restaurants.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.460
And I brought those results of
the restaurant search here

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.910
onto my map.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.422
I'm displaying it as markers
on the map, and if you look

00:02:51.422 --> 00:02:56.310
below, I'm also displaying
the text-based results.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.950
So all this information that
you're seeing here is coming

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.770
straight out of the
Places API.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.710
On the left, I'm showing
the Zagat score.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.380
And in the center here,
I'm showing the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.900
Zagat editorial review.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.240
And on the right, I'm showing
the business photo, that's

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.050
coming from the Places
API service.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.270
There's a lot more information
that's available in the Places

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.580
API that I'm not showing.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.000
You can bring in price,
for example.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.900
Is this an expensive restaurant,
an inexpensive

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.060
restaurant?

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.910
You can bring in information
like operating hours.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.190
Are they open now, or not?

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.920
You can also bring in Google+
reviews, as well.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.840
So in addition to the Zagat
reviews, there are those

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.290
Google+ reviews, as well, that
you can incorporate.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.500
DYLAN THOMAS: So this is
obviously pretty good for

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.650
entertainment and hospitality
industry.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.800
It looks like you sort of focus
this on restaurants in

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.790
your Autocomplete, as well.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.430
Is that something--

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.240
I think that's something
you can control, right?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.190
Whether you're going to focus
the Autocomplete results on

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.020
addresses, or a certain
kind of place.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.420
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Yeah, and it
turns out, in our Places API

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.960
database, like I mentioned,
there are

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.260
over 100 million places.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.620
We have something like 60
different categories you can

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.140
choose from.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.060
So I'm showing restaurants, but
you can search airports,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.140
banks, ATMs.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.750
There's tons of different
categories.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.959
Hospitals, it goes on
and on, really.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.670
So it's quite a bit
of information.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.070
And it is great, as you
mentioned-- hospitality sites,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.410
travel sites, hotel sites, any
sort of site that wants to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.630
enable location-aware content.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.390
This is very, very valuable,
especially for mobile

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.735
applications, as well.

00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:36.850
DYLAN THOMAS: OK, and then one
other thing I wanted to ask

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.130
there is, can you make it
sort of really obvious.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.940
Which parts of what you're
showing here are actually the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.750
Maps API, the JavaScript library
there, and which parts

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.180
are the Places API is
adding to the mix?

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.240
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Sure, so here
at the top, I'm showing a

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.785
Google Map.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:54.200
Here on the left, and a street
view image on the right,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.660
that's all coming from the
Google Maps JavaScript API.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.600
And it's pretty cool being
able to tie these

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.400
two services together.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.820
But all this location
information that I'm showing,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.900
this point of interest
information about the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.350
restaurants, these addresses of
the restaurants, that's all

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.480
coming from the Places
service.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.230
In this case, I'm using the
Places API web service.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.020
There is a JavaScript version
and a web service version.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.460
And I'll get into that in a
little bit more detail about

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.450
when you want to use which.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.920
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it, thanks.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.770
DAVE MCCLUSKY: So as I just
mentioned, there is a

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.170
JavaScript version, as well as
a web service version of the

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.232
Places API.

00:05:37.232 --> 00:05:39.780
I say typically, you want
to use the JavaScript

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.000
version, if you can.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.105
It's very easy to use.

00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:44.520
It's well integrated with
the Google Maps API.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.260
When you want to use the web
service version, is typically

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.650
when you need to call
it from a server.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.250
When you don't have a client
application, for example.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.990
If you need to make a lot bulk
or batch requests, the web

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.350
services are preferred.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.590
One thing to note, however, is
those Zagat reviews are only

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.330
currently available in
the web service.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.430
So if you want to incorporate
those premium editorial

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.480
reviews, you do need to be using
the web service to get

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.460
that information.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.450
DYLAN THOMAS: And I think what
you're showing here, also, is

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.690
one of the big topics that comes
up with our customers,

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.110
as they move from the free
version of the API, with its

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.810
capabilities, to the Enterprise,
or the business

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.870
version of the API, is real
quota consideration, and what

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.812
changes there.

00:06:32.812 --> 00:06:34.890
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Right, so when
you're using the free version

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.475
of the API, you start off with
1,000 free queries a day.

00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:41.260
If you verify your identity and
put in a credit card, that

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.300
gets upped to 100,000
queries a day.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.640
But you don't get the Zagat
reviews, that's only in the

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.820
Enterprise license.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.850
And you don't get support or
service level agreement.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.710
Your need your Enterprise
license for that.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.710
And of course with Enterprise
license, that can be sized for

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.780
whatever amount of quota that
you need, the number of

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.311
queries that you need per day,
we can size you for that.

00:07:05.311 --> 00:07:06.110
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it,
so it's sort of

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.110
the queries per second.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.630
Then it's also the maximum, the
total daily quota, are the

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.710
two things that you're looking
at when you're validating this

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.050
enterprise solution, versus
a free version, right?

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.860
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Exactly, and I
can explain a little bit more

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.170
about how we count quota
for the Places.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.160
DYLAN THOMAS: Oh
perfect, great.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.340
DAVE MCCLUSKY: So essentially
every sort of request to

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.940
Places API counts as a query,
as a request, against that

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.910
100,000 per day quota limit
that you have, or whatever

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.120
you've negotiate as part of
your business license.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.130
There are a few exceptions.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.780
So for example, if you're doing
a normal search, that

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.590
counts as a request.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.117
But we also have something
called a radar search, and a

00:07:49.117 --> 00:07:49.970
text search.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.830
These are a little bit different
types of searches

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.790
you can do.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.400
A radar search brings in
a lot more results.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.790
And a text search allows you
to perform more of a Google

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.215
natural language
type of query.

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:05.940
Like pizza in New York, a
string type of query.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.660
And those count as five
or 10 queries each.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.950
So It's a little bit more
than a standard search.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.730
The other sorts of operations
count as one query each, so

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.790
such as, bringing in
a Zagat review.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.510
That's an extra request.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.450
Or bringing in a business
photo, for example.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.970
That's an extra request.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:30.210
So you need to start looking
at your implementation to

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.960
really assess how many queries
you're going to be using.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.630
So it does vary heavily
by your implentation.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.909
And you can design your
applications to use a lot or

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.390
to use a little.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.490
The Autocomplete API is
something else we get asked a

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.480
lot about, as well.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.385
And that also counts as a query,
every time you call

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:51.305
that Autocomplete API service.

00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:53.040
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it, and I've
noticed that you've got some

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.930
things in red.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.630
These are clearly differences
between the web service and

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.800
the JavaScript API.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.950
So that's if you're doing some
sort of crowd action.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.540
If you're working with Places to
add and remove them, which

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.290
is a capability of the API, it
looks like that is something

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.800
you only want to be
doing, or can do

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.890
through the web service.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:10.520
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Yeah,
that's true.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.280
So for the most part, the
functionality is duplicated

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.440
across both services.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.200
There are a few differences.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.690
So some of the actions, these
are called actions, to add a

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.370
place, delete a place, those are
only available through the

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.890
web service version.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.712
As well as the Zagat reviews,
those are only available

00:09:26.712 --> 00:09:28.700
through the web service
version.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.410
DYLAN THOMAS: One other thing
I was just thinking of here,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.610
is that we showed an example
using the Maps API, and the

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.020
Street View API, but you
can also use the Places

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.360
Autocomplete, independent of
a map entirely, right?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.950
You can just use that to get
really good address input to

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.845
your application.

00:09:43.845 --> 00:09:44.580
DAVE MCCLUSKY: That's right.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.670
So you can use the
whole Places API

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.420
without a Google Map.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.000
We don't require that you show
the results on a Google Map.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.750
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.770
I think we have some--

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.420
maybe some idea about what
you could do with that.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.560
Which other kind of map you
might want to put that on

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.310
downstream.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.060
But yeah, you don't have to
have a map while you're

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.790
finding the address, I think.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.080
DAVE MCCLUSKY: So you can't
Places data on a non-Google

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.060
Map, but it doesn't have
to be on a map.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.500
DYLAN THOMAS: Because that
would just not be cool.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.520
DAVE MCCLUSKY: So maybe I can
walk you through an example.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.070
Because that quota does get a
little complicated sometimes.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.180
I can show you that example
of the demo I just showed.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.520
And show you how many counts, or
queries against that quota

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520
that would take up.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.900
DYLAN THOMAS: Excellent.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.890
DAVE MCCLUSKY: So in
the example that I

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.150
showed, typing in--

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.680
so taking a look at the
screen shot here--

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.950
I'm starting to type in a
query, so for the word

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.940
restaurant.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.260
Say I type in the first
four letters--

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.540
R-E-S-T. And if I call the
Autocomplete API each time,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.880
that would be four queries
right there.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.820
When I perform a text search,
that could be 10 queries.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.700
And then say if I show six
results, and for each one of

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.130
those results, I show
a Zagat review.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.140
And for each one of those
results, I show a business

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.040
photo, that would be six
more requests each.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.430
So just showing this page for
the screenshot here that that

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.930
I'm showing, would be about 26
requests to the Places API.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:06.690
DYLAN THOMAS: Oh, this
is really helpful.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.370
So presumably this is the kind
of thing that you talk with

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.900
customers about, when they're
going through an

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.030
implementation, is to just take
a really close look at

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.040
how they are using it.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.610
And what the impact is on their
quota, and also their

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.926
performance on the page.

00:11:20.926 --> 00:11:22.680
DAVE MCCLUSKY: That's right.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.370
How you design this application
is going to affect

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.210
how many requests
you're making.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:33.820
For example, if you wanted to
have the user click before you

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.740
show a Zagat review, you could
optimize the number of queries

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.082
you make by waiting for that
user action before you make

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:40.690
the request.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.270
As opposed to showing them all
automatically, like I am here.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.750
DYLAN THOMAS: Oh, that's a good
watch point, actually.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.640
I didn't think of that one.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.830
That's a really good tip.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.410
That's why we're
talking to you.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.660
So let me just ask you one
other question then.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.250
It seems like some of the
Enterprise angle of this is

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.690
quite heavily geared towards
the management of quota and

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.180
keeping a watch on things.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.170
Do you have any suggestions
about how people can plan for

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.720
the initial launch of their
site, or track for things that

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.730
you've seen, like the quota
being blown out, due to a very

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.430
successful website launch,
for example?

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.680
What are the kinds of things you
tell customers they should

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.440
do, to get ready for
that kind of thing?

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.050
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Sure, so I mean
the most important thing you

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.960
can do is upfront planning.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.850
Understanding how we count
quota, and planning your

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.030
application accordingly,
to make

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.590
efficient use of your quota.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.170
The next thing is we offer a
variety of usage reports.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.770
So within the API console, you
can track your usage against

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:41.250
these services to see how much
usage you're getting.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.850
And track that over time.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.570
And then as you're approaching,
running out of

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.980
quota, we do send emails
alerting you at various

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.200
points, that you're reaching
the end of the quota.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.780
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it, so you can
sort of do the proactive

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.210
thing yourself.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.410
But then if you start getting
emails from Google letting you

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.390
know you're getting close, then
you probably want to take

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.580
a close look at that, and
potentially get in touch with

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.830
Google, right?

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.240
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Right, and
definitely monitoring those

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.340
usage reports over time to
make sure there are no

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.100
surprises is really key.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.740
DYLAN THOMAS: Cool,
great, good tips.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.390
Thanks very much.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.150
So Dave, I think we're pretty
much at time now.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.550
I want to thank you for your
insights and going over the

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.730
products, really helpful.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.820
DAVE MCCLUSKY: Thanks, Dylan.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.000
DYLAN THOMAS: And we'll
see you next time on

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.570
"What in the World."
