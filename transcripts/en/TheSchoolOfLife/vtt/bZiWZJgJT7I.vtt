00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.940
The 17th century English philosopher, John Locke,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.400
is to be remembered for his wise and brilliant contributions

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.520
to three great issues that continue to concern us to this day:

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.080
how we should educate our children,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.920
who should rule over us,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.160
and what we should do about people who have different religious ideas to us.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.660
Locke was born into a quiet Somerset village in 1632.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.960
He was 10 years old when the English civil war broke out,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.860
and his father became captain in the parliamentary army.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.820
King Charles I was publicly executed in 1649, just a few feet away from where Locke was studying:

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.160
at Westminster School.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.280
The screams of the crowds heard in the library marked him deeply.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400
Locke went on to study medicine at Oxford

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.840
and planned to be a doctor,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.640
but his life changed significantly when, by chance,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.860
he became acquainted with the dashing and highly ambitious Greek politician, Antony Ashley Cooper--

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.740
known as the "First Earl of Shaftesbury," who'd come to Oxford to look for a cure for a liver disease he had.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.280
Cooper suggested that Locke move to London to become part of his household.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.320
The offer was hard to resist, and once part of Cooper's entourage,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.200
Locke began to participate in the great scientific, educational, religious, and political debates of the day.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.580
Along the way, he also helped to cure Shaftesbury of his liver complaint, earning his lifelong gratitude.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.700
The first question Locke grew fascinated by, was what to do with people who don't agree with your religious views.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.420
In breaking away from the Catholic Church under Henry VIII in the 16th century,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.240
English Protestantism had started a process of noisy questioning of religion

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.060
that couldn't now easily be stopped.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.600
Because this was threatening to get out of hand, there were arguments that there should be

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.400
total government control over religion, and a hard crack down on dissenters.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.060
But Locke became one of the foremost advocates of freedom of belief in his beautiful, essay concerning

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.640
toleration, written in 1667.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.160
Here, he advocated toleration on the basis of three points.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.460
Firstly, 'because Earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings in general, cannot dependably

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.260
evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints.'

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.140
Secondly, 'even if they could, enforcing a single "true religion" would never work, because you can't be

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.920
compelled into belief through violence.'

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.020
And thirdly, 'coercing religious uniformity leads to far more social disorder than allowing diversity.'

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.640
Locke argued that the ultimate aim of the state was just to preserve the quiet and comfortable living of men in

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.320
society, but that it'd have nothing to do with the good of men's souls.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.640
Religion was a personal choice, and churches were voluntary organizations,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.440
which could set their own rules and be left to it.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.260
It was thanks to Locke's influence, that the idea of locking up

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.720
people for their beliefs fell entirely out of favor.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.620
By the 18th century, other European nations looked with envy at England;

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.880
a place where what you happen to believe was simply deemed

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.400
irrelevant to your statues or prospects.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.700
This was a truly remarkable achievement for one book, by one man to have set in train,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.280
but Locke didn't stop there. In 1689, he published a second extraordinary book;

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.460
The Two Treatises of Government.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.520
This tried to answer the question of  who should rule the country and on what legitimate bases.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.440
One common yet increasingly fanciful notion at the time, was that political authority derived directly from God.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.900
But a more recent explanation from Thomas Hobbes had asserted that

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.260
the totalitarian power of kings was justified by their ability to keep order

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.940
and prevent repetitions of the chaos that had rained; Hobbes had insisted,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.500
in the time before powerful governments and that he had called;

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.980
the state of nature.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.660
By painting the state of nature in the darkest colors, Hobbes had asked his readers

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.000
to set themselves low expectations, for what a decent ruler was meant to be.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.120
Anything better than the savagery of the Stone Age was legitimate,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.620
and rulers have no responsibility to guarantee religious freedom or human rights.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.620
But now, in the First Treatise, Locke thoroughly demolished the Scriptural claim;

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.460
that God had created kings.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.220
And in the Second Treatise, he took on Hobbes's ideas about the state of nature.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.800
Locke agreed with Hobbes that before without government, there would have been a State of Nature.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.200
But he disagreed what this place would actually have been like,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.980
he argued; that it would have been broadly peaceful, and that in agreeing to summit to governments,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.640
people have therefore not, fearfully agreed to surrender all their rights.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.280
In fact, they possessed a range of alienable or natural rights that no ruler could ever take away.
