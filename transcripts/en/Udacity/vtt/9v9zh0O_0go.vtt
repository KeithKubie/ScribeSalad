00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.190
Looking at this plot, we can see that we have

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.290
some funky outliers in here. And down here is the bulk

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.450
of our data. To determine good x and y limits for

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.300
our axis, we can look at 95th percentile, using the Quantile

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.718
command. This will let us see the ninety-fifth percentile of

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:18.890
www_likes_received. And the ninety-fifth percentile

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.800
of likes received. And hopefully, we

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.230
should get rid of some of these points. To do that,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.920
I'll use the x lim layer and the y lim layer.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.240
We'll pass zero as the lower bound for x lim, and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.689
for the upper limit, we'll use the ninety-fifth percent quantile for

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.600
the ww likes received. Similarly, for likes received, we'll use the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.890
same sort of syntax and just replace the variable. Zero will

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.910
be our lower bound, and the ninety fifth percentile for likes

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.980
received will be our upper bound. When I run this code,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.330
we're in effect zooming in on that lower portion of the

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.990
graph that we had over here. The slope of the line of

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.580
best fit through these points is the correlation. And, we can

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.740
even add to the plot by using some code. We do

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.230
that by adding a smoother, and setting the method to a

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.140
linear model or lm. Notice too that I also colored it

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.610
red so that we could see it through the black points.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.140
Let's quantify this relationship with a number. So what's the correlation

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.540
between our two variables? I don't want you to have to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.080
subset the data, so just include all the data points and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.890
then round your answer to three decimal places.
