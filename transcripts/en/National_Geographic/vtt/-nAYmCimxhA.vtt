00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.834
This trial and
error approach became

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:06.567
the scientific method, the
basis of all modern medicine.

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:10.233
Observe, experiment,
formulate a hypothesis,

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.734
and then test it again
and again until it's

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.300
proven false or true.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.300
It's a method passed
down to us by the most

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.734
famous graduate of the
Asklepion, Galen of Pergamon.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.300
HOST: Roughly 200 years
after the birth of Christ,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.700
Galen helped lay the
origins of modern medicine.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.233
Galen was a fight doctor who
actually managed to write down

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.500
his best practices.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.734
And writing down what
he knew to be true,

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:39.734
he created a corpus
that was not just useful

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.667
but was in fact
revered for centuries.

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:46.800
[tiger roar]

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:54.834
HOST: With each procedure,
Galen was diving

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.934
into undiscovered territory.

00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:00.934
Lucky for us, he
kept detailed notes

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:05.567
and recorded all his
successes and his failures.
