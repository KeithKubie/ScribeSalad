00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:10.302
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:11.760
GORDON CHAMBERS:
So now we're going

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.860
to do some songs from the
most current album, "Sincere."

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.755
I shot this video of this
song in my house in Brooklyn.

00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:20.020
Is Brooklyn in the house?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.030
[CHEERING]

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.510
GORDON CHAMBERS: I shot
it right in my own house.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.100
And it featured in it an
amazing acting performance

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.257
by a friend of ours who's an
amazing singer named Sy Smith.

00:00:31.257 --> 00:00:33.090
So if you check out the
video for this song,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.686
you'll see her acting
her behind off.

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:38.060
And you'll also see a woman
who surprised me and came out

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.290
tonight.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.360
She's also in the video.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.330
Miss Ebony Jo-Ann
is in the house.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.464
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:46.630
GORDON CHAMBERS: Acting her
behind off in the video.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.280
You gotta love soul artists,
because we work together,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.571
and we're there for each
other when we need each other,

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:52.360
aren't we, Ebony?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.510
And I think she's
working on her album.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.480
So anyway, this song is a song
that, actually, Troy Taylor

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.678
wanted Trey Songz to record.

00:01:02.678 --> 00:01:05.740
[SINGING] And Trey said,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.589
And I said yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:10.880
It's called "I Can't Love
You (If You Don't Love You)."

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.237
Can I get a witness?

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:12.617
