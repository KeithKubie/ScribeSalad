00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:06.729
 Big Fish was founded 15 years ago as a simple game studio. 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.948
 We have become with time an important company in developing 

00:00:08.948 --> 00:00:12.350
 Mobile games for several platforms. 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.360
 We've been designing Android games since it was launched. 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.246
 It was great to see how focused developers' tools were 

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:21.125
 And global reach 

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:25.002
 Which helped us deliver better games to a larger audience. 

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.210
 It is a wonderful thing now that we can use 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.215
 Tools such as Open Beta for experimental use 

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:32.546
 To gather information that allows us to make a greater effort 

00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:35.943
 In the development of user-focused design. 

00:00:35.943 --> 00:00:37.918
 The games were previously subject to trial release 

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:40.274
 A process that was very satisfactory to us, 

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.058
 We were just waiting to make sure all the features were available 

00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:43.891
 The game is published. 

00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:45.266
 Now we use Open Beta 

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.492
 We really want to put the game directly to users 

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:50.457
 More early during the process. 

00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:52.183
 Cooking Craze is a time management game, 

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:54.833
 Where the game is played from the perspective of the chef. 

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:56.133
 Posted Big Fish Cooking Craze 

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:59.015
 Working with a partner called ElaFun who developed it. 

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.198
 This is the first time we offer a free time management game 

00:01:01.198 --> 00:01:04.253
 The experience was very enjoyable and impressed the players. 

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:06.693
 When comparing the launch of previous games 

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:08.337
 With the latest launch of Cooking Craze 

00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:09.568
 Open Beta was used 

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:12.006
 We noticed a significant reduction in the crash rate 

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:13.907
 About 21%. 

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.894
 And we also got a larger amount 

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:17.955
 Of the comments, about 10 fold. 

00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:18.842
 We have also noted, 

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:21.929
 Based on a larger sample size, no 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.142
 1 or 2 star ratings in Cooking Craze. 

00:01:25.142 --> 00:01:26.376
 In the previous game version, 

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:29.174
 We got a few outstanding comments. 

00:01:29.174 --> 00:01:30.822
 Advantages of using Open Beta 

00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:33.192
 You can still play games globally. 

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:36.799
 This allows the marketing team to improve their operations, 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.510
 Acquisition partners and paid campaigns 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.410
 Which was not available to them at the initial launch via GeoLock. 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.661
 Before using Open Beta, we were launching games empirically 

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:49.605
 In a few initial launch countries, 

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:51.936
 We used that process to find out all the metrics 

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:52.954
 Which we are looking for. 

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:55.849
 With Open Beta, we can launch the game globally immediately, 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.970
 We can collect data from a wider range 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.969
 Of players that express more accurately 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.551
 What we will see when the game officially launched. 

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:08.985
 With Open Beta, we no longer assume any restrictions. 

00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:11.350
 What we have to do is launch the game and publish it and observe what happens, 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.720
 We can interact in the event of a problem 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.125
 Rather than assuming a problem occurs. 

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.452
 We check the key performance indicators of the game, 

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:20.894
 Take a look at the team that offers the game 

00:02:20.894 --> 00:02:21.961
 And on the scale of its capabilities. 

00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.641
 We look at a lot of metrics 

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:25.101
 In Android dynamic cursors. 

00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:26.144
 In the pilot release, 

00:02:26.144 --> 00:02:29.014
 Take a look at retention rates. 

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:30.982
 Users return to the game on the second day 

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:32.270
 Or on the third day? 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.741
 We usually check the retention rate of D1, D7 and D30. 

00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:38.641
 Then take a look at the metrics for making a material profit. 

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:40.304
 If the metrics are satisfactory to us, 

00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:42.953
 Realize that it is time to move on 

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:44.695
 Official launch phase. 

00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:47.229
 We have increased retention rates 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.128
 Significantly. 

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:51.611
 Where the retention rate D1 increased by about nine percentage points, 

00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:54.243
 The D7 rate increased by about eight percentage points, 

00:02:54.243 --> 00:02:57.057
 The D30 rate is about 5 percentage points. 

00:02:57.057 --> 00:02:58.357
 One of the great features of Open Beta 

00:02:58.357 --> 00:03:00.025
 We can collect comments 

00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:02.365
 Of the experimental players without appearing 

00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:05.115
 Comments and ratings for all users. 

00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:08.537
 Now if we fail something, we will not get negative feedback 

00:03:08.537 --> 00:03:10.072
 Remain in our permanent record 

00:03:10.072 --> 00:03:12.452
 During the game life cycle. 

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:14.356
 I recommend all game developers 

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:17.971
 Take a look at the tools in Play Console. 

00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:21.099
 Because we use a lot of these tools and take advantage of them too. 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.135
 During the past year alone, we changed the way 

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:26.202
 The development of games and the issuance of a large, 

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:28.285
 Depending on Open Beta only.
