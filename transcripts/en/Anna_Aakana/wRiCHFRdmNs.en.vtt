00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:02.235
Do you ever approach a tray of chocolate chip cookies,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.995
only to have the soul crushing realization that

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.680
they're actually ~oatmeal raisin~?

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.000
SOUL CRUSHING!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.740
Yeah...that has nothing to do with today's video,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.740
but honestly this happens way too often to me,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.400
so oatmeal raisin just needs to not exist anymore

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.040
if you like oatmeal raisin, I have to question your integrity as a human being.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.300
I QUESTION YOUR INTEGRITY AS A HUMAN BEING!

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.940
But, yeah ... anyway, I overanalyze things A LOT.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.020
Mostly really stupid things.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.380
So, I know the frequency of his texting has decreased,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.600
but not necessarily the consistency in which he initiates conversation

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.755
and he has an 80% initiation rate

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.360
but only 20% of the time he actually address a previous message that I've sent

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.315
What about the content of the messages?

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.520
Has that experienced a shift?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700
Energetically, it's at an all time low

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.460
What about pic to text ratio?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.460
Pretty high, all things considered, but that could totally be an occupational side effect

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.400
[together]: Selfies?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.060
Galore.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.040
[together]: Wow, okay...

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.715
[talking over each other] I'll go ahead and make the spreadsheet.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.200
In my time, as an overanalyzer, [ba dum bum]

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.580
There's a few recurring themes.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.260
so how do you know if you're one?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.340
1. Instead of living in the moment, and feeling with your intuition and enjoying what is...

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.940
you're very preoccupied with either analyzing your past history and mistakes

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.260
and how to possibly decipher helpful solutions

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.300
which also illicit strict embarrassment/punishment feelings

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.235
or you're consulting the unknown future for all the potential scenarios

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:19.055
of how these timelines could play out and what your reactions would be

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:21.095
in those said timelines

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.995
Complex, rhetorical scenes are turned over and over in your mind

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.620
no matter what you're doing,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.000
and you've convinced yourself that though this is not reality

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.680
these illusions are actually helpful preparation for all the possible realities that you may come across

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.760
Confused?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.740
YOU'RE NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE AN OVERANALYZER,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.600
AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.100
AND I HOPE YOU FEEL PERSONALLY ATTACKED.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.835
2. You play out the worst case scenario fantasies

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.815
in your head. On a loop.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.800
This is an extension of 1.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.140
Instead of really indulging in the positive scenarios from these limitless timeline

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.380
thereby sort of creating some kind of like, manifestation, or create a visualization

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.220
you dwell on all the worst stuff.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.600
because of course, that would happen to you.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.380
and when it does, damn it, you are going to be prepared!

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.160
Emotionally, Mentally, Physically! Bring it on!

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.500
I'm ready for everyone and anyone to die at any moment and I have a spare change of underwear in my trunk

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.500
and you know why.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.025
3. You observe everything, except what's actually happening.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.720
[dramatic music]

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.400
What do you think Anna?
Anna : Huh?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.615
4. You take little things very seriously.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.480
You're 2 months old now.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.320
You have to start thinking about your future.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.260
Look, I'm sorry, but if you don't keep up your social media profiles, how is anyone supposed to know to adopt you?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.460
Do you want to stay at santa dora for the rest of your life?

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.180
Look, look at your Instagram.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.700
...it's pathetic.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.980
I wouldn't want to adopt you based off of this.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.740
You really need to start thinking in terms of aesthetics.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.420
And finally, we've got the pink links. You know what I'm talking about...

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.860
You do a google search, and EVERY link on the first 3 pages is pink

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.100
because, GUESS WHAT?

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.240
[over dramatic music] You've already done the search 1000 times!

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.260
Overanalyzing things is not helpful, and I'm speaking from experience.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.755
It is basically unnecessary worry.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.560
If you're chronically obsessing, overthinking, or overanalyzing

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.780
it usually stems from you trying to resolve uncertainty about the future.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.820
And I get it!

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.840
I am very uncomfortable with uncertainty.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.080
It is the worst.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.500
Who wants to be in a constant state of  unknown about everything?

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.520
But unfortunately, that's just the baseline of reality.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.560
I mean, there's just so much out of your control, and so much that we can't be certain about.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.320
Changing your relationship to uncertainty is the only way to stop constantly seeking answers

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.980
for a question that only time has.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.720
Allow yourself to feel uncertain

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.300
Stop researching, stop harassing your friends and family, and allow uncertainty.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.480
In fact, maybe try to embrace it.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.040
And I know, it's easier said than done, but trust me it's like a rollercoaster of acceptance

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.160
that I've ridden and am currently on the ride for constantly

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.140
But the only person who really loses out when you overanalyze, is you.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.220
You lose both time and energy.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.320
so reign it in!

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.620
