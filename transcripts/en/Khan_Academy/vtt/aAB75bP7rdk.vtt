00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:01.616
- [Narrator] In this
video, I wanna explore

00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:03.421
the question of what impact

00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:07.104
does the environment
have on human migration.

00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:09.320
We have a couple specific examples here,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.495
and before we dig into
those, I want to make

00:00:11.495 --> 00:00:13.549
a few broader points about the environment

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.763
as a historical factor.

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:17.640
The first of those is
simply that the environment

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.196
does have impacts on what
people are able to do,

00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:22.481
on how and where they're able to move.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.654
We might be looking at
is the climate suitable

00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:26.172
for practicing agriculture?

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:27.933
Food production is such an important part

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:32.199
of human movement and human
survival in new environments.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.251
We might look at transportation.

00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:35.837
In the Pacific Ocean, for example,

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:38.093
getting from island to island requires

00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:40.444
that you have technology
that allows you to travel

00:00:40.444 --> 00:00:42.921
over the ocean for long distances.

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.590
The second point to
consider, more broadly,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.772
is that human beings, when
they move to new areas,

00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:50.251
tend to have impacts on the environment.

00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:52.259
If they're bringing new
plants or new animals

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:55.026
to a place where they
haven't previously existed,

00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:59.104
that's going to have some
impacts on the new place.

00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:01.223
Finally, this isn't to
say that the environment

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:04.560
is wholly explanatory of
why history played out

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.185
the way it did, but we
also don't want to dismiss

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:11.152
the environment as a
potential explanatory factor.

00:01:11.152 --> 00:01:13.427
With those bigger points in mind,

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:16.690
let's start by looking at a
specific example in Africa,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.012
known as the Bantu
migration, or, more often,

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.347
the Bantu expansion
into sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:22.347 --> 00:01:24.438
When I say sub-Saharan Africa,

00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:26.533
that's just the region
of Africa that is south

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.807
of the Sahara desert, and
I'll shade that in here

00:01:28.807 --> 00:01:32.474
so that you can see
where I'm talking about.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.728
Next, what I have is an overlay in yellow

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.719
that shows the areas of Africa

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.886
where a Bantu language is the
predominant language spoken.

00:01:43.324 --> 00:01:44.747
The question that raises is

00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:46.858
why does so much of sub-Saharan Africa

00:01:46.858 --> 00:01:48.591
speak a Bantu language?

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.339
There aren't any written
records of Bantu speakers

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:53.643
and how they moved and
what they were thinking

00:01:53.643 --> 00:01:55.428
when they did move, but there is evidence,

00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:58.606
in terms of how the languages
relate to one another,

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:00.578
and there's also archeological evidence.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:02.173
One of the helpful things about studying

00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:06.509
the Bantu Expansion is that
from about 500, 400 B.C. on,

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.327
they were using iron tools.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.408
They had iron-making technology,

00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:12.735
and those tools, around with pottery

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:15.453
that's distinctive to
Bantu-speaking cultures,

00:02:15.453 --> 00:02:18.104
can help archeologists
trace how Bantu speakers

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.586
spread throughout Africa over time.

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:23.245
Linguists who have studied
how these languages

00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:25.535
relate to one another and archeologists

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:28.285
who have looked at evidence
of how Bantu speakers

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:30.454
migrated and moved throughout Africa

00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:32.499
are fairly confident that they originated

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.069
somewhere here in west
Africa, and from there

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.756
spread to the south,
as well as to the east,

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:41.184
over to what's known as the
Great Lakes Region of Africa.

00:02:41.184 --> 00:02:43.821
Then, from there, farther south again.

00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.063
That tells us how people
moved through Africa.

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:47.729
What pattern did they follow?

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.051
The next question we wanna
try and figure out the answer

00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:54.522
to is why did they migrate
to the places that they did?

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:56.838
One thing that we know
about Bantu-speaking peoples

00:02:56.838 --> 00:02:59.305
is that they tended to
have fairly consistent

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:01.986
and common agricultural practices.

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:03.554
Among the crops that they were growing

00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:04.779
were

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:05.850
millet

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.189
and sorghum.

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.725
Once they got to the great lakes region

00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:10.632
and started moving
south, you also see them

00:03:10.632 --> 00:03:12.708
adopting cattle herding.

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:14.836
Pictures of the cattle that they would've

00:03:14.836 --> 00:03:16.752
probably had here.

00:03:16.752 --> 00:03:18.868
What these crops and these
cattle have in common,

00:03:18.868 --> 00:03:21.143
all of them tend to thrive in what's known

00:03:21.143 --> 00:03:25.792
as a tropical savanna, or a
semi-tropical savanna climate.

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:27.981
Sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception

00:03:27.981 --> 00:03:30.494
of this rainforest region here,

00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:33.779
and this high desert down in the south,

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:37.454
is largely tropical, or
semi-tropical, savanna.

00:03:37.454 --> 00:03:40.339
When we put the overlay back
up of where Bantu-speakers

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.191
are the majority, we can
see that sort of corresponds

00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:45.130
with those climate variations.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.452
You see them populate
really all of the areas

00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:52.103
that are favorable to their
agricultural practices.

00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:53.064
That should make sense.

00:03:53.064 --> 00:03:54.368
If we think about migration

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:57.466
as a risk-reward calculation,

00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:59.652
you need to make sure that any place

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:01.053
that you're migrating to

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:04.472
is gonna be able to provide you with food.

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:06.000
To bring that back to our big theme

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.510
of how does environment impact migration,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.697
we really see in the Bantu Expansion

00:04:10.697 --> 00:04:14.061
the role of climate affecting
what kind of agriculture

00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:16.559
is possible, and that
determines what areas

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:19.253
look attractive for migration.

00:04:19.253 --> 00:04:20.936
The next region we want to look at,

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:22.716
the next migration we want to study

00:04:22.716 --> 00:04:27.244
is that of people moving
throughout the Pacific Islands.

00:04:27.244 --> 00:04:31.388
You can see the path this
migration probably took here.

00:04:31.388 --> 00:04:33.933
When we talk about
expansion in the Pacific,

00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:35.809
we're looking at
something somewhat similar

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.487
to the Bantu Expansion in Africa,

00:04:37.487 --> 00:04:39.958
and that, again, we don't
have any written records

00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.592
from the people who moved here,

00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:44.955
so again, we're relying on
linguistic, or language-based,

00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:48.889
evidence, as well as
archeological evidence.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.215
This evidence helps us sort of divide up

00:04:51.215 --> 00:04:54.906
the Pacific into three distinct regions.

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:58.178
We have what's called Malanesia in blue,

00:04:58.178 --> 00:05:02.095
and Micronesia in red,
and Polynesia in purple.

00:05:05.136 --> 00:05:07.680
Again, these are all people
who were originally speaking

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.968
some sort of Austronesian language,

00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:13.800
very similar culturally,
but they can look at

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.564
how there have been small
changes in cultural artifacts,

00:05:17.564 --> 00:05:20.244
changes in languages, even in the genetics

00:05:20.244 --> 00:05:21.681
of the people and the animals

00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:23.421
in different regions of the Pacific,

00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:25.732
to kind of get a sense of where they were

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:28.965
at what time, and that
gives us this probable route

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:31.015
of migration that we saw.

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:33.775
Thinking again about environment
impacting this migration

00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:35.383
into the Pacific Ocean,

00:05:35.383 --> 00:05:37.390
there are a couple of important factors.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.629
The first and obvious one
is that getting across

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.373
large stretches of ocean is going to pose

00:05:42.373 --> 00:05:44.862
a difficulty; it's an obstacle.

00:05:44.862 --> 00:05:47.495
The way that people overcame
this obstacle in the Pacific,

00:05:47.495 --> 00:05:50.424
was they came up with
better sailing technology.

00:05:50.424 --> 00:05:52.094
I can pull up here a picture

00:05:52.094 --> 00:05:54.761
of a re-creation of a catamaran.

00:05:56.157 --> 00:05:57.546
This technology was really important

00:05:57.546 --> 00:05:59.602
for traveling long distances in the ocean

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:01.913
because, to get out in the open ocean,

00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:04.871
you need a sturdy, a durable ship

00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:08.169
that's gonna hold up to wind and waves.

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.016
Even though this is a modern re-creation,

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:13.101
it gives us a good sense of
what the technology was like.

00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:16.679
You can see how that would
be a more durable craft

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:19.096
than, say, a canoe by itself.

00:06:20.182 --> 00:06:23.052
This allows people to
travel between islands.

00:06:23.052 --> 00:06:25.044
The other issue, environmentally speaking,

00:06:25.044 --> 00:06:27.532
that poses an obstacle to
expansion in the Pacific

00:06:27.532 --> 00:06:29.808
is that a lot of these
islands are really small.

00:06:29.808 --> 00:06:31.339
You're probably noticing that some of them

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:33.857
are quite difficult to see
on the satellite image,

00:06:33.857 --> 00:06:35.732
and they don't have a lot of arable,

00:06:35.732 --> 00:06:38.603
or farmable, land on them,

00:06:38.603 --> 00:06:41.563
and so they can't support
large populations,

00:06:41.563 --> 00:06:43.523
and this is probably one
reason why there is continued

00:06:43.523 --> 00:06:46.387
expansion in the Pacific
over a long period of time,

00:06:46.387 --> 00:06:48.574
is because the islands
themselves can't support

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:49.935
very large populations.

00:06:49.935 --> 00:06:52.233
If a population grows to a certain point,

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:55.178
some people have to leave.

00:06:55.178 --> 00:06:56.807
To deal with this fact that the islands

00:06:56.807 --> 00:06:58.323
didn't provide a lot of natural food,

00:06:58.323 --> 00:07:01.204
people would bring their
own food supplies with them.

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:03.909
They'd bring things like
sweet potatoes and yams

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:07.233
and taro root, and they
would bring animals as well,

00:07:07.233 --> 00:07:09.202
so chickens, and you have a picture here,

00:07:09.202 --> 00:07:13.673
this is what's called a
Southeast Asian red junglefowl,

00:07:13.673 --> 00:07:17.191
and it's the precursor
to domestic chickens.

00:07:17.191 --> 00:07:18.082
It can give you a sense of what

00:07:18.082 --> 00:07:20.211
some of these chickens
probably looked like.

00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:21.608
They brought pigs.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.268
They also had a small breed of dog.

00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:24.962
The dog breed is extinct now,

00:07:24.962 --> 00:07:26.722
but we have some pictures that were drawn

00:07:26.722 --> 00:07:30.510
by some early European
explorers of the Pacific.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.267
People would bring these items with them.

00:07:32.267 --> 00:07:34.943
They'd bring these animals with
them onto these new islands.

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:36.695
They would grow the crops.

00:07:36.695 --> 00:07:40.121
They would raise the animals
and use them as a food source.

00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:41.347
To go back to our original list

00:07:41.347 --> 00:07:45.810
of big takeaways, this gets
into this idea of environmental

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.397
impact of bringing these
new plants and animals.

00:07:48.397 --> 00:07:50.161
What happens is that
people bring these plants,

00:07:50.161 --> 00:07:51.796
they bring these animals
that are not native

00:07:51.796 --> 00:07:54.617
to these islands onto
these islands and use them.

00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:56.767
They farm them; they raise them for food;

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.465
and in most cases, people
are able to sort of

00:07:58.465 --> 00:08:01.974
strike a balance of
maintaining a food supply

00:08:01.974 --> 00:08:04.028
with these crops and
animals that they've brought

00:08:04.028 --> 00:08:06.095
and not destroying the island environment,

00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:07.816
because, obviously, that
would have consequences

00:08:07.816 --> 00:08:10.270
for their ability to
continue to live there.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.780
Hopefully, it's clear at this point

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.090
that environment definitely played a role

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.075
in these migrations, in these expansions.

00:08:18.075 --> 00:08:20.389
Certainly, this isn't only
about environmental factors,

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:22.682
but in both cases, it
would be very difficult

00:08:22.682 --> 00:08:25.506
to explain what happened
if you didn't include

00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:27.839
these environmental factors.
