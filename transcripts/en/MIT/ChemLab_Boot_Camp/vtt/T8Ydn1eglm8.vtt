00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.525
HANSOL: She's our TA.

00:00:01.525 --> 00:00:03.784
TAs know everything.

00:00:03.784 --> 00:00:09.218
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:10.980
LINA: Something bad happened.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.000
My flask tipped over.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.450
Something bad always happens
whenever I do an experiment.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.990
It's either my flask tips over
or something explodes.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.380
Do you make mistakes too?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.345
PHIL: I still make mistakes.

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:25.240
LINA: Wait really?

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.770
What did you do?

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.750
PHIL: What did I do?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.000
LINA: Yeah.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.540
PHIL: I've had some
pretty bad days.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.790
KATHARINA RIBBECK: My
worst day in lab...

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.030
JUSTIN BULLOCK:It's more like
a worse like two weeks.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.680
GRACE YAO: My worst day in lab
had to be the day where I had

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.880
to smash fish.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.360
PHIL: One day in undergrad, I
was re-crystallizing something

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.290
on a hotplate.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.160
NICOLE KAVANAUGH: I was doing
an RNA purification.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.460
GRACE YAO: First of all, I'm
a little scared of fish.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.510
I had this mortar and pestle.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.156
PHIL: I set up this big huge
two liter flask on a ring

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:04.800
stand and everything
connected to a hose

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.710
GRACE YAO: And I had to put the
little fish in and smash

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.840
it to powder.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.950
The fish head just flew
off onto the floor

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.900
PHIL: And before I could fasten
it, the hose whipped

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.680
the flask across the room and
it shattered all over.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.500
NICOLE KAVANAUGH: And I
made some poison gas.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.610
JUSTIN BULLOCK: By the end, I
pretty much had nothing left

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.660
and it was just a failure.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.770
PHIL: You're going to
cry at that point.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.580
Your day cannot get any
worse than that.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.050
ALONA BIRJINIUK: The very
first time it's always

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.310
nerve-wracking.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.312
This is your experiment.

00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:35.100
And if things don't go right-

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950
BEN OFORI-OKAI: There are going
to be times where you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.670
may not feel like your
going to be capable.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.140
But the truth is that
you actually are.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.540
You just have to like step
back, take a deep breath,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.300
remember like who you are
like where you came.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.765
KATHARINA RIBBECK: You have
failures of course.

00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:52.950
And you're very disappointed
and then redo it.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.150
But this is local and then
you have to move on.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.100
LINA: Something bad always
happens and I always have to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.840
start over.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.690
But Tengfei told me that when
she was an undergrad she was

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.460
even worse than I was
and look at her now.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.280
She's teaching us how to
do all these things.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.880
It's so encouraging because
if she can learn,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.040
then I can learn too.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.280
And someday I'll be just
as good as she is.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.980
PHIL: Oh wow, I really should've
been wearing safety

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.480
glasses here.
