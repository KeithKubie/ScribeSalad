the economy in 2009 partly the reason
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.359
the economy in 2009 partly the reason
for that is that term the economy is in

for that is that term the economy is in
 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.130
for that is that term the economy is in

many respects subset of the environment
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.019
many respects subset of the environment
I think people are beginning to realize

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
I think people are beginning to realize
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.050
I think people are beginning to realize
that the old models of mass the old

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
that the old models of mass the old
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.779
that the old models of mass the old
models of producing things that we don't

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
models of producing things that we don't
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.030
models of producing things that we don't
need of consuming things that we don't

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
need of consuming things that we don't
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.450
need of consuming things that we don't
really need to consume in the West is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
really need to consume in the West is
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.389
really need to consume in the West is
actually broken and actually people are

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
actually broken and actually people are
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.580
actually broken and actually people are
beginning to realize the sustainable

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
beginning to realize the sustainable
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.799
beginning to realize the sustainable
motor consumptions sustainable mode of

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809
motor consumptions sustainable mode of
 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.139
motor consumptions sustainable mode of
production are the only things that are

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149
production are the only things that are
 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.020
production are the only things that are
going to generate sustainable jobs

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030
going to generate sustainable jobs
 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.729
going to generate sustainable jobs
because it's a great sustainable

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
because it's a great sustainable
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.979
because it's a great sustainable
economies and actually going to get us

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
economies and actually going to get us
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.650
economies and actually going to get us
back to having a real economy in a real

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
back to having a real economy in a real
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.290
back to having a real economy in a real
world and that's interesting coming from

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
world and that's interesting coming from
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.540
world and that's interesting coming from
may be coming from someone who works in

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
may be coming from someone who works in
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.340
may be coming from someone who works in
digital actually again I think that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
digital actually again I think that
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.460
digital actually again I think that
digital is going to be the key driver

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470
digital is going to be the key driver
 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.890
digital is going to be the key driver
that's because one the more and more of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
that's because one the more and more of
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.020
that's because one the more and more of
the business processes the migrate

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
the business processes the migrate
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030
the business processes the migrate
towards digital a less impact they're

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
towards digital a less impact they're
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830
towards digital a less impact they're
going to have in the physical world so

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
going to have in the physical world so
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.039
going to have in the physical world so
anything that can be done digitally will

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
anything that can be done digitally will
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.080
anything that can be done digitally will
it can start to become done digitally

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
it can start to become done digitally
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.700
it can start to become done digitally
and the other thing is going to be

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
and the other thing is going to be
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.999
and the other thing is going to be
enormous pressure on business on

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
enormous pressure on business on
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.020
enormous pressure on business on
politicians to act sustainably more

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
politicians to act sustainably more
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.810
politicians to act sustainably more
responsibly ethically because everything

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
responsibly ethically because everything
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.780
responsibly ethically because everything
we do is now transparent this really is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
we do is now transparent this really is
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.670
we do is now transparent this really is
all about everyone being connected to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
all about everyone being connected to
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.780
all about everyone being connected to
everyone else in anything they're

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
everyone else in anything they're
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.200
everyone else in anything they're
interested in what we have is a world in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
interested in what we have is a world in
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.390
interested in what we have is a world in
which there is a transparency of action

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
which there is a transparency of action
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.630
which there is a transparency of action
that you're two clicks away from finding

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
that you're two clicks away from finding
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.730
that you're two clicks away from finding
out whether someone has actually done

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
out whether someone has actually done
 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.889
out whether someone has actually done
what they said they were going to do and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
what they said they were going to do and
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.499
what they said they were going to do and
so therefore I think if you look at the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
so therefore I think if you look at the
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810
so therefore I think if you look at the
macro pressure of the last 20 years has

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
macro pressure of the last 20 years has
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.999
macro pressure of the last 20 years has
been about the environment that the

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009
been about the environment that the
 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.690
been about the environment that the
economy is it's it's a it's a blip but

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
economy is it's it's a it's a blip but
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.359
economy is it's it's a it's a blip but
it's a very very big blend but actually

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
it's a very very big blend but actually
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.219
it's a very very big blend but actually
it's going to be a tipping point that

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
it's going to be a tipping point that
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.990
it's going to be a tipping point that
takes sustainability takes the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
takes sustainability takes the
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.240
takes sustainability takes the
environment really really seriously it's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
environment really really seriously it's
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.610
environment really really seriously it's
actually a critical year

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
actually a critical year
 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.849
actually a critical year
for that thank you
