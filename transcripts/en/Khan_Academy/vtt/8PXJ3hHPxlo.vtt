00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.560
Welcome back.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.990
Well, I just-- hopefully, we
together figured out correctly

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.570
that the total time in the air
is this initial velocity in

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.950
this direction divided by 10.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.040
That's our total time
in the air.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.330
And now, how far is the
object going to go?

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.870
Well it's going to go, our
displacement or our distance

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.212
in this x direction is going
to be-- so, let's see, We

00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:27.880
could call it distance in the
x direction is going to be

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.330
equal to vx, this
vx times time.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.210
Times time in the air, right?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.100
Times this number.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.060
And this is the average
velocity

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.340
because it's not changing.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.080
This is a constant.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.220
Assuming we have no friction
or no air resistance-- air

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.710
resistance is really just
a form of friction.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.310
The horizontal component of this
velocity is going to stay

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.870
the same the entire time.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.670
So the total distance traveled
is going to equal this number.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.990
Let me switch back to
that purple, so you

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.030
know what I'm doing.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.870
v sub i square root
of 3 over 2.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.180
That's this times the
time in the air.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.310
Well the time in the
air is this.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.370
Times v sub i over 10.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.250
So the distance total traveled--
let's see.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.160
Let's multiply these.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.540
vi squared times the square
root of 3, all

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.020
of that over 20.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.580
So now we know as a function
of our initial velocity in

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.510
this direction, how far is this
thing going to travel?

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.900
Well we know that we want it to
travel exactly 100 meters.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.220
So we just set them equal
to each other.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.760
We say 100 is equal to vi
squared times the square root

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.670
of 3 over 20.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.580
And then we can multiply
both sides times

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.460
the inverse of this.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.460
We could multiply both sides
by 20 and divide by the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.700
square root of 3.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.700
So we get v sub i squared is
equal to-- let me see.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.675
20 times 100 is 2,000, divided
by the square root of 3.

00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:23.630
So it's 2,000 times the
square root of 3.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.420
And so our initial velocity we
need to shoot this thing at is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.950
going to be the square
root of this.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.010
So initial velocity is going to
be the square root of 2,000

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.890
divided by the square
root of 3.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.290
So let's figure out what that
number is, just to give us a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.630
sense of whether this
feels right.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.080
Let me take the square root
of 3 first. 3 square root.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.920
And let me inverse
that times 2,000.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.110
That equals 1154.7 and then
I can square root this.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.365
33.98.

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:06.320
So almost 34 meters
per second.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:16.290
So my initial velocity has to be
33.98 meters per second for

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.860
me-- so my initial velocity
has to be 33.98 meters per

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.990
second to exactly hit this
target 100 meters away.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.620
I think that is fairly cool.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.860
And we could also do it to
figure out-- you know, we

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.840
could do it backwards to figure
out if we know exactly

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.570
what our velocity is going to
be, maybe like a slingshot--

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.490
always has the same velocity
and the only thing I can

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.730
change is the angle.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.700
As long as we know our inverse
trigonometric functions, we

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.040
can actually figure out the
exact angle that we have to

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.520
aim the slingshot or the
catapult or whatever to hit

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.410
the target.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.110
So I don't want you to go out
and raise your own army and

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.570
then whatever else, but if you
have to, you now know how to

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.170
command artillery.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.090
With that, I will leave you.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.090
And hopefully, you will not do
something overly destructive.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.710
I'll see you soon.
