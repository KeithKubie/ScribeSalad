on sustainable buildings I told you that

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440
on sustainable buildings I told you that
 

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.860
on sustainable buildings I told you that
you know we used two thirds less energy

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:34.870
you know we used two thirds less energy
 

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.740
you know we used two thirds less energy
than the rest of the country but what we

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:37.750
than the rest of the country but what we
 

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.290
than the rest of the country but what we
do use eighty percent is used by our

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:40.300
do use eighty percent is used by our
 

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.840
do use eighty percent is used by our
buildings and so we really have to look

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:42.850
buildings and so we really have to look
 

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:44.040
buildings and so we really have to look
at making our buildings more

impediments to energy efficiency and
energy generation so things like solar

00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:58.599
energy generation so things like solar
 

00:39:58.599 --> 00:40:02.730
energy generation so things like solar
panels or solar shades shades coming up

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:02.740
panels or solar shades shades coming up
 

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.550

starting an administration we've already

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:11.330
starting an administration we've already
 

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:13.390
starting an administration we've already
added almost 400,000 we actually have

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:13.400
added almost 400,000 we actually have
 

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.150
added almost 400,000 we actually have
700,000 to accommodate and that we still

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160
700,000 to accommodate and that we still
 

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:22.060
700,000 to accommodate and that we still
need to grow by about 200 over 200,000

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:22.070
need to grow by about 200 over 200,000
 

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:24.220
need to grow by about 200 over 200,000
units and we're very conscious that we

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:24.230
units and we're very conscious that we
 

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:28.000
units and we're very conscious that we
have to grow wherever we can grow but we

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.010
have to grow wherever we can grow but we
 

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:29.740
have to grow wherever we can grow but we
actually know that we can do that

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:29.750
actually know that we can do that
 

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:35.200
actually know that we can do that
because we have accommodated already

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:35.210

several hundred thousand units in just
this administration so we only have to

00:46:39.339 --> 00:46:39.349
this administration so we only have to
 

00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:42.190
this administration so we only have to
do about 125 per year so answer to your

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200
do about 125 per year so answer to your
 

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.000
do about 125 per year so answer to your
question very still is we still have

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.010
question very still is we still have
 

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.560

Avenue and that can take some density
 

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:09.970

I'm making up numbers now but it just is

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:17.970
I'm making up numbers now but it just is
 

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:20.110
I'm making up numbers now but it just is
that a cap as the nine point one of I

should happen later and so I think

00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:27.700
should happen later and so I think
 

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.630
should happen later and so I think
that's a good a good example and I was

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640

and so maybe that's the best thing could

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:38.050
and so maybe that's the best thing could
 

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:39.960
and so maybe that's the best thing could
happen in terms of land use there are

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:39.970

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:42.030
happen in terms of land use there are
lots of ideas but the more people who

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.069
lots of ideas but the more people who
come out to the island and actually see

00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079
come out to the island and actually see
 

00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:46.079
come out to the island and actually see
it maybe that's how we get the best

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:46.089
it maybe that's how we get the best
 

00:55:46.089 --> 00:55:48.089
it maybe that's how we get the best
ideas maybe it's not a good thing to

00:55:48.089 --> 00:55:48.099
ideas maybe it's not a good thing to
 

00:55:48.099 --> 00:55:50.970
ideas maybe it's not a good thing to
leap and make a decision I'm whether it

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:50.980

00:57:17.279 --> 00:57:17.289
and so the conservancy usually is about
 

00:57:17.289 --> 00:57:19.809

both investing in public space and

00:57:19.809 --> 00:57:19.819
both investing in public space and

so you're right it should be used

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:24.170
so you're right it should be used
 

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.380
so you're right it should be used
carefully and not that every district is

harder to enforce and that's the that's
 

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.430
harder to enforce and that's the that's
the that's the problem with the special

well often you have to have a
 

01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:46.460
well often you have to have a
combination of the two things but we

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:46.470
combination of the two things but we
 

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:49.310

thought zoning couldn't incentivize
healthy food choices so we're trying to

healthy food choices so we're trying to
 

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.170
healthy food choices so we're trying to
expand the use of zoning as a tool to

expand the use of zoning as a tool to

they're also coupled with other
 

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.940
they're also coupled with other
incentives so offer insistently in the

incentives so offer insistently in the
 

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:19.099

a new grocery store so in fact there

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:25.410
a new grocery store so in fact there
 

01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:27.950
a new grocery store so in fact there
should be multiple incentive so I no

01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960
should be multiple incentive so I no
 

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.960
should be multiple incentive so I no
zoning best and so we use that as a tool

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:29.970
zoning best and so we use that as a tool
 

01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:32.570
zoning best and so we use that as a tool
but always in combination with other

01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580
but always in combination with other
 

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:36.040
but always in combination with other

multiple programs for affordable housing
 

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.910
multiple programs for affordable housing

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:11.620
effect and also whether you can talk a
little bit more about the public process

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:11.630
little bit more about the public process
 

01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:14.260
little bit more about the public process
that you go through maybe on a project

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:14.270
that you go through maybe on a project
 

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:16.300
that you go through maybe on a project
like that or on the issue of the

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:16.310
like that or on the issue of the
 

01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:18.430
like that or on the issue of the
waterfront and how could you just walk

01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:18.440
waterfront and how could you just walk
 

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.800
waterfront and how could you just walk
us through sort of how you engage the

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:20.810
us through sort of how you engage the
 

01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:22.510
us through sort of how you engage the
public on something so important is that

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520
public on something so important is that
 

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.359

on the waterfront the rising currents

01:21:25.359 --> 01:21:25.369
on the waterfront the rising currents
 

01:21:25.369 --> 01:21:27.430
on the waterfront the rising currents
show was fantastic I'm sure a lot of

01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440
show was fantastic I'm sure a lot of
 

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.399
show was fantastic I'm sure a lot of
people here saw it I was on the jury for

01:21:30.399 --> 01:21:30.409
people here saw it I was on the jury for
 

01:21:30.409 --> 01:21:32.350
people here saw it I was on the jury for
it and I just did a panel on it about a

01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360
it and I just did a panel on it about a
 

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.750
it and I just did a panel on it about a
week ago and actually influenced our

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:34.760
week ago and actually influenced our
 

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.640
week ago and actually influenced our
waterfront plan very much because it's

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:36.650
waterfront plan very much because it's
 

01:21:36.650 --> 01:21:39.280
waterfront plan very much because it's
clear from that exhibit that the issues

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:39.290
clear from that exhibit that the issues
 

01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:42.129
clear from that exhibit that the issues
of not just sea level rise but the real

01:21:42.129 --> 01:21:42.139
of not just sea level rise but the real
 

01:21:42.139 --> 01:21:44.800
of not just sea level rise but the real
issue of storm surge and the velocity of

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:44.810
issue of storm surge and the velocity of
 

01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:47.140
issue of storm surge and the velocity of
storm surge is the vulnerable makes a

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:47.150
storm surge is the vulnerable makes a
 

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:49.870
storm surge is the vulnerable makes a
city very vulnerable and princess the

01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:49.880
city very vulnerable and princess the
 

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.459
city very vulnerable and princess the
bulkheads that we built a battery park

01:21:51.459 --> 01:21:51.469
bulkheads that we built a battery park
 

01:21:51.469 --> 01:21:52.870
bulkheads that we built a battery park
city is probably the worst thing you can

01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880
city is probably the worst thing you can
 

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.490
city is probably the worst thing you can
do because that velocity hits the

01:21:54.490 --> 01:21:54.500
do because that velocity hits the
 

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.430
do because that velocity hits the
bulkhead and son not good so will we

01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440
bulkhead and son not good so will we
 

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.560
bulkhead and son not good so will we
have advocated in the plan is softening

01:21:59.560 --> 01:21:59.570
have advocated in the plan is softening
 

01:21:59.570 --> 01:22:02.740
have advocated in the plan is softening
the edge a one enhancing wetlands not

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:02.750
the edge a one enhancing wetlands not
 

01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:04.390
the edge a one enhancing wetlands not
only wetland habitats but marine

01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400
only wetland habitats but marine
 

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.580
only wetland habitats but marine
habitats in fact one of the best ways

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:06.590
habitats in fact one of the best ways
 

01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:09.010
habitats in fact one of the best ways
and you saw it in oyster texture one of

01:22:09.010 --> 01:22:09.020
and you saw it in oyster texture one of
 

01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.810
and you saw it in oyster texture one of
the best ways of actually slowing down

01:22:10.810 --> 01:22:10.820
the best ways of actually slowing down
 

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:11.310
the best ways of actually slowing down
that

01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:11.320
that
 

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.410
that
velocity of the storm surge is soo

01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:13.420
velocity of the storm surge is soo
 

01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:15.390
velocity of the storm surge is soo
creating reefs and governors island

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:15.400
creating reefs and governors island
 

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.520
creating reefs and governors island
actually just lowered the harbor school

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:17.530
actually just lowered the harbor school
 

01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:19.830
actually just lowered the harbor school
lower their first reef into the into the

01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840
lower their first reef into the into the
 

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.890
lower their first reef into the into the
harbor about two weeks ago so we

01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:22.900
harbor about two weeks ago so we
 

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.830
harbor about two weeks ago so we
understand those issues very much both

01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840
understand those issues very much both
 

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.930
understand those issues very much both
sea-level rise and storm surge so you'll

01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:27.940
sea-level rise and storm surge so you'll
 

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:29.819
sea-level rise and storm surge so you'll
see and our waterfront recommendations

01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:29.829
see and our waterfront recommendations
 

01:22:29.829 --> 01:22:32.520
see and our waterfront recommendations
which is on our website that that's very

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:32.530
which is on our website that that's very
 

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:34.919
which is on our website that that's very
much taken into consideration also in

01:22:34.919 --> 01:22:34.929
much taken into consideration also in
 

01:22:34.929 --> 01:22:37.020
much taken into consideration also in
terms of how you design the water's edge

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:37.030
terms of how you design the water's edge
 

01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:39.839
terms of how you design the water's edge
we are advocating not only soft edge but

01:22:39.839 --> 01:22:39.849
we are advocating not only soft edge but
 

01:22:39.849 --> 01:22:41.100
we are advocating not only soft edge but
where there's a walkway that we use

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:41.110
where there's a walkway that we use
 

01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:44.069
where there's a walkway that we use
riprap instead so all of these actually

01:22:44.069 --> 01:22:44.079
riprap instead so all of these actually
 

01:22:44.079 --> 01:22:46.229
riprap instead so all of these actually
feed into the into the new waterfront

01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239
feed into the into the new waterfront
 

01:22:46.239 --> 01:22:48.000
feed into the into the new waterfront
plan recommendations and we'll still

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:48.010
plan recommendations and we'll still
 

01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:49.589
plan recommendations and we'll still
getting feedback on them so we won't

01:22:49.589 --> 01:22:49.599
getting feedback on them so we won't
 

01:22:49.599 --> 01:22:52.740
getting feedback on them so we won't
finalize them until the end of the year

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:52.750
finalize them until the end of the year
 

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:55.260
finalize them until the end of the year

they were being left out there's so many
 

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.790
they were being left out there's so many
constituents for the water and the

for their different interests on the
 

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.609
for their different interests on the
waterfront so it's been really

01:24:05.609 --> 01:24:05.619
waterfront so it's been really
 

01:24:05.619 --> 01:24:07.200
waterfront so it's been really
remarkable it was my biggest worry

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:07.210
remarkable it was my biggest worry
 

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:09.359
remarkable it was my biggest worry
frankly is that we wouldn't be able to

01:24:09.359 --> 01:24:09.369
frankly is that we wouldn't be able to
 

01:24:09.369 --> 01:24:11.640
frankly is that we wouldn't be able to
engage the public at large in this plan

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:11.650
engage the public at large in this plan
 

01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:14.879
engage the public at large in this plan
and it's feeling it's really really

01:24:14.879 --> 01:24:14.889
and it's feeling it's really really
 

01:24:14.889 --> 01:24:17.160
and it's feeling it's really really
feeling great

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:17.170
feeling great
 

01:24:17.170 --> 01:24:21.270
