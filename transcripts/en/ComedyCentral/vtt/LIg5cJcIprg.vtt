Thanks for joining us,

this is -
what is it called?

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:04.470
The other show.

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:06.706 line:0%

Hey everyone,
thanks for joining us

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.475 line:0%
on The other show,

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:11.978 line:0%
today we're talking
about episode six,

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.479
and we're here with
Helene and Drew as always,

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:15.148 line:0%
and Molly Shannon who plays Pat!

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.250 line:0%
[Molly] Hello, so
happy to be here.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:18.484 line:0%
(all laughing)
this is so,

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:20.453
this is like my dream
of being an actress,

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:21.654
like, on a show -
What do you mean?

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:22.889
With a couch,
talking. (all laugh)

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.824
[Sarah] That's why
you got into this.

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.092
Yeah, kind of.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.194
[Sarah] To sit on a couch.
(all laugh)

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.298
Guess who's going to be
on Watch What Happens Live?

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.333
I love my Year of Yes!

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.136
Was it weird to, like,

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:38.671
shoot Watch What Happens
Live in character?

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.173
Or no.
Ummm,

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.641
that was a little weird,
[Chris] Yeah.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:42.842
It's interesting,

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.178
because I've hardly
ever done that,

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.246
[Chris] Yeah.
So it's very strange,

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.315
cause in real life I
get nervous as myself,

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:50.516
if I do a talk show,

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:51.951
that does feel strange,

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:52.952
cause you're not yourself,
[Chris] Yeah.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:54.287
So you don't feel as nervous.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.688
And you're sitting
next to Patrick Wilson,

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:56.689
playing himself,
(Sarah laughs)

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:57.957
but you're in character?

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.659
It's bizarre!
So weird!

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.027
He was really nice.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.028
Hi, um,

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.363
I'm looking to get jacked, fast.

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:05.765
Do you have a gym membership?

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:07.166
No, uh,

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:08.668
but it's kind of an emergency,

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.870
I'm going to be the bartender
on Watch What Happens Live,

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:12.038
cause, just -
it's good to be seen,

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.372
Okay, yeah, no, totally,

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:14.640
I did that last week.

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:15.875
You've been on Watch
What Happens Live, too,

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.477
but as the bartender, right?
Yes -

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.678
You have?
Yes!

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.046
What?
But you weren't

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:20.880
wearing clothes.
He was stripping!

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:21.848
I was wearing clothes,

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:22.782
I had, like, on a jacket,

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:23.883
like buttoned up to my neck,

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.184
like, I was like (yells softly).

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:28.054
I could not remember
that Guildenstern,

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.689
Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern line,

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.557
because I was so nervous, like,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.459
it was just like
sense memory of being

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:35.695
behind the bartender
like thing again,

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.396
I was like oh,
I'm nervous again!

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:38.831
(all laughing)
It was very funny,

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:39.999
cause even in between takes,

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:40.967
when people would be talking,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.235
or giving notes or something,

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.903
you were always just
standing back there,

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.404
by yourself in a little bow tie,

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.140
just still there.
(all laughing)

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.142
Yeah, I was trying
to conserve warmth,

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.409
and also, like, you had said,

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:52.345
like, hey, we don't
have much time in there,

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.880
so any time we're in between,

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.381
just like
No, I wasn't rushing

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:56.415
the actors,
We had all the time

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:57.250
in the world
You had all

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.751
the time in the world!

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.052
How you doing,
you excited?

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:01.955
Oh, I'm so nervous
I could barf!

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:03.890
I just hope I don't
mess up tonight.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.358
Don't be nervous,

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.660
you literally can't mess
up Watch What Happens Live.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.262
Molly, your character
in particular,

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.097
is like super
starstruck, I guess,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.532
like, are there people,

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.066
to this day that
you, Molly Shannon,

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.102
would still be
starstruck around? Or no.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.270
Yes. Definitely.
There are?

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.938
Oh yeah!
That you haven't met,

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.373
or you've met them
and still like...

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.608
I met them and I
still feel starstruck.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.577
[Chris] Who?
Like, Angelina Jolie.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.279
And you've met her?
(all laughing)

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.448
[Helene] You've met Angelina!

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.417
Every time you're around
Angelina you're starstruck.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.286
I get starstruck
for Housewives, too,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.453
like I said, like,
[Chris] Yes,

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:35.688
I bumped into
[Chris] Absolutely.

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:36.622
Shannon Beador
at the LAX Airport,

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:37.790
and I was like (gasp loudly),

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:39.625
it's like the gates opened up,
(laughing)

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:41.527
like I get very excited!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.529
I'm obviously a big Molly fan,

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:45.565
Yeah,
And I was like,

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.767
during the pilot
when we were filming,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.735
I was like, if it
ever looks like

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:51.804
the person acting
across from Molly

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:53.239
is just a big fan of hers,
(laughing)

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.974
and is smiling huge,

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:56.209
just tell me,
(Molly laughing)

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.244
cause I felt like I was
just kind of like...

00:02:58.277 --> 00:02:59.779
♪ Dance all day, 

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.280
♪ Dance all night, 

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.149
♪ Dance until we
don't smell right, ♪

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:04.417
♪ Dance until we, 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.486
♪ Stink, stink,
stink, stink... ♪

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.288
Yeah, I, uh,
I was told

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:10.890
that there would be dancing
in this music video,

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:11.824
and they were like,

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:12.959
there's going to be a rehearsal,

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.060
and it sort of
sounded super casual,

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.261
and so I was like, um,

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:17.964
okay so, I guess I have
to learn this dance,

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.166
and they weren't really
telling me the time,

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.667
they made it seem like it
was going to be nothing,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.635
and I showed up for the
rehearsal and I was like,

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:25.304
(gasps loudly) this is real!

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:27.940
And then all of the girls
that did that music video,

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:30.076
all of the dancers are so good,

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.344
Yeah, they're amazing

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.578
And I was like, God,

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:33.813
all of you guys are so good,

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.448
I feel like I'm in
a Beyonce video,

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:36.682
and Cat, the
choreographer, went,

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:39.085
Oh, these girls do
dance for Beyonce!

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:40.519
And I was like (groans),

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:42.154
and I walked out one door
of the rehearsal room,

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:43.856
and like, came back in the
other door and was like,

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.124
I'm ready to start again.

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:46.192
Did it make you
sad that you weren't

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.326
still dancing, Brookie?

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.595
Um, no, actually,

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:50.796
I like what I'm doing.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.098
Plus, if I had kept dancing,

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.933
I'd be starting
over now anyways,

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:57.203
so, I guess in some
ways I got a head start.

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.372
That's beautiful.
Thanks, Mom.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.940
No, I mean the top
that I'm wearing.

00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:03.843
I really am like Pat.
Let's be honest,

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.811
Are you?
No!

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:06.712 align:start size:66% position:34%
Like, 10%?
Values,

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:07.813
20%?
Values,

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:08.814
Values?
Values.

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:09.882 align:start size:66% position:34%
Values.
(laughing)

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:11.617
Yeah.
Values? (laughing)

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.985
What are Pat's values?
Family?

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:15.021
Family.
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.822
Yeah, and spirituality.
Yeah.

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:18.224
I think I was going to say,

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:21.060
just the way she's positive
about life and open,

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:22.028
Yeah.
I feel like that too,

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.796
I try to, I think I'm like that.

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.531
[Chris] Yeah.
I relate to her.

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:26.866
We talked about that
in the writers room,

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.834
that we like about
your character,

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:30.236
or hopefully what we
were trying to do was

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.738
not have her be
like a stage mom.

00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:33.973
It's just sort of like, sure,

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:35.708
I love my son, and
everyone in America

00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:37.043
is saying they love him too,

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.177
so I guess I love America,
(all laughing)

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.078
this is great, like, yes,

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:41.247
just saying yes to things.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.215
Has anyone done a Year of Yes?

00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:45.151
Or like, made a conscious
effort to be like,

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:46.852
this year I'm going for it.

00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:48.921
I think I do,
like, every January,

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:50.990
and then by like, February 2nd,

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:52.692
I'm like, I can't
remember, I don't know.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:56.262
Yeah, I was going to try
to be more positive in 2018,

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:59.498
and I made it to
like, May. (laughs)

00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:02.435
That's when we started
shooting! (all laughing)

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:05.171
Mom, why did you say
dad died of cancer?

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:06.272
What do you mean?

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:07.039
That's what we
decided to tell Chase.

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:08.441
Yeah, Chase,

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.376
not the whole viewing audience
of Watch What Happens.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.577
Well, I just figured,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.945
Chase is going to be
watching it later, so...

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:14.547
Did I mess up?

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.350
Just in general, I
love the idea of a woman,

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.951
this isn't so much
me cause I'm married,

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:22.188
but I love a woman having
a very happy chapter two,

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:23.456
where they, you know,

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.024
her husband passed away,

00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:27.193
but she's really like alive,

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.628
and so full without,

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:32.365
kind of a nice chapter
two at a nice age,

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:33.933
I just think that's
so true to life,

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.535

Kind of reinventing

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:40.239

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:43.442
in a very positive way.

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:44.710
I just love that

00:05:44.743 --> 00:05:45.878
