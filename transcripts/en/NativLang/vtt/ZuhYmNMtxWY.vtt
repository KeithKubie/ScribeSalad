2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.250
<v 1>words are arranged in different ways,</v>

3
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:15.000
in different languages and even in different types of sentences.

4
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.240
In the same language, this gets called word order.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.460
There are three components that we look at when we describe the basic word order

6
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:27.750
of a language, the subject word, the object word, and the verb.

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.160
Once we identify a subject, a verb, and an object,

8
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.190
we can consider their arrangement. Many,

9
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:39.480
many languages have the basic word order, subject, verb, object.

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.540
In other words, the subject comes first, followed by a verb,

11
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.310
and the verb is followed by its object.

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.660
Another common configuration is subject, object, verb.

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.570
Other configurations are even less common.

14
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.820
Basic word order doesn't tell us everything about the structure of a sentence.

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.680
It just gives us some gist of how sentences in a language may be arranged.

16
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.030
Also, many languages don't strictly stick to their basic word order,

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.900
hence the word basic. A great example is English.

18
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.470
English has the basic word orders, subject for object.

19
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.900
It's an s fio language.

20
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.120
Yet when we ask a question with the Varubi or in some cases the verb have we

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.440
switched the word order.

22
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.730
The traditional way of describing that is to say that we invert the verb and

23
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:29.700
it's subject to ask a question. In other words,

24
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:33.280
it's argued that the word order of English questions with the verb east,

25
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.840
which is to verbs subject object. So we say,

26
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.090
are you happy where you there?

27
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.150
We're inverting the subject and the verb.

28
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.200
This explanation brings up the concept of inversion. In other words,

29
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:50.790
switching the place of words but consider a different explanation for the same

30
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:55.170
change. This one will use the concept of movement or just move.

31
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.330
In this case, we're performing an operation in which we move one of the words.

32
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.040
So instead of saying that we invert the words B and the subject in,

33
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.053
are you there?

34
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.070
We're just moving our before the subject and this will give us basically the

35
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:15.210
same result by performing a different operation instead of switching places.

36
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:16.290
We're just moving.

37
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:21.291
One of the words and a final concept to consider with respect to word order is

38
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:25.410
the adjunct and adjunct is optional material.

39
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.610
More words that you can add. Since it's optional, it modifies.

40
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.140
I asked the question, were you there, but I could add more material.

41
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.870
Were you there on Thursday and even more material?

42
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.460
Were you there at the school on Thursday? We can call those extra pieces.

43
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.353
Adjuncts

44
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.670
take time to make sure you understand this lesson in the previous two lessons,

45
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:49.020
in the grammar of sentences.

46
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.160
Next time we'll use all of this basic understanding to start building

47
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:54.150
grammatical rule

48
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.070
