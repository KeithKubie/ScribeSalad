00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.180
So... what I'd really like to do

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.180
Let me start again...

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.600
So of all the video I´ve been involved with for Sixty Symbols

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.320
Numberphile

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.940
and Brady´s million other channels

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.940
The one I´m least happy with by far

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.040
is the one we did in entropy

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.500
We even then did a follow up with a "solo mea culpa"

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.000
Where I uhm...  pointed outs where there are some importants details

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.500
seeing where we just gloss over

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.180
I really wanna revisit entropy and Brady is gonna endorse me, what is great

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.080
What it might and might not

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.400
A lot starts from this

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
the work of this guy

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.040
a guy called Frank Lambert

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.460
And notice, It says Disorder- A cracked crutch

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.460
for supporting entropy discussions

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.600
So every time you hear entropy

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.380
mention, or the vast majority of times

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.260
I'm certain on the undergraduates

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.060
I'm certainly in the other Sixty Symbols video we did the same thing

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.500
We made this link between entropy and disorder

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.520
For a person who isn't a scientist and even for a person who is a scientist

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.740
that is actually a very difficult and very confusing link to make

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.480
because: for example

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.960
the argument is that,
you know...

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.260
entropy is always increasing...

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.020
disorder is always increasing...
How does this happen?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560
so this is from my kid´s crystal growing kit

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.440
So we get crystals.
How do we get lovely structures like this?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.740
Beautiful structures.
This is the crystal structure of silicon

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.720
how do we get this extended over, you know

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.140
huge pieces of silicon

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.120
How much more ordered do you wanna get?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.140
And then the argument is that disorder is always increasing

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.880
How, then, do you take, you know, atoms in a melt... or atoms in a gas phase and this how we grow silicon

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.060
They're pretty disordered, you would argue

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.120
And then they hit the surface, and they grow and they built, and they form this structure

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.920
So, that seems to be, from on the face of it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.300
a pretty good example of something which is very disordered turn into something very ordered

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.480
That's the issue with using order and disorder to explain entropy

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.040
and this is something that this guy, Lamberd has been banging on about for quite some time and quite rightly banging on about

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.380
Because it's exceptionally, exceptionally misleading.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.680
I wanna cover just very briefly, uhm...
two aspects of this

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.720
You know, you could then quietly right ask me
Well, you know, how it does happen then?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.920
Does it breaking the secound law of thermodinamics?

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.180
The fact of to see in this apparent disorder to order transition

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.000
intead of other way round?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.300
Have the laws of thermodynamics suddenly gone wrong?

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.000
Have we missunderstood everything?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.380
The important in here is if you got to take into account the entire system

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.460
You've got to take into account whether the system is closed or opened

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600
if those energy or matter flow

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.700
All of those different things, we can even reduce it further to make the argument

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.060
of this even simpler, the important thing that we are neglecting

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.460
When we talk about just the atoms forming in order or disorder

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.460
Is what's the role of energy

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.520
and in particular when those atoms bond they give off heat energy

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.340
and that heat energy is an exceptionally important contribution to the "disorder" of the system
