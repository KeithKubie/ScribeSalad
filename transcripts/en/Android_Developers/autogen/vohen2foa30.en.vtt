like the YouTube app there it's not
 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.740

you know one personally that my opinion
 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.830
you know one personally that my opinion
is that it makes a lot of sense to do it

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840
is that it makes a lot of sense to do it
 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.060
is that it makes a lot of sense to do it
a full screen swipe when there aren't

a full screen swipe when there aren't
 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.850
a full screen swipe when there aren't
competing gestures like for example if

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860
competing gestures like for example if
 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.630
competing gestures like for example if
you don't have swipe to dismiss actually

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640
you don't have swipe to dismiss actually
 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.870

how's it going so um you know when you

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180
how's it going so um you know when you
 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.999
how's it going so um you know when you
do not swipe to dismiss

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009
do not swipe to dismiss
 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:41.649
do not swipe to dismiss
or you don't have you know other

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659
or you don't have you know other
 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:44.140

horizontal gestures like for example a

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150

map as your primary content view I think

00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:47.119
map as your primary content view I think
 

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:48.939
map as your primary content view I think
it makes sense if you like a full screen

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949
it makes sense if you like a full screen
 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:50.260
it makes sense if you like a full screen
slide because that's probably what

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270
slide because that's probably what
 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.510
slide because that's probably what
people are trying to do anyway that's

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520
people are trying to do anyway that's
 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.889
people are trying to do anyway that's
just again it's really my opinion and

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:53.899
just again it's really my opinion and
 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:55.450
just again it's really my opinion and
the current guidelines say edge swipe

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460
the current guidelines say edge swipe
 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.309
the current guidelines say edge swipe
and I'd say that you know by default you

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319
and I'd say that you know by default you
 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.749
and I'd say that you know by default you
should probably just use the edge slide

00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759
should probably just use the edge slide
 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.779
should probably just use the edge slide
um the other thing is that where is it

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789
um the other thing is that where is it
 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.189
um the other thing is that where is it
where is it is only suitable for the

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199
where is it is only suitable for the
 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.079
where is it is only suitable for the
topmost level so another thing that

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:08.089
topmost level so another thing that
 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.989
topmost level so another thing that
folks sometimes use drawers for and not

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:10.999
folks sometimes use drawers for and not
 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:16.059
folks sometimes use drawers for and not
home we need onion join the other thing

that people use jar is for us to kind of
 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:19.769

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:19.779
provide exposed global navigation
 

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:22.329

throughout the aplex for example if I'm

00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:22.339
throughout the aplex for example if I'm
 

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:24.459

like in a detail screen you know three

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:24.469
like in a detail screen you know three
 

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:26.709
like in a detail screen you know three
levels deep somewhere you know what if I

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:26.719
levels deep somewhere you know what if I
 

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:29.379
levels deep somewhere you know what if I
want to expose global navigation let the

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389
want to expose global navigation let the
 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.619
want to expose global navigation let the
user do a full kind of context switch

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:31.629
user do a full kind of context switch
 

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.999
user do a full kind of context switch
and sometimes folks use jars for that

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:34.009
and sometimes folks use jars for that
 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:36.189
and sometimes folks use jars for that
and I don't think of that really fits in

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199
and I don't think of that really fits in
 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:37.899
and I don't think of that really fits in

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:08.409
feel like you know the up button should
always take you up through that the

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:08.419
always take you up through that the
 

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:10.719
always take you up through that the
hierarchy of content and it shouldn't be

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:10.729
hierarchy of content and it shouldn't be
 

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:15.429
hierarchy of content and it shouldn't be
like but expects in the drawer yeah it's

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:15.439
like but expects in the drawer yeah it's
 

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:18.519
like but expects in the drawer yeah it's
fair um anybody else any other thoughts

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:18.529
fair um anybody else any other thoughts
 

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:20.889
fair um anybody else any other thoughts
on actually this is one thing that say

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:20.899
on actually this is one thing that say
 

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:23.799
on actually this is one thing that say
is is pretty common right i mean is is

00:08:23.799 --> 00:08:23.809
is is pretty common right i mean is is
 

00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:26.559
is is pretty common right i mean is is
using the drawer for global access like

00:08:26.559 --> 00:08:26.569
using the drawer for global access like
 

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:29.589
using the drawer for global access like
using the inside of the up icon and or

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599
using the inside of the up icon and or
 

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:31.600
using the inside of the up icon and or
the up carrot in the app icon using kind

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:31.610
the up carrot in the app icon using kind
 

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.409
the up carrot in the app icon using kind
of the three horizontal lines and um and

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:35.419
of the three horizontal lines and um and
 

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.059
of the three horizontal lines and um and
you guys can't really see who's talking

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:37.069
you guys can't really see who's talking
 

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:38.439
you guys can't really see who's talking
cuz i'm sharing the Hangout screen but

00:08:38.439 --> 00:08:38.449
cuz i'm sharing the Hangout screen but
 

00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:41.110
cuz i'm sharing the Hangout screen but
um you know something something like

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120
um you know something something like
 

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.750
um you know something something like
that is is a little more comment on

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760
that is is a little more comment on
 

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.509
that is is a little more comment on
other platforms and so you know it's

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519
other platforms and so you know it's
 

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:47.620
other platforms and so you know it's
definitely something that I think that

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:47.630
definitely something that I think that
 

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.480
definitely something that I think that
we should try to standardize on at some

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:49.490
we should try to standardize on at some
 

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.000
we should try to standardize on at some
point in the future I'm actually a

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.010
point in the future I'm actually a
 

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.860
point in the future I'm actually a
little point about the the three

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:53.870
little point about the the three
 

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.470
little point about the the three
be horizontal lines is um somebody

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480
be horizontal lines is um somebody
 

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.810
be horizontal lines is um somebody
called out the hamburger icon because

00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:58.820
called out the hamburger icon because
 

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.090
called out the hamburger icon because
it's basically you know two slices of

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:01.100
it's basically you know two slices of
 

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.130
it's basically you know two slices of
two buns or whatever and then a piece

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.140
two buns or whatever and then a piece
 

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.780
two buns or whatever and then a piece
like you know a patty and meat patty in

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:04.790
like you know a patty and meat patty in
 

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.850
like you know a patty and meat patty in
between but yeah it's nothing like

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:06.860
between but yeah it's nothing like
 

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.470
between but yeah it's nothing like
something that's that's been used

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480
something that's that's been used
 

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.720
something that's that's been used
throughout and I think that users

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:10.730
throughout and I think that users
 

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.700
throughout and I think that users
understand what it is the the three

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:12.710
understand what it is the the three
 

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.130
understand what it is the the three
horizontal lines but really kind of the

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:15.140
horizontal lines but really kind of the
 

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.600
horizontal lines but really kind of the
the current guidelines are for the app

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:16.610
the current guidelines are for the app
 

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.600
the current guidelines are for the app
icon and the up carrot well let me let

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:19.610
icon and the up carrot well let me let
 

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.980
icon and the up carrot well let me let
me just jump into some of the unofficial

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:20.990
me just jump into some of the unofficial
 

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.870
me just jump into some of the unofficial
stuff before I take the screen off so

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880
stuff before I take the screen off so
 

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.200
stuff before I take the screen off so
you can see our faces again so like like

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.210
you can see our faces again so like like
 

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.180
you can see our faces again so like like
the current guidelines say you know only

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:28.190
the current guidelines say you know only
 

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.470
the current guidelines say you know only
at the top level the up up icon or up

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480
at the top level the up up icon or up
 

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.079
at the top level the up up icon or up
karen app icon it should also not slide

00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:35.089
karen app icon it should also not slide
 

00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:36.610
karen app icon it should also not slide
the action bar so this is a point of

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:36.620
the action bar so this is a point of
 

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.930
the action bar so this is a point of
contention this is definitely something

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:37.940
contention this is definitely something
 

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.150
contention this is definitely something
that is a little inconsistent right now

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160
that is a little inconsistent right now
 

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.790
that is a little inconsistent right now
across Google Apps so the Google+ app

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800
across Google Apps so the Google+ app
 

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.920
across Google Apps so the Google+ app
for example does slide the action bar

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:44.930
for example does slide the action bar
 

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.540
for example does slide the action bar
out of the way to make room for the jar

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:46.550
out of the way to make room for the jar
 

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.390
out of the way to make room for the jar
the YouTube app does not we definitely

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:49.400
the YouTube app does not we definitely
 

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.130
the YouTube app does not we definitely
recommend not sliding the action bar out

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.140
recommend not sliding the action bar out
 

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.300
recommend not sliding the action bar out
of the way and there's I think there's

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:52.310
of the way and there's I think there's
 

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.370
of the way and there's I think there's
really two reasons for that the first is

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:54.380
really two reasons for that the first is
 

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.079
really two reasons for that the first is
that from a framework standpoint from a

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:56.089
that from a framework standpoint from a
 

00:09:56.089 --> 00:09:57.730
that from a framework standpoint from a
development standpoint it's actually

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:57.740
development standpoint it's actually
 

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.550
development standpoint it's actually
kind of difficult to do that um and it

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560
kind of difficult to do that um and it
 

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.850
kind of difficult to do that um and it
kind of imposes extra you know effort

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:03.860
kind of imposes extra you know effort
 

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.490
kind of imposes extra you know effort
and extra work to get that done and some

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500
and extra work to get that done and some
 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.860
and extra work to get that done and some
people say you know in in that case

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:08.870
people say you know in in that case
 

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.930
people say you know in in that case
let's just recreate the action bar let's

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:10.940
let's just recreate the action bar let's
 

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.730
let's just recreate the action bar let's
just re implement the action bar so that

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:12.740
just re implement the action bar so that
 

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.560
just re implement the action bar so that
we can start it out of the way and

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:14.570
we can start it out of the way and
 

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.960
we can start it out of the way and
that's not really something that you

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:16.970
that's not really something that you
 

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.280
that's not really something that you
should be doing because there's a lot of

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:18.290
should be doing because there's a lot of
 

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.220
should be doing because there's a lot of
kind of nuances with how the action bar

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:21.230
kind of nuances with how the action bar
 

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.600
kind of nuances with how the action bar
is implemented so you should try to

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:22.610
is implemented so you should try to
 

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.910
is implemented so you should try to
avoid implementing the action bar and

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920
avoid implementing the action bar and
 

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.070
avoid implementing the action bar and
you're on your own on the other point is

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.080
you're on your own on the other point is
 

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.480
you're on your own on the other point is
that you know the action bar is really

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:28.490
that you know the action bar is really
 

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.940
that you know the action bar is really
kind of a core navigational anchor it's

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:30.950
kind of a core navigational anchor it's
 

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.380
kind of a core navigational anchor it's
really really the number one structural

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:34.390
really really the number one structural
 

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.449
really really the number one structural
component of an app I'd say and so

00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:37.459
component of an app I'd say and so
 

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:38.790
component of an app I'd say and so
moving that out of the way kind of

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800
moving that out of the way kind of
 

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.620
moving that out of the way kind of
slowly deteriorates deteriorates this

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:41.630
slowly deteriorates deteriorates this
 

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.199
slowly deteriorates deteriorates this
kind of relationship the user has with

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:44.209
kind of relationship the user has with
 

00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:45.790
kind of relationship the user has with
that action bar you know making it

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800
that action bar you know making it
 

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.350
that action bar you know making it
making sure that it's stable is very

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360
making sure that it's stable is very
 

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.120
making sure that it's stable is very
very important and if you start moving

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.130
very important and if you start moving
 

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.470
very important and if you start moving
it out of the way and sliding it away

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480
it out of the way and sliding it away
 

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.930
it out of the way and sliding it away
and so on um they could potentially

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:52.940
and so on um they could potentially
 

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.810
and so on um they could potentially
deteriorate the experience so those are

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:55.820
deteriorate the experience so those are
 

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.310
deteriorate the experience so those are
the two points that I'd say about

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320
the two points that I'd say about
 

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.630
the two points that I'd say about
sliding the action bar um and then again

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:01.640
sliding the action bar um and then again
 

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.579
sliding the action bar um and then again
edge swipe or full swipe and then the

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:03.589
edge swipe or full swipe and then the
 

00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:04.960
edge swipe or full swipe and then the
other thing that that folks sometimes

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:04.970
other thing that that folks sometimes
 

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.489
other thing that that folks sometimes
put into the

00:11:06.489 --> 00:11:06.499
put into the
 

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.709
put into the
into the navigation drawer it's things

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:08.719
into the navigation drawer it's things
 

00:11:08.719 --> 00:11:11.799
into the navigation drawer it's things
like settings and help and we really

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:11.809
like settings and help and we really
 

00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:13.539
like settings and help and we really
don't recommend putting things like

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:13.549
don't recommend putting things like
 

00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:14.889
don't recommend putting things like
settings and help there because that's

00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:14.899
settings and help there because that's
 

00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:18.039
settings and help there because that's
where those are really meant to be in

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:18.049
where those are really meant to be in
 

00:11:18.049 --> 00:11:20.889
where those are really meant to be in
the action overflow the action overflow

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:20.899
the action overflow the action overflow
 

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:23.409
the action overflow the action overflow
is kind of those three vertical dots in

00:11:23.409 --> 00:11:23.419
is kind of those three vertical dots in
 

00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:27.309
is kind of those three vertical dots in
the action bar that you know that when

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:27.319
the action bar that you know that when
 

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:28.409
the action bar that you know that when
you press them used to kind of

00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:28.419
you press them used to kind of
 

00:11:28.419 --> 00:11:30.549
you press them used to kind of
additional actions that you can take and

00:11:30.549 --> 00:11:30.559
additional actions that you can take and
 

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:34.509
additional actions that you can take and

those are really kind of overflow items

00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:38.539
those are really kind of overflow items
 

00:11:38.539 --> 00:11:41.469
those are really kind of overflow items
and so we feel that those should belong

00:11:41.469 --> 00:11:41.479
and so we feel that those should belong
 

00:11:41.479 --> 00:11:43.659
and so we feel that those should belong
in an action overflow and not in the

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:43.669
in an action overflow and not in the
 

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:46.449
in an action overflow and not in the
navigation drawer so these are kind of

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:46.459
navigation drawer so these are kind of
 

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:50.259

just a question of time and resources so
 

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:10.839
just a question of time and resources so
hopefully at some point will be anybody

action bar and they'll the overflows
 

00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:38.079
action bar and they'll the overflows
that will no longer accessible so it's

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:38.089
that will no longer accessible so it's
 

00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:39.639
that will no longer accessible so it's
another good reason to keep the action

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:39.649
another good reason to keep the action
 

00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:40.899
another good reason to keep the action
by in place that you can keep that

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:40.909
by in place that you can keep that
 

00:12:40.909 --> 00:12:45.849

this extra real estate people get

00:12:53.259 --> 00:12:53.269
this extra real estate people get
 

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:54.849
this extra real estate people get
tempted to dump all sorts of extra

00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:54.859
tempted to dump all sorts of extra
 

00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:56.710
tempted to dump all sorts of extra
information in there and I think that

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720
information in there and I think that
 

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.359

really waters down this power is a

00:12:58.359 --> 00:12:58.369
really waters down this power is a
 

00:12:58.369 --> 00:13:01.059
really waters down this power is a
navigational tool I tend to include is

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:01.069
navigational tool I tend to include is
 

00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:03.429
navigational tool I tend to include is
very similar to the spin and navigation

00:13:03.429 --> 00:13:03.439
very similar to the spin and navigation
 

00:13:03.439 --> 00:13:06.369
very similar to the spin and navigation
like you might see in google maps for

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:06.379
like you might see in google maps for
 

00:13:06.379 --> 00:13:08.199
like you might see in google maps for
example it's a similar thing but you

00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:08.209
example it's a similar thing but you
 

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:09.939
example it's a similar thing but you
know if you have a larger list of items

00:13:09.939 --> 00:13:09.949
know if you have a larger list of items
 

00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:11.769
know if you have a larger list of items
you can become unwieldy in that spinner

00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:11.779
you can become unwieldy in that spinner
 

00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:14.019
you can become unwieldy in that spinner
and harder to do so i think the drawer

00:13:14.019 --> 00:13:14.029
and harder to do so i think the drawer
 

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:16.059
and harder to do so i think the drawer
can be a good alternative there and as

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:16.069
can be a good alternative there and as
 

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:17.499
can be a good alternative there and as
well as not sacrificing some real estate

00:13:17.499 --> 00:13:17.509
well as not sacrificing some real estate
 

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:19.510
well as not sacrificing some real estate
so don't be tempted to just Chuck

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:19.520
so don't be tempted to just Chuck
 

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.070
so don't be tempted to just Chuck
any other thing in there because you had

any other thing in there because you had
 

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.480
any other thing in there because you had
some more space and you know another

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:22.490
some more space and you know another
 

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:26.740
some more space and you know another
vertically scrolling container mm-hmm so

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:26.750

site navigation actually was very

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720
site navigation actually was very
 

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.200
site navigation actually was very
difficult to use because it didn't make

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:47.210
difficult to use because it didn't make
 

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.940

navigation drawers I'm sure that we've
 

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.450
navigation drawers I'm sure that we've
done some amount of research but I

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:10.460
done some amount of research but I
 

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.580

really know the details we definitely

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:12.590
really know the details we definitely
 

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.770
really know the details we definitely
did research on I know we did a whole

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:14.780
did research on I know we did a whole
 

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.600
did research on I know we did a whole
bunch of research on the action bar and

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:16.610
bunch of research on the action bar and
 

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.860

few years ago maybe two years ago we did
 

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.720
few years ago maybe two years ago we did
a big study on that but um I think that

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:25.730
a big study on that but um I think that
 

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.870
a big study on that but um I think that

a lot of our guidance is it as a result
of direct user testing with that but the

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:30.950
of direct user testing with that but the
 

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.080

then you can build up these incredibly
 

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.120
then you can build up these incredibly
long back stack which gets quite

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:52.130
long back stack which gets quite
 

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.400
long back stack which gets quite
complicated whereas if you do stick to

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:54.410
complicated whereas if you do stick to

very distinct platforms like I mean um
 

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:12.759
very distinct platforms like I mean um
if you look at the desktop platform

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:12.769
if you look at the desktop platform
 

00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:14.620
if you look at the desktop platform
versus you know Android they're

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:14.630
versus you know Android they're
 

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.410
versus you know Android they're
definitely different you know norms on

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:17.420
definitely different you know norms on
 

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.780

each so you know even iconography you

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:19.790
each so you know even iconography you
 

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.300
each so you know even iconography you
know even the direction of like you know

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:22.310
know even the direction of like you know
 

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.370
know even the direction of like you know
if there's a search icon where the

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:24.380
if there's a search icon where the
 

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.680
if there's a search icon where the
handle is is it to the left or to the

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:26.690
handle is is it to the left or to the
 

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.300
handle is is it to the left or to the
right even little things like that I

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:28.310
right even little things like that I
 

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.389
right even little things like that I
mean they can differ across platforms so

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399
mean they can differ across platforms so
 

00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:32.259
mean they can differ across platforms so
I'd say that you know it's more

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:32.269
I'd say that you know it's more
 

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:33.759
I'd say that you know it's more
important than to be consistent within

important than to be consistent within
 

00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:35.829
important than to be consistent within
Android rather than consistent across

in the past yeah I mean you some e
 

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.470
in the past yeah I mean you some e
jar as the main navigation its I use it

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480
jar as the main navigation its I use it
 

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.870
jar as the main navigation its I use it
as a last resource I mean if you don't

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880
as a last resource I mean if you don't
 

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.980

have any other way to show visually on
 

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:01.720
have any other way to show visually on
the app d sections oh there but I think

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:01.730
the app d sections oh there but I think
 

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.870
the app d sections oh there but I think
it's very very easy to just throw

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880
it's very very easy to just throw
 

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.150
it's very very easy to just throw
everything in there and forget about it

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:07.160
everything in there and forget about it
 

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.330
everything in there and forget about it
and yeah it I mean it commented right

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:12.340
and yeah it I mean it commented right
 

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.040
and yeah it I mean it commented right
it's not right because the users are not

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:15.050
it's not right because the users are not
 

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.190
it's not right because the users are not
seen and if the users have not seen they

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200
seen and if the users have not seen they
 

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.170
seen and if the users have not seen they
probably not going to remember that they

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:20.180
probably not going to remember that they
 

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.550
probably not going to remember that they
have that it's there so I think it's a

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:24.560
have that it's there so I think it's a
 

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.310
have that it's there so I think it's a
trend it's obviously a trend a lot of

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320
trend it's obviously a trend a lot of
 

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.290
trend it's obviously a trend a lot of
people are using it better I don't think

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:29.300
people are using it better I don't think
 

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.520
people are using it better I don't think
I think it's like um okay we don't know

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:33.530
I think it's like um okay we don't know
 

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.700

and what it should be is really a last
 

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.550
and what it should be is really a last
resort and i think that they're two

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:57.560
resort and i think that they're two
 

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.470
resort and i think that they're two
points want to make their you know the

00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480
points want to make their you know the
 

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.630
points want to make their you know the
first is that you know sometimes there

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640
first is that you know sometimes there
 

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.520
first is that you know sometimes there
are jars that are that have three items

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:03.530
are jars that are that have three items
 

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.170
are jars that are that have three items
in the left right in the in the left

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:05.180
in the left right in the in the left
 

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.210
in the left right in the in the left
pane you swipe it open and there's three

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:07.220
pane you swipe it open and there's three
 

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.240
pane you swipe it open and there's three
items there um drawers are really just

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.250
items there um drawers are really just
 

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.520
items there um drawers are really just
replacements for tabs in that case so

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:12.530
replacements for tabs in that case so
 

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.600
replacements for tabs in that case so
it's really just an alternative

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:13.610
it's really just an alternative
 

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.880
it's really just an alternative
presentation of horizontal tabs at the

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:15.890
presentation of horizontal tabs at the
 

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.770
presentation of horizontal tabs at the
top of the screen and so you know that

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:17.780
top of the screen and so you know that
 

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.270
top of the screen and so you know that
point why don't you just you know simply

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280
point why don't you just you know simply
 

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.950
point why don't you just you know simply
use tabs or use a spinner something

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960
use tabs or use a spinner something
 

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.840
use tabs or use a spinner something
that's it's less heavy weight and and

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:22.850
that's it's less heavy weight and and
 

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.170
that's it's less heavy weight and and
more immediate more immediately visible

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.180
more immediate more immediately visible
 

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.520
more immediate more immediately visible
and the other point I wanted to make is

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:27.530
and the other point I wanted to make is
 

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.100
and the other point I wanted to make is
that you know this is actually this

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.110
that you know this is actually this
 

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.510
that you know this is actually this
reminds me of one of the problems that

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520
reminds me of one of the problems that
 

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.220
reminds me of one of the problems that
we saw with the menu button the original

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:33.230
we saw with the menu button the original
 

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.440
we saw with the menu button the original
menu button on older devices one of the

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:35.450
menu button on older devices one of the
 

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:36.850
menu button on older devices one of the
problems was that people were putting

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:36.860
problems was that people were putting
 

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.880
problems was that people were putting
core functionality into something that

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:39.890
core functionality into something that
 

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.400
core functionality into something that
wasn't immediately visible and something

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:42.410
wasn't immediately visible and something
 

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.170
wasn't immediately visible and something
that wasn't immediately kind of it

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:44.180
that wasn't immediately kind of it
 

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.280
that wasn't immediately kind of it
wasn't immediately clear what

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:45.290
wasn't immediately clear what
 

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.140
wasn't immediately clear what
functionality was available and so you

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:47.150
functionality was available and so you
 

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.790
functionality was available and so you
know you would press the menu button and

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:48.800
know you would press the menu button and
 

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.740
know you would press the menu button and
hope that there's interesting stuff in

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:50.750
hope that there's interesting stuff in
 

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.480
hope that there's interesting stuff in
there hope that the thing that you're

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:52.490
there hope that the thing that you're
 

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.580
there hope that the thing that you're
trying to do is in there it wasn't

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:54.590
trying to do is in there it wasn't
 

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.500
trying to do is in there it wasn't
immediately on screen one of the reasons

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:56.510
immediately on screen one of the reasons

we actually came up with the action bar

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:58.220
we actually came up with the action bar
 

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.260
we actually came up with the action bar
pattern with

00:19:59.260 --> 00:19:59.270

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.270
pattern with
to put more fundamental actions in

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280
to put more fundamental actions in

navigation on screen and I think that

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:03.050
navigation on screen and I think that
 

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.110

to Russia you've mentioned tablets but

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.100
to Russia you've mentioned tablets but
 

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.980
to Russia you've mentioned tablets but
also it makes it easy to do a

master-detail flow on tablets because

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360
master-detail flow on tablets because
 

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.570
master-detail flow on tablets because
you can show that sort of draw by

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:43.580
you can show that sort of draw by
 

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.730
you can show that sort of draw by

did you want to like a make a point

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:32.450
did you want to like a make a point
 

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.260
did you want to like a make a point
about its usefulness or do you have any

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:35.270
about its usefulness or do you have any
 

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.289
about its usefulness or do you have any
questions about it yeah I'm just curious

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:38.299
questions about it yeah I'm just curious
 

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:40.840
questions about it yeah I'm just curious
like so there's a little bit of

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:40.850
like so there's a little bit of
 

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.060
like so there's a little bit of
weirdness about scrolling up bring

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:43.070
weirdness about scrolling up bring
 

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.149
weirdness about scrolling up bring
something from the bottom that the

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159
something from the bottom that the
 

00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:47.919
something from the bottom that the
advantage of person said it's on the

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:47.929
advantage of person said it's on the
 

00:24:47.929 --> 00:24:50.980
advantage of person said it's on the
bottom so it's lot it's a lot closer to

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:50.990
bottom so it's lot it's a lot closer to
 

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.659
bottom so it's lot it's a lot closer to
your your finger maybe if you're

00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:52.669
your your finger maybe if you're
 

00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:54.070
your your finger maybe if you're
scrolling up you just draw up a

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080
scrolling up you just draw up a
 

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.680
scrolling up you just draw up a
loneliness right there if you're like

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:56.690
loneliness right there if you're like
 

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.480
loneliness right there if you're like
strictly on like a tablet or something

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:58.490
strictly on like a tablet or something
 

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.980
strictly on like a tablet or something
or if you scroll up and the things at

00:24:59.980 --> 00:24:59.990
or if you scroll up and the things at
 

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.320
or if you scroll up and the things at
the top then it's really far away so

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:02.330
the top then it's really far away so
 

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.880
the top then it's really far away so
here's like there what's the ideas about

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:06.890
here's like there what's the ideas about
 

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.799
here's like there what's the ideas about
like should it be on the top or bottom

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:08.809
like should it be on the top or bottom
 

00:25:08.809 --> 00:25:12.220
like should it be on the top or bottom
or they were just a weird pattern and

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:12.230
or they were just a weird pattern and
 

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:16.120
or they were just a weird pattern and
olive oil I think um I think that the

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:16.130
olive oil I think um I think that the
 

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.799
olive oil I think um I think that the
the placement is generally probably

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:17.809
the placement is generally probably
 

00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:19.120
the placement is generally probably
better to put at the top it's a little

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.130
better to put at the top it's a little
 

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.950
better to put at the top it's a little
more natural I'd say that the Google+

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960
more natural I'd say that the Google+
 

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.419
more natural I'd say that the Google+
app in general you know when talking

00:25:22.419 --> 00:25:22.429
app in general you know when talking
 

00:25:22.429 --> 00:25:23.919
app in general you know when talking
about things that Google Plus that does

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:23.929
about things that Google Plus that does
 

00:25:23.929 --> 00:25:26.110
about things that Google Plus that does
it's a little more experimental on the

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120
it's a little more experimental on the
 

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.880
it's a little more experimental on the
UI side there they're definitely drawing

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:27.890
UI side there they're definitely drawing
 

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.100
UI side there they're definitely drawing
lots and lots of things and you know

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.110
lots and lots of things and you know
 

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.690
lots and lots of things and you know
some of them work really well some of

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:31.700
some of them work really well some of
 

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.549
some of them work really well some of
them are really just you know

00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559
them are really just you know
 

00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:36.700
them are really just you know
experiments that they'll pull out so I

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:36.710
experiments that they'll pull out so I
 

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.740
experiments that they'll pull out so I
wouldn't say that you know follow the

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:38.750
wouldn't say that you know follow the
 

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.049
wouldn't say that you know follow the
Google+ app you know why you know to the

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:41.059
Google+ app you know why you know to the
 

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:44.529
Google+ app you know why you know to the
T as to what it does um but specifically

00:25:44.529 --> 00:25:44.539
T as to what it does um but specifically
 

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:45.610
T as to what it does um but specifically
in this case I think one of the reasons

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:45.620
in this case I think one of the reasons
 

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.380
in this case I think one of the reasons
that they moved it down is that it

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:47.390
that they moved it down is that it
 

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.909
that they moved it down is that it
wasn't like the iconography that they

00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919
wasn't like the iconography that they
 

00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:50.740
wasn't like the iconography that they
were using wasn't as clear as it could

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:50.750
were using wasn't as clear as it could
 

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.450
were using wasn't as clear as it could
be and then they wanted to show text as

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:52.460
be and then they wanted to show text as
 

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.240
be and then they wanted to show text as
well and then at that point you know the

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.250
well and then at that point you know the
 

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.180
well and then at that point you know the
the bar itself became quite large so it

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:58.190
the bar itself became quite large so it
 

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:01.090
the bar itself became quite large so it
became just kind of a little a little

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:01.100
became just kind of a little a little
 

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.799
became just kind of a little a little
bit of a burden at the very top of the

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:02.809
bit of a burden at the very top of the
 

00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:04.180
bit of a burden at the very top of the
screen so they moved it to the bottom

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:04.190
screen so they moved it to the bottom
 

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.740
screen so they moved it to the bottom
but I don't think that's really

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:05.750
but I don't think that's really
 

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.210
but I don't think that's really
finalized I don't really know if it's

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:07.220
finalized I don't really know if it's
 

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.250
finalized I don't really know if it's
finalized but certainly it's stuff that

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:09.260
finalized but certainly it's stuff that
 

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.870
finalized but certainly it's stuff that
we're still exploring but I'd say that

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880
we're still exploring but I'd say that
 

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.810
we're still exploring but I'd say that
by default you should probably use you

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:13.820
by default you should probably use you
 

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.840
by default you should probably use you
know sticky bars at the top unless it's

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:16.850
know sticky bars at the top unless it's
 

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.669
know sticky bars at the top unless it's
really kind of following you're spilling

00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679
really kind of following you're spilling
 

00:26:18.679 --> 00:26:21.370

gesture so if you're scrolling down and

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:21.380
gesture so if you're scrolling down and
 

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.330
gesture so if you're scrolling down and
you want to show something at the very

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:22.340
you want to show something at the very
 

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.700
you want to show something at the very
bottom like for example you know jump to

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:24.710
bottom like for example you know jump to
 

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.019
bottom like for example you know jump to
the bottom I don't know if this is very

00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:26.029
the bottom I don't know if this is very
 

00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:27.639
the bottom I don't know if this is very
common but you know your jump to the top

00:26:27.639 --> 00:26:27.649
common but you know your jump to the top
 

00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:30.700
common but you know your jump to the top
or jump to the bottom if it's if it's

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:30.710
or jump to the bottom if it's if it's
 

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.260
or jump to the bottom if it's if it's
showing up in the direction you're

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:32.270
showing up in the direction you're
 

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.940
showing up in the direction you're
scrolling the probably makes sense so if

scrolling the probably makes sense so if
 

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.200
scrolling the probably makes sense so if
you're scrolling up probably showing

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.210
you're scrolling up probably showing
 

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.630
you're scrolling up probably showing
something at the top is

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640
something at the top is
