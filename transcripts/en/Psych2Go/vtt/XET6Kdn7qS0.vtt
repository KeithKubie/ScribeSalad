00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.149
The older we get the harder it is to not only make but keep friends close to our side and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.739
Sometimes the people we least expect to let us down are those who hurt us the most.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.189
As your friend changed into someone you no longer recognize

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.900
Do you feel more burdened instead of fulfilled in some of your friendships?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.220
Here are 10 signs you may have a toxic friend.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.680
1. You feel like you can't be your true self when you're with them.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.709
Friendships exist so you can grow familiar and comfortable with someone

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.409
But if they pressure you to do things you don't want to or begin to judge you for the new hobbies you develop

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.769
perhaps it's time to think about where your friendship is going.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.480
A real friend is someone you can be yourself with without fearing that they won't accept you.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.340
2.Your communication becomes almost non-existent.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.040
Do they often ghost you or put minimum effort and communication,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.000
if it's always you texting or calling them first?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.640
You might want to ask yourself 
why it's always you initiating plans.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.860
Sometimes life gets busy and people
may not be able to hang out with each other

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.400
as much when they move, get new jobs
or entering new relationships.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.760
But if they only seem to hang out with you when the original plans have been canceled,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.800
or just to kill time before
they ditch you to hang out with others,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.960
they may only be using you for their own convenience.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.800
3. They constantly smother you!

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.720
A toxic friend can also swing the other way

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.060
and try to cross over
any healthy boundaries you set for yourself.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.020
If they want to spend every minute every day with you

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.580
but get jealous when you want to hang out
with your other friends,family or lover,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.220
then they aren't being
respectful towards you.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.040
A healthy friendship needs balance in order to sustain.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.220
Even if the two of you are best friends,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.300
too much of anything is bad for you and can be emotionally draining.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.120
4. You feel like you guys are competing
against one another.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.840
Are they constantly trying to one-up you?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.540
If they can't be happy for your success,
it's best to take a step back

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.180
and figure out where their jealousy issues stem from.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.600
Friendship is built on the foundation of
compassion and selflessness.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.240
If their competitive streak takes over,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.580
they might only have wanted to
get closer to you to be frienemies.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.980
5. They aren't considerate of your feelings.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.320
Sometimes you feel like you can trust them.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.820
Other times they say a comment that takes a jab at you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.019
and it makes you wonder what they really meant by it.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.140
There's a difference between
friendly sarcasm and mean remarks

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.540
that teeter over the edge of bullying.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.020
6.They give you a hard time for your mistakes
even when you apologize.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.520
If they constantly bring up the past
and only focus on what you've done wrong,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.040
then perhaps it's time to move forward without them.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.760
Friendships can only sustain if the two of you can grow together.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.960
But if they seem to hold you back and
refuse to let go of their grudges,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.800
then this will only work against your friendship
instead of supporting it.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.460
7. They are controlling and try to micromanage you
rather than give you advice.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.760
A good friend is there for you during the tough times.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.000
But if your friend tries to fix you and wants to make decisions for you

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.500
instead of giving you advice,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.680
then they are treating you more like a project rather than a friend.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.420
Even if they're coming from a good place
and only want what's best for you,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.400
they can't live your life for you.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.440
8. Your friendship provides more stress than support.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.500
Do you feel overwhelmed, neglected or unhappy?

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.360
If you feel like you're still testing your friend to see if you can trust them,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.220
then chances are your friendship isn't solidifying.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.820
Although friendships take work and effort,
they shouldn't always be stressful.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.520
The whole point of having a good friend is being able to have fun together without trying too hard.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.240
9. You frequently catch them
talking about you behind your back.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.560
It's normal to seek advice from people
outside of your conflicting relationship.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.280
And when we're angry or sad,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.580
sometimes we might say things about others
that we don't always mean out of frustration,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.300
but a toxic friend may gossip behind your back

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.980
just because they find it satisfying or entertaining.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.900
If you confront them about it and they continue to do it,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.020
this will only hurt you in the long run.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.540
10. You forget why the two of you
became friends in the first place.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.620
Do you feel like your friendship is coming to an end?

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.300
It's not fun losing friends

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.700
but it's better to let go, move on and find people
who accept you for who you are,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.520
instead of putting effort in a friendship
that will never work.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.360
Maybe at one point you guys really were friends,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.440
but those days are long gone.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.420
Appreciate the memories you made,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.440
and make new ones with people
who are willing to be there for you.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.360
