00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.420
&gt;&gt; MATT: I’m Matt and this is John. We work
from Larva Labs, and we have written several

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.010
applications for Android. We have about three
games and a photo twisting application. And

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.970
we wrote them because, mainly because we’re
fans of the genres there in, the strategy

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.650
games, [INDISTINCT] game, and word kind of
finding games. So that was really the motivation,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.080
and just because we like the platform as well.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So you chose the Android platform.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.969
Tell us a bit about how you came to that decision
in technical standards.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.120
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah. I think, well, we’re Java
developers from sort of way back. So we chose

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.310
the Android platform, you know, because we
really like the SDK, and we kind of like where

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.500
they're going with it, like that it was open-sourced,
and that it was so sort of pluggable and,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.220
you know, open in its access, so it really
makes sense for us. And we wanted to target

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.210
the, you know, the market. We wanted to try
that out and see if there was a business there

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:14.340
and, you know, in targeting the Android market.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So as developers we really value

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.700
being able to share war stories. Tell us about
one particularly difficult period of development

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.700
and how you dealt with that.
&gt;&gt; JOHN: What’s a good example of that?

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.909
&gt;&gt; MATT: Let me think here. Well, I would
say we have a little bit of trouble on our

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.570
tower defense game, Retro Defense. We had
some trouble kind of getting--there’s a

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.580
lot of graphics on that game and there's a
lot of animation and a lot of stuff. And you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.750
know, we spent a lot of time kind of just
getting it to the level of performance that

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.320
we wanted to get it to. So it wasn’t necessarily
there was any one particular stumbling block

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.020
per se, but it was just kind of a process
of optimization that, you know, kind of led

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.240
to some unexpected things we did, you know,
that weren’t necessarily obvious. So, I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.040
would say it again, like I think everyone
knows the advice but the profile: “You should

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.690
know what you're doing before you start doing
it?” Because we definitely wasted a lot

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.580
of time fixing some things.
&gt;&gt; JOHN: We also had a real struggle on the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.049
app where you're warping photos. We wanted
to be able to get photos from the gallery

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.269
and put the photos back into the gallery or
they'll email them out. And, you know, we

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.939
knew about the intense and we thought it was
going to be a kind of a straightforward thing,

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.069
but we really struggled to do that. We really
kind of, we searched every possible forum

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.879
posts and tried all of these different things,
and we eventually got it to go but that was

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.379
a real battle, too, you know. I think now
we know it, you know, we know it forever.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.499
And the next time we do even similar to that,
it will go a little better, but that was the

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:39.719
struggle, yeah, just, just sort of working
between the gallery app and our app, and between

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.049
the email apps and our app.
&gt;&gt; MATT: And it seemed almost like the things

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.499
that we thought were going to be hard weren’t
hard, and the things that we had thought were

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.069
going to be easy turned out to be a little
more difficult. It was not in every case but

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.310
a few of those things, that’s what happened,
so.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.310
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So what new features in cupcake have

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.372
you been able to use in your applications?
&gt;&gt; MATT: What new features? Well, one of the

00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:06.499
new features we were able to use is not crashing,
because we had a bit of a problem. So we fixed

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:11.470
that now, that’s good. But, yeah, not too
much, I mean, what was kind of cool about

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.909
that was that a lot of our interface just
kind of took advantage of it automatically,

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.769
like, we have a bunch of cool transitions
now where we did before, which kind of just

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.739
worked without us doing anything. So the whole
interface of our games like the way the settings

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.430
come up and the way, when you pop open menu,
the level chooser and stuff, it’s all like

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.299
smooth, like, cool kind of choosing transition
and stuff. So that was really, really nice

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.139
to run that for the first time once you fix
the crash and see all those new transitions.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.629
&gt;&gt; JOHN: We don’t have anything like this
in an app that’s out yet. But we’re interested

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.040
in getting involved in the new sound APIs,
too, and the more direct access to audio.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.030
That’s something that’s interesting to
us for sure, and we hope to use that more.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.799
&gt;&gt; MALE: Okay. Were there any tips or tricks
that you're able to use?

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.790
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Tips or tricks that we heard, that
we learned from someone that we made use of?

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.379
I mean, there are...
&gt;&gt; MATT: There's a few, yeah. There's a couple.

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.499
One was this gesture detector class is awesome.
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah.

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.980
&gt;&gt; MATT: Where we were running a bunch of
stuff to try to figure out when you're long

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.209
pressing, we just didn’t really realized
there was something already in there for flings,

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.489
for all of the kind of stuff that you would
do with your, with the touch interface. This

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.400
thing handles it all, and just kind of gives
you the super nice interface into like, the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.810
user just flung in its direction, you know,
if the user long presses this thing. So that

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.580
thing was--we spent some time trying to do
it ourselves, and then we realized that was

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.129
there, and it replaced everything we did with
that. So that was really a good fun.

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:39.061
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah. And with the existing audio
tip, the sound pool stuff, you know, how to

00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:41.589
use that, we struggled for a while in that.
&gt;&gt; MATT: Yeah, that’s true.

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:45.572
&gt;&gt; JOHN: There was limited documentation,
but some sort of, some forum posts and stuff

00:04:45.572 --> 00:04:48.970
that straightened us out.
&gt;&gt; MATT: Oh, yeah, the audio tip is used Ogg

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.889
Vorbis. It’s the only one.
&gt;&gt; JOHN: That’s right. Yeah.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.440
&gt;&gt; MATT: I mean pre-cupcake. I don’t know
what the deal was in cupcake yet. But...

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.350
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah, we just had, we just had, you
know, the wave files, just un-encoded audio,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.500
and it was really, it had a lot of latency.
And we just sort of--someone just mentioned

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.710
almost in passing like, “Oh, is Ogg Vorbis
the only format that has no latency?” And

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.810
we said, “What?” And so we switched over
to that, and everything has been real sharp

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.379
and working great.
&gt;&gt; MATT: Yeah. So that was a good tip.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.889
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah, that was a tip that came out
of nowhere for us. Yeah.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.330
&gt;&gt; MATT: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So what's your favorite aspect of

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:24.030
the Android development process?
&gt;&gt; MATT: I would say, well, what do...? The

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.880
SDK is great. The emulator is really good.
And I would say like having the source is

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.860
amazing. We haven’t worked on a phone before
where we've had access to the source. So there’s

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.629
a lot of times where you have a very simple
question about what something is going to

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:42.750
do. And the way we did it before was the black
box, you know, like test every possible things

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.820
until we did something right. Now you just
take a look, you know, and it’s very quick.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.180
It's--to see what going on. It saves a lot
of time. So...

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.439
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah, that’s really handy. That’s
a big factor.

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.610
&gt;&gt; MATT: Yeah. And we’re getting more into
like the kind of the replaceable aspect of

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.129
the components, you know, and [INDISTINCT]
and stuff like that, and access to all the

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:00.479
different information on the phone. And so
that whole content provider system is really

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.110
cool, too. So, the, you know, the kind of
open nature of all the components in the phone

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.080
is really I think going to provide some concrete
benefits, you know. It’s not just going

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.440
to be a talking point. It’s going to start
to produce some real, real cool results.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:22.250
&gt;&gt; MALE: So what are the features that you
could do in your app that you can't do on

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.710
other platforms?
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Well, like Matt just said, there

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.250
is the things that we can't do are the, you
know, in another platforms is that sort of

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.440
real integration without the components and
you have to pull data out from other apps,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.910
you know, from your contacts or from SMS or
phone calls--all that sort of stuff. You can

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.410
build an app that truly is like a first class
member of that phone, and not just some add-on,

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.939
that is of, you know, that’s completely
sound boxed and unable to participate. That’s

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:54.220
a big thing.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Thank you for your time.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.680
&gt;&gt; JOHN: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; MATT: All right, perfect.
