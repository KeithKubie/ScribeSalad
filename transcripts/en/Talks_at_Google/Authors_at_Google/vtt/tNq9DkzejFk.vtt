And today, Bruce is here to talk
about his new book, "The

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.980
Secrets of Happy Families." So
please join me in welcoming

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.230
Bruce Feiler.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.590
BRUCE FEILER: Good afternoon,
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.920
I'm delighted to be here, though
my wife, upon hearing

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.980
that was going to give this
talk, insisted that I begin

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.710
with this disclaimer, which is
that I wrote about happy

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.090
families, not because I had one,
but because I wanted one.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.180
As many of you know, I grew up
in Savannah, Georgia, and as

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.960
you just heard, spent many years
of my life-- almost two

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.570
decades-- traveling around the
world, entering different

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.740
worlds, and writing
about them.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.820
I wrote a book about Japan,
about England, many years

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.720
traveling around the
Middle East.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.940
And yes, it's true, I did spend
a year performing as a

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.390
clown in a traveling circus.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060
And I would go out and enter--

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.210
I would even say brazenly
enter--

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.670
these different worlds, and try
to become a part of them.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.660
But I found a few years ago when
I became a parent that,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.400
in the world of family, in the
world of my own house, I felt

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.120
completely lost.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.670
And a few years ago, all of
this came to a head--

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.590
this incredible chaos, and the
sense that we were always on

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.090
the defense as parents.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.810
My family gathers every summer
for a two week extended family

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.290
reunion on Tybee Island off
the coast of Savannah.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.030
In fact, I am the father of soon
to be eight-year-old now

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.460
identical twin daughters.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.230
One of them is named Eden, for
the garden of Eden, and one of

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.210
them is Tybee, named for this
island in Savannah, where I

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.470
grew up and where
we got married.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.460
And we had just a number of
years ago-- we just gotten

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.810
through that long slog of sippy
cups and diaper caddies,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.210
and we were ready to form
a family culture.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.720
And I'd been thinking, we talk
so much in this culture about

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.610
racing the biological clock to
have our children, but yet,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.930
there's this other biological
clock that we're also racing

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.720
that we don't really talk
about, and that is the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.910
biological clock of before our
children grow up and don't

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.550
want anything to do with
us as parents again.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.020
So there's this kind of window
that we have to develop a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.100
family culture.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.250
And to be honest, we
didn't really know

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.020
how to go about that.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.810
How do you teach kids values
in a 24/7 world?

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.610
How do you make sure that they
have that bond with their

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.890
family that's very tight
before they go off

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.710
and enter the world?

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.290
So we were struggling with those
issues, my wife and I.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.620
And we were the first
to arrive at this

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.110
extended family reunion.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.500
My little sister came next.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.970
She has older children.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.690
Her kids were preteens at the
time, and they were facing

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.710
their challenges--

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.720
prying their kids' noses out
of their digital devices,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.730
teaching their kids
about money, and

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.560
sex, and cyber stalking.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.090
My older brother came next.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.710
He doesn't have children.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.720
And he was very focused
on my aging parents.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.620
Was it time to put Dad in
a wheelchair full time?

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.390
Was it time to ask mom to
stop driving at night?

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.760
So all these issues were kind
of swirling in our family as

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.970
we got together, and sure
enough, on that first night,

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.430
everything became exploding
out onto the table.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.630
We were sitting down to dinner,
and I noticed out of

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.020
the corner of my eye
that my nephew was

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.230
texting under the table.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.260
And yes, I knew I shouldn't say
anything, but I couldn't

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.070
help myself.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.860
And I asked him to
put it away.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.290
Kaboom!

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.720
It was like a mushroom
cloud exploded.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.530
My sister snapped at me not to
parent her children, my father

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.150
pointed out that it was my
daughters who were balancing

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.930
spoons on their noses, my mother
said, from her point of

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.180
view, none of the grandchildren
had

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.540
manners to speak of.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.820
And at that point, my wife got
up and fled to the kitchen to

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.430
get ice cream, exactly as
her mother would have

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.300
done in this instance.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.440
But they haven't finished their
vegetables, I said, at

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.530
which point, everybody got up
and fled to separate corners

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.870
of the house.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.300
Later that night, my father
called me to his bedside, and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.150
there was this palpable quiver
in his voice I couldn't

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.200
remember hearing before.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.298
Our family's falling
apart, he said.

00:04:44.298 --> 00:04:46.680
Oh, no it's not, I said,
without thinking.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.120
We're stronger than ever.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.310
But lying in bed that night,
I began to wonder.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.530
Was he right?

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.820
What is the secret sauce
that holds families

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.430
together these days?

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.560
What are the ingredients that
make some families effective,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.310
resilient, happy?

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.110
It turns out to be an
astonishingly good time to ask

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.340
that question.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.620
The last few years have seen a
remarkable transformation--

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.860
an explosion of knowledge about
all the things that

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.820
families are challenged with.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.900
Dinner time, discipline,
difficult conversations.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.430
There are breakthrough ideas
about how to make teams and

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.850
groups run more effectively, not
just in families, but in

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.880
so many different worlds.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.330
The problem is that parents are
in this straitjacket, that

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.150
the only ideas we are allowed
to implement must come from

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.070
what I call the family
improvement industry--

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.470
shrinks and self help gurus
and other family experts.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.280
But as you know, in so many
different worlds, from Silicon

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.380
Valley to corporate America,
from championship sports

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.150
teams, even to the US military,
there's all this new

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.910
knowledge about how to make
groups run smoothly, be

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.790
effective, be resilient, bounce
back from difficulties

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.550
more quickly.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.240
The problem is that most of
that knowledge remains

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.000
ghettoized in that world, cut
off from the families, from

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.070
the parents who need it most.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.890
So I spent the last few years
traveling around, entering

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.530
these different worlds, and
trying to figure out what

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.070
parents in those worlds were
taking home and doing with

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.120
their families.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.730
What is the research behind
these new ideas that they're

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.080
implementing?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.300
And then I brought those
ideas back home to my

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.950
own wife and kids.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.720
When I set out on this project,
I made two promises

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.300
to myself, and one promise
to my wife.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.010
I met the vow I made to her, and
I didn't meet the two vows

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.460
I made to myself.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.630
So the vow I made to her was
that she said, I'm willing to

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.530
try any new idea that you come
up with, but I don't want

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.610
anything based on theory.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.120
I want to know that actual
families are doing these

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.380
actual ideas.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.470
The two vows to myself were
more problematic.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.310
The first vow I made was that I
wasn't going to talk to any

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.730
therapists, and I did
violate that.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.480
I actually spoke to a Belgian
sex therapist.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.260
It was the only one I talked to,
but I did break that vow.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.420
The other vow that I made to
myself was that I wasn't going

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.280
to take what I learned and
cram it into some clever

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.020
little list of the two or three
or five or seven things

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.010
that you have to do to
have a happy family.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.940
I don't know about you,
but I find those

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.010
lists incredibly stressful.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.070
What happens if I disagree
with number two, or if I

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.030
forget number four?

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.330
Am I doomed to have
an unhappy family?

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.220
The truth is, I don't think
there is such a list.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.610
In fact, one of the things
I've tried to do in The

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.590
Secrets of Happy Families is
specifically put 200 new ideas

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.150
out onto the table, because it
would be very clear that with

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.930
200, nobody could be expected
to do them all.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.130
But if you take the three or
four or seven that apply to

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.430
your family, and that most
resonate with you, and you

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.050
bring them home, I'm almost
prepared to guarantee that

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.260
you'll have a happier
family in a week.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.700
Having said that, it did turn
out that certain themes did

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.440
keep emerging with all the
families I was talking to, and

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.450
all of the experts I was
interviewing, and all the

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.420
research I was looking at.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.470
And what I want to do here today
is lay out two of those

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.250
broad themes.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.540
And before I do that, I just
want to set the table here by

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.820
saying, one of the things that
I clearly learned, and the

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.800
research clearly shows, is
that we have learned a

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.010
tremendous amount in the first
generation of positive

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.000
psychology.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.559
And maybe the number one thing
that we have learned that

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:38.020
makes people happy
is relationships.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.380
Happiness by almost every
measure is other people, and

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.550
the other people that matter
most to us are our family.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.200
But what is staggering, maybe
even shocking, is that we

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.810
spend so little time
actually trying

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.210
to improve our families.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.920
Think about it.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.150
We have our jobs.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.260
We work on those.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.590
We have our hobbies.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.750
We work on those.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.390
We have our bodies.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.040
We work on those.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.080
We have our families, but
somehow, this idea is out

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.890
there that our families
just are.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.510
We're going to somehow
organically just know how to

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.110
raise a family.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.230
But the truth is, for many
of us, it's not working.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.140
But the good news is, there is
lots of know how out there.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.060
And if you do small things,
and take small steps, you

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.860
actually can make your family
happier, and in the process,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.840
make everybody in the
family happier.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.690
So what's the first of the two
big ideas I want to talk about

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.750
here today?

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:38.210
It is high functioning families
adapt all the time.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.050
Now, I thought when I became
a parent, no problem.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.850
I'm just gonna set a few rules,
and we're going to

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.190
follow them, and everything
is going to work.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.160
Turns out it doesn't
work that way.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.480
There's absolutely no way that
what you're designing for your

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.280
family in September is going to
be relevant to the problems

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.440
you're going to be
facing in April.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.400
You need to be able to
change in real time.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.310
One of my favorite lines of
parenting comes from my friend

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.490
Justin, who had four children
in six years.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.430
And he said, with children,
everything is a phase, even

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.700
the good parts.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.830
Our lives are moving.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.210
Our kids are adapting
all the time.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.930
Just when they stop teething,
they start having tantrums.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.120
Just when they stop needing our
help taking a bath, they

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.760
need our help dealing
with online bullies.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.620
We are constantly being
forced to change.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.810
And the reality is, we're
always playing defense.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.670
We're always reacting
to the situation.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.230
We're not really playing
offense.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.680
Ellen Galinsky of the Families
and Work Institute asked 1,000

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.670
children, if you could be
granted one wish about your

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.370
parents, what would it be?

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.740
The parents all guessed the
children would say, spending

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.540
more time with them.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.890
They were wrong.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.020
The children's number one wish
was that their parents be less

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.580
tired and less stressed.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.110
The reality is, we're out
of control, and our

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.550
children are onto us.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.900
It's no wonder that Salvador
Minuchin, the great family

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.550
theorist from Harvard, said that
the family's number one

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.170
challenge is to be adaptable.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.780
So has anyone figured
out how to do that?

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.140
At 7:00 on a Sunday evening,
in Hidden Springs, Idaho,

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.330
population 2,535, the six
members of the Star family

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.880
were sitting down to the
highlight of their week, the

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.110
family meeting.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.230
The Stars are a typical American
family, with their

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.190
share of typical American
family problems.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.210
David is a software engineer.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.410
His wife, Eleanor, takes
care of their six

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.300
children, ages 10 to 15.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.260
One of those kids has
Asperger's syndrome.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.250
One ADHD.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.270
One tutors math on the
far side of town.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.000
One practices lacrosse
on the near side.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.230
We were living in complete
chaos, Eleanor said.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.020
I was trying that whole love
them and everything will work

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.340
out philosophy, but
it wasn't working.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.700
For the love of God, I finally
said, I can't take it anymore.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.210
What the Stars did next,
though, was surprising.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.340
Instead of turning to friends
or relatives, they turned to

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.370
David's workplace.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.530
And they turned to a radical
idea that at the time, was

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:14.760
just moving from automotive
manufacturers in Japan to

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.705
start ups in Silicon Valley.

00:12:16.705 --> 00:12:20.430
And that idea was agile
development.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.980
So since I'm sitting here
at Google, let's just

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.800
see a show of hands.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.990
How many people here have heard
of agile development?

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.960
Almost full attendant.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.180
I have to say, I've been asking
that question in talks

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.990
around the country, and I
usually get two or three hands

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.080
in whatever size room it is.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.350
So let's talk about agile, OK?

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.570
And why it applies to something
as apparently

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.450
radically different
as families.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.305
So the core idea--

00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:46.430
I don't have to tell you-- but
the core idea of agile is that

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.030
companies were following what
was called the waterfall

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:53.440
model, which is executives
were issuing orders that

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.360
harried programmers were
following down below.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.140
And by the time it got to those
programmers and they

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:03.490
came back with a project, it was
over budget, out of date,

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.300
and irrelevant.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.100
83% of projects failed.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.100
So the core idea of agile, of
course, is that you divide

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.850
people into small teams,
and you do things in

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.330
small chunks of time.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.470
So instead of saying go off and
design me a search engine

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.515
or a cell phone, and come back
in two years, you say, design

00:13:20.515 --> 00:13:22.705
me an element, come back,
and let's adapt.

00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:23.740
Let's adjust.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.220
Let's succeed or fail
in real time.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.170
Let's constantly be changing.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.390
What David Star said was when
he first brought these ideas

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.870
into his family, including
especially, the idea of a

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.940
weekly meeting to review the
progress, he said it lowered

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.550
stress, increased communication,
and made

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.560
everybody much happier to be
part of the family team.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.380
When my wife and I brought these
ideas into our family,

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.820
including these family meetings,
it was the most

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.230
significant change we made into
our lives since the birth

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.710
of our children five
years earlier.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.210
And these meetings did
all this while

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.250
lasting under 20 minutes.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.510
So let's break this down a
little bit, and talk about why

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.110
it is that families
can benefit from

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.170
this kind of an idea.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.030
So one of the principles of
agile, of course, is public

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.310
accountability.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.590
We're all part of a team.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.740
Everybody needs to know what
everybody else is doing.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.380
That's why they have these
information radiators--

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.430
these large boards where
everybody's chronicling

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.690
everybody else's tasks.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.530
So in the Stars, they adapted
this by creating a morning

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.870
checklist with a list of
obligations that each of the

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.060
children was expected
to tick off.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.980
So in the morning that I was
in Idaho, Eleanor came

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.030
downstairs about 6:30, made
herself a cup of coffee, and

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.840
sat down in a reclining chair,
and she sat there and casually

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.060
chatted with each of her
children as one after the

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.870
other came downstairs, checked
the list, made themselves

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.130
breakfast, checked the list
again, put the dishes in the

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.460
dishwasher, re-checked the list,
fed the pets or whatever

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.600
was their task for the day,
checked the list again,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.130
gathered their belongings, and
headed to the bus stop.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.350
It was the single most
amazing family

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.560
dynamic I had ever seen.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.060
And when I strenuously objected,
this would never

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.710
work in my house, that our girls
needed too much nagging

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.040
and too much prodding and too
much parental yelling, Eleanor

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.710
said, that's what I thought.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.740
I said to David, keep your
work out of my kitchen.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.292
But I was wrong.

00:15:21.292 --> 00:15:24.190
So when I turned to David, why
does this have an impact?

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.430
He said, you can't underestimate
the power of

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.900
doing this.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.130
And he made a check mark.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.230
He said, in the workplace,
adults love it, and with kids,

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.060
it's heaven.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.290
The week we introduced a morning
checklist into our

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:42.540
house, it cut parental
screaming in half.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.080
But the biggest change
came when we

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.590
instituted this family meeting.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.290
So we now hold a weekly
family meeting.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.410
We do it every Sunday night.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.720
It takes 15 to 20 minutes, and
we ask three questions based

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.470
on the agile family model.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.020
Number one, what worked well
in our family this week?

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.660
Number two, what didn't
work well?

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.720
And number three, what
will we agree to work

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.750
on in the week ahead?

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.620
Everybody throws out ideas, then
we vote on two that we're

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.511
going to focus on.

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:12.770
And instantly, the most amazing
thing started coming

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.270
out of our daughters' mouths.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.460
What worked well this week?

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.850
Making our bed, or clearing
the table.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.690
What didn't work well?

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.950
Our math sheets, or greeting
visitors at the door.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.940
Now, those of you who are
parents here among us--

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.840
I don't know about you,
but our children are

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.690
like Bermuda triangles.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.080
Words and ideas go in, but
they never come out.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.240
Like, their inner lives are
a complete mystery to us.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.560
And what this idea has brought
into our lives is we now have

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.050
access to what our children
are thinking and feeling.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.770
And it got extremely interesting
when we said, what

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.520
will we agree to work on
in the week ahead?

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.910
Because here is the key plank
to the entire idea.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:58.050
We let our children, with adult
supervision, pick their

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.790
own rewards and punishments.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.670
In the workplace, it functions,
and with kids, it's

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.010
absolutely magical and
absolutely transformative to

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.440
the family dynamic.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.589
So we say, OK, what are we going
to work on this week?

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.260
And give me the reward
and the punishment.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.440
So one of my daughters will
say, OK, if we greet five

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.730
visitors at the door, we get
10 extra minutes of reading

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.829
before bed.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:25.660
If we kick somebody, we lose
desserts for a month.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.290
Now, by the way, anybody who's
not done this says the kids

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.120
will be incredibly lax
in their punishments.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.910
Anybody who's done
it knows the kids

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.610
are incredibly strict.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.870
Our daughters are like
little Stalins.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.740
We're constantly having
to dial them back.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.380
Now, mind you, there is a gap
between what they say in these

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.100
meetings and their behavior
the rest of the week.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.090
It's not like all the
problems go away.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.050
But the truth is, for us, it
doesn't really bother us,

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.320
because we feel like we are
laying these underground

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.750
cables that aren't going to
fully light up their worlds

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.290
for many years to come.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.050
We started these meetings when
our daughters were five.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.400
Three years later, we are
still doing them.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.580
My wife counts them as among
her most treasured

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.590
moments as a mom.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.010
So what have we learned?

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.000
The first thing we've
learned is that you

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.390
have to make change.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.810
You have to adjust
in real time.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.400
What is incredibly effective
about the system is we don't

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.300
have to fight every battle the
minute that it erupts.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.730
So if we're trying to get the
broccoli down on Tuesday

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.820
night, or if you're having to
discuss a curfew on Thursday

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.110
night, you don't have to have
every battle in the moment, in

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:35.190
the absolute chaotic stress
of that situation.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.130
You know at the end of every
week there is going to be this

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.610
moment where you're going to
have a time where everyone's

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.770
going to sit down calmly, at
the same level, and have a

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.070
conversation about how the
family is functioning.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.340
So the first thing we've learned
is to be mindful about

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.530
how we function as a family, and
set aside a small amount

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.340
of time every week where
we talk about it.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.730
The second idea that we've
learned, as I mentioned

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.790
before, is that you have to
empower your children.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.710
I can push my kids around.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.970
I can elbow them into doing
something that I want.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.180
I can tell them the same thing
over and over again.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.460
It's easier, and by
the way, we're

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.330
usually right as parents.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.780
But as parents all discover,
it doesn't actually work.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.990
And the latest brain research
is showing that children who

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:25.076
set their own schedules, make
their own work plans, evaluate

00:19:25.076 --> 00:19:27.590
their own progress,
they're actually--

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.350
from FMRI studies, we know
this-- they are building up

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.030
their prefrontal cortex, and
getting the skills they are

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.540
going to need later in life.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.240
The point is, by having children
take agency over

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.730
themselves, you are helping
build the set of skills that

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.800
they're going to need to
function later in life.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.130
Let me just give an example
of how this works.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.650
So this week in our family,
we're working on overreacting.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.420
I'm sure none of you has that
problem, but we have that

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.780
problem in our house.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.800
OK, so we all agree we're going
to work on overreacting.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.530
So we say to the kids, OK,
give me some rewards and

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:03.150
punishments.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.890
One of my daughters says, OK,
how about we get five minutes

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.140
of overreacting this week, and
if we have fewer than five

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.630
minutes, we get to have
a sleepover at

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.140
the end of the week.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.530
And if we have more than 15
minutes of overreacting, then

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:21.850
we'll do one push up for
every minute over 15.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.800
Well, first of all, I never
would have picked a sleepover,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.650
and I certainly wouldn't have
picked push ups as the

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.370
punishment.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.470
But now I know this is going
to motivate them.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:31.180
I'm learning.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.850
I'm hearing back from them.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.280
But when my other daughter
hears this about the five

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.770
minutes of overreacting, she
said, is that one five minute

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.980
overreaction, or 10 30
second overreactions?

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.880
And as far as I'm concerned,
this exchange is already a

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.520
success, because it's that math
that she's doing in our

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.940
head that's exactly the math
that I want her to do.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.060
Now, by the way, we did some
push ups that week.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.030
But as I said, that's not really
the headline from this

00:20:59.030 --> 00:20:59.500
experience.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.940
The headline is the actual
thought process of working.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:07.220
In fact, a couple days later,
I was going out to do

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.060
something, and they were
playing a card game.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.290
And sure enough, some conflict
erupted over the card game,

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.450
and one of my daughters started
overreacting, and

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:15.350
started screaming.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.270
And her sister goes,
overreacting, overreacting,

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:18.960
and starts counting.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.790
One, two, three, four.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.680
And within 10 seconds, it
stopped, and it was a

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.910
certified family miracle.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.520
The point is, whenever
possible,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.650
empower your children.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.500
Bring them into the conversation
about what it

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.370
means to be part of
your family unit.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.940
And the last thing we learned is
that parents don't have all

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.940
the answers.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.720
If that is not enough of an idea
for you, let's go even

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720
one step further.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.280
In this meeting, we actually
allow our daughters to

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.220
criticize their parents.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.260
We actually let them let off
steam that they have, in a

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.380
sense, giving them stature
in the family.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.030
This is not that the kids
run the asylum.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.340
This is an ecosystem designed
by the parents.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.780
There's still homework, and
manners and bedtime and all

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.270
these things that we insist, but
we are bringing them into

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.050
the process.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.520
And as we know, there is scores
of studies, years of

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.850
research, that shows the most
effective teams are not

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.150
designed by charismatic
leaders.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.970
Nothing is top down anymore.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.490
Business is not top down,
religion is not top down,

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.330
government is not top down.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.540
We cannot send our children into
a world where everything

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.860
that they've learned at home has
been the parents have all

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.600
the authority.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.540
We have to prepare them
for the world

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.630
they're going to enter.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.960
And I have to say,
they love it.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.815
Just the other week, we were
having a family meeting, and

00:22:40.815 --> 00:22:44.250
we said, what didn't work well
in our family this week?

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.530
And my girl said, Dad
yelled a lot.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.660
In fact, they said they were
playing a game on the iPad

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.400
where they could record songs,
and they have a recording of

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.080
Dad yelling, so they have
proof that Dad yelled.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.135
My wife thought this was the
greatest thing ever, and she

00:22:58.135 --> 00:22:59.610
was like, yeah, high
five, high five.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:00.540
You nailed Dad!

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.060
You got Dad yelling!

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.080
And then they turned to her, and
they said, yeah Mom, and

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.445
we recorded you cursing.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.920
We live in a world where
the best ideas can

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.460
come from any place.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.120
That's the idea that works
in this office.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.410
This is an idea that parents
can learn a lot from.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.450
So the first big theme that I
learned is adapt all the time.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.900
The second big theme
that I learned--

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.640
I want to talk a little bit
about it right now--

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.960
is talk a lot.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.860
High functioning families keep
a conversation going.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.260
And it's not just difficult
conversations.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.160
In fact, there's a chapter
in "The Secrets of Happy

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.080
Families" about how to talk
about sex, how to talk about

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.020
money, how to talk about aging
parents, how to fight smarter.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.620
A lot of new ideas.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.470
But the specific thing I want
to talk here about is that

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.690
high functioning families talk
a lot about what it means to

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:58.530
be part of your family.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.610
I spoke to Jim Collins, the
author of Good to Great, the

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.380
defining management
book of the last

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.950
decade, as you all know.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.000
And Jim said to me that
well run human

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.580
organizations of any kind--

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.060
could be companies, could be
countries, is also families--

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.770
do two things in common.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:19.570
They preserve the core, and
they stimulate progress.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.800
The stimulating progress is what
we've just been talking

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.600
about-- coming up with a system
to manage the change so

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.490
it doesn't manage you.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.330
But what about preserving
the core?

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.800
Jim said that families can learn
a lot from another idea

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.250
that organizations do, which is
define their core identity.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.370
And he coached us through this
process of creating a family

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.890
mission statement, modeled on
the mission statement that

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.610
many companies and
organizations do.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.450
Now, when I first heard this
idea, I thought it was cold

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.880
and corny, and had completely
no appeal.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.490
But then someone asked me a
question that caught me up

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.440
short, and the question
was this--

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.080
can your children actually
identify what values are most

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.796
important to you?

00:25:00.796 --> 00:25:03.540
And I thought, I'd like to think
that they could, but the

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.570
truth is, I haven't really
articulated it to them.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.250
They'd have to guess
it or divine it.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.870
So Jim coached us through this
process, as I said, of

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.020
creating a family mission
statement.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.830
So we have a family equivalent
of a corporate retreat.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.020
We had a pajama party.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.880
We all piled into our bed.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.110
I made popcorn, although
actually, I burned one batch.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.450
I had to make a second batch.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.860
And we had the most amazing
conversation.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.480
First of all, I took a list of
80 values, which I have here

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.760
in the book for those of you
who want to do it, which I

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.240
took from management manuals,
from education books, from

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.490
happiness books.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.480
And we went through what's
really important to us.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.080
Honesty is the best policy.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.120
I say that all the time, but
really, a core value?

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.300
Is that going to be one of the
things that's most central to

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.310
who we are?

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.040
So we said, what do we like
most about our family?

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.170
Kids, when you're leaving, what
do you miss most about

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:52.090
being with our family?

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.780
When you have friends over to
our house, what is it that you

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.210
most like them to see
about our family?

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.780
And we ended up with this
a list of 10 statements.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.780
We like to travel.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:02.340
We're travelers.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.420
So one of them is, we're
travelers, not tourists.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.900
One of them is a line that my
wife uses all the time--

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.790
we don't like dilemmas,
we like solutions.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.570
One of them is, we help
others to fly.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.970
A key finding of the happiness
research is, if you want to

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.020
improve yourself, you have
to articulate your

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.720
best possible self.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.940
What this is, in effect,
is articulating our

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.610
best possible selves.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.550
What is the family
we want to be?

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.460
And we've now hung it in a
prominent place in our home.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.740
And we saw benefits
right away.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.680
A few weeks later, we got
a call from the school.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.040
One of my daughters had gotten
into a spat with a classmate.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.780
And back to my idea that parents
don't have all the

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.150
answers, we didn't
know what to do.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.090
We hadn't had this experience
before.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.530
So we called my daughter into
my office, and my wife was

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.750
kind of grasping for straws,
to be honest.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.820
And the flip chart that we
had-- and we made this.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.120
It was still up on my wall.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.540
And my wife said, anything
up there seem to apply?

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.860
And my daughter looked,
and she said, we

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:00.695
bring people together?

00:27:00.695 --> 00:27:05.246
And boom, suddenly, we had a
way into the conversation.

00:27:05.246 --> 00:27:08.470
So create a family mission
statement.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.920
But talking about what it means
to be your family also

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.050
can go one step further, and it
can happen at other times

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.600
of the day.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.790
And in order to talk about a few
of these ideas, I need to

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.320
address the pink elephant
in the room, and

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.800
that is family dinner.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.660
All parents have been told that
having family dinner is

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.110
good for your children.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.600
And the truth is, there's lots
of research to back this up,

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.050
and if you can have family
dinner with your

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.820
kids, that's fantastic.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.900
But here's the problem.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.470
It doesn't work In most
of our lives.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.660
My wife doesn't even come home
from work until 6:30.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.960
Americans rank 33 out of 35
countries in a UN study about

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.490
who eats family meals
together.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.330
But dig deeper into the
research, and the news is

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:51.420
actually quite revealing and
fascinating for parents.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.600
Nothing has been more studied
in the family space than

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.140
family dinner.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.530
Tens of thousands have been
studied, and taped, and

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.900
logged, and every you know,
um, and like has been

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.670
chronicled.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.910
And it turns out there's only
10 minutes of meaningful

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.650
conversation in any
family dinner.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.160
The rest is taken up with take
your elbows off the table and

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.900
pass the ketchup.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.640
And the research shows you can
take that 10 minutes and move

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.930
it to any time of the day, and
have the same benefit.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.790
So if you can have family
dinner, great.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.950
But if you can't, have
family breakfast.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.010
Meet for a bedtime
snack at 8:30.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.650
Even one meal on the weekends
has the same benefit.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:28.960
Because here's the point.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.840
The point is, what you're
talking about, the family

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.050
part, matters much more
than the dinner part.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.320
But what should you actually
be talking about in those

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.960
exchanges, whenever
you have them?

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.590
Could be at night, could be on
a, walk could be in a carpool.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:48.010
We collected about two dozen
different ideas for family

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.990
conversations, and we tested
them all in our house with

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.590
friends, and relatives, and
people of different

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:54.360
generations.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.940
And I put 10 in my book
that worked the

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.950
best, from my research.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.990
I call them the Hunger Games.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.840
And I want to mention just three
of them here tonight--

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.400
things you can do in a family
conversation that will serve

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.040
everybody in the family.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.110
Idea number one, word a day.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.370
Kids in 1st to 12th grade
have to learn

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.530
3,000 new words a year.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:22.030
You can help by teaching your
kids one new word a day.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.380
When you talk to babies,
naturally, as you know, we

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.610
elevate our voices and we do
this thing called baby talk,

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.640
and the research shows that
actually helps children with

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.600
phonics and understanding how
to read and how to speak.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.810
But the truth is, when they get
older, you want to stop

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.550
using baby talk, and talk
more like yourself.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.750
So you want to teach them new
words, and one way we learned

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.340
about that my wife loved was
we bring a newspaper.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.200
You guys know what that is?

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.920
It comes in paper, and
there are stories.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.470
We bring newspapers and
magazines-- by the way,

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.880
catalogs are fantastic.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.970
A J.Crew catalog has enough
color names that are new to be

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.830
word a day for two months.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.650
So what happened was,
interesting story.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.160
So my wife would bring these
to the table, and we would

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:07.420
begin this conversation about
new words that we didn't think

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.130
that they would know.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.360
And by the way, I'm a big
advocate-- in fact, I wrote an

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.940
article in the York Times-- it
is OK to Google at dinner.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.750
Even if you have a rule that
you put your devices away,

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:20.580
which is great for kids, it is
OK if you're actually Googling

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.420
to learn new knowledge.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.590
And I'm well on the
record about this.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.435
So it's OK to Google
at dinner.

00:30:26.435 --> 00:30:27.710
AUDIENCE: Googling--
what's that?

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.590
BRUCE FEILER: Yeah.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.010
I call your attention to
the logo behind me.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:36.100
Googling is what you do when
you're on your surfboard, and

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.580
you want to know what the
jet stream is going to

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.970
be doing that day.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.390
But here's what happened, OK?

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.770
So we were teaching our kids new
words a day, and it turned

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.910
out they know all these words
from school-- the slang and

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.810
these words that they use with
their students, and suddenly,

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.240
they wanted to teach
a new word to us.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.860
So suddenly, by complete
happenstance, we had stumbled

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.160
into this great conversation
topic, where ideas

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.140
we're going both ways.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.560
One new word a day.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.790
Idea number two.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.810
Autobiography night.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.670
Beginning at age five, kids
learn to narrate a story about

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.500
their lives, but they have to
actually practice this skill.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.790
And the research shows that
parents who ask more elaborate

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:16.000
questions, is the academic term
for it-- who what when,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.130
where, how, and why--

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.680
will help their children
learn this skill.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.830
Asian American researchers in
Boston looked at American moms

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.340
and Asian moms.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.230
Sure enough, the American moms
asked more elaborate

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.710
questions, had their children
telling more stories about

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.730
their lives.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:34.670
The Asian moms were talking more
about the schedule, and

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.340
the discipline, and the hard
work of the family.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.030
These Asian American researchers
went back three

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.010
years later.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.820
The American children had a
higher sense of self esteem

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.870
and identity, and the Asian
children knew more about the

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.970
schedule, and the work,
and the discipline--

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.160
what is valued in
these cultures.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.880
Don't think this makes
a difference?

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.800
Researchers have shown that
children who tell a simple

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.260
story about themselves--

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.010
about a past success
in their lives--

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.960
if they do this the night
before, or the morning of a

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.160
big test in school, or an
athletic competition, their

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.410
performance will rise.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.930
So if they remind themselves
that they got through a

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.170
difficult task in the past, it
will give them confidence to

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.930
get through the difficult task
in front of them on that day.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.260
And the last idea I want to
talk about is my single

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.730
favorite idea from "The Secrets
of Happy Families,"

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.050
and the idea is this--

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:30.790
talk about your family
history.

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.610
Researchers at Emory
gave children a

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.813
simple do you know test.

00:32:34.813 --> 00:32:37.500
Do you know where your
grandparents were born?

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.410
Do you know where your parents
went to high school?

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.090
Do you know an aunt or an uncle
who had an illness or

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:45.150
something difficult that
they overcame?

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.730
The children who scored highest
on this test, which

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.580
means who knew more about their
family history, had a

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.720
higher sense of self confidence,
and a greater

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.430
belief that they could control
their own lives.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:01.700
It was the single biggest
predictor of a child's

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.100
emotional health
and happiness.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.020
As the lead researcher explained
to me, these

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.280
children understand that they're
part of something

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.630
larger than themselves--

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:14.530
an inter-generational
self, he called it.

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.490
There are three types of
family narratives.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.140
There's an ascending
family narrative.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.380
We had nothing, we worked
hard, we have it all.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.710
There's a descending
family narrative.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:27.060
We have a lot, there was a
storm, a recession, a war, we

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.180
lost everything.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.970
Now we have less.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:32.090
There's an oscillating
family narrative.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.270
We worked hard.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.370
We had some success.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.740
Your father opened a business.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.370
Your mother was on the board.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.600
But then your uncle
lost his job.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.290
Well, we all rallied as a
family, and we got through it.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:45.000
Then you had an aunt
who had cancer.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.960
Children who understand they're
part of an oscillating

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.670
family narrative have a greater
believe that they can

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.230
get through their own
difficult times.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.860
And that really is the headline
from this study, and

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.170
in a way, from this whole
idea of talking

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.380
about your family history.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.630
You want to spend time talking
about your family's positive

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.620
moments, but even more
important, talk about the

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.130
family's negative moments, and
how you overcame and rallied

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.909
through them, so when children
hit their own hurdles, they'll

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.699
believe that that's just part of
life, and they can get over

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.380
their hurdles.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.010
As I said, when I set out on
this project, I was determined

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:24.190
not to cram everything into a
list of two or three or five

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.790
secrets that all happy families
have in common.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.730
And in fact, I don't think
such a list exists.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.420
What works for your family is
different from your family, is

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.440
different from my family.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.780
But the number one thing I've
learned is how important our

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.320
family is to our overall
identity.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.510
I grew up in a time, as many
of you here, where we were

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:47.570
told that the individual
is the most

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.139
important thing in society.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:53.090
But everything that we've
learned, and particularly what

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.510
has come out of the world of the
internet, has told us that

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.040
actually, naturally, we are
inclined to be in groups, to

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.260
be in networks, to
be on teams.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:07.360
No team, no group, no network is
more important to you than

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.770
your family, and there are
things you can do to improve

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.880
that family.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.600
And what I've found, as I said,
is that there are three

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.290
large things that
high functioning

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.260
families have in common.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.950
Number one, they adapt
all the time.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.190
As I've been saying over and
over again, you need to be

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.970
able to change what you're
doing depending on the

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:29.950
circumstance.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.390
There's an idea that I don't
have to tell you that those in

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.340
the internet world know, which
is, if you're doing the same

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.380
thing on the Internet that you
were doing six months ago,

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.980
you're doing the wrong thing.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.270
Families can learn
a lot from that.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.870
The second idea is talk a lot.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.120
Not just difficult
conversations, but talk about

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.450
what it means to be part
of your group.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.680
And the last big point, which
I haven't really touched on

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.350
today, but I do want to
throw it out here,

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.750
is go out and play.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.530
It sounds incredibly simple,
and yet it's

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.210
the one that we forget.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.720
The research is very clear.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.370
All families have conflict.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:04.260
If you can limit and control
that conflict, you can spend

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.060
more time building the
positive memories.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.390
Parents should spend less time
worrying about what they do

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.760
wrong, and more time focusing
on what they do right.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.350
So whatever it is you enjoy
doing as a family--

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.220
it could be surfing, it could
be cooking, it could be

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.280
hiking, it could be doing
jigsaw puzzles--

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.670
find some family members, find
some time, make memories.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.840
I was a teenager when I first
read "Anna Karenina," and I

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.430
encountered what may be the
most famous line in world

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.740
literature.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.810
All happy families are alike.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:39.460
Each unhappy family is unhappy
in its own way.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.510
And when I first read it, I
thought it was idiotic.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.590
Of course all happy families
are not alike.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.880
There's big ones, there's small
ones, there's loud ones,

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.080
there's quiet ones.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.280
But working on this project,
I have changed my mind.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.550
Today, for the first time, we
have comprehensive knowledge

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:58.150
about what it is that makes
families function.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:02.210
We know there are critical
skills that families can have

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.440
to be able to work through
problems, bounce back from

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.860
setbacks, make positive
experiences, and run their

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:13.250
family life less chaotically,
more successfully.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.780
Is it possible, all these
years later, to

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.610
say Tolstoy was right?

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.460
The answer, I believe, is yes.

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:24.280
When Leo Tolstoy was five years
old, his brother Nikolai

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.940
came to him and said he had
discovered the secret to

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.200
universal happiness, and he had
engraved it on a little

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.320
green stick which he
had buried in the

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.030
family's ravine in Russia.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.910
And if the stick was
ever found, all

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.000
humankind would be happy.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.530
You can actually see the note
that Tolstoy wrote, because he

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.820
became obsessed with this stick,
but he never found it.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.970
And late in his life, he wrote
a note, which you can type

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:53.220
into Google and find, which
says, he wants to be buried in

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.990
that ravine.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.290
He still lies there today,
covered in a

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.290
layer of green grass.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:02.560
And that story, to me, captures
maybe the final

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.340
lesson that I learned.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.482
Happiness is not something
we find.

00:38:06.482 --> 00:38:09.110
It's something we make.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.720
Almost anybody who's looked at
great organizations has come

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.500
to pretty much the
same conclusion.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.710
Greatness is not a matter
of circumstance,

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:20.002
it's a matter of choice.

00:38:20.002 --> 00:38:21.830
You don't need a grand plan.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:22.960
You don't need a big scheme.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.510
You need to take small steps,
accumulate small wins, keep

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.670
reaching for that green stick.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.980
And that, in the end, may be
the greatest lesson of all.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.740
What's the secret to
a happy family?

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.990
Try.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.710
Thank you very much.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:48.250
So we have about 15
minutes left.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.780
I tried to leave ample time
for you to ask questions.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.190
I know some of you may have to
scoot back to work, but who

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.804
would like to get us started?

00:38:55.804 --> 00:38:57.030
AUDIENCE: I'll volunteer.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.520
BRUCE FEILER: Great.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.860
AUDIENCE: What you say
makes a lot of

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.910
sense, practically speaking.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.310
You have twins.

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:06.410
At some point, they reach an
age where they can start

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.910
participating in the process.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:10.560
Obviously, six months
old is too early.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.460
Eight years old is too late.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.810
Wherever works for them.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:17.070
What do you do in families
where you have, say, a

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.700
five-year-old and
a two year old?

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.930
BRUCE FEILER: Well,
two questions.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:24.040
Let me answer that question.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.820
There's two sides to this
question, which is, when is

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.170
old enough, and when
is too old?

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.045
Because both questions will
inevitably come up.

00:39:33.045 --> 00:39:39.030
The Stars, who had been doing
a lot of these agile ideas

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.670
first, and a lot of families I
look at, start, if you have

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.570
two or three or sometimes four
children, five children,

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:45.610
whatever it may be--

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:49.600
if there is a range, maybe
sometimes the older children

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.720
may be ready for it, but the
younger children may not.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.610
In the morning checklist, I
know families that have

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.720
younger children often will
start with an ideogram,

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.370
because the children
can't read.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.290
And I've been talking to
a lot of families--

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.010
this family meeting
idea is really--

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.180
a lot of people been writing
me since the book has been

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.990
out, and I will pause to mention
that it's number five

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.000
on "The New York Times"
bestseller list this week, so

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.410
people have been reading it
and reaching out to me.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.620
And they've been saying, well,
the meeting hasn't been

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.310
working, or it has
been working.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:20.490
I think part of the messaging
here is, this

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:21.340
is part of our family.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.720
We're going to have these
meetings, and they may not

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.250
always work.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:27.170
It took us a long time to
get the hang of them.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:30.130
And what we did wrong at the
beginning was, we were talking

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.280
about what about what went well
in your life, or what did

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.370
not go well in your life?

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.820
And that's irrelevant
to the meeting.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.730
We actually played games
like this at dinner--

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:39.970
bad and good.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.120
Everyone goes around and says
what they did bad today, and

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.100
everyone goes around and says
what they did good.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.620
Some people call this roses and
thorns, some people call

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.620
it highs and lows.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.240
The Obamas call it
highs and lows.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.065
They play it in the
White House.

00:40:52.065 --> 00:40:53.060
But that's irrelevant.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.630
We're talking about how
we work as a family.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.620
So I think you can start it
whenever the oldest child is

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.700
ready to do it, and if the other
one's running around,

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.390
they're still going to learn
that this is important.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.550
And my guess is, as we know,
with kids of different ages,

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.800
the younger children tend
to be tugged along.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.370
The younger children usually--

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:14.530
not always, but usually-- walk
faster, speak faster, because

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.380
they're trying to catch
up with the behavior

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.230
of the older children.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.120
Let's now talk about the other
side which also comes up,

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.360
which is what about teenagers?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.410
We know from the research, and
we know from life experience,

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.410
that kids between 12 and 16
spend half as much time with

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.030
their parents, and twice as much
time with their peers.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.990
So we know that they
already have one

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.800
foot out of the family.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.110
And David Star, for example,
very clearly said to me he

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:41.410
feels that a lot of this agile
methodology actually works

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:43.810
better with older children,
because at that point, they're

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:45.710
taking more responsibility.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:48.040
But the question is, how do
you get them to the table?

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.490
With younger kids, one
of the things we do--

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.365
we play a quick game.

00:41:51.365 --> 00:41:53.730
We play a game called Ma at the
beginning of our meeting,

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.340
where we go, Ma, Ma, Ma, and
everyone takes a turn, and

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.190
then we stop.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:58.130
Welcome to the family meeting.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.770
Ma.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.500
We do that at the beginning
and the end, to

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.670
kind of have a marker.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.040
And we also-- and by the way,
this works with kids in their

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:05.890
single digits--

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.810
we put allowance at the end of
the family meeting, because

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.530
that incentivizes the kids
to stick around.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.520
But with older kids, here's
what's going to happen.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.270
They're going to say, I don't
want a family meeting.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:16.070
I'm too old.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.410
I'm above it all.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.170
But they're going to come to you
at one point and say, can

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.370
I stay out past my curfew
at Johnny's house?

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.300
Or, can I go to the movie with
Susie, which I didn't tell you

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.710
about in advance?

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.600
And the parent at that point
says, sorry, I'm

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.420
walking out the door.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.550
Or I'm flossing my teeth right
now, and we're not going to

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:34.340
talk about this.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.080
If you want to do this,
you've got to come

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:36.800
to the family meeting.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.360
Because we're a system, and
once you make a change, it

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.790
affects everybody.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.100
And that's the large
point here.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.430
I mentioned the flossing
teeth, because

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:44.320
it's been on my mind.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.620
Because recently, my wife came
into my office at 11:00 at

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.940
night, and I'm answering email,
and she's flossing her

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.150
teeth, right?

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.430
Things are flying everywhere.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:55.340
And she says, so, did
you deposit the

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.710
money in the bank account?

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.060
Because we have to pay down
the mortgage this month.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.590
And my response was,
wait a minute.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.160
There's a whole chapter
in my book about

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.150
talking about money.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:04.760
And I said, remember
what we've learned?

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.090
We're not going to have these
conversations at 11:00 at

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:08.450
night when you're flossing
your teeth and

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:09.240
I'm doing my email.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.240
We're going to have a regular
time where we're going to sit

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.440
down and talk about money.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.320
And that's the message
with older kids.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.460
Sorry, we're not to change
the system in midstream.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.780
We're going to come up with a
special time where we're going

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.180
to sit and talk about how
we work as a family.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:24.490
Thank you.

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.848
Who would like to go next?

00:43:25.848 --> 00:43:27.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.930
I'm an only child, and I have
one child, and I don't plan on

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:30.740
having more.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:37.070
So one thing that I want to
avoid in raising my child is I

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:42.470
was very much a focus to my
parents, and it kind of cause

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:44.510
a little bit of resentment,
because I felt like I could

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.860
never let them down, and I
didn't have anybody to

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.520
commiserate with.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.710
So in your research, did you
see any differences in

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.480
families with only children
versus multiple children?

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:03.690
BRUCE FEILER: Well, the short
answer is, this wasn't a big

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.810
topic of mine.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.380
But the longer answer is no.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:12.670
That what I chose to do was not
look at the makeup of the

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:15.000
family, but actually look
at the problems

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.720
that families face.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.930
So rather than breaking families
into single families,

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:24.630
adoptive families, blended
families, I broke the family

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.020
down into things
that we all do.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:30.090
We love, we play, we fight, we
have difficult conversations,

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.010
we teach our kids about
sex and money.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.490
And each of my chapters is
about a different thing.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:39.470
Because basically, three big
changes have gone on in the

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:42.380
family in the last generation.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.170
Change number one is that
there's been a change in what

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:46.910
it means to be a family.

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.390
We have so many different
kinds of families.

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:51.510
I just mentioned adopted,
blended, gay, straight, we

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.090
have nuclear families that live
in separate houses, we

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.680
have divorced families that
nest in the same house.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.240
So the definition of the family
has changed, but the

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.020
things that we struggle
with have not.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.060
But there are also two other
changes I want to mention.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.100
One is that women have come
flooding into the workplace,

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.215
which is discussed, actually,
quite a lot, as we all know.

00:45:10.215 --> 00:45:12.250
And as we know, going
on right now.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:13.970
But there's this other change
that's actually less

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:16.520
discussed, which is that dads
have come flooding into the

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.890
parenting space, and fathers
are much more involved now

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:20.920
than they ever were.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:27.020
But I think in particular what
that has done is erase the

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.510
church state divide
that once existed

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.090
between work and family.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:31.240
And technology--

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.400
I'm here at a technology firm--
makes a big difference.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.900
We now know that busy parents
can check in with their

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.000
children during the day at
sports practice, or their

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.150
homework in the afternoon.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:46.850
We also know that technology
allows workers to check in

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.350
with their colleagues
in what was once

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.380
family time in the evening.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.670
So I think one of the reasons
that a lot of the ideas I've

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:58.040
been talking about here are
so alive and well in the

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.750
parenting world today is because
this new generation of

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:05.770
parents has less time, wants
smarter proven ideas that

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:08.250
work, and they're less
interested in this divide--

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:11.180
the old days when my dad would
come home at 5:30, and he and

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.180
my mom would sit down and have a
drink and have their private

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.590
time, and then we would have
family dinner at 6:00.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:18.610
There are still families that
do that, but that is a very

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.150
profound minority now.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:23.730
Most people are living with
technology coming at them all

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:29.510
times of the day, and they have
to find this family time.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:35.240
And so my hunch is that the
challenge you faced as an only

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:39.540
child, where there was so
much intensity between

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.590
you and your parents--

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:44.410
if that's the biggest problem
you have with your children,

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.380
that's a blessing, because most
parents have the opposite

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.650
problem, which is not enough
intensity, and not enough time

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:50.860
to spend with their children.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.530
So my guess is that that's not
going to be as much of a

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.690
problem for your child as you
may have felt growing up.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.980
AUDIENCE: I have 11 and 13 year
old boys, and I have a

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.460
father who's rather sick in Palm
Springs two hours away.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.880
He's in his 70s.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.720
Do you talk at all in your book
about how to manage that

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.240
balance of how to parse
out the little time I

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.270
have with my family?

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:14.610
BRUCE FEILER: In some ways, this
whole book is an answer

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.030
to that question, because
I, too, have

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.250
aging and ailing parents.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:19.570
I live in Brooklyn.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.030
My parents live in Georgia.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:26.250
My father has Parkinson's, and
can't travel as much, so

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.680
getting to Georgia
is a conflict.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.690
We do it two or three times a
year, but it's still hard.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:33.320
My in-laws live in Boston, and
my mother in law just spent

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.200
the last year fighting cancer.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.860
So we definitely felt squeezed
between aging parents and

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:40.940
rising children.

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.300
And it is a large theme of this
book of how to work on

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.100
that balance.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.210
One of my favorite chapters, and
I'm glad I get to mention

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:50.170
this, because there's a Google
reference in it, is called

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.400
Talk About the Marshmallow.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.420
And it's about how to have
difficult conversation among

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:59.620
adult siblings dealing with
challenges, a lot of them

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.840
having to do with managing
parents.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:07.430
And there is a tremendous amount
of knowledge out there.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.640
There's a whole chapter
in my book about

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.630
how to fight smarter.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.690
I went and took a three day
course from the folks at the

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:16.190
Harvard Negotiation Project
on how to make peace in my

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:19.570
family, both between warring
siblings, and between my wife

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:23.970
and I, who were having a fight
at 7:42 every night, and we

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:27.350
were talking about who's
dropping off the dry cleaning,

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.030
who's booking the tickets
for Thanksgiving, who's

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.930
picking up the milk.

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:33.230
We kept getting into a fight,
and I wanted to know how to

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:34.110
solve that.

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:35.850
And we learned a
bunch of ideas.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.010
And one of the ideas I learned
is that the highest stress

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:39.910
time in families is between
6:00 and 8:00.

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:43.270
So we learned that 7:42 is the
worst time of day to have this

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:45.510
conversation, and we no
longer do it there.

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:47.250
And there's a bunch of ideas
about where to sit, how to

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.650
sit, how to make that
conversation work better.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:51.640
But I want to talk about
particularly this challenge of

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.500
how to-- do you have siblings?

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.500
AUDIENCE: A brother, but he's
not allowed to help.

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.290
BRUCE FEILER: Well, he's
not allowed to help.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.990
OK, so fine.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.855
And my guess is, is
he farther away?

00:49:00.855 --> 00:49:03.050
AUDIENCE: He's a long-haul
trucker, so he's--

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.860
BRUCE FEILER: Oh,
he's a long--

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:04.080
OK.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.960
So this is the challenge
that we find.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.060
My brother's in Atlanta.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.260
He's close to my parents.

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.530
We're farther away.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:13.670
How do you get people involved
if they are far away?

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:18.610
And one of the first things I've
learned is, opposite of

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:21.370
what you think is-- too few
cooks spoil the broth.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.100
So if you're making a difficult
decision, do you

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.450
have to put your parents
in a nursing home?

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:29.200
Is it time to ask a relative
to stop driving?

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.960
Do you need to confront an
adult sibling who may be

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.530
having a substance
abuse problem?

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:37.590
The first lesson is, too few
cooks spoil the broth.

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.350
So you want as many people in
the conversation, even if they

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:42.030
say, I'm a long haul trucker.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:43.620
I don't have time to join
this conversation.

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.880
Actually, your advice
is very valuable.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.440
We were deciding whether
my mom should buy

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.950
long term care insurance.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.120
I said, we want to a family
meeting on the phone to

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:52.940
discuss it.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.630
My sister said, I don't know
anything about insurance.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:56.330
My brother said, I'm too
busy with other things.

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.010
I said, we want everybody
there, even if you're

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.660
impatient, even if you know
nothing, because the research

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.750
clearly shows groups make
better decisions than

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:03.860
individuals.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:07.520
Next, if you are having one of
these difficult conversations,

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.040
vote first and speak later.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.170
Again, the research shows,
get everyone's

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.270
opinion on the table.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.710
The group will make
a better decision.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.970
If not, the person who speaks
loudest and first will

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:19.930
influence everybody else, even
if they don't know what

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.110
they're talking about.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:25.710
We're going to talk about is it
time to put granddad in a

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:26.500
nursing home?

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.530
Everybody is going to say
whether they should or not at

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:31.170
the beginning, then you're
going to talk about it.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:32.820
Then the conversation
will go better.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:36.212
And here's my favorite tip,
which may not apply if you

00:50:36.212 --> 00:50:37.540
just have a brother, but
I think it will.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.230
I was actually talking to an
executive at Google at dinner,

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:41.770
and I said, what's going
on in your work?

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:44.190
And he actually worked
up in Mountain View.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:50.580
And I said, what's going on in
your office that can help me?

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.170
And he said, in our office in
Google-- and for all I know,

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:57.180
it's happening down here-- we
try to have at least two women

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:57.890
in every meeting.

00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.540
And I said, well, why is that?

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.450
And he pointed me to this study
from Carnegie Mellon--

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:02.850
it's actually in my book--

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:06.340
that they looked at do groups
make better decisions than

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:06.930
individuals?

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.350
Answer yes.

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:09.960
What is one of the factors?

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:13.070
If there's only one woman in
the group, the woman will

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:14.770
defer to the man.

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:17.050
If there's more than one woman
in the group, the group will

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:20.510
reach consensus more quickly
and be more collaborative.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.700
This has been shown in
workplaces, it's been shown on

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.230
corporate boards, it's been
shown on three judge panels at

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:27.560
the appellate level.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.610
If you have more than one woman
in the group, the group

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:31.060
will make a better decision.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.580
So if you are making a difficult
decision about your

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:37.010
parents, then if you have
siblings, get them in.

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:39.060
If you have aunts and uncles,
even if you have a friend--

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.400
get as many people in
the conversation.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.300
The group will make
a better decision.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.550
And then the last thing--

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:53.920
I want to reiterate
two points.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.960
Point number one is, you want
to make sure that you're

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.440
having positive experiences
that are

00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.460
outweighing the negative.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.930
You want to bring your children
in contact with their

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:03.780
grandparents.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.390
Have them do a task together.

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:07.580
If you want to reduce tension
among warring siblings or

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.000
among people of different
generations, give them a task

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:10.630
to do together.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.620
It will remind them they
can cooperate.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.310
Do that before a dinner or a
long car ride, and the group

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:16.260
will get along better.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.880
So you want to enlist your
children into contact with

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.310
their grandparents to make
sure there are positive

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:26.310
memories that will help you
during all the slog where

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:29.010
you're doing all the back
and forth driving.

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:31.130
And then the last thing I would
say is, you want to be

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:33.650
open about the difficulty
with your kids.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:36.880
You don't want to pretend that
you're a super mom who has all

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.410
the answers and can
do it by yourself.

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:42.100
One of the games that I
recommend in one of these

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:42.710
conversations--

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.230
could be a dinner
or a car ride--

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:47.310
is a game called Pain Points,
where everybody, parents and

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:49.210
children alike, goes around
and says what they're

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:50.390
struggling with.

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:53.060
And if you tell your children,
I'm struggling, because I

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:57.280
would like to go to your soccer
game, but grandma has

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.070
an important eye doctor's
appointment, and I don't know

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:00.970
what to do.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:04.050
And if you bring your children
into that process of trying to

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:06.880
solve the tensions in your
family, you'll relieve the

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.940
stress on yourself, you'll
give them the skills, and

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:14.230
suddenly what becomes a
difficult experience becomes a

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.490
bonding experience.

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:18.050
And time and again, that is
what I've learned in this

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:20.010
process, which is,
it's difficult.

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:21.700
Our lives are chaotic.

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.260
They're out of control.

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.000
But you can, to use the phrase
of the day, you can lean into

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.770
those moments.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.700
You can enlist people to help.

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.240
You can talk about this.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.740
We're in a hard moment
right now.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.900
We need everybody to rally.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:41.900
I spend an hour last night
with a lawyer friend in

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.645
Beverly Hills last night who had
an 18-year-old child who

00:53:44.645 --> 00:53:46.900
had herpes encephalitis.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:50.300
And it was so severe, and she
spent so much time in the ICU,

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:52.370
that they actually had to take
off her skull and put it in

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:56.430
her body to let the brain
swelling relax.

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:58.450
She's one of the one in
a million who had a

00:53:58.450 --> 00:53:59.810
recovery from this.

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:01.670
And when I was saying to this
dad, what did you learn from

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:02.770
this experience?

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:07.450
He said, my 15-year-old,
in the lead up to this

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:12.500
experience, was yelling at his
older sister, I hope you die.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.670
That's how much there
was tension.

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:17.540
And he said, when we got into
this situation, my wife's way

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:18.920
of responding to it
was to sleep every

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.090
night in the hospital.

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.480
My way was to go to the hospital
and bring my work,

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.030
and bury myself in my work as
we waited for this recovery.

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:28.110
But my 15-year-old, he's
a young person.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:29.230
He got on the internet.

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:30.390
He started searching.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:34.030
He's the one who wanted
all this information.

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:38.540
And having that rupture in the
normal family life allowed

00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:40.180
everyone to realize
how dependent

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.630
they are on one another.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.750
In a lot of ways, what I'm
talking about here is, can you

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:47.010
make that rupture?

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:49.420
Can you break that routine, even
without going through a

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.270
horrible situation like that?

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:53.760
And the answer, I
believe, is yes.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.270
You can take small steps.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:57.020
You can accumulate small wins.

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.690
You can make the
family happier.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.760
You can make everybody in
the family happier.

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.010
Thank you very much.
