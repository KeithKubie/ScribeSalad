00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.710
to tell you if there's a famous picture
of some of us hillary clinton and me the

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720
of some of us hillary clinton and me the
 

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.250

grass Owen the governor standing there
at the podium I had my hands behind me

00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119
at the podium I had my hands behind me
 

00:47:40.119 --> 00:47:41.790
at the podium I had my hands behind me
with my fingers crossed that it was

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:41.800
with my fingers crossed that it was
 

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.620
with my fingers crossed that it was
going to work when we hit the button to

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:43.630
going to work when we hit the button to
 

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.740
going to work when we hit the button to
start the markets which we did you know

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:46.750
start the markets which we did you know
 

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:49.530
start the markets which we did you know
but it was it was a marvel of

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:49.540
but it was it was a marvel of
 

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.900
but it was it was a marvel of
information technology that let us

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:51.910
information technology that let us
 

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:54.990
information technology that let us
demonstrate that whether our buildings

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000
demonstrate that whether our buildings
 

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.359
demonstrate that whether our buildings
have been knocked down our spirit wasn't

00:47:57.359 --> 00:47:57.369
have been knocked down our spirit wasn't
 

00:47:57.369 --> 00:48:01.380
have been knocked down our spirit wasn't
stopped it was really an important

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:01.390
stopped it was really an important
 

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:07.670
stopped it was really an important
moment and then we set out to figure out

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680
moment and then we set out to figure out
 

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.920
moment and then we set out to figure out
where the money flows are in the world

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:10.930
where the money flows are in the world
 

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.650
where the money flows are in the world
that are supporting these evil things

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:13.660
that are supporting these evil things
 

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.910
that are supporting these evil things
and in the time that I was there until

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920
and in the time that I was there until
 

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.490
and in the time that I was there until
the end of till the end of november in

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:20.500
the end of till the end of november in
 

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.839
the end of till the end of november in
2002 we were able to confiscate and a

00:48:24.839 --> 00:48:24.849
2002 we were able to confiscate and a
 

00:48:24.849 --> 00:48:27.930
2002 we were able to confiscate and a
four hundred million dollars worth of

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:27.940
four hundred million dollars worth of
 

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.900
four hundred million dollars worth of
money that we were only able to identify

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:30.910
money that we were only able to identify
 

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.390
money that we were only able to identify
and secure because of information

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400
and secure because of information
 

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.900
and secure because of information
technology without it we had no hope

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:36.910
technology without it we had no hope
 

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:39.030
technology without it we had no hope
there was no way we could have

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040
there was no way we could have
 

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.880
there was no way we could have
interdicted the money that terrorists

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:41.890
interdicted the money that terrorists
 

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.870
interdicted the money that terrorists
were using to attack civilization yeah

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880
were using to attack civilization yeah
 

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.930
were using to attack civilization yeah
so it's made

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:46.940
so it's made
 

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.150
so it's made
you don't find it a happy example but it

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160
you don't find it a happy example but it
 

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.490
you don't find it a happy example but it
is really an important of an example of

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:51.500
is really an important of an example of
 

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.339
is really an important of an example of
the combination of public policy and the

the combination of public policy and the
 

00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:56.319
the combination of public policy and the
needs of public policy and bringing with

it information technology to change the
 

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:02.170
it information technology to change the
world in a very positive way then I want

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:02.180
world in a very positive way then I want
 

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.579
world in a very positive way then I want
to make a case that information

to make a case that information
 

00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:05.859
to make a case that information

kept saying you know I don't think we
 

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.980
kept saying you know I don't think we
should have another tax cut because I

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:16.990
should have another tax cut because I
 

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:19.599
should have another tax cut because I
think there's a threat we could have

00:49:19.599 --> 00:49:19.609
think there's a threat we could have
 

00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:22.300

know and we need to do something about
 

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.890
know and we need to do something about
the ten thousand page tax code that

election season this incremental tax cut
will produce half of one percent

not worth it now I tell you all that

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:13.220
not worth it now I tell you all that
 

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.430
not worth it now I tell you all that
because this is the case of Public
