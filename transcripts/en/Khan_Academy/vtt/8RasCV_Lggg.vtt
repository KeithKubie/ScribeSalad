00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.365
Let's say that I have the complex number z

00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:05.581
and in rectangular form we can write it

00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:12.348
as negative three plus two i.

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:14.837
So first let's think about where this is

00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:16.532
on the complex plane.

00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:26.324
So, this is our imaginary axis
and that is our real axis.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.551
And let's see, the real
part is negative three,

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:35.726
so we could go one, two, three
to the left of the origin.

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:37.432
Let me space that out a
little bit more evenly.

00:00:37.432 --> 00:00:42.416
So one, two, three to
the left of the origin.

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:44.283
So negative three.

00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:45.778
And then we have two i's.

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:48.007
We're going to go up two.

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.880
So up two in the imaginary direction.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.713
So one, two just like that.

00:00:53.713 --> 00:00:57.434
So z is real part negative three,

00:00:57.434 --> 00:00:59.920
imaginary part two.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.864
z would be right over
here in the complex plane.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:08.424
So that is z right over there.

00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:11.048
Now what I want to think
about are other ways

00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:14.777
to essentially specify the location of z.

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:16.384
And in particular,

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:19.112
instead of giving the
real and imaginary parts,

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.481
essentially the coordinates here,

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.976
let's think about giving a direction

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:24.816
and a distance to get to z.

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:26.825
So for example we could give

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:29.033
the distance from the origin to z,

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:35.537
so let's call this distance r,

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:38.480
but that distance by itself
isn't enough to say where z is.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.539
You have to say in what
direction do you have

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.209
to go a distance of r to get to z.

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.643
and so to specify the direction,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.406
we will have this angle,
theta, in radians,

00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:54.422
this angle between the positive real axis

00:01:54.422 --> 00:01:57.245
and this line right over here,

00:01:57.245 --> 00:02:02.190
this line or the segment that
connects the origin and z.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.086
So if someone gave you this
angle and this distance,

00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:07.478
then you could get to z.

00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:09.605
Now what I want you to do right now

00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:13.885
is pause this video and see
if you can find a relationship

00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:17.477
between r theta and
negative three and two.

00:02:17.477 --> 00:02:20.894
In fact, given this complex
number in rectangular form,

00:02:20.894 --> 00:02:25.062
can you figure out what r and theta are?

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:28.989
Well let's think through
this a little bit,

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.974
and to help us let's remind ourselves

00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:33.981
of the unit circle
definition of trig functions

00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.765
because we are going to
use some trig functions

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:38.814
to relate r, theta, and
two, and negative three.

00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:41.567
So I'm going to construct
a unit circle here.

00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:45.253
So construct a unit circle.

00:02:45.253 --> 00:02:47.061
So this right here's a unit circle,

00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:48.653
a circle of radius one.

00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:52.110
So construct a unit circle.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.222
That's a unit circle.

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:57.860
So by definition what are the horizontal

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.693
and vertical coordinates of
this point right over here

00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:05.677
where this line intersects
the unit circle?

00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:08.669
Well, this is forming an angle of theta

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.262
with a positive real axis

00:03:10.262 --> 00:03:13.373
and so the horizontal coordinate over here

00:03:13.373 --> 00:03:18.013
by definition is going
to be cosine of theta.

00:03:18.013 --> 00:03:20.118
Cosine of theta.

00:03:20.118 --> 00:03:22.109
That's the unit circle
definition of cosine of theta,

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.262
and the vertical coordinate
is going to be sine of theta.

00:03:26.262 --> 00:03:27.997
Sine of theta.

00:03:27.997 --> 00:03:32.853
And so what would the horizontal

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:34.773
and vertical coordinates of this point be?

00:03:34.773 --> 00:03:36.694
We obviously know they're
negative three and two,

00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:38.070
but what would they be in terms

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.189
of cosine theta and sine theta?

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.444
Well look, this point right over here

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:45.973
is a radius of one away from the origin.

00:03:45.973 --> 00:03:50.886
So this distance right over here is one,

00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:53.733
but now we are r away from the origin.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.781
We're r times as far.

00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:58.213
So if we're r times as
far in that direction,

00:03:58.213 --> 00:03:59.631
then we're going to be r times as far

00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:01.501
in the vertical direction and r times

00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:03.205
as far in the horizontal direction.

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:06.981
We're going to scale everything by r.

00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:12.510
So the horizontal coordinate
of this point right here

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.942
instead of being cosine of theta

00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:16.413
is going to be r times cosine of theta.

00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:18.254
So this point right over here,

00:04:18.254 --> 00:04:19.406
which we know is negative three,

00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:22.461
is going to be equal to r cosine of theta,

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:24.686
and by the same logic,
this point over here,

00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:25.878
the vertical coordinate,

00:04:25.878 --> 00:04:29.894
we're going to scale up sine
theta by r, we're r times as far.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.392
So this point right over here is going

00:04:31.392 --> 00:04:33.660
to be r sine theta and we already know

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.922
that that's equal to two.

00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:38.562
r sine theta.

00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:42.771
So given that, can we now
figure out what r and theta are?

00:04:42.771 --> 00:04:48.618
So let's first think about
figuring out what theta is.

00:04:48.618 --> 00:04:55.683
So to do that, let's think about
some of our trig functions.

00:04:55.683 --> 00:04:57.777
So one trig function that involves

00:04:57.777 --> 00:05:02.186
sine theta and cosine
theta is tangent theta.

00:05:02.186 --> 00:05:05.041
So for example we could say tangent theta,

00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:10.497
tangent of our angle, tangent of theta,

00:05:10.497 --> 00:05:20.238
is equal to sine of theta
over cosine of theta.

00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:23.000
We could also multiply the numerator

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.192
and denominator here by r.

00:05:24.192 --> 00:05:26.401
That won't change the value.

00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:30.328
So that's the same thing as r
sine theta over r cosine theta

00:05:30.328 --> 00:05:33.432
and we know r sine theta
is going to be equal to two

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:37.584
and we know that r cosine
theta is negative three.

00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:41.736
So this whole thing is
going to be negative 2/3.

00:05:41.736 --> 00:05:44.440
Another way of thinking
about it is the tangent

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.809
of theta is going to be the same thing

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:53.791
as the slope of this line right over here.

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:55.696
And what is the slope of that line?

00:05:55.696 --> 00:05:57.743
Well if you start at z and
you want to go to the origin

00:05:57.743 --> 00:06:02.521
you're going to go positive
three in the x direction

00:06:02.521 --> 00:06:05.493
and then you're going to go negative two,

00:06:05.493 --> 00:06:07.942
or I should say positive three
in the horizontal direction,

00:06:07.942 --> 00:06:10.695
and then you go negative two
in the vertical direction.

00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:11.957
So the slope is your change

00:06:11.957 --> 00:06:13.766
in vertical over change in horizontal.

00:06:13.766 --> 00:06:17.766
It's negative two over three.

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:20.282
But now we can use this
to solve for theta.

00:06:20.282 --> 00:06:21.985
To solve for theta, we just
take the inverse tangent

00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:25.514
of both sides and we get theta is equal to

00:06:25.514 --> 00:06:29.635
inverse tangent of negative 2/3,

00:06:29.635 --> 00:06:32.274
of this thing right over here.

00:06:32.274 --> 00:06:36.273
So we copy and paste that and we can get

00:06:36.273 --> 00:06:38.370
our calculator out to figure
out what this actually is.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.674
So let's turn it on.

00:06:40.674 --> 00:06:43.490
Let me make sure that I am in radian mode.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.353
I am.

00:06:44.353 --> 00:06:46.618
and so I can take the inverse tangent

00:06:46.618 --> 00:06:50.545
of negative two divided by three,

00:06:50.545 --> 00:06:56.715
which gets us negative point
five eight eight zero zero,

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:57.689
on and on and on.

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:59.497
So if we round to the nearest
hundredth of a radian,

00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:02.810
it would be negative point five nine.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:10.122
So this is approximately
negative zero point five nine.

00:07:10.122 --> 00:07:12.026
Now is this the right angle?

00:07:12.026 --> 00:07:15.849
Is this the theta that we are looking for?

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.026
Well this theta, negative
zero point five nine,

00:07:19.026 --> 00:07:21.681
that's going to get us over here.

00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:23.794
That's this angle right over here.

00:07:23.794 --> 00:07:27.946
That's what the inverse tangent gave us,

00:07:27.946 --> 00:07:30.865
and it makes sense because this ray is

00:07:30.865 --> 00:07:33.017
a continuation of this
ray right over here.

00:07:33.017 --> 00:07:34.626
Together they would form a line.

00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:35.954
It has the same slope.

00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:38.001
But that's not the theta
that we are looking for.

00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:39.866
The theta that we are looking for

00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:41.706
is going in the opposite direction.

00:07:41.706 --> 00:07:44.217
It's half way around the circle.

00:07:44.217 --> 00:07:46.265
So if we think in terms of radians,

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:51.777
it's going to be this
angle plus pi radians.

00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:56.096
So the theta that we're looking for isn't

00:07:56.096 --> 00:07:58.429
going to be what our
calculator gives us for this.

00:07:58.429 --> 00:08:01.853
It's going to be this value plus pi.

00:08:01.853 --> 00:08:03.948
So theta, the theta that we care about,

00:08:03.948 --> 00:08:10.261
is going to be negative zero
point five nine, roughly, plus pi.

00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:11.605
I'm going to say approximately just

00:08:11.605 --> 00:08:13.413
because I have rounded right over here.

00:08:13.413 --> 00:08:16.021
So let's get the calculator out.

00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:18.981
So let's take our previous response,

00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:21.389
and that's just the previous answer,

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:26.029
plus pi because we're going to
go in the opposite direction.

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:30.037
So that gives us roughly
two point five five radians.

00:08:30.037 --> 00:08:35.101
So this is approximately
two point five five radians

00:08:35.101 --> 00:08:38.493
is our claim for what theta is.

00:08:38.493 --> 00:08:39.724
Now does that make sense,

00:08:39.724 --> 00:08:45.709
that this angle is two
point five five radians?

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:49.220
Well, this angle if we go straight up,

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.396
that's pi over two radians,

00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:52.797
and pi is three point one four,

00:08:52.797 --> 00:08:57.525
so that's going to be
one point five seven,

00:08:57.525 --> 00:08:59.613
something like that,

00:08:59.613 --> 00:09:01.469
and this is pi radians,

00:09:01.469 --> 00:09:04.396
so that's three point
one four one five nine,

00:09:04.396 --> 00:09:05.708
keep going on and on and on.

00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:08.493
So two point five nine is
indeed in the right quadrant.

00:09:08.493 --> 00:09:09.732
So that is right.

00:09:09.732 --> 00:09:13.125
This is going to be an angle
of two point five five radians.

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:16.565
Now we just have to figure
out the length, what r is.

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:18.900
And that we can just use
the Pythagorean theorem for.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:24.121
We can set up a right triangle.

00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:29.451
We know that this distance
right over here is two

00:09:29.451 --> 00:09:32.060
because this distance
right over here is two,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:37.084
and we know that this distance is,

00:09:37.084 --> 00:09:38.123
the coordinate here is negative three,

00:09:38.123 --> 00:09:39.952
but the distance here is just three.

00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:42.147
So we know from the Pythagorean theorem

00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:47.621
that r squared is equal to two squared

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:54.311
plus three squared or that r is

00:09:54.311 --> 00:09:59.255
equal to the square root of
four plus nine, which is 13.

00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:00.527
And so there we have it.

00:10:00.527 --> 00:10:02.584
We have negative three,

00:10:02.584 --> 00:10:05.369
so we know r is equal
to the square root of 13

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:07.608
and theta is two point five five radians.

00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:09.051
So using that information,

00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:14.101
we can now rewrite z in
terms of r and and our theta.

00:10:14.175 --> 00:10:17.904
So now we can say that z is equal to,

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:21.652
instead of negative 3, we can
write it as r cosine theta,

00:10:22.217 --> 00:10:24.122
so we can write it as the square root

00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:33.363
of thirteen times the cosine of theta,

00:10:33.363 --> 00:10:36.747
which is, we're saying theta
is roughly two point five five

00:10:36.747 --> 00:10:44.251
if we round to the nearest
hundredth, plus two,

00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:45.972
we already know is r sine of theta

00:10:45.972 --> 00:10:49.339
is the square root of thirteen,

00:10:49.339 --> 00:10:55.986
and then sine of theta,
two point five five,

00:10:55.986 --> 00:11:00.034
and then all of this is going

00:11:00.172 --> 00:11:01.800
to be multiplied times i,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.208
and if we like to
simplify it a little bit,

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:08.239
or kind of really make
clear what the r is here,

00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:09.565
we could factor it out.

00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:14.327
So we could say that z is
equal to the square root

00:11:14.327 --> 00:11:19.678
of 13 times cosine of two point five five,

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:22.230
and once again two point five
five is an approximation,

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.566
so maybe I should say
approximately equal to,

00:11:25.566 --> 00:11:35.587
cosine of two point five five plus

00:11:35.633 --> 00:11:41.287
i times sine of two point five five.

00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:44.159
And so when I rewrote z in
this format right over here,

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:46.840
it makes it much clearer what

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.511
the direction I have to go in is,

00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:51.287
the direction is two
point five five radians

00:11:51.287 --> 00:11:53.944
counterclockwise from
the positive real axis.

00:11:53.944 --> 00:11:55.864
It also says how far I need to go,

00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:58.359
I need to go square root of 13.

00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:00.721
This essentially makes the polar,

00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:05.184
it makes it clearer how we
get there in kind of a more,

00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:06.887
I guess you could say, polar mindset,

00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:09.647
and that's why this form
of the complex number,

00:12:09.647 --> 00:12:12.071
writing it this way is
called rectangular form,

00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:15.538
while writing it this
way is called polar form.
