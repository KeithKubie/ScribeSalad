[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:07.050
ANA: Welcome, everybody.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.730
We are super excited to
have Barry Friedman here

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.620
to talk about his latest
book, Unwarranted, Policing

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.240
Without Permission.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.462
Barry is a professor at the New
York University School of Law.

00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:24.890
And he's spent the last 30
years writing and teaching

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.638
and litigating about issues
of constitutional law

00:00:28.638 --> 00:00:30.790
and criminal procedure.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.480
He is also the author of the
book The Will of the People.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.520
And his writing has
appeared in New York

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.070
Times and Slate and Republic.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.252
Also joining us
is Deborah Jones--

00:00:41.252 --> 00:00:42.210
DEBORAH JACOBS: Jacobs.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.710
ANA: Jacobs.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.860
I'm so sorry, Jacobs--

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.570
who is the director of the
office of law enforcement

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.250
oversight here in King County.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.880
She's got a long career
working in executive leadership

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.280
positions at the ACLU,
specializing in policing

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.409
procedures and practices.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:02.700
BARRY FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Ana.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.270
Thank you all for coming.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.170
I'm very, very happy to be here.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.250
It's my first trip to Seattle,
and certainly to this campus.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.907
So I'm going to start by telling
some stories about policing.

00:01:16.907 --> 00:01:18.490
I could actually
start with the Dallas

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.100
shooting of Jordan Edwards,
which is kind of a tragedy.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.280
Because I tell so many stories
about policing having gone off

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.330
the rails, I also always
stop at this point,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.580
and say that I
spend a lot of time

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.254
now working with
policing agencies,

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:33.670
and with policing
officials trying

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.530
to fix some of the things
that have gone off the rails.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.488
And there are a lot of
great people in policing

00:01:37.488 --> 00:01:38.800
who want to get it right.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.440
And it's important for us all
to be there in a helpful mode

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.310
to get that to happen.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.100
So I'm going to tell
you some stories.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.890
And I have a question for you,
because I'm a law professor.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.432
And the question is, I want you
to think about these stories.

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:52.098
I want you to think
about these stories.

00:01:52.098 --> 00:01:52.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.155
[LAUGHS] That was subtle.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:55.280
I want you to think about--

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.020
I want you think
about these stories

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.603
and, try to think about, if you
can, what they have in common.

00:02:01.603 --> 00:02:03.850
They're going to seem very,
very different to you.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.120
So this is Freddy Martinez.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.960
Freddy was physics trained.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.840
He's works in the tech
industry in Chicago.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.890
He's an activist.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.290
This is a stingray.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.772
I'm just curious, being here,
who knows what a stingray is?

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.980
Everybody knows what a
stingray-- or a lot of people.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.896
So I'm going to tell the
few people who don't.

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:23.720
We'll clue them in.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.610
So a stingray is a
cell tracking device.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.160
The police use it to figure
out where a cell phone is,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.410
or what cell phones
are in the area.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.880
It has some incredibly
important uses for policing.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.730
If you think about a kidnapping,
for example, and you've

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.200
a cell phone number, and
you want to figure out

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.340
where the person is--

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.230
very helpful.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.240
It also, however,
can be used to record

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.640
the phone numbers of
everybody that's at a protest.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.490
And that was Freddy's
interest, which was--

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.670
were the Chicago police
collecting at Black Lives,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.370
for example, protests,
the cell phones of people?

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.550
And he was trying to think about
a way to engineer something

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.470
to defeat the stingrays.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.420
And then somebody said
to him, why don't you

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.520
just file a Freedom of
Information Act request?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.920
So he filed a Freedom of
Information Act request,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.040
and he was stonewalled
for a very long time.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.420
And so he hired--

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.440
or, he joined up with
this man, Matt Topic,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.050
who is a lawyer in
Chicago who litigates

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.580
Freedom of Information request.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.170
In fact, Matt was involved
in the release of the Laquan

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.169
McDonald video in Chicago.

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.210
And what they learned was
that the Chicago police

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.960
had, for many years,
been using stingrays.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.820
And when they try to
dig deeper, and ask

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.340
a lot of questions about--
did you have court authority?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.194
Had you vetted the
legality of this?

00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:31.610
What were you doing
with the data?

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.810
Were you storing the data?

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.916
They got stonewalled again.

00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:36.290
The city of Chicago
hired a firm,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.415
and quickly spent a couple
hundred thousand dollars

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:40.107
on not answering any
of their questions.

00:03:40.107 --> 00:03:41.690
But while that was
happening, and they

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.310
were getting kind
of non-responses,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.390
people started to notice
around the country

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.290
that the same non-responses,
almost in identical language,

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.710
were appearing from police
departments in California

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.965
and in Georgia.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.340
And eventually, people piece
together what was happening,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.040
which is that the FBI
had gotten stingrays

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.800
into the hands of local
law enforcement agencies

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.360
with non-disclosure
agreements that

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.870
said that no matter what, they
couldn't reveal what technology

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.650
was being used.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.780
So for years, law
enforcement agencies

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.210
had not been getting court
orders, or lying to judges

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.446
and getting court orders.

00:04:12.446 --> 00:04:13.820
There was even a
clause that said

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.528
that if you were in
the middle of a trial

00:04:15.528 --> 00:04:17.779
and you were about to say
what the technology was,

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.760
that you had to-- the prosecutor
had to dismiss the case.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.680
And there are instances
where that happened.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.830
And so that's one example of law
enforcement use of technology.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.512
And we'll be back to that.

00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:27.720
But here's a different story.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.330
So this is Tamir Rice.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.400
Tamir Rice, as I
think all of you know,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.770
was playing with a toy gun
in a park in Cleveland,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.020
and somebody called the
police and said that there was

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.760
a male with a gun in the park.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.790
The police responded.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.580
Dispatch never relayed
the information

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.480
that it might have
been a candidate,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.010
it might have been a toy gun.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.340
They came flying into
the park in a squad car--

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.330
a patrol car.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.226
They stopped within
just feet of Tamir Rice.

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:52.100
And within seconds, an
officer had jumped out

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.340
and shot him twice, left
him on the ground bleeding.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.111
They didn't have any
emergency care equipment it.

00:04:57.111 --> 00:04:58.860
Took several minutes
for EMS to get there.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.030
And as you all know, he died.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.010
This is Charles and Etta Carter.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.790
So Charles and Etta Carter
lived outside of Philadelphia.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.530
Very humble jobs for many years.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.860
They had one kid who got her
PhD in developmental psychology,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.392
super proud of her.

00:05:14.392 --> 00:05:16.850
She gets a new job in Florida
working in the school system.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.340
She gets married, they buy a
new house, everything's new.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.050
So they do what good
parents do, they

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.780
loaded up a van full of stuff
that the couple might need,

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.310
and they went down to Florida.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.044
And they stayed for
a couple of months,

00:05:27.044 --> 00:05:28.460
and then when they
were done, they

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.900
turned around and came back.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.240
And on a really,
really hot July day,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.005
they were stopped by the
Maryland State Patrol.

00:05:35.005 --> 00:05:36.380
And all the Maryland
State Patrol

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.180
ever said was that
Charles had been

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.910
driving wobbly, or weaving.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.430
They took them out of the car.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.380
They put them up on an
embankment out of the van.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.390
They started to take
everything out of the van.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.420
They tore open bags
of laundry detergent,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.430
breakfast cereal,
wedding invitations

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.870
from her daughter's wedding.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.810
They tossed the wedding
dress out into the back.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.480
Fortunately it had been wrapped
up and wasn't destroyed.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.770
Took out lawn chairs,
took apart a refrigerator.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.550
And all the while,
the Carters sat out

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.590
on this embankment in the heat.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.730
They called a drug dog in.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.730
The drug dog urinated
around their belongings.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.246
And eventually, on
several occasions,

00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:14.870
Etta Carter, who had
a bladder problem,

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.453
asked if she could use a Porta
Potti that they had in the van.

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:18.710
And the police said no.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.810
They threatened to cuff
her if she got up again.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.110
And so, on a day that
was her 40th anniversary,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.060
she was forced to
sit on an embankment,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.690
and urinated all over herself
while the officers looked

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.760
through her belongings.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.850
They eventually let them
go with just a warning.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.242
Never an apology of any sort.

00:06:37.242 --> 00:06:39.200
They went to a rest stop
so she could clean up.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.330
They went back to their
home in Philadelphia.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.630
They had several sleepless
nights, didn't know what to do.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.700
Eventually went to the
AAA looking for help.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.750
The AAA sent them to
the ACLU of Maryland,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.000
and there was a lawsuit filed.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.970
It was eventually settled.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.406
But the truly
remarkable thing was

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:56.030
that throughout the
entire litigation--

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.650
I'd read through
all the depositions,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.910
nobody in the
Maryland State Patrol

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.368
ever thought that
anything had gone

00:07:00.368 --> 00:07:05.330
wrong, that anything had ever
happened outside of procedure.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.750
This is a slide just to
tell a story of a fellow who

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.800
was an Iraqi war vet who wakes
up in his apartment complex

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.200
in the suburbs here
in the United States.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.900
And because he'd been
on many raids himself,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.540
knew exactly what was happening
when he woke up to gun barrels

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.650
in his face.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.010
He just had no idea why
any of it was happening.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.864
It turned out that his
apartment was being--

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.030
undergoing some maintenance.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.640
And so the department
development

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.970
had moved him into a
different department.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.460
Some of the neighbors wondered
who was in that apartment.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.043
They called the
police, and the police

00:07:36.043 --> 00:07:37.572
responded with a SWAT raid.

00:07:37.572 --> 00:07:39.530
He went down to the police
station the next day

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.830
and said, investigate,
call the apartment complex,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.170
ask security who was
in that apartment.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.992
And they said, we
don't investigate.

00:07:47.992 --> 00:07:50.325
It kind of gets in the way
of our apprehending suspects.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.115
This is just-- there are--

00:07:55.115 --> 00:07:56.609
you're driving
under the influence,

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.150
cops want to give
you a breathalyzer.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.108
But if it's drugs, the
breathalyzer won't work,

00:08:00.108 --> 00:08:02.710
so it's become-- in fact, it's
becoming increasingly common.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.620
I now get calls about this all
the time for-- particularly

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.680
in the Midwest, for police to
take folks to the hospital,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.800
and have them forcibly
catheterized to get a urine

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.730
sample.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.730
And including a case
where a fellow who

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.040
refused to sit still
for the catheter

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.220
was strapped to a gurney so that
they could insert the catheter.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.609
And then just a quick reminder
that the NSA, as we all

00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:25.900
learned from Edward Snowden,
was gathering the metadata

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.230
from all of our
telephone communications,

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.250
and also some of our
internet connections.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.929
So the question I have that
I ask folks all the time is,

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.820
what do all these
seemingly different stories

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.720
have in common?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.807
And we don't tend to think
of them as the same story

00:08:40.807 --> 00:08:41.890
here in the United States.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.740
We think about racial profiling,
we think about militarization,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.520
we think about technology,
we think about use of force.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.480
But my argument in the
book and in the work

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.480
I do with the policing
project that I've started

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.620
is that all of these stories
are united by a governance

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.380
failure, which requires
me to teach you

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.390
all of a minute of
constitutional law.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.060
So when we think
about government

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.560
in the United States,
we think about

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.100
democratic accountability.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.270
And I divide that up into
front end and back end

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.102
accountability.

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:13.060
And we know all about
front end accountability.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.185
It's what you think of when
you think of democracy.

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:17.440
It's the idea that
we have rules,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.200
that we put the rules in place
before officials act so we

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.617
know what they're going to do.

00:09:21.617 --> 00:09:22.450
They're transparent.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.920
We know what the rules are.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.370
Indeed, we have a voice
in what those rules are.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.704
There's always some
form of public input.

00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:31.120
We try when we can to make
sure that the benefits outweigh

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.290
the costs.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.210
Now we have back end
accountability, too,

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.505
which is to say, what
keeps that system running

00:09:37.505 --> 00:09:39.880
and keeps it honest is that
we have courts that make sure

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.694
that everything that's supposed
to happen up front happens.

00:09:42.694 --> 00:09:44.110
But it's the up
front part that we

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.050
think of as democratic
accountability,

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.630
but not in policing.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.310
In policing, for bizarre
historical reasons,

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.529
we have almost no front
end accountability.

00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:55.570
And all of our accountability
is on the back end.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.150
It's things like inspectors
general, and civilian review

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.360
boards, and
court-appointed monitors,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.772
and body cameras-- the sort
of stuff Deborah deals with,

00:10:03.772 --> 00:10:05.230
and she'll talk a
little bit about.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.040
Even body cameras, if you
stop and think about them,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.290
are back end accountability.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.947
All the stuff on the
back end is designed

00:10:10.947 --> 00:10:13.030
to kick in when something
bad has happened to say,

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.863
can we figure out, was
somebody responsible?

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:16.120
Did something go wrong?

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.680
Is somebody to blame?

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.300
But what we don't
do around policing,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.357
and this is the key thing that
I think has gone wrong is,

00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:24.190
we don't involve the
public on the front end

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.920
to say, how do we
want to be policed?

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.260
What should the rules be
by which we're policed?

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.810
Should we all know what those
rules are, and have input

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.650
into them?

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.080
And the interesting
thing is, when

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.450
we do have that input
here in the United States,

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.890
when something
happens to cause us

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.280
to have that input for people
to get annoyed and speak up,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.410
policy changes,
policing changes.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.580
So I'm sure you
recognize this picture.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.400
It's one of the
images from Ferguson.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.280
After Ferguson, there's a big
debate about militarization.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.960
That debate goes on
around the country.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.820
And as befits a federal
system and a democracy,

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.759
different governments, different
states at the local level all

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:02.800
adopt different policies
about what should happen

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.120
with the military equipment.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.190
Some decide to keep
it, some decide

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.040
to ship it back, some decide
that it's got to be online,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.100
what equipment the government
has, so that folks can respond.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.620
Some decide that the government
actually-- the police

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.540
have to come to the
city council, whatever,

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.010
and ask to get the permission.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.150
But the policy changes.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.910
Similarly with drones--
a lot of states

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.595
are now adopting
drone legislation

00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:25.720
because people are focused
on the use of technology

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.980
around policing.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.320
And even after the
Snowden revelations,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.324
though it took Congress
a long period of time,

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:32.740
eventually what
happened is, there

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.820
was a big debate in Congress.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.236
And we decided
that the government

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.520
shouldn't hold all that data.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.890
And instead, it should be
held by private companies,

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.060
and should only be
available under court order.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.820
So when we get the
public involved

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.340
in the front end, which
we don't do very often,

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.300
policing changes.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.220
And the last kind
of big point I want

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.392
to make with some more images
is that this, ironically,

00:11:53.392 --> 00:11:54.350
is good for the police.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.010
So this is the sell to the
police, but it's important.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.060
So there's been a lot of talk
about legitimacy of policing,

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.150
about trust in
policing agencies.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.900
Well, it's not that
surprising that people

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.210
don't trust that there are
legitimacy issues when people

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.668
aren't engaged,
and when they don't

00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:09.700
have a voice in what happens.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.210
And so when there are
things like Stop and Frisk,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.090
hundreds of thousands of
people a year in New York.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.070
Or when there's
surveillance going

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.020
on that people don't
know about, then

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.930
in fact, when people learn,
or when people observe that,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.752
there is a huge loss of
legitimacy and trust.

00:12:24.752 --> 00:12:26.460
And that's painful
for policing agencies,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.320
which need to understand--
and what progressive chiefs

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.451
understand is-- in fact,
we were working in Camden,

00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:32.700
and there was a horrible
incident of an eight-year-old

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.300
girl that was shot and killed
in crossfire from a gang fight.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.460
And somebody came forward,
a very wealthy person

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.770
elsewhere in New Jersey,
and offered up a big reward.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.390
And nobody took the money
because what happens

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.984
is that, in these neighborhoods
when something goes wrong

00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:50.400
and there's a shooting, nobody
cooperates with the police.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.690
Nobody wants to
speak to the police.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.231
People are threatened, they're
afraid to speak to the police.

00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:56.040
And it's that lack of
legitimacy and trust

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.082
that keeps us from getting that
engagement with the public.

00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:00.540
But here's kind of
an ironic story.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.100
So Compton, part of
the sprawling place

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.329
that is Los Angeles, the
police department decides--

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:09.870
the L.A. sheriff's
department decides

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.328
that they're going to try out
some surveillance technology.

00:13:12.328 --> 00:13:16.410
Big airplane in the sky,
remarkable resolution,

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.700
track crime that way.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.350
Eventually, people find out.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.310
It's in the newspapers.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.210
People are extremely angry.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.150
Remarkable statement by
the public information

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.858
officer for the L.A.
sheriff's department

00:13:25.858 --> 00:13:27.510
says, look, when we
did this, we knew

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.550
that people kind of get
nervous about Big Brother, eye

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.060
in the sky.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.560
So we thought we
just better kind of

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.197
keep it hush-hush
and not tell anybody.

00:13:33.197 --> 00:13:35.280
Obviously people were
unhappy when they found out,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.090
and that was the end of it.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.500
But down the street
in Lancaster,

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.447
exact same technology, public
debate, they decided to use it.

00:13:41.447 --> 00:13:42.780
And that happens time and again.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.863
It's happened with drones.

00:13:43.863 --> 00:13:45.290
It happened here in Seattle.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.281
The police department
got some drones,

00:13:47.281 --> 00:13:49.280
people learned about it,
were extremely unhappy.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.946
They eventually had
to ship them to L.A.

00:13:50.946 --> 00:13:52.900
Just a quiet the tempest.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.070
So the idea I want
to leave you with

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.467
is that bringing front end
accountability to policing

00:13:58.467 --> 00:14:00.300
is really important,
and makes a difference.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.850
I started an organization called
The Policing Project to work

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.290
on those kinds of issues.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.050
We do lots of different
things, but I just

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.675
want to mention a
couple that I thought

00:14:08.675 --> 00:14:10.990
would be of particular
interest in this room.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.960
So one thing that
we're doing is,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.284
we're working all over the
country bringing community

00:14:15.284 --> 00:14:17.700
voice to policing, trying out
different models of bringing

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.366
the police and the
communities together.

00:14:19.366 --> 00:14:22.350
Decide how they
want to be policed,

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.630
often working with,
as you might guess,

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.310
extremely marginalized
neighborhoods,

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.575
communities of color.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.950
The other thing
that we're doing,

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.600
which astonished
me when I started

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.570
to write the book-- so you
know, I didn't believe then,

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.100
and I very much
don't believe now

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.170
that we're safer because
of all this policing.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.380
And I'm very curious about the
efficacy of policing practices,

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.880
so I said to my
research assistants,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.296
go forth and get
me the literature

00:14:43.296 --> 00:14:45.127
on cost-benefit
analysis of policing.

00:14:45.127 --> 00:14:46.710
And they came back
with not very much.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.590
And I said, no,
seriously, there must be.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.830
We spend $100 billion a
year on public safety,

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.680
there must be studies.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.236
Shockingly little cost-benefit
analysis done around policing.

00:14:56.236 --> 00:14:58.110
But the one extraordinary
fact that I learned

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.860
was, in all of the little,
skimpy literature there was,

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.620
no attention paid whatsoever to
the social costs of policing.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.162
So we might ask, look, we can
hire this many more officers,

00:15:08.162 --> 00:15:09.870
we can do this many
more Stop and Frisks,

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.200
doesn't make us safer.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.310
We have some estimates
to the cost of crime,

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.360
but no one ever
asks the question,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.980
how do we monetize
the Stop and Frisk?

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.210
What is it-- what does it cost--

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.900
what's the value on being
stopped and frisked?

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.400
Or what's the value
on community trust

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.691
if it's lost when that happens?

00:15:22.691 --> 00:15:26.370
And so around street policing
issues, around technology--

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.100
which is one of the really huge
issues around policing right

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.600
now, is the growth
of technology,

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.790
these are the kinds of
questions we need to answer.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.050
That's all from me.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.716
My friend Deborah's now going to
talk to you a little about what

00:15:36.716 --> 00:15:38.070
she does here in Seattle.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.095
DEBORAH JACOBS:
Thank you, Barry.

00:15:39.095 --> 00:15:39.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.643
BARRY FRIEDMAN: Thank you.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.130
DEBORAH JACOBS: Thank you so
much to Ana and [? Yves ?]

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.170
and David for hosting us.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:51.470
It's really exciting to be
here, and see how you all live.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.210
So I-- after working more
than 20 years for the ACLU,

00:15:55.210 --> 00:16:00.250
I decided to settle into work,
specifically digging deep

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.810
on police practices.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.780
And the reason I kind of
went to single-issue work

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.450
is, I see that as the
most critical area

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.470
of civil liberties.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.410
It's the most direct, immediate,
dangerous confrontation

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.560
between a government
and its citizens.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.360
And it's also the gateway
to mass incarceration.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.460
And for me, for those
reasons, it really

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.700
rose up as someplace where
I'd like to dedicate my time.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.320
So there aren't a ton of systems
to hold police accountable.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.060
During the Obama
administration, we've

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.510
seen unprecedented
engagement with the DOJ.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.870
I think he sent the DOJ out
more on police practices issues

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.980
than probably the last five
or six presidencies combined.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.940
Those kind of-- it's
really a new thing.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.560
But as we know, the
administration has changed.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.540
And I think we have lots of
evidence to see the rollback.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.610
So what's left for
accountability?

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.260
And you could also
really question

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.560
how the efficacy of DOJ
intervention, some success

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.700
stories, some rollbacks.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.570
We'll see what happens in
Seattle, in particular.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.880
But civilian oversight
is another way

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.410
of holding police accountable.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.700
My office is one of 150
offices around the country that

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.880
engage in civilian-led
oversight efforts.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.369
And by the way, I'm not in
love with saying civilian

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.890
because what's-- it's
versus military, right?

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.500
And I don't particularly want
our police to be militarized.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.470
I also don't want to
use citizen because that

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.829
excludes a big chunk of our
population unintentionally,

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.000
I think.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.069
But for now, it's
civilian oversight.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.600
No two offices are the same.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.940
You can't do apples
to apples comparisons.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.810
And there's no one best
model, one best practice,

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.730
or way of doing the oversight.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.940
What my office does is sort
of three key functions.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.580
When the-- so one thing is,
we oversee the King County

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.840
sheriff's office.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.780
That office covers all of
unincorporated King County,

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.630
and about a dozen jurisdictions
that contract for its services.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:56.200
So that's Burine, Shoreline,
Beaux Arts, Maple Valley,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.910
Woodinville, Muckleshoot
Reservation, and a bunch more

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.290
I can't pull off
the top of my head.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.550
And so when you're in Burine,
you might see Burine police,

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.199
and then you'll see a little
King County sheriff under that.

00:18:09.199 --> 00:18:10.990
So we have, compared
to the Seattle police,

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.560
a really diverse geographic
and otherwise area.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.030
So you can't even compare
how Seattle does things

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.510
to how King County does things.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.130
And that's something
to be mindful of.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.990
So what the activities
my office do are,

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.330
one, when the sheriff's
office completes

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.520
an internal investigation,
we look at it

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.830
to see if it was
thorough and objective.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.600
Is there bias in
the investigation?

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.740
Have they crossed their
T's and dotted their I's?

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.070
Two, we do systemic reviews,
use of force trends,

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.794
training issues.

00:18:37.794 --> 00:18:40.210
One of the things that drives
me crazy about the training,

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.670
there's statewide, there's
a 24 hour annual training

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:43.590
requirement.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.190
And at least the
King County sheriff's

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.990
office, that's all
done electronically.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.465
None of it has to be
in-person training.

00:18:49.465 --> 00:18:52.540
And I think there are huge
costs and issues around that.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.140
Three, we do community outreach.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.279
That's me right here,
right now, talking to you.

00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:57.820
And for those of
you who think you're

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.421
covered by an area of the
King County sheriff's office,

00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:01.420
I'd love to talk to you.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.660
Because we have opportunities to
engage you, and I need to help,

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.200
people.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.120
So identify yourself.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.130
And then right now, we--

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.310
in November, 2015, the
voters of King County

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.160
voted to expand the authorities
of my office to include

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.960
individual investigations.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.200
The King County council has just
passed an ordinance to do that.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.730
And now that
ordinance is subject

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.610
to collective bargaining with
the 11 different unions that

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.640
represent the law enforcement
that make up the King County

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.690
sheriff's office.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.730
So this will be a new
experience for me to see,

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.599
can we hold onto these
voter-endorsed rights?

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:35.890
It might interest you to know
that in Washington State,

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.840
a collective bargaining
agreement has

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.410
a higher legal authority
than an ordinance,

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.400
or even a vote of the people.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.120
So I'm trying to live out some
of what Barry's talking about.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.980
And he's correct in
saying a lot of what we

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.140
do are the back end solutions.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.970
What can come on the front end?

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.710
So in our new
ordinance, one piece

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.370
is to have input on policies
before they're adopted.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.980
Non-binding input, but
input nevertheless.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.380
And that, as it happens, was
the piece of the ordinance

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.000
that they fought
hardest against.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.870
And I don't--

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.490
I'm not sure what
that means, Barry.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.710
You know, how much
is that related

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:16.450
to defensiveness of like,
no, we decide how we do it?

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.600
But the future is
what Barry describes.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.860
It's-- when people talk
about community policing,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.350
most of us get on our head,
that's a cop out of his car

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.480
in the community
to talk to people.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.870
I think we need to take a more
aspirational viewpoint, which

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.410
is that community policing
is about the community,

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.650
through democratic processes,
setting the priorities of what

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.910
the police should be doing.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.650
And Seattle has great
precedent for this.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.060
When we-- God, how
long ago, 20 years ago,

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.750
passed a law that said marijuana
should be the lowest law

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.350
enforcement priority.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.070
I don't think that's been done
here, or anywhere else since.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.300
But it's the idea.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.327
It's like, well, what do we
care most about in our community

00:20:52.327 --> 00:20:53.410
that we want police to do?

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.360
And what we don't want them
to do, how are we going

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.620
to make up that difference?

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.950
So technology, I just want
to say a couple of things,

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.930
and then I'll not take
up any more of the time.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.930
I know you want to ask
Barry a lot of questions.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.840
But one thing that's a
big issue with police

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.680
is adopting technologies without
having thoughtful processes

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.810
for the policies behind them.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.060
So I just found out that
King County sheriff's

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.950
has been using a
technology that there

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:22.120
was no real analysis of like,
what are the privacy rights?

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.380
How is this going to
be properly stored?

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.870
Or-- all those issues.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.690
So I think for those of
you in the tech community,

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.854
if you're interested in policy
around privacy and technology,

00:21:31.854 --> 00:21:32.770
there's a lot of room.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.103
And I personally would love
to have your help, if that's

00:21:35.103 --> 00:21:37.720
something, you're engaged with.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.991
Another issue is better
technologies for police.

00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:42.490
So one thing I said
at lunch, if you

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.530
want to become a
billionaire is, come up

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.680
with a great, non-lethal
way to stop people.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.830
Tasers are sometimes
non-lethal, but if you

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.670
have an underlying
medical condition,

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.530
many hundreds of people now have
died from Taser applications.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.600
And that's what they
rely on now, it's Tasers.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.030
You have a gun on one
hip, a Taser on the other.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.840
And unless they're
coming up fast at you,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.760
you're going to take your
Taser and give it a try.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.093
But it's not always reliable,
and they don't necessarily

00:22:07.093 --> 00:22:08.470
trust it.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.370
So they are, by the way--
they've already experimented

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.160
with web--

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.730
a net you can shoot.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.520
But the newest trend is
sticky gum that you shoot.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.150
And people-- it's
like a cartoon.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.790
And go on YouTube, and look
for the demonstrations.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.760
But they kind of stop people
from being able to move.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.960
Those are not in use yet.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.320
There's a lot of room for that.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.820
And I think it's necessary.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.330
And then finally,
one thing I notice

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.570
is that underlying systems
with which policing is managed

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.940
leave a lot of room
for improvement.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.300
There's an industry
standard called IAPro--

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.570
Internal Affairs Pro, where all
the data is kept in most police

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.500
departments.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.020
And there's so many
shortcomings to those programs.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.500
And so this is an area where I
think there is tremendous need.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.470
Again, I'm not a
big body camera fan.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.510
I'm not against
technologies inherently.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.580
I think they need to
work for the people.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.520
Problem with body cams,
among other things,

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.810
is, they only face one way.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.060
And I think where you have
something like a dash cam

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.890
where you're performing
in front of it--

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.810
although they can
also avoid those.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:11.920
So a lot of issues there.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.440
And I really appreciate
your interest in this.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.050
My office is one of only
two independent oversight

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.340
offices in the state.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.857
The other one's in Spokane.

00:23:19.857 --> 00:23:21.940
I'd love for you to take
an interest in what we're

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.040
trying to do because it's
really about the future.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.740
What kind of accountability
can we as citizens

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.420
assert in these dynamics?

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.880
And it's a work in progress
trying to get it right,

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.230
and lots of challenges.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.050
But I can't think of a more
important field in which you

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.790
could share your talents.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:37.810
So thank you.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.180
And I'm going to help
moderate questions for Barry

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.280
because I love just being
up here and talking.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:42.940
Come on, Barry.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.815
We'll take questions.

00:23:43.815 --> 00:23:46.659
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.650
So who has a juicy question?

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.050
Or even a just not juicy one?

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.800
AUDIENCE: Thanks a lot
for the great talk.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.924
And I can't wait to check
out the rest of the book.

00:23:56.924 --> 00:23:58.520
My question is
regarding firearms.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.380
So this may be a
naive assertion,

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.240
but it seems like,
in the United States,

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.610
police have firearms
that are maybe

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.590
more dangerous than others.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.452
And in fact, I think
in the UK, most police

00:24:09.452 --> 00:24:10.910
aren't even equipped
with firearms.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.390
So is that a unique
situation to the US?

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.320
And how do firearms play
in this whole thing?

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.050
BARRY FRIEDMAN: Yeah,
I mean, cultures

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.140
vary everywhere, right?

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.260
So in the UK, they largely
don't have firearms.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.840
I just read a story
in the newspaper

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.790
that knifings are up in the UK.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.340
So that's what gangs
use, their knives.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.860
And apparently, somebody
tells me also, just kind of

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.220
fold people over and compress
them until they expire.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.047
So we all come from
different cultures,

00:24:39.047 --> 00:24:41.130
and things are done
differently in different ways.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:47.330
We know that we come from a
very Rambo, Cal person culture,

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.380
and that involves
a lot of weaponry.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.910
And it's a problem for the cops.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:53.480
I mean, it's interesting.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.870
If you talk to cops, they don't
love concealed carry laws,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.050
they don't love open carry laws.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:58.675
They don't love
everybody having a gun.

00:24:58.675 --> 00:25:01.239
It makes their job a
lot more difficult.

00:25:01.239 --> 00:25:01.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.500
So it seems like
community policing

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.140
is one of the best ways to
get the police more engaged

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.090
with the community, and
to get the community

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.370
to see the police as a
force that will help them,

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.099
as opposed to just arrest them,
or enforce the laws on them.

00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:15.890
This is kind of a
question for both of you,

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.680
and for King County,
what's stopping us

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.980
right now from just rolling
out a larger community policing

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.790
effort?

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.220
BARRY FRIEDMAN: So
first, I just want

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.170
to draw a distinction,
which Deborah drew,

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.420
between community policing
and community engagement

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.711
because I think it's important.

00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:32.459
So community policing,
as you identified,

00:25:32.459 --> 00:25:34.250
is a way to get the
cops out of their cars,

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.583
and walking around, and meeting
people in the community.

00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:40.340
And generally, we should favor
that as a method of policing.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.089
Though we should
also be conscious

00:25:43.089 --> 00:25:45.380
of unintended consequences,
because we always have them

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.070
around policing.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.257
And so there was
some community that

00:25:48.257 --> 00:25:50.840
had this idea that it would be
great if, on Friday afternoons,

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.381
the cops would just come up and
high-five all the kids coming

00:25:53.381 --> 00:25:54.250
out of school.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.700
A lot of parents
were like, whoa,

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.140
we just don't
really want the cops

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.000
around high-fiving anybody.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.280
And you know, that's a
function of a loss of trust,

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.521
and a loss of legitimacy.

00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:05.270
We were moving toward
a community policing

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.080
model in this country, and
then we had a war on drugs.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.750
And then we had a war on terror.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.120
And it's hard to have community
policing when you're at war.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.780
And so Sue Rahr, who is the
former Sheriff of King County

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.670
and now runs a training
facility talks a lot

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.380
about the difference
between cops

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.900
being warriors and guardians.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.720
But a lot of departments
are moving toward community

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.470
policing models.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.320
The NYPD is moving pretty
quickly toward one.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.540
We're doing some
work in Chicago,

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.040
and they're trying
to move themself

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.789
to set up that kind
of community policing.

00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:38.097
So it's the right direction.

00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:39.680
DEBORAH JACOBS: I
would just throw in,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.860
one other thing is resource.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.660
You ask what stops
it, is resources.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.470
There are so many
differences in capacities

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:49.530
of police departments.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.780
And you know, how many people?

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.279
Are they doing--
King County happens

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:53.870
to be an extremely
lean department.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.480
That will give you an example
to compare it to Seattle.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.690
In Seattle, they've done
amazing work on their crisis

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.630
intervention in terms of
people in behavioral crisis.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.870
So if they get a call, for
example, with a suicidal,

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.159
possibly armed person,
they'll spend up to an hour--

00:27:09.159 --> 00:27:11.450
first of all, they'll have
an officer there that's been

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.690
trained and certified in--

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.780
they call it CIT, people
in behavioral crisis.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.010
And then they'll spend
up to an hour trying

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.770
to engage them from
outside, giving them

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.750
lots of time and space.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.840
You all saw in Seattle
a few weeks ago,

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.450
downtown was shut down because
there was a knife-wielding man.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.741
And there was a confrontation
with the police that took

00:27:31.741 --> 00:27:33.470
two or three hours to resolve.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.610
They were using, I think,
the greatest tool of all,

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.820
which is patience, you know?

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.520
Giving that time and space
to the community members

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.660
in order to engage.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.230
But you have to
have the capacity,

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.020
you have to have the
physical resources.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.230
In King County, the sheriff's
deputies right alone.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.780
Seattle they ride in pairs.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.930
And in King County, you could be
up to an hour from your backup.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.490
So that also influences.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.295
And also just the rural
nature of a lot of the land.

00:27:58.295 --> 00:28:00.170
So I think one of the
challenges in coming up

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.150
with good solutions
to reform policing

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.920
is to make it scalable.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.940
And so when--

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.190
I don't know, what department?

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.360
When Tukwila hears what
Seattle's doing, they're like,

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.740
ugh, you know, we can't do it.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.390
So thinking in
those terms as well,

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.096
what's possible
within what you have.

00:28:17.096 --> 00:28:18.024
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:18.024 --> 00:28:19.565
AUDIENCE: I have a
bunch of questions

00:28:19.565 --> 00:28:21.197
that I was trying to select one.

00:28:21.197 --> 00:28:22.780
I keep changing my
mind up back there.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:23.643
AUDIENCE: So--

00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:26.850
BARRY FRIEDMAN:
You can have two.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:27.950
It's a special day today.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:28.356
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:28.942
AUDIENCE: All right, I'll
do two since I'm just going

00:28:28.942 --> 00:28:29.168
to stand here and freak out.

00:28:29.168 --> 00:28:30.610
DEBORAH JACOBS: It's Cinco
de Mayo, you can have five.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:31.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.900
AUDIENCE: So-- and I start
really freaking out now.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.690
So one of my question is, I
guess, more for Barry because I

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.180
guess you'll explain it.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.770
Why, in terms of your
focus, you chose policing.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.835
Because there are other
enforcement people--

00:28:47.835 --> 00:28:51.990
I don't know what you call
those, that also affects

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.480
the life of the civilians.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.010
Like, for example, the
DA, or the immigration.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.040
So, yeah that's
my first question.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.370
BARRY FRIEDMAN: So
I'm going to give you

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:07.080
a rather personal
answer to that question.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.240
So I hit a point in my
career for various reasons

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.260
where I really wanted--

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.150
I felt I wasn't enough
publicly engaged

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.330
in what was it that I would do.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:21.590
And when that happened and
I was thinking through that,

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.910
I was also writing this book.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.397
And of course I didn't
reach the obvious conclusion

00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:27.230
by adding two and two
together that policing

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.190
would be the thing to do.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:35.395
And then Snowden happened,
and I realized that I--

00:29:35.395 --> 00:29:37.370
that the ideas in
the book mattered

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.460
a lot in the real world, and
that I could maybe apply them.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.037
And then as we
were working on how

00:29:42.037 --> 00:29:44.120
to set up the policing
project, Ferguson happened.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.490
And it's been kind of like being
shot out of a cannon since then

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:47.720
with the work that we do.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.960
And by the way, I want to
follow Deborah's discussion

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.490
about what all of you can do.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:57.650
Because in our work, there's
huge needs for technology.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:01.730
So I-- that's the path I took
because it's what I knew.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.890
But I think that many of
the same issues that I'm

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.020
raising about policing in
front end accountability

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.734
completely apply to prosecutors.

00:30:07.734 --> 00:30:09.650
They may be more independent
than anybody else

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:10.290
in the system.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.020
And so it's a perfectly
fair question,

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.220
but this problem feels
this big some days.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:20.131
And so it's all I can
kind of grapple with.

00:30:20.131 --> 00:30:20.630
Thank you.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:21.530
You want another one?

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:22.155
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:22.155 --> 00:30:23.070
BARRY FRIEDMAN: Good.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.010
AUDIENCE: So my
other question was,

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.100
how much partnership
and cooperation

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.910
you have with the
police department,

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.510
or the various policing people?

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.650
Because I see them.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.210
There's-- one, there's
always this story about

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:37.700
that's the good cop and bad cop.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.600
And a lot of people go to
the job because they do

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.750
feel that they--

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.820
becoming a police
or law enforcement,

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.860
they are doing things.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.440
And so they won't to grow
up and get their job,

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.490
and become hated by everyone.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.640
So how much
cooperation is there?

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.750
How is that?

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.750
BARRY FRIEDMAN: Yeah, so
that's a good question.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:31:01.220
So the policing project, we
work with policing agencies all

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.520
the time, and with communities.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.254
So depending upon
the community, we're

00:31:04.254 --> 00:31:05.420
kind of in a different role.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.060
In Cleveland, we're working
with the federal monitor doing

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.730
community engagement in terms
of getting the community to have

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.260
input into the monitoring plan.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.390
They're under a consent
decree following

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.450
Tamir Rice to deal with
use of force issues.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.480
In Camden, we're there
because the police chief

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.000
asked us to come in and help
him engage with his community,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.020
and deal with some
of these issues.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.000
We're setting up a--

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.500
you saw on the slide, a
advisory council in Tucson.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.470
We're working with the
L.A. Police commission.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.880
It's the only civilian-run
police department

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.894
in the country to ask the
question to the public, what

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:37.310
do we do about
body camera footage

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.320
after there's been an
officer-involved shooting?

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.490
And so we often feel like
we're operating in a minefield.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:46.496
We talk a lot about
walking a very thin line.

00:31:46.496 --> 00:31:47.870
I'm very careful
about the things

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:51.260
I say in public because
the public is there,

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.320
the community is there,
but also the police.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.580
And it's easy to alienate
one or the other.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.540
But the goal is to try
to bring them together.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.394
And I try to--

00:32:01.394 --> 00:32:02.810
Ana and I were
talking about this.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.220
I try to think the best of
people in every situation,

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.640
and assume that they're
acting in good faith,

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.580
and are often in
just bad situations.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:15.470
And I have found that if you--
it's slow, slow, painful work.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.810
It is really remarkable
how hard some of it is.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.342
But you get these
glimmers of sunlight

00:32:21.342 --> 00:32:23.300
when people are communicating
with one another,

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.600
and progress is being made.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.995
And the police realize they
can listen to the community,

00:32:26.995 --> 00:32:28.370
and it's not
threatening to them.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.286
And that the community
actually is supportive,

00:32:30.286 --> 00:32:32.669
and has ideas for how to
do things differently.

00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:35.210
And the community realizes that
the police are not just there

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.100
to terrorize them,
but actually are

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.560
folks who came to the job
originally thinking that they

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.560
would do something good.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.784
And so that happens too
seldom, but when it happens,

00:32:42.784 --> 00:32:43.950
I think it's pretty magical.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.354
And that's the idea.

00:32:45.354 --> 00:32:46.770
DEBORAH JACOBS:
If you don't mind,

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.770
I'll also throw in
two cents on that one.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.930
Hands down, the
hardest part of my job

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.260
is trying to work
both collaboratively

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.460
and adversarialy with
the department I oversee.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.130
I'm very fortunate because
our Sheriff, John Urquhart,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.450
is very progressive.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.730
He, for example, has
taken a strong stand

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:09.050
about not enforcing civil
immigration enforcement

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.500
for the federal government.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.770
He also has been
great, progressive

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.400
on drug policy issues.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.370
But we're-- as I described, we
kind of review what they do.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.590
So it's like
[CAT FIGHTING NOISES] you know?

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:25.220
And you have to-- you want
to find your common areas,

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.000
and march those forward, and
also deal with the pain points.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.982
And people in my field
get fired all the time.

00:33:31.982 --> 00:33:33.690
I don't think I even
have any friends who

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.689
have worked in this field
who haven't been fired

00:33:35.689 --> 00:33:39.530
from their jobs
eventually because you

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:43.460
have to be pro-community,
and collaborative

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.120
with law enforcement, as well.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.960
So it's kind of--
it's a struggle,

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.950
and frankly, is calling on
the depths of my maturity,

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.270
to the extent there are any.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.284
[LAUGHS]

00:33:54.284 --> 00:33:55.700
BARRY FRIEDMAN:
You know, I just--

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.944
if you think about
it, in government--

00:33:57.944 --> 00:33:59.360
and it's important
for what I want

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.710
to say about what the
tech community can offer,

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.489
the front end and the
back end of policing

00:34:05.489 --> 00:34:08.030
should talk to one another, just
like everything else, right?

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.500
So I am party to a lot of
anguished conversations

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.900
with folks that are angry
that police officers have not

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.409
been held accountable, that
they've not been indicted.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:20.420
And part of the reason
is because we are not

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.290
clear enough on the front
end about what we expect.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.820
The standards are
very, very vague.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.000
So you can have a very
effective back end

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.699
unless you've got a front end
that's got legitimacy to it,

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:31.080
and that tells people
what's expected of them.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.560
And by the same token,
what Deborah does,

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.940
she's got exactly
the right model

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.250
going in the sense of,
if you're on the back end

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.874
and you see where
there are problems,

00:34:38.874 --> 00:34:40.790
then that ought to inform
how you want to have

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:42.830
new policies on the front end.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.210
And it all ought to work
that way, in a healthy way.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.674
So even though it's adversarial
and also collaborative,

00:34:47.674 --> 00:34:49.340
that's how we're
supposed to be in terms

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.679
of being self-critical about
what government's doing,

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:52.790
and then improving it.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:57.200
It doesn't happen that way very
often, but that's the idea.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.900
You going to ask a que-- yeah.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.140
Or were you just
holding up the--the--[LAUGHS]

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.098
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm just
hanging out over here.

00:35:02.098 --> 00:35:02.610
No.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.026
So first, thanks
for coming today.

00:35:04.026 --> 00:35:06.809
I really enjoyed
both of those talks.

00:35:06.809 --> 00:35:09.350
So I was going to say, I have
a lot of friends that are cops.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.160
And with everything that's
been happening recently,

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.530
we talk a lot, I guess,
about what they're doing,

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.270
and what the community
thinks about it.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.155
And one thing that
I've found is,

00:35:21.155 --> 00:35:23.630
they kind of think
that a lot of policies

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:28.130
that are there to protect
citizens are against them.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.050
One specific example
that I can think of

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:35.160
is, in Seattle, you have to pull
someone over only for the thing

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.010
that you're pulling
them over for, which

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.690
is different from other places.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.107
And that makes sense to me.

00:35:40.107 --> 00:35:41.690
I feel like that's
really good policy.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:47.150
But to them, it's like, if
we suspect a guy of some drug

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.270
offense, and then we
see that he's speeding,

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.580
we can't use that as a reason
to pull him over and look

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.490
for something else.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.340
And it's sort of a--

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.470
to them, it's hurting
them in doing their job.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.650
And so what I'm
wondering is, is there

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.390
anything being done
to sort of bridge

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.844
that gap where they don't
feel like the policies

00:36:04.844 --> 00:36:06.260
are against them,
and they can see

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.870
the benefit for the community?

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:13.081
And then also, is the problem
the incentive structure?

00:36:13.081 --> 00:36:13.580
Yeah.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:18.695
BARRY FRIEDMAN: So that's
a terrific question.

00:36:18.695 --> 00:36:20.590
We conduct debates
in this country

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.880
in an unbelievably
unhealthy way.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.820
And it's often you're
pro-cop or anti-cop.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.390
Or you're-- sometimes I think
it's like you're pro-safety

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.220
and security, or
you're pro-liberty.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:35.660
And I always wonder,
you know, I'm both.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.460
I tell people I have young kids.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.520
I live near the
World Trade Center.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.039
I want to be safe and secure.

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:43.580
I want my kids to
be safe and secure.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.650
And I also want to live in a
society where we have liberty,

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.540
and we treat one
another respectfully.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.520
And I hate that we divide the
world up in that other way,

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.080
and then think about
things that way.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.300
So what the officers are talking
about is, it has become very--

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.060
it became very common
in the United States

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.710
to engage in what
was often referred

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.810
to as proactive policing.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.190
That meant lots of stops--

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.490
lots of pedestrian stops,
lots of traffic stops.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.710
And cops will tell you,
they can stop anybody.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.793
You follow somebody for
just a little bit of time,

00:37:14.793 --> 00:37:16.947
there's 1,000 things
that you could do wrong

00:37:16.947 --> 00:37:17.780
in the vehicle code.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.470
It's easy to pull people over.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.710
And then they get
consent to search.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:24.680
And I looked at data from L.A.
at one point one quarter--

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.820
I mean, one half of a year.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.900
And 19,000 some-100 people
were asked to consent,

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.670
and three people didn't.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.046
So you wonder how
voluntary that consent is.

00:37:34.046 --> 00:37:36.170
Though you do also want to
meet those three people.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.397
And you know, that's a decision
for us to make as a soci--

00:37:41.397 --> 00:37:43.730
I mean, first of all, there
are constitutional problems.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.280
It's not clear that you should
be pulling over a lot of people

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:46.870
with no cause.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.765
The meaning of living in a
liberal democracy like we are

00:37:49.765 --> 00:37:51.640
is that you have a
certain amount of liberty,

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.140
and that shouldn't happen.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.420
But that's the exact
question, which

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.900
is that we don't
say, how do we want

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.880
to fight crime while we
talk about being worried

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.570
about crime.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.770
We don't have a conversation
about how part of that.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.920
And we all ought to be
in that conversation,

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.780
and we should include the
police in the conversation.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.238
Everywhere we go,
everything we do,

00:38:09.238 --> 00:38:11.110
we hold focus groups
with the officers,

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.284
line officers, the brass.

00:38:13.284 --> 00:38:14.950
They should be part
of the conversation.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:16.450
But I hate the
notion that they have

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:19.120
the ownership over
that question,

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.640
or feel that they have
the ownership over it.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.210
Remarkable documents sitting
on my desk from the Fraternal

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:27.430
organization, the
union in Chicago,

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.340
the superintendent in Chicago
in the middle of all the uproar,

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.980
new use of force policy.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.602
Sends it out to the public to--

00:38:34.602 --> 00:38:37.060
they had a cool online program,
and everybody could kind of

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.680
add comments and edit.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.650
And the Fraternal
organization was outraged.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.550
And they sent out this
email that basically said--

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:47.350
I mean, they used this phrase,
the world's turned upside down.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.110
The superintendent's taken
our use of force policy,

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:53.680
and asked the public
what they think.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.932
And all I could think
was, how crazy is that?

00:38:56.932 --> 00:38:58.390
Asking the people
that you're going

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:00.970
to use force on what the policy
should be for using force,

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:01.210
right?

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.040
I mean, it wouldn't
strike any of us as crazy.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.780
And that's just
something that's broken,

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.880
and that's exactly the thing
that we're trying to fix.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.810
How to fix it?

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:10.810
So this will be my
pitch to all of you

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.337
out there about-- so this front
end accountability is really

00:39:13.337 --> 00:39:15.670
difficult because we don't
have any structures for doing

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.545
it the United States.

00:39:16.545 --> 00:39:19.100
We're making it all
up all the time.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.890
And when you're making
it up all the time,

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.990
there are a lot of questions
that tread into the world

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.281
in which you live, and where
all of you can be helpful.

00:39:25.281 --> 00:39:28.810
So we are working often in
very marginalized communities.

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.850
And there are inadequate
ways to conduct

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.280
participatory democracy,
and to do it in a way

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.517
that people aren't having
to come to a meeting

00:39:35.517 --> 00:39:37.350
when they don't have
time come to a meeting,

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.350
they got kids to take care of.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:40.683
And we need to have a easy
way for people to have input.

00:39:40.683 --> 00:39:42.310
And the platforms
aren't very good.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:43.810
We want to know if
what we're doing works.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.560
And to figure out what
you're doing works,

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.350
you need to do a
lot of surveying.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:49.180
And the platforms for--

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.580
there aren't platforms that
allow police departments

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.050
to easily go in and get
into their geo-coded parts

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.800
of their community,
and say, how we doing?

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.600
How's the new policy
affecting people?

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.120
To test legitimacy,
to test trust,

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.870
so that we can see
over time whether we're

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:02.800
making any progress.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.750
Just doesn't exist.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:05.549
Huge data needs.

00:40:05.549 --> 00:40:07.090
So one of the things
we're looking at

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.476
is, there are measures
of the impacts

00:40:10.476 --> 00:40:12.100
of policing that
people just have never

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.310
thought about very much.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.210
So we want to kind of go in
and ask in communities where

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.900
there's been this kind
of proactive policing,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.250
are there effects
on public health?

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.540
What about education rates?

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.790
Drop out?

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.910
Obviously offending and arrests?

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.890
And so there are
lots of opportunities

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:30.982
to engage in this project.

00:40:30.982 --> 00:40:33.190
I mean, I commend Deborah
for all the suggestions she

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.020
had locally, but
those same problems

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.812
are multiplied through 18,000
different policing agencies.

00:40:37.812 --> 00:40:39.520
I don't know if you
want to add anything.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.330
I just went on and
on there, sorry.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.270
DEBORAH JACOBS:
I'll just throw in

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.900
that I think we confront the
same kind of problem that we

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.000
confront with other groups
that are essentially

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.280
segregated from one
another, and that

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.950
is that we don't
know each other,

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.690
and we don't come into
each other's territory--

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:55.090
whether it's black and
white, or cops and civilians,

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.450
or whatever it is.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.570
And so I think it's incumbent
upon those of us who

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.520
care about those things
to take those steps,

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.000
and try to meet each
other where we are.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.160
From my office specifically,
we administrate

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.320
an alternative
dispute resolution.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.960
I would way rather
see a cop spend

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.500
an hour in the room with
a facilitator talking

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.930
to a person who had a
complaint against them

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.920
than get a five day
suspension because I think

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.510
it's worth that much more.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.852
I kind of think we need a
truth and reconciliation--

00:41:22.852 --> 00:41:24.310
I don't what that
looks like, but I

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:27.770
think there's enough damage
that really stems from slavery

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:31.960
in particular that
we have more dialogue

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.230
to conduct before we're
going to be able to meet.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.189
But someone like
you is invaluable.

00:41:37.189 --> 00:41:38.980
You know some of these
people, but you also

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.240
have outside perspectives.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.470
You can take your
bubble and their bubble,

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:44.620
and make a bubble bath.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.430
BARRY FRIEDMAN: I love that.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:49.431
I'm going to steal that.

00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:50.680
DEBORAH JACOBS: No, you can't.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.110
BARRY FRIEDMAN: It may not work
as well if I do the bubble bath

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:54.190
thing, but yeah.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.360
AUDIENCE: So all this talk--
first, the great talk,

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:56.860
by the way.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.410
Thanks for both of
you for coming--

00:41:58.410 --> 00:41:59.493
to both of you for coming.

00:41:59.493 --> 00:42:03.340
So all this talk
is about expanding

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.540
the oversight of the police
over the law enforcement.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.360
And one of my--

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.990
the concerns I have
is that there's

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:15.460
no equal oversight over the
citizens in terms of organized

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.930
crime, for instance.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.210
In other words,
we're restricting,

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:20.980
we are tying the
hands of the police,

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:24.040
but we are opening the hands
of the organized crime.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:29.380
And what are your thoughts about
expanding the oversight one

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.660
way or another over
suspected criminals?

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.680
So maybe required that the
information, where they go,

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.670
is just as public as a
policeman, or anything

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:43.374
like that so that we can kind
of counter to the other trend,

00:42:43.374 --> 00:42:45.040
that actually, as we
weaken the police--

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.930
and I've seen that
in other societies.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:50.280
The police weakens, and the
organized crime strengthens.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.200
So--

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.380
BARRY FRIEDMAN: So
that's a hard question.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.200
It's particularly
difficult in part

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.540
because we don't
empirically know

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:03.220
whether we're empowering
criminals and limiting

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.050
the police, and where the
optimal level of enforcement

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.550
is.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.924
I mean, you're exactly right--
there's some optimal level

00:43:08.924 --> 00:43:09.970
of enforcement, right?

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.560
The law and economics
folks around me would say,

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.520
we just have to figure out the
optimal level of enforcement.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.978
By the way, I just
want to say, I'm

00:43:16.978 --> 00:43:20.530
not sure I want to
limit the police more.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.810
I want to change the nature
of what we call oversight.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.476
In fact, I don't like
the word oversight

00:43:24.476 --> 00:43:26.710
for a lot of what
we do, I mean, you

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.115
know Deborah does oversight,
but on the front end,

00:43:29.115 --> 00:43:30.490
I don't think of
it as oversight.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:34.150
I think of it as
collaborating on figuring out

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.660
what the rules should be for
exactly what you're asking.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.520
The other thing is,
technology has actually

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.031
addressed some of that problem.

00:43:41.031 --> 00:43:43.030
So this is the question
you were going to plant,

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:44.290
and I'm now going to
relieve you of planting it

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:44.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:47.050
But so the-- guess we're
not supposed to let

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:48.670
people know that, either.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:51.520
So the policing's
changed dramatically

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.540
in the last 30 years.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.081
And I don't think
anybody noticed it,

00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:56.310
just like technology
swept over all of us,

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:59.070
and we just kind of
adapted, but didn't--

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.440
then you have your whoa moment.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.020
So policing used to be
all about suspicion,

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.960
or a lot about suspicion,
which was that you knew--

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.030
you had a reason to
think that somebody

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.790
was doing something wrong,
or had done something wrong.

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:14.390
And the Constitution was written
to focus on suspicion that way.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.387
So we think about
probable cause, right?

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:17.720
Why is the government after you?

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.390
Because we have enough facts,
probable cause, to think

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:21.650
you've done something wrong.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.124
Enough to justify getting
a warrant to search you.

00:44:24.124 --> 00:44:25.790
And it was a very
suspicion-based model.

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:28.550
But if you think about the
way that policing looks today,

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:29.420
it's very different.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.160
It's a deterrent-based
model, which

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.470
is that we're going to conduct
sufficient surveillance

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.422
over all of society that
we've got an eye on you.

00:44:36.422 --> 00:44:37.880
And you know we
have an eye on you.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.172
And hopefully-- you especially.

00:44:39.172 --> 00:44:40.379
We're going to behave, right?

00:44:40.379 --> 00:44:41.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.130
And so we're all going
to pay attention.

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.850
And so we're going to collect
everybody's telephone metadata.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.640
And it's not just being
used for national security.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.190
That information can
be queried by the FBI.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:55.160
It's a real problem in the law.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.750
We're going to have
airport security,

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:57.560
and we're just going
to get everybody

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:58.684
to march through it, right?

00:44:58.684 --> 00:45:01.590
There's no cause to think
anybody's got a weapon, we just

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.371
we spent a ton of
money on the theory

00:45:03.371 --> 00:45:05.870
that we're going to keep people
from showing up with weapons

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:06.900
in the first place.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.779
And so we actually have a ton
of surveillance right now.

00:45:10.779 --> 00:45:13.320
I mean, one of the big questions
is location-tracking, right?

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.800
We're all telling the police
where we are with our phones

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.710
at every moment.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.530
And we have inadequate
legal controls

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:19.710
on getting that information.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.624
So I'm not sure where
the balance is, and I

00:45:21.624 --> 00:45:22.790
don't think any of us knows.

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:24.950
Because we don't tend
to think about things

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.710
in this world in any kind of
scientific, careful, thoughtful

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:29.210
way.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:30.793
We just have a lot
of public rhetoric.

00:45:30.793 --> 00:45:34.040
And I think that's a shame,
because I want us to be free,

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.690
and I want us to be safe.

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:38.600
And I published a piece
in the Outlook section

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.090
of the Washington Post
a few weeks ago that--

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.910
just to ask the question,
we spent $100 billion a year

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:46.700
on public safety, ought
we to know what works?

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.720
So I'm with you,
I want to be safe.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.011
But I want to have a better
understanding of, actually,

00:45:51.011 --> 00:45:52.440
where we are with that.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.520
Thank you.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.520
AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.110
Thank you for coming.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:58.880
So my question is about--

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.110
you started your lecture
with a bunch of examples

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.420
where police clearly
misbehaved, or we

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.810
would call it bad policing,
and extreme examples.

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:10.580
What's the mental model that
you have about those cases?

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.880
Few bad apples?

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.630
Few bad districts?

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.935
BARRY FRIEDMAN: Yeah, no.

00:46:12.935 --> 00:46:13.640
No.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.960
AUDIENCE: Is it most of
the districts are bad?

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.185
What's the distribution, there?

00:46:16.185 --> 00:46:17.518
BARRY FRIEDMAN: It's bad policy.

00:46:17.518 --> 00:46:18.540
It's bad policy.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.100
So-- and it's suboptimal policy.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.080
So that's the point.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:29.100
So we-- a lot of the problems
that I showed at the beginning,

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.380
I can walk you back
through and show you

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.680
how a more sensible policy
would have avoided that problem.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.810
And if you thought that some
of those were problems--

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.310
I mean, just think
about the amount

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:47.070
of time and loss of human
dignity and discomfort

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.310
that's associated with forcibly
catheterizing somebody, right?

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:51.960
So I don't know if
we ever want to do.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.070
And I'm not sure
that we ever want

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.320
to do it for the crime of
driving under the influence.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.736
And if you were going to get
me to thinking we should ever

00:46:57.736 --> 00:46:59.370
do it, we maybe should
do it if there's

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.370
a tragic accident, right?

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.100
But that's heavy-handed
police behavior,

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.760
and it's taking a cop
off of their patrol

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.231
where they'd be, maybe, missing
something far more serious,

00:47:11.231 --> 00:47:11.730
right?

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:15.180
And so the police
shootings, every one

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.250
of which is an
extraordinary tragedy--

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.170
and I just want to
point something out

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:21.960
to you, which is that we
view the people who were shot

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.200
and their families as the
center of that tragedy, which

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.730
is exactly right.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.490
But we often don't think
about the fact that--

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:32.512
and cops will tell you
this, that the cop who shot

00:47:32.512 --> 00:47:33.720
somebody's life is destroyed.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.636
And sometimes it's
justified, but their life's

00:47:35.636 --> 00:47:38.580
still completely turned
upside down by having done it.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.510
We don't want those
things to happen.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.350
And so instead of just focusing
on who we're going to punish,

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:44.730
we should be asking the
question, how are we going

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.110
to avoid it in the first place?

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.790
It's a suboptimal policy, right?

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.250
And so-- I mean, that's
what I'm all about,

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:54.450
is data and optimization.

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:56.550
And that isn't how we've
approached policing.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:58.260
It's not how we've approached
technology in policing.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.030
I mean, Deborah was
talking about this.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:03.030
What happens is, what-agency's
got a new gadget,

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.680
so then the next
agency wants it.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.263
And they're not
thinking, do I already

00:48:06.263 --> 00:48:07.576
have something that does that?

00:48:07.576 --> 00:48:09.450
Am I thinking about how
the data is getting--

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:11.130
what the cost of storing
the data is going to be,

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:12.510
how I'm going to use the data?

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.390
So it's exactly
the right question.

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.240
And my soapbox, I'm
sorry, is that I

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.405
think that we should stop
always looking on the back end,

00:48:21.405 --> 00:48:23.626
and looking for blame when
things go wrong, and say,

00:48:23.626 --> 00:48:25.500
let's optimize policy
so they don't go wrong.

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.376
And we're actually
getting things right.

00:48:27.376 --> 00:48:28.626
AUDIENCE: I get that argument.

00:48:28.626 --> 00:48:31.350
My question is a little
bit more specific.

00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:35.188
When I walk into average
department in the country,

00:48:35.188 --> 00:48:36.330
would I observe--

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:37.865
what's the extent
I would see it?

00:48:37.865 --> 00:48:40.360
Are there really
few bad departments?

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.197
Most of them are?

00:48:41.197 --> 00:48:44.060
I'm using term
bad loosely, here.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.359
BARRY FRIEDMAN: Yeah, I get it.

00:48:46.359 --> 00:48:47.400
What's that distribution?

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.598
Are we trying to fix
few localized problems,

00:48:50.598 --> 00:48:52.837
or is it universally
you pretty much

00:48:52.837 --> 00:48:54.494
have to fix the whole system?

00:48:54.494 --> 00:48:55.470
What's the--

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:56.900
DEBORAH JACOBS: I'm going to
answer a little bit similarly--

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.110
AUDIENCE: And it's subjective,
I understand very--

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:58.670
DEBORAH JACOBS: Yeah.

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.169
So one thing I would
say is, I don't

00:49:00.169 --> 00:49:02.960
think there are bad apples, I
think there are bad orchards.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.660
And what makes up the orchard
are some of the things

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.922
that Barry mentioned--

00:49:07.922 --> 00:49:09.380
what kind of policies
are in place?

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.830
What kind of
training is in place?

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:13.250
And all those things contribute
to the ultimate thing,

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.120
which is the culture.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.580
What is the culture
of the department?

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:24.440
And so for the most part, I
think that police departments

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.640
that have not had the benefit of
the sunlight shining upon them,

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.580
whether through litigation,
the DOJ, civilian oversight,

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:32.960
whatever it might be--

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.300
I think most of them
are problematic.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.700
Not because they've done
something bad already,

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.300
but because they don't have the
policies and training in place

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.430
to make sure it doesn't happen.

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.950
And when a shooting
happens, they'll

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.995
land in-- so one of the issues
that [? Yves ?] and I just

00:49:48.995 --> 00:49:52.940
talked about a little
earlier, on October 21, 2016,

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.480
a woman was killed by King
County sheriff's deputies

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.880
on the Muckleshoot
Indian Reservation.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.470
They were-- it was
a wellness call.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.370
She was suicidal, and they were
coming in response to that.

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:05.190
And things went terribly wrong.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.965
There was going to be
an inquest in Kent.

00:50:06.965 --> 00:50:08.445
It starts May 22.

00:50:08.445 --> 00:50:10.820
And what they're going to do--
the purpose of an inquest,

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.800
which is used very
few jurisdictions,

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.500
but King County is one of
them, is to get the truth out

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.100
under oath.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.380
What happened?

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.330
But citizens find that
process very dissatisfying

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:23.816
because they get out what
happened, and then what next?

00:50:23.816 --> 00:50:25.190
But as they look
at that, they're

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:28.380
going to look--
was it justifiable?

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.790
But the lens we need to
have is, was it preventable?

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:34.350
And so when I look at a
department, is it good,

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:35.150
is it bad?

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.010
What policies and
training do they

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:40.155
have in place to prevent the
most common kinds of tragedies?

00:50:40.155 --> 00:50:42.530
And I would posit-- and I
don't have the numbers on this,

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:46.730
but that the mental health or
behavioral health crises stuff

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:49.790
is the key place where we
need to be focusing resources.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.910
Because that is such a breadth
of what they deal with.

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:54.990
Also related to some
comments you made,

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:57.900
I want to say that we as
a society need to decide--

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.220
do we want police to
enforce minor things?

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.740
Do we want them to stop Michael
Brown for crossing-- walking

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:04.989
down the middle of the street?

00:51:04.989 --> 00:51:06.710
Sandra Bland for her
broken taillight?

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:09.800
Eric Garner for doing
whatever he was doing,

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.270
hanging out on the streets?

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.830
My answer is no.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:14.241
I think we have
over-enforcement.

00:51:14.241 --> 00:51:16.490
But then what happens to
those quality of life things?

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:17.690
How do we address those?

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:21.060
Because we do care
about them, we all do.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.090
We have to come up
with other systems.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.340
And we can't keep
recruiting people

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:29.330
to be armed cops jumping
out of helicopters when

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:32.080
actually they're social
workers, that's what the job is.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.040
So rethinking the
job description

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.450
seems critically
important to me.

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:38.030
And then hiring on that basis,
and having the community

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.722
understand that what
you don't want enforced,

00:51:40.722 --> 00:51:42.680
we're going to have to
find another answer for,

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.770
whether it's something
you lobby for in Olympia,

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:48.300
or something that you
implement as a community.

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.816
But a lot of that rests with us.

00:51:49.816 --> 00:51:51.440
We've put these
problems at their feet,

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.730
and they're not trained or
equipped to deal with them.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:54.770
BARRY FRIEDMAN: I'm going to
give you just a slightly more

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:56.550
precise answer
because I appreciate

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:57.800
the precision of the question.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.510
So it's kind of remarkable.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:01.580
So the NYPD has about
35,000 officers.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.820
There are plenty of departments
that have one or two officers.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.970
I think the median in
the country of the 18,000

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.560
departments is 10 officers.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.490
So it's quite a distribution.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.800
What surprises you when
you get into policing

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:20.510
is how it's kind of like
you're walking into the past,

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.460
and how things
haven't moved along.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.200
And so again, I don't
think they're bad.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.420
They're not modernized.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.350
There's been nothing
to cause modernization.

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:30.530
And to the contrary,
what happens is,

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:34.100
we'll starve departments
for cash sometimes,

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.050
or it's just used in bad ways.

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:40.280
And here's another thing, this
is a money-making thing here

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:40.800
at Google.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.640
So there's a lot of talk
about transparency and data,

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.660
and we don't have
data on policing.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.260
So it's hard to have data
on 18,000 separate entities.

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.222
That's tough to do.

00:52:50.222 --> 00:52:51.180
But one of the reason--

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.400
so the story we
tell is-- well, we

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.270
don't have data
because the police

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.900
don't want to give it up.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.330
I tell that story in the
first few pages of my book.

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:58.040
I believe that to be true.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.940
But a lot of it is just
an embarrassment of data

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.540
in the sense of, they don't--

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.340
we decided that we
were curious about stop

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.260
data, demographic stop data.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.610
And where would we get it?

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:09.250
Well, there are some
departments under court order,

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:10.850
so we'll just call them up
and see if they'll share it,

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:12.050
or they're supposed to share it.

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:13.280
We literally called
up some departments,

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.988
and they said, yeah,
we'll get it to you.

00:53:14.988 --> 00:53:16.025
What's your fax number?

00:53:16.025 --> 00:53:18.950
And they're ready to fax over
their sheet of their figures.

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:20.990
And so I actually
think that we'd

00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:24.320
have so much more policing data
if we had the tools developed

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.670
to collect the data.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:27.950
And I think there's a real
financial opportunity here,

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.783
which is that there are
18,000 departments--

00:53:29.783 --> 00:53:32.030
and I think they would use
many similar platforms,

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:33.770
and then we would
have unified data.

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:36.020
But it's really a--

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.580
I mean, there are
some bad apples,

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:38.930
but that's not the right story.

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:43.721
It's just where
modernization didn't happen.

00:53:43.721 --> 00:53:44.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:46.241
BARRY FRIEDMAN: Thank you.

00:53:46.241 --> 00:53:47.780
You want to stop us now.

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.100
Stop us before we kill again.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:49.865
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:49.865 --> 00:53:51.490
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.115
BARRY FRIEDMAN: Thank
you guys, really.

00:53:53.115 --> 00:53:54.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:54.830
Thank

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:56.380
you.
