00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:13.663
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:15.061
It's 1816.

00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:17.973
A 35-year-old doctor by the name
of RenÃ© Laennec

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:20.173
is walking through Paris.

00:00:20.173 --> 00:00:23.803
He pauses to watch as two children
signal to each other

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:27.273
across a long piece of wooden board.

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:29.613
One child holds the board to her ear.

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:31.333
The other scratches the opposite end

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:36.673
sending the amplified sound
down the length of wood.

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:42.185
Later, Laennec is called to assess 
a young woman with a heart condition.

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:45.144
The patient is purportedly quite 
well developed

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.264
and Laennec expresses some hesitation

00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:51.494
in pressing his ear directly 
against her chest.

00:00:51.494 --> 00:00:53.454
Remembering the children with the board,

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:56.875
Laennec, in a moment of vision 
and dignity,

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.372
tightly rolls a sheet of paper

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:01.553
and places one end to his ear

00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:06.304
and one end over the young 
woman's heaving bosom.

00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:10.593
He is delighted by 
the clarity of the sound.

00:01:10.593 --> 00:01:14.405
Laennec spends the next three years
developing and testing various materials

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:15.766
and mechanisms

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:20.165
before settling on a hollow wooden tube
with detachable plug.

00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:21.963
His device becomes the forerunner

00:01:21.963 --> 00:01:26.255
to the metal, plastic, and rubber
stethoscope we still use today.
