00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:04.066
Where you are going is
just as important as how

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.433
you plan to get there.

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:07.400
As we look forward
to new frontiers

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.333
here on Earth and beyond,
places where resources may be

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:14.066
scarce or non-existent, we
need to look for new ways

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.367
to carry ourselves
beyond the horizon, ways

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:19.934
like sailing on currents
of air, drawing energy

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:21.400
from the rays of the sun.

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:26.233
BERTRAND PICCARD,
MD: Everything I

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:29.100
do is the example I
received from my grandfather

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.667
and my father.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.033
My grandfather made the first
flight in the stratosphere.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.834
Actually, he was the first man
to witness with his own eyes

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.900
the curvature of the Earth.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.700
My father went to the bottom
of the Mariana Trench,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.433
11 kilometers down, the
deepest spot in the ocean.

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.300
I thought it was
normal to explore.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.800
And for a long time,
the exploration

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.033
was about discovering new
geographical territories.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:57.433
And I believe that
now, exploration

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.166
has a role to play if we
want to make a better world.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.800
ANDRE BORSCHBERG:
And 30 years ago, we

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.333
had this idea to fly around the
world without the dependence

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.867
on fossil energy.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:09.800
They told us it was impossible.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.600
So that was the starting point.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.934
BERTRAND PICCARD,
MD: Solar Impulse

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:16.166
is a feat of exploration.

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.734
It's a scientific adventure.

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:23.800
The goal was to demonstrate
how you can use solar energy

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.667
to fly around the world.

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:28.333
ANDRE BORSCHBERG: It
was not possible to take

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.900
an existing airplane, and
to glue some solar cells.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.233
It would never work.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.033
So we had to rethink
this airplane

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:35.767
completely from scratch.

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:39.367
The conclusion was to make
an airplane the size of a 747

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:41.233
with the weight of a car--

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:45.800
the only airplane today
which can fly almost forever.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.500
BERTRAND PICCARD, MD:
And these technologies

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.200
can be used everywhere,
not just in our airplane.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.500
And this moment
of rupture, where

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.000
you left behind what you know,
and enter into the unknown--

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.667
it's the leap of faith.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.233
In 2016, Solar Impulse
became the first aircraft

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:18.200
in aviation history
to circumnavigate

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.767
the globe with no fuel.

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:22.433
BERTRAND PICCARD, MD:
If you want exploration,

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.300
very often you need to
get out of the system,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.500
because the system is paralyzed
by common assumptions.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.000
It's not the people
selling candles

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.633
who invented the light bulb.

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:45.433
We succeeded to use solar
energy to fly around the world.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:51.900
It's interesting to see the
difference between conquering

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.500
and exploring.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.300
When you want to conquer,
it's to have more.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.300
When you want to explore,
it's to know more.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.633
The future will
be very different.

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:10.166
So you need an
explorer's mild if you

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:11.700
want to succeed in the future.
