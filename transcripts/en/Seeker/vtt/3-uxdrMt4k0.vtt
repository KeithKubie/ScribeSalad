This episode of Dnews is brought to you by
BASF.

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.310
Does your garbage can runneth over?

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.240
Consider composting!

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.969
--
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.580
find yourself with more garbage than you know
what to do with, it might be time to consider

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.580
composting.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.480
I live in San Francisco, which is currently
the greenest city in the United States.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.640
A while back, the city announced a goal to
achieve zero waste by the year 2020.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.980
And by waste, they're referring to landfill
waste.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.320
So composting is crucial here.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.480
Every resident gets a free compost bin - but
for people outside of San Francisco, it's

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.170
not quite as easy.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.190
Some cities charge you for bins, others don't
even offer them - which sucks.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.079
But, that's okay - because it's super easy
to do yourself - and it's great for the environment.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.339
So what is compost?

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.519
In a nutshell, it's a collection of organic
waste - aka food and plants - that decomposes

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.540
over several months, and eventually turns
into "humus" - which is an extremely nutrient-rich

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.540
soil.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.479
What's special about it, is that in addition
to eliminating unnecessary landfill waste

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.540
- the soil it produces can also be used as
an organic fertilizer for your home garden.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.670
So all composting requires three basic ingredients.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.960
You need water, and you need an equal amount
of browns and greens.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.030
Browns: tree matter - dead leaves, branches,
twigs, sawdust

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.530
Greens: typically wet - grass clippings, vegetable
waste, fruit scraps, coffee grounds, etc

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.200
You don't wanna put any meat, dairy, or bread
items in your compost, because those will

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.710
rot and attract pests.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.990
Also, it's recommended you do this outdoors.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.200
If you live in an apartment, or don't have
a backyard- you CAN do it indoors, but it's

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.560
a little bit trickier, and it needs more maintenance.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.280
So for the purposes of this video, I will
show you how to do it outside.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.830
First things first - you wanna select a container
for your compost, and place it in a grassy,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.530
relatively shaded part of your yard.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.140
If you're handy you can build a container
yourself - or you can buy one from any home

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.900
&amp; garden store - just make sure it's the right
size.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.490
You want it to fit everything you have, but
not be too big - and you want your compost

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.409
heap to be touching the ground, so make sure
whatever container you use doesn't have a

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.409
bottom on it.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.129
You'll wanna start by laying a few inches
of twigs or straw at the bottom, to help aerate

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.129
the pile.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.689
And then, you can start adding waste.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:20.969
The biggest rule to remember when composting,
is that you want an equal balance of nitrogen,

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.409
carbon, water, and air.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.739
Nitrogen is found in those greens I listed
earlier, and Carbon is found in the browns.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.189
So equal amounts green and brown.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.379
You'll wanna chop up any big chunks of material
before putting them in - and it's also important

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.099
to avoid any highly processed foods, since
those'll take longer to break down.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.219
But generally speaking, as long as you maintain
that balance of materials, the compost will

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.159
naturally begin to attract all of those organisms
that eventually break it down.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.769
Once you've set everything up and added your
waste, it's pretty hands off from there.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.359
If you're gonna be adding new scraps regularly,
I suggest burying them in the center of the

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.359
pile.

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.140
That will naturally aerate all of it, which
is something you wanna be doing every week

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.140
anyway.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.310
If you notice your pile is getting too dry,
just water it a bit.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.889
And if it's super hot or rainy outside - it
might also help to cover it with something,

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.879
to maintain the right balance of moisture.

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.540
After a few months, your compost should be
ready to use.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.689
You'll know when it turns a nice dark brown
color, develops an earthy smell, and is warm

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.629
to the touch - which is a product of the microbes
living inside.

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.170
And at this point, you can go ahead and mix
the compost soil into your garden.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.620
Just remember this should be used as an additive
and not as the sole source of soil in your

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.620
garden.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.349
That could turn out very poorly.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:04:07.309
If you know of any other ways to "go green"
on the cheap, hit us up on 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:15.110
Twitter at @Dnews and let us know.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.340
Otherwise, happy composting!
