Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on is bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, January 1st, 2018 oh my God. It's a new year. A new with the new year comes hopes in jeans for a better world and God wants us to sit there and try to make it a better world. Well, you should probably start with yourself. Friends have seen those people late night trying to tell you how to make it a better world,

Speaker 2:          00:00:35       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       or somebody writes a song about it, make it a better place for you and for me and the plumber down the street, right?

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       It's very difficult. The older you get to listen to those songs going like, all right, so,

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Not only are you not going to make the world a better place, you're going to write some cheese ball fucking song and make money off the fact that people want to make it a better place. You're going to give some fucking stupid pop culture psychology, right? Pop Psychology. Is that what you're going to throw out? I don't know what the fuck it is. It's like after nine 11 when that country guy wrote that song, you know, Uncle Sam's Buda, Buda, Buda, and you're right. It's like, how did he like, like that wasn't going to be a giant hit. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       I dunno what I'm talking about. All I could tell you is I'm doing this Monday morning podcast on Tuesday, uh, because I was like, well, what do I do? Do I do it? Do I do it the night before I go to the Rose Bowl? And then by the time I tell you the Rosebowl stories, it's like four days old, or do I just go to the rose bowl and do it a little late? I decided on the ladder. All right. And I apologize to any, I dunno, whatever fucking group, you know what I'm hoping in 20 2018 happens, I just hope that people start standing up to all of this fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       the amount of people being offended, you know, it's not that you get offended, it's the level of coverage that it gets compared to shit that really is way, way, way more devastating to realize. By the way, you know what's really was bugging me, you know, and there was all those hurricanes and everybody, everybody sending fucking money out and all alleged shit, right? You gotta help all these people in Houston guy to help all these people in Florida. Hey, where the fuck were you guys? Wouldn't the Hollywood hills were on fire? Ha, I didn't see any fucking benefits for fucking, what's his name? Ralph Nader. What's the fucking guys name? Who Owns Fox? Whatever the fuck his name is. Will that poor bastards mansion was catching on fire? Did any of you fucking people floating on a mattress, a Houston a few months ago? Rub a couple of nickels together and send it to him. Make some teary eyed videos. I just kind of seems like it's a one way street here. The fuck is the guy's name alone is Fox. Is it Ralph? It's one of those fucking names where you see like, you know, you know, chicks didn't take him seriously in high school and then all of a sudden he owns like the biggest network ever. And all those women there, I should've fucked Ralph.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       Why did I have to fuck to the quarterback?

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       Baker, mid fucking man's field, whatever the fuck his name is. The guy won the Heisman, the hell's his name. Baker Mayfield. Boom, boom, boom, boom. [inaudible] sorry. That was my bad. Curtis may feel when I pull a pass to that guy was, huh? If I could sing and all these great songs, he's doing a Goddamn cake and the literally the lighting falls down on them and breaks his fucking neck. I mean, how, how did he continue to write music? I don't know how the fuck is at some people. I don't know. I hate to say this. I know this about myself at that ever fucking happened to me. I would just be yelling, kill me to everybody who came walking into the room. We're going to start your rehab. Kill me, kill me. Give me a fucking something. I'm not strong enough to get through this.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       Jesus. This is dark. Sorry. Whatever. That's what happens when you just fucking start running. You Yap. All of a sudden this happens. Okay. So I'd like to apologize to all Curtis Mayfield fence and anybody who stubbed their toe. Speaking of which I'm at the fucking I co I cooked up a goddamn store this weekend. I went out strong. All right. So the great j law had Rosebowl tailgate legend Jason Law had he fucking, uh, he goes to put together the menu, right? And he does, doesn't go, we're doing burgers, we're doing dogs. He just, he doesn't do that horse shit. J fucking analyze like bill Belicheck. He fucking looks okay. Oklahoma is playing George's planes. The next thing you know, he's like, well, in Oklahoma, you know, they do this tri tip something or other. So he gets that going. I'd tell him, Hey, you want me make a pie this year? Goes, yeah, why don't you make a Peach Pie for Georgia? And He ties this whole fucking Oklahoma Georgia thing together was incredible. So I'd never made a peach pie. Right. And I know peaches or out of season. So I'm like, why am I going to go down there and buy some fucking out of season piece to some poor fucking had to pick off of what used to be his own property down in Costa Rica, whatever the fuck they do. However they do the the fruit nowadays.

Speaker 2:          00:06:07       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       I fucking, I say, I said, fuck it man. I'll go down getting them canned peaches. I'm going to get some goddamn canned peaches. So I got some canned peaches.

Speaker 2:          00:06:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       Pick the fucking recipe off the Internet. And this is what I found with recipes on the Internet. Okay? They're going to get it to you so it tastes really good, but they're not going to, they're not going to give you the recipe or it tastes great. So what they're gonna do is they're going to, you don't remember that guy. I'm going to bring it up a notch. Bam. And he'd be screaming and yelling. He had that fucking band, Emeril lagasse right about how he used to take it up a notch. Do what they do on the Internet is every fucking recipe. They take it down a notch, take it down a notch, and then they fucking remove something. They take something out, some little specials, special spice. So anytime you make an a fucking pie, here's it's a little sage advice for you. All right? It's going to be the usual. Okay? If you're doing some sort of fruit there, it's going to be basically a quarter cup of sugar. I mean quarter cup of flour and like a cup of sugar. And then there's going to be cinnamon, Nutmeg, uh, possibly vanilla, I dunno, some sort of bullshit and they're going to see 80 teeth, Mooney the and like a teaspoon of that. Fuck that fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       All right. They say eighth of a teaspoon taken. Nice. Helping of it with the eighth of a teaspoon. That's what I do at Bam. Throw that shit. Now what do you want? A teaspoon? I'll give you a teaspoon and a quarter. Maybe a teaspoon and a half if I'm feeling crazy. Right. You just kind of bring the levels up on everything and then you think, what else would they have on their, you know, they probably, you know, squeeze a little lime on the peaches, you know, before they fucking do all of this shit, right?

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       Maybe a little vanilla in there. And then you always got to throw like, you know, a little bit of butter in there to mix all of that shit together. Then you taste it. You throw a little more sugar on top, you bring everything up. That's what I did. And uh, I gotta tell you my gut rave reviews on a peach pie. Who Knew, who knew? You know, people, you know, if you don't try to explore the limits of your talents, you'll never truly find out how great your life could be. So I made a peach pie. I made a practice one with Nia and it was a deal I didn't have a lot of times. So I actually went to the store and bought a store, bought frozen pie on the bottom, sec religious, and then I made a homemade one for on top, you know, cut my work in half.

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       And then there was this all this weirdness where the one on the bottom was kind of done, but the one on top was, so I took it out and, uh, you Nia took one bite of it and just goes [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] does that shit. And I knew she was right, but I also got mad at her, you know what I mean? Cause I'm lazy. I didn't want to go back, so I fucking egg wash the Goddamn pie because I forgot to do that. Sprinkled some sugar on it, threw it back in. Then it was better than I made a decent pie. But then I brought all the levels up and the one that I did to the rose bowl fucking crushed, or maybe people would just be nice. I don't know. Um, I also made a quiche Lorraine.

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       I've always wanted to make a quiche. I mean, who doesn't like eggs? Who does it like Pie Emmy right there. You've got both things going on. This is breakfast and dessert all at the same fucking time. And uh, I go to make this thing and of course knee is all over me looking at this, looking at that, look at it. This, I fucking stick to Kesha in there. All right. Do the whole damn thing. I fucking 45 minutes in. You know, I'd give it a little poke with the tongs. It still looks jelly as hell. So I leave it in for another 10 minutes and then it looks pretty much solid and I'm getting nervous dot. I'm going to burn it. So I take it out, I let it cool off a couple of hours later, I cut into it. It looks a little runny, but I'm too hungry so I don't give a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       So I'm eating it. It's clearly needs to go back into the oven for 10 minutes, but it's fucking delicious. So I get to try this. I think it needs to be, you know, I think it needs to go back to the oven maybe for 10 minutes. And she just cuts in and she goes, Ooh. And then eats and goes [inaudible] [inaudible] and I just went, you know what? Fuck you. And she's like, well, I'm just being honest. I'm like, I know. Yeah, I know. I just want it, but it still tastes good, right? She goes, yeah, but it's running. His shit needs to go back in the oven. I'm like, well, he could have said it tasted good first.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       And she stormed out of the room and then I was like, I'll come on honey, come on. I'm sorry. Sorry, I won't be like this in 2018 so I put it back in the oven for like another 10 minutes. Actually, Nia did, she finished the thing off and it, it tasted fucking delicious. And then before the fucking rose bowl, um, the night before, I'm thinking, all right, [inaudible] is going to be making his classic fucking a breakfast sandwich, which is basically a English muffin. He puts a little Havara, ate cheese on one side and then he has his avocado spread. He does on the other side. Then he cooks this fucking egg to absolute perfection where it's not too runny. It's not over hard. It's just perfect. Not Quite over meeting, uh, medium. It sounded like a medium rare. So when you bite into it, the egg yolk oozes out, but it doesn't fall out of the sandwich and all of that shit. Right. And then also he, he had marinated this, this tri tip that he put on top of that and it was the best fucking eggs. It was such a good egg sandwich. I only had one cause he goes, you want to have another one? It's like, no, I don't want to kill it. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       Yeah. And the night before I had made these hash browns, you know, the thing about it is, is you don't want to make the fucking things, but you also don't want the things to turn all brown and Shit. So I actually did the whole mix and then put it in a fucking Ziploc bag in squished all the air out of it. I possibly could stuck it in the fridge and it was fine. I cooked those fuckers up on the side. At that point I was a little shit face. I think I overdid it. That's right. I was already drunk before breakfast even came out.

Speaker 3:          00:12:35       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       We had already loaded up the truck. We put the game changer in there. The game changer. Who by the way? All right. The game changer is a, is a flat top griddle with four burners. All right. In the propane gas, I'm telling you right. That's what the fuck you want to bring to a cookout. That thing, it's just, you never have to worry about your fire going out. There's not like, there's not all of this pressure. There's none of that shit. You just turn that fucking thing on. Jay's just like a short order cook. I've never had the last two years I've never seen him so relaxed at a cookout because before you know, we had a Hibachi that's way down here. We had another one that was up on its legs. This guy is going, he's doing like fucking 400 squats an hour trying to cook everything, making sure as fire doesn't go out time and shit. And um, and he cooks the whole time. It's like he's cooking one thing. He cooks a breakfast and he cooked something in the middle, then he cooks the dinner. So he was always having to add shit and calls. And all that means is over the course of like six hours. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       So the flat top grill that j law had dubbed the game changer. Um, he was just crushing it all day. And um, I had gotten these things cause this was our 10th, um, Rosebowl in a row. And anybody who's married knows that your 10 year thing is 10 and not only do they know that the, you know, 10 the 10 anniversary, you, there's no way you can go out and buy something made out of tin for your wife only and she's going to be happy with that unless you met an absolute sweetheart who doesn't mind being broke or it doesn't mind that she married a cheek. Fuck one of the other. Anyways, so I went out and I got these flasks made up for me and Bartner cause we, we were the original guys who was just the two, just the two of us the first year.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       So I got a giant Roman numeral 10, like the Superbowl engraved on the front and on the back I just had Joe Barton, Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend. And then I did like the American Express, the members sense and had oh nine and um, next year law had gets his in a two years. Feminists gets his, although I have to correct you cause I already had a made up and I thought that they both came in 2010. Um, anyways, so I'm out there throwing the football around. I've got some booze in me, right? I smoked a little weed, which I never do, but I'm just trying to lay off the bows. And uh, this is why I don't smoke weed is because you know, with booze, if you reach for a bottle of vodka, you know, okay. You know basically what the punch to the face is going to be. Or if you grab a beer, you know what that's going to be. You grabbed some wine, you know what that's going to be when someone goes, hey, you want to take a hit of this choice? You don't know what the fuck it is. Is that the, is it that shit that just kind of makes you feel like, hey man, like everything's gonna be alright man. Or is it going to have you just fucking staring at a Goddamn tree?

Speaker 2:          00:15:52       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       So I, you know, I dunno what, what are you supposed to do? Just take one hit and then stand there and wait for your face to start melting and be like, oh, well it didn't. This is why I'm done with fucking weed too.

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       So I take a fucking hit. I don't feel anything. I'm like, oh, this must be the, the, the light one. So then I go back and in about two, three times and exceed, you know, I'm telling everybody at the Tailgate, I go, hey man, listen. I know I'm really high right now, but look at that fucking tree. Isn't that fuck it. That tree is fucking a mess. Like some shit out of a horror movie. Look at that. Look at the way it's like bent like that, and they're just laughing at me and I am so at peace that I don't care that I'm actually La. I don't give a fuck that they're laughing at me. I'm just happy. That point that I'm bringing them joy is I make a complete fool of myself. Um, and I'm drinking from the flask and then Jay throws a burger on. We've got this grass fed fucking grass fed fucking meet dude. I fucking, it might've been the best burger I ever had, but also I was so high, I was just talking to people about this fucking tree, which felt like an intense minute. So, you know, it was like, at least probably what, like 11 minutes. Um, I ate at Burger, it was fucking amazing. And, uh, then I went over to a chair. I sat down and I passed out for like two hours.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       It, Jay was making these fucking meatball subs on a Brioche Bun. And I completely, I the last like four or five years in a row, I have missed the main course. And by the way, Americans call it an inmate, call it a main course, don't call it the entree. Alright? In French entree means to enter it. That's actually the beginning of the meal in somewhere across the fucking ocean in the scurvy and the fucking slavery and the indentured servitude. However, whatever distracted us, we fucked that up. Entree means to enter. That's the beginning. Okay. So just say the main course and for the main core cell had this, uh, what do you have for entrees? Um, so I missed that. I woke up and, uh, I ended up, I tried the pie with the Alamo. It was fucking delicious. Everybody loved it. And at that point I was kind of fucking sober because I was actually way more high than I was shit faced. And, um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:33       I didn't even smoke a cigar and I went into the, I went into the game and, uh, I just started, anytime a vendor came by just started crushing waters, I was already on the wagon. That's how fucked up I got at the tailgate. Like, you know, you know, like when you're still legally drunk and you're already back on the what you're telling people, I'm on the wagon as you have like literally they could let your breath on fire. Um, that's, that's what, you know, you went to hard. I don't really have any fucking stories about the tailgate cause I barely remember it. Um, other than it was fucking awesome. I do remember I was drinking, uh, uh, millers. I was drinking out of that flask. I had, you know, once a year a mill. I had Miller and Miller lite. Miller lite comes back with their old school, less filling tastes. Great bottle. So I add a couple of those. Um, I threw the football around lefty. I vaguely remember that. Oh. And then somebody at the tailgate told me a fucking story about how Garappolo ended up on the fucking 40 niners. Evidently the Cleveland browns were interested in getting him, but bill Belicheck still holds a grudge against them for him, for his time, you know, 1995 when he was coaching at which I believe he was also with fucking, what's his face? Nick Saban there.

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       So he's like, fuck that. And he calls up to 49 is, he goes, give me a second round draft pick. We'll give you a grappler. How fucking nuts as a, I've wrote a couple of those stories recently. Like, do you know the Celtics got into a position to g to get Bill Russell? This is a story that was told to me. Sit down, gather around and listen to this tale. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:30       the Celtics had too good of a year to be in a position to draft Bill Russell. So radar back makes a bunch of fucking moves to get all the way up to number two. Alright. But the problem is is the Rochester royals is some shit head number one. There was nothing he could do to get them to not, you know, to give up the number one pick and everybody was going to take Bill Russell. He was just clearly the best guy. So the Boston got it, had the fucking ice capades every year and they used to make a bunch of money off that. Now you, I know a lot of you fucking millennials out there like the ice capades bunch of people twirling around, dress on the ice, right? Skating around dress like fucking Yogi and booboo bear. Why the fuck would I go see that bullshit? Well, it was before the Internet, the one you had a little black and white fucking TV, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       The picture was always jumping. This was just some exciting shit. There wasn't a teddy bar or fucking free internet porn. Every once in awhile, you know, once a year, these beautiful fucking goddess women would come in, what their shapely thighs and he could sit there and look at them and pretend you were into the yard and just sat right next to your wife. You could fuck it. You know, look at some games over there, right? So would, it would always sell out. So the Rochester royals were hurting for money. So red our back called up the ice capade guy. He goes, Hey, can you do me a fucking solid? Can you fucking get the ice capades can you guarantee that you'll do a couple of dates out there for these fucking guys? He said, absolutely I will. So he called them up as it, listen, I'll get you to give me the number one pick. I gave you the fucking ice capades for a week. You make all this goddamn money in the miser that owned the team said, you know what, I'll take that deal. I will say, forget Bill Russell. So Dorothy Hamill can come in or Peggy Fleming, whoever the fuck it was back there.

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       I Dunno way back then. It was probably some woman named Ethel and she was considered hot, right? Bethel McGuire in Hazel said, Gorski or come and skate. Oh my God, she's so fucking hot. Right. Years later they wrote on the golden girls, but back then they were a hot piece of ass. Now I know I skipped over a lot of fucking details, so you should probably listen to the Bill Simmons podcast, right? To figure out what really happened. But that's what was told to me. And you know what, God damn and I'm sticking with it. I'm fucking sticking with that story. So anyways, all Billie, no fun. I'm not going a bunch of days again, but like, I'm just like, uh, I'm done. All right. I came off the wagon on December 26th and now it's January 2nd and I'm right back on. I had, I had a hell of a week. One day I didn't drink. All right. That was the 28th. December 20th. So six out of the last seven days I drank. Uh, I don't like how I feel. I don't like how I look. I just can't fucking do it anymore. Okay. I'm turning 50 in June. I had a great half of a century run. All right. I never really drank until I was like 17. So what am I had a good 30 year Larry Bird. Speaking of the guard, I had a nice 33 year run.

Speaker 4:          00:23:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:53       So, uh, I am now going to be that guy that picks a spot. Am I going to be that fucking dude? Maybe I'd just be that guy that has a glass of wine with dinner every once in awhile.

Speaker 4:          00:24:05       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       it's just like, just all this awkward silence between me and my wife as we sit on either end of this really long dinner table, you know, and all you hear is just me like turning the pages of the paper and you know, shaking it, you know, you can do that thing to make sure it straightens out every once in a while just being like, oh, new. Did you see down in Brazil in a really? Um, I don't know what I'm going to do, but uh, I'm, I'm just, I'm, I'm bringing the way I was bringing everything up in that recipe. I'm bringing everything down, bringing everything down.

Speaker 4:          00:24:46       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:24:48       I'm fucking, uh, back to crushing the waters on back on my diet. And I got a couple of goals this year. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       On the biggest mistakes I made in my adult life was buying 34 inch jeans after being a 32. All right, 32 best shape of my fucking life. They started getting a little tight around the fucking waste and I thought, oh, you know, you get older, you fill out, and it's like, no bill, you put on weight, you can't, why don't you just take fucking seven to 10 days to lose? I didn't, I bought the next size up jeans. Okay. And that was stupid because that just gave me this leeway to be a fat fuck. Who feels comfortable in his pants?

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       You never buy the next size up jeans after you're done growing and all that shit, you know what I mean? Unless you're a fucking bean pole, which may be, I was, so I'm back down to 33. I figure I'll stay there. So that's what I'm going to do. I got my fucking wardrobe right now. I got it. It's just like, you know, I hate going shopping. All right. And I have not bought a fucking shirt or a pair of pants in a couple of years. Kind of fucking couple of free tee shirts. I bought a Primus tee shirt at the concert I went to. But other than that, it is just, I just, you know, and I got rid of a bunch of old clothes. So I have like, I have two shirts that I wear, one of two shirts when I fucking had life. Those are my two headlining shirts and I think I have a pullover sweater and that's it.

Speaker 4:          00:26:34       And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       I don't think I give a shit.

Speaker 4:          00:26:40       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:26:42       I got to go out there, have some

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       fucking rhinestone shiny goddamn shirt. I really believe that as long as I have a fucking act that nobody's going to read really paying attention to the shirt. Right. Well now that I brought it up, you're gonna. MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:03       I Dunno. Maybe I'll buy Shannon, maybe I'll buy a fucking sweat. You know, I'm thinking, I'm thinking would be that guy that just dresses all in black. If I wasn't so fucking pasty and I wouldn't look like a floating head in hands, I would do that. But what's great about a black shirt, you can wear that like three days in a row before anybody really even notices like this motherfucker's not changing his shirt. You know, that is the genius of Malcolm young rest his soul, the greatest rhythm guitarist and rock and roll history, in my opinion.

Speaker 3:          00:27:32       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       The genius of the way that that meant dressed. The sheer amount of money that that man saved by just wearing jeans and a fucking tee shirt, right? Einstein that said Einstein Shit. That's what genius is. Do they get rid of all the white noise and they just focus on what's fucking important. I was what he did. He just was just a Allie needs pants and a shirt. I'm not going to be fucking sitting there trying to be in style. I'm going to dress timeless blue jeans and a fucking black tee shirt and I'm done. Do you ever see the left? There'd be rocked video. That's one of my favorite parts of the video when he's getting ready for the show and he takes the t shirt off and then he snaps his fingers, like he says spoiled Rockstar and they just throw him another tee shirt, the exact same color he puts it on or a slightly different color and then that's it. It's over.

Speaker 3:          00:28:35       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       Anyways, my shoulder's been doing great and then I fucked it up at the, at the, uh, the tailgate. By the way, I was throwing lefthanded doing our right, you know, making sure I was given my right shoulder arrest and everything. I hadn't felt any pain in my shoulder for days. Long story short, at the end of the end of the, uh, the tailgate, we're going to close up the table and uh, I'm on one side of the other guys on the other side and we're folding up the legs and the one was getting stubborn and where I had my fingers, it fucking slammed down on both of my fingers, right? Just wham. And I went, ah, fuck. And I pulled my arms out. I was basically reaching around the fucking table, you know, like I was given the skinniest person ever the finish who at that finishing move in wrestling where they just put you in a fucking bear hug and they would act like he was being crushed to death. I was doing that with the tables. So when I went to Yank my arms I really quickly, it was like, it was like I was throwing two elbows at the same time and I felt like fucking lightning in my right shoulder.

Speaker 1:          00:29:46       And uh, I think I went right back to square one. I don't know what the fuck I got. Do I think I'm going to do that Coby shit. Um, Robin told me about that whole stem cells shit and I just get scared of that stuff. I Dunno the way Joe Rogan is fearless and we'll read up on something and then make an informed decision before he takes a step in that direction. I just hear about something new, do not read up on it and act like an old lady who thinks the fucking sky's falling. That's the way I approach life. So I haven't done that yet. My shoulders still fucked up. Um, I might do that thing where they take your own. What I like about that fucking spinning a, your blood is it your own blood and then they shoot it back in. Right. Although I would want to watch them the whole time, you know, follow them around with my own blood to make sure they don't take like the fucking blood of a yak or a fucking chimp or some shit, whatever they, whatever the fuck did with whatever they're doing these days. Um, to try to get that thing fixed. Um, all right, let me, uh, let me read to what do I have any advertising? Um, I don't know that I do during the holidays. It's slows down. I don't have any advertising.

Speaker 4:          00:31:03       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:03       Well what do you know?

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       What do Ya know? All right, let me see here. I guess I don't have any advertise. Well fuck it. Let's continue talking. Alright, this is what else I did on my wonderful, over my wonderful holiday break. I went down to the comedy store, did it set, had a great time, and I was driving home, you know, and I'm driving along sunset just starting to fucking listen to my tunes and all of a sudden they go by this venue and I look and what do I see? I see Dave Chappelle and John Mayer are doing a show. I'm, I get the fuck Outta here. Right. So I call up a buddy of mine that books all the shows and I said, hey, what's, what's the story with this? This John Mayer, you know, come out with his band.

Speaker 4:          00:31:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       You know this Dave, go on first is John go on first, Blah Blah Blah. And he's like, no. What happens is John comes out, plays like four songs. He brings Dave out. Dave does stand up.

Speaker 4:          00:32:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       For an hour, an hour and a half. And then he brings John back out and then they just sort of riff is Dave talks about shit. John will play the music underneath. And I was like, I got to fucking see that. So, uh, me and my me and the lovely Nia, we went down there cause I never take a route on New Year's Eve because that is the original Saint Patrick's Day. Um, plus I go to the rose bowl the next day, so I need to get my sleep before I get absolutely hammered and pass out in the fucking chair for a couple of hours. Missing meatball sub. Um, so we went down there and um, just had such a great fucking night. And um, I don't think I've ever seen that. I don't think I've ever seen two people that fucking talented like did usually one genius and then surrounded by a bunch of people who would just sit in there.

Speaker 1:          00:32:58       Isn't he amazing? I'm so happy to be barely playing bass with this genius or I'm so happy to be fucking, I dunno, whatever the fuck else. I'm so happy to be in the ice capades with this twirling genius. Right. It was two of them. And when I kind of noticed about both of them is that they just, it like most genius minds sake take cut. They get rid of all the fucking white noise. Everything about every bit that Chappelle did was just like, there was no fat on it. And he got right to the fucking point. Another thing that I loved was, um,

Speaker 4:          00:33:33       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       I can't believe that I've been in this business long enough that we're like the older guys now. It always blows my mind that I'm like five years older than Dave Chappelle cause he was already a made guy when I came in. So I always look at him like he's got 10 years on me, you know, or 15. And you know, just when I watch his act, I'm like, this guy's clearly been doing this a good couple of decades longer than me and the realities, I think he's only been doing it like six years longer than I have. It's something like that. He's fucking amazing. And what I love too is just,

Speaker 4:          00:34:12       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       he's that same. Um, with all that's changed, everybody getting offended, all of this fucking crap. I, you get in trouble. He hasn't changed at all. He's just like that same guy that I saw way back in the day when I used to go to the Boston comedy club and watched them go on at like two in the morning and just start murdering at two in the fucking morning. And I remember I used to always sit there going, how the fuck do you do that? How do you get that funny at two in the morning in front of a crowd that gave up on the show like an hour ago and they're tired and they just want to go home that second he steps on stage. Boom. He just like, he just starts fucking killing. So, um, you know, days update, murdering me in the eye, like just fucking laughing, die and having a great time and I'm, and then he brings John Mayer back on.

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       I don't want to ruin the show for him because I don't know how many they going to do. But, uh, basically if Dave was up there and he would just say in like, you know, I was watching fucking Hawaii five o like John, whenever you've chief fucking rifts, it's clearly that David's just ripping, like mayor could play whatever the fuck he said. And Dave said that at one point, he goes, I don't know if you guys realize this shit, but John Mayer can play whatever he hears. And then he just started doing all this crazy shit, like make his guitar sound like a cat or a car beeping. Like it went beyond. I can play songs, like he can just do noises around the house, but it was fucking, that was fucking incredible. Um, so if you get a chance, I don't know if you get a chance to go see the show, definitely. Uh, definitely go do it. Um, all right. And what that, let me, uh, speaking of which, let me promote this, um, uh, the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit and I forgot to fucking ask Dave Chappelle if he ever wanted to come in and do it. God dammit.

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       Um, anyways. All right. Patrice O'Neal benefit is on February 20th, uh, 2018. Uh, it makes a great gift for Christmas. This is old copy. Uh, whatever. It's a great fucking benefit. Uh, we have all these amazing comedians on it and, um, what a great way to start the year by seeing an all star lineup of old comedians like myself, all the way down to new convenience that were influenced by Patrice O'Neal. By the way, I'm going to post this video once a year. I got a post. It, um, is that one when, when Patrice was watching the up and down game, just his laugh and all of that shit. I just got up once a year. I, I, I kind of watched that video once a year and um, it's Kinda been nice over the years where it became less sad for me to watch it and now it just, uh, I don't, I get it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       I just guess I got to the point in my grief, which I'll never be over him not being around, but I guess, um, I've gotten to the point with my grief where I just, I just think like, um, I like what an amazing person to have known. Um, ah, see it's still said it's always going to be sad, but can you dope. It's going to be fucking set. So I'll, I'll post that. But those of you new to the podcast, you know, as the years go by, maybe even new to Patrice, which blows my mind, but, uh, uh, I'll post that video and then you can go down a wonderful, hilarious rabbit hole of anything that fucking guy ever said. So anyways, we're doing a benefit for his loved ones that he was taken care of when he was, uh, still alive and a, all the money after we get done paying for the fucking venue, being upfront, being transparent, uh, we'll go to his loved ones.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       All right. It's on February 20th in New York City. What a Greg excuse to go to New York City. Go skating down Rockefella center. Watch a bunch of great comedians. Honor the greatest comic that I ever saw. A Patrice O'Neil. February 20th, 2018 at the New York City Center. All right, there we go. Um, moving on. Uh, did anybody watch the Celtics first? The Houston Rockets? Holy Shit. Goddamn. What a fucking game that was. James Harden, by the way, is, is fun to fucking watch. You know I love about that guy. He looks, he doesn't look like a basketball player. I look at dead guy and I go, that guy knows how to play the trumpet. Something about does it, he looks like one of those fucking like his last name should be Hargrove is some shit. And this, I dunno, somebody shorts his beard and his haircut. It's very, he looks Aba ish even though I guess he should have a giant Afro.

Speaker 1:          00:39:08       I don't know what, but I taped the game. I heard how amazing was. So I already knew the result and I watched the game and of course my fucking, my uh, my recording cut off right at the end of the game before Al Horford hit the shot. And, and uh, hard and kind of had a meltdown I guess through style. Marcus smart to the floor or some shit. I don't know what happened but I guess he got pissed. He went to little Grankowski against the bills. Um, by the way, congratulations to the buffalo bills. I was actually really pulling for you guys, um, even though you were in our division or whatever. Um, I just feel like the football gods had punished you guys enough. It was great to see you guys back. Get back in with tie rod. Tayla um, so congratulations on that. And then also can you believe the fucking NFL season is already over? How does that happen?

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       I'll tell you what else I don't understand. How it happens is I go to see that unbelievable rose bowl game I just fucking saw and I didn't even talk about the game. All right, here's my breakdown or the game. Fucking fucking, here we go. You know, this is going to be an intelligence breakdown in the game. Oklahoma's going no huddled the whole fucking first half. Georgia's Goddamn head is spinning around. They don't know what to do right before they have, they kicked an onside kick, which I get this six second slap you thinking, all right, I don't want this guy to run this ball back. We'll kick it to an up person. They'll, we'll fucking tackle them, Yada, Yada, Yada, and that'll be over. Who the fuck knew Georgia was going to come out through a quick fucking pass, get in field goal range and instead of being down by three scores, 17 points.

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       They're only down by two scores were like dumb fucking move and George is getting the Goddamn ball. All right. No, no, I'm sorry. Oklahoma got the ball. They kicked off to them. That was the thing. They were up by 17 fucking points and they would get the ball after the half. I mean they had their foot on their fucking neck. I get the onside thing. I don't fault him for that, but in the third quarter when they stopped going, no huddle, they started playing Marty ball and they're trying to bleed out the fucking, I actually get that fucking move.

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       But then Georgia scores a touchdown. Now they've scored 10 on answered. You're still trying to bleed the clock. They score another touchdown. Now they've gone 17 on answered. You still in your huddle, they score 24 fucking unanswered points to go up by seven before you finally decide out of the fucking blue to go back to no huddle. And the second they go back to no huddle, Georgia has a problem again. Bam. They score a fucking touchdown. I'm running out of sound effects cause Allie, they fumble the ball. Your return it. Now you're up by fucking seven. You've got to give it to Georgia bulldogs. They have Georgia Goddamn fucking bulldogs. Hey, they came back, tied it up, and for the first time ever in a hundred, and I don't know how many goddamn years are the fucking Rosebowl. All right. They had an overtime game and it doesn't just go to one. Over time it goes to two, two overtimes. Um, congratulations to the Georgia bulldogs, um, on an amazing victory. Uh, I don't know why I was, I was actually, even though I'm a big SCC guy, I was kind of torn. I was a little emotionally torn. I was rooting for Oklahoma for whatever fucking reason. I just decided I was going to root for them. I don't have anything against Georgia, but, um,

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       I was, uh, I was actually also on another level kind of sight to see Georgia wind because j law had, is so fucking pissed that Ohio state didn't get in and he thinks CSCC is totally fucking overrated.

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:43:22       And you know, he was arguing for the PAC 12 he was at one point he was fucking arguing. I was like, Jesus Christ Jay, it's eight o'clock, you're already fucking wine and a by the buck guides. And he said, the most innocent voice every pointed at somebody else at the tailgate. He goes, he brought it up, he put it, he went from like going and where we fucking, we beat Penn state and they'll say, he's goes, he brought it up. So I thought it was kind of funny, you know, and then Alabama also once, so both SCC teams, SCC teams that got in are now going to play for the championship. So the SEC is going to win another fucking title. And it just cracks me up that that's going to bump j law head and he just will not admit that on the Ohio state buckeyes had no fucking business last year of being one of the final four, considering they lost to Penn state.

Speaker 1:          00:44:12       And then Penn state won the title. He goes, Bill, you're not listening to what I'm saying. I'm saying that Penn State got screwed. But that's all he'll say. He will not say that Ohio state did not deserve to be in their last year despite the fact that they then went there and lost 24, seven and he's all, I'll fucking, Deshaun Watson was unbelievable. It's like, dude, he wasn't tackling guys too. You scored no points. So I feel like Ohio state this year got punished. Um, for the fucking snooze fest. They basically ate their balls last year. A wanted to get another Saturday night, eight o'clock spot at the club. They're like, no buddy, you're going to get a Wednesday. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:44:55       and I actually think that Ohio state would have done great, you know, considering when I watched their game, how their front for are all first and second round draft picks on the defensive side. Um, I actually agree with j law had, but like you don't get your cake and eat it. You don't get to suck and get in and lose by 24 points and don't even score one fucking point the year before. And then the next year when you're actually good enough to get an also get rewarded, you know? So that's my beef, that's my beef with j law here, but I still love the Getty death, so we'll get over it. Um, anyways, amazing fucking game. And um, we, we went the whole game without having an incident until the very end. I Dunno what happened. Bart. Nick was, you know, a little boost up and I think he bumped into somebody in front of us in this fucking guy who I swear to God was as old as me.

Speaker 1:          00:45:47       It starts yelling at Barton Creek and Barton. Nick is just staring at him and I'm just staring at him and he's like, I'll be a nice stop bumping you. We just fucking stare at him and I'm looking at this guy like, dude, you're as old as me and you're yelling at the human version of a fucking Kodiak bear. And the guy didn't know what she was waiting for us to respond and we didn't respond, but it was just lie had, we were all just staring at the guy and they just looked at Joe and he goes, fuck you.

Speaker 1:          00:46:18       They fucking turns around. It's like, dude, between all of us were about 225 years old. This is the first Rosebowl ever that is going into fucking over time. You want, you want to get kicked out, uh, you want to roll around in these stadium floors with you fucking, this guy wasn't even wearing true religion jeans, which puppet for Come Dad James in the last fucking 12 years. He's, he, I think he was, he was probably wearing the, you know, the Lee jeans and on the tag it just said in giant bold letters, Lee, you know, which where I came from basically meant that, you know, your family was barely, could barely afford to live in, in a blue collar town. Um, if he had the lead genes, the lead genes in the gap jeans,

Speaker 3:          00:47:09       you know.

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       Yeah. They have Levi. Yeah. I believe that's how simple life was back then. If you had Levi, that meant that your parents were actually doing well. Okay. And it before, uh, diesel jeans came in and fucked it. Just fucked it all up.

Speaker 3:          00:47:28       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       jeans were like 25, 30 bucks and I know with inflation will just say jeans for like 50 bucks. Right? Then all of a sudden diesel comes along and then like twice that and the next thing you know, that's like $200 pairs of jeans that suffocate your balls and still can't get up and over your flat ass. I don't fucking understand what, I don't understand genes. And then that tapered in down the bottom. Like you're going to do ballet and people need to see your feet, right? Like you're going to reenact the thriller video.

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       Um, I dunno. Anyways, let's read some of the fucking, the letters here over the a that I got. If I can find them. Oh, I guess I didn't copy and paste them. Did I? Where are they? All right, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:48:24       This is a very dramatic email. It says it's the name of this email is good. Bye, dear bill. I am sadly no longer a fan. It's really too bad because I was a huge fit. All right. What do you think I did? What did I say? Who did I say it about? Uh, went to see you and Paul Versey in Albany, New York. Oh, that was a great show. And I've watched every one of your specials as well as F is for family. And I'm an avid podcast listener. All right. So what he's doing now, he or she is doing is establishing that they listened to every fucking thing that I do.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       This is what everybody does when they complain. You can't just complain. You have to establish credibility. Like when people argue politics, you know, they sit there and they go, Hey, I'm a democrat. I'm for gay marriage, upper legalizing pot. But this Obama has gone too far or the other way around. You know, I'm fucking Blah, blah blah. But this Trump, this is what everybody does. All right? He goes, I'm not super religious. Oh, Gj age. You're not super religious. But I obviously said something about your God. All right, but you took it too far when you trash Jesus at anyone who believes in them. When the fuck did I do that through? Do you understand that this is unscripted? I don't remember half the Shit I said today. I mean, if you want to take it seriously, by all means, he goes, you take your shots here and there, which is tolerable. But in the 1228, 17 replayed portion of the podcast, uh, it was just too much. Oh, I gotta listen to that one. I didn't hear it the first time and I wish whomever is picking the replays had more of an inkling than to play that expert expert. As much as I wish you didn't say it. Um, well aren't you glad that they played it? So now you can know how bad a person I am. A, this probably won't matter to you because at this point you don't need me anymore.

Speaker 5:          00:50:33       Oh, come on.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       The end of the comedy hut. That being said, I bet

Speaker 5:          00:50:40       big promoter and a supporter for a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:50:45       This has to be a woman. This they're just doing, they're just going 100% guilt. I'm sure you will never read this as you probably have a screener at this point. Uh, just taking a shot. I do wish you continued success. I'll look at this and they're still going to go out as a class. This person's a class act and nothing but the best for you and the lovely Mia. It's Nia with an end. You know what? I'm a, I'm saying goodbye to you the amount of times that I said Nia on the podcast and you still don't even know my wife's name and you have the nerve to get upset with me cause I trashed the old Jay star there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:26       Why don't you, what would Jesus do? Jesus would forgive me and continue to listen to the podcast, wouldn't he? I would think. Um, anyways, uh, that being said, or being a bump up of, uh, uh, for the lovely mia and your daughter in there, uh, Boston sucks and go fuck yourself. Um, ps checkout, Gary Newman's new album, all synth, but really cool. Alright, pss, if you don't read this or if you do read this, don't use a southern accent because I'm from New York. Lol. You know what? You're going to be back. I gotta fill in. You're going to be back. Um, I love these fucking people that it's just like all the dumb shit that I say. I've trashed people that smoke weed. I trash women. I trust Jesus. I trash fucking anybody who's a Republican. Anybody who's a Democrat, all of this fucking shit. And everybody listens. And listens and listens, then all of a sudden, once you know, fucking comes into your world like I the trash above ground pools and all of a sudden I got to listen to somebody going, hi.

Speaker 5:          00:52:36       You know, just because I can't afford to take a goddamn hole in my backyard.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       You know, look at that right there. Offensive to southern people is if there's people up north that can't afford to fucking have a backhoe come in there and whatever the fuck it is that they do, right, dig into the Goddamn ground. Um, hey. You know what I mean? All right. See you draw the line of Jesus. Well, there you go. I mean, as far as my limited understanding of Jesus and what exactly it was he was trying to prove with all this party tricks with the fish and the bread over there. Um, I think he was a very forgiving person, sir. So I think if you're truly into the teachings of Jesus and you're truly strong enough spiritually, you can handle one 20 minute fucking clip from a Goddamn podcasts from a few fucking years ago. You know what the real thing is here, sir, is you need to up, okay?

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       What I'm saying is not going to infiltrate into your fucking soul and all of a sudden make you possess and have you kill your whole family. Why can't you just look at me and feel fit? Sad for me that I'm going to go to hell and that you're going to go to heaven. You're going to be on a little puffy cloud. There is. I'm burning forever, right? Why don't you just look at it that way, all right? It's not that he's leaving. It's that you know all the dumb shit that I say, all of the dumb shit that I fucking say, and then that one thing you look past everything else, all right? But whatever, you know it'd be more pouchy. God bless you. God bless you in your search. I wish you well on your search to a Jesus only positivity podcast. All right? All right. Your journey to Aa. Bear, dare Billy to Shift Drinking Albino ginge dad bod once a solid c cup now as solid eight cups or moves a lot and a mouthful. All right, me and another friend of bill w agree that you're qualifying story for AA is unfolding perfectly. All right, here we go. Um, I'm an alcoholic, so you must be an alcoholic.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       All right, I'm going to lose this guy's offense. I hate fucking Aa people. There's nothing more self involved than someone who has an addictive personality and all they think is whatever happened to them, whatever they're going through, you also have to be going through because they are the center of the fucking universe. All right, from your off the wagon on the wagon, off the wagon to your, let's try some controlled drinking. You are perfect. A material, uh, can't wait to hear about your surrender and your acknowledgement that you lack and that lack of power is your dilemma. No, Jesus Christ. Stop projecting all of your shit. You fucking loser. I fucking hate people in Aa. I really do. Not all of them, but people like this. Listen Dude, just because you are under the sink, turn your kid's birthday drinking fucking mouthwash. Don't break my balls over.

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       I don't have to go to your dumb ass fucking meeting. I've gone to some AA meetings. Do the stories you guys tell my GI is on the fucking ground. You guys make me look like a fucking fairy. Uh, he's in denial right now. The gag of gagging by dude, I'm gonna tell you something that I just did. I just went off the wagon for six days, drank like an animal yesterday in while I was drunk, effortlessly said, you know, and I'm not drinking anymore effortlessly. I didn't have to surrender and say, I have no power over this.

Speaker 3:          00:56:27       Bad, bad.

Speaker 1:          00:56:30       I don't need to go down to your dumb ass group and smoked cigarettes and eating donuts with all you guys down there with the a blown out fucking wallflower noses. All right, I'm fine. Anyways. And your discovery that there is a power greater than yourself. One Who can solve all your problems. Yeah. Or one that you can dump all your shit on. It's a great life. You could even say, even say it's a life second to none. One day at a time. Easy. Does it keep it simple, stupid. I just can't wait to hear you speak from the podium delivering a message of hope. It's not the meetings you make. It's the steps you take. Thankfully there are only 12 of them. Ah, love your biggest 32 year old blonde Nigerian fan. Um, Hey, God bless you in your sobriety. But no, all right, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:57:32       Um, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:57:35       this is how my sobriety works. I just like how I feel when I'm sober from a tall, I like how I look. I like the weight that I become. It's total vanity and there becomes a point in your life where you just, you just too fucking old to drink. It just beats the shit out of you. So, uh, thank you sir. But I don't need to go down there and surrender and you know, I'm telling you right now, if you think you're a fucking alcoholic, go to a Goddamn AA meeting. These fucking people, I swear to God, they'll tell stories where like, like they're sitting there, half their nose is hanging off their face and that just go in like, so I take some duct tape and I fucking tape my nose back onto my face. And all I'm thinking is I got to go back to the liquor store and get more booze. Man. When I got arrested for drinking and driving about 30 fucking years ago, um, I remember why I was required to go to two AA meetings and I was like, these people are out of their fucking, and every story was that they would do. And then I belted my wife in the face. I actually hit my wife over the head with our own child. And the crazy thing is, is I would say, can like, you know what, I got to go get a drink

Speaker 1:          00:58:57       and they'll look, I shouldn't be laughing at people that have that much of a fucking problem. Okay. But, um, I could tell you this, sir, I don't need to surrender to anything. All right. I know that I, there are times in my life when I drink too much and I have the ability to look at myself, say I have a problem and then fucking walk away from it. MMM. That's it. All right. And I want to tell you, y'all want you to answer me. Name one of your fucking Aa friends down there that can come off the wagon and drank like I did. You know the yesterday I drank six out of seven days. I had two drinks one day I had a beer the next day, then drink the next day, had two drinks at the John Mayer Chappelle thing, and then had two drinks the next day and then fucking got hammered at at the Rose Bowl. And now I can just be like, all right, fuck that. I'm not doing that now. That's it. I can, I can do that, sir. I'm sorry that you can't do that. I'm sorry that you need to go down there and put your arms around a budget.

Speaker 6:          01:00:10       Well, all go down together.

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       They gotta give you a little chip. Every little your little fucking cookie, you know. God bless you. I mean fucking people might lose it on this podcast. God bless you buddy. If that's what the fuck you have to do.

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       Are you one of those alcoholics too who still a fucking cunt, you know, and then blames everything on your fucking disease. Oh, sorry bro, I just got to let us shit coming up. You know, you've got that built in fucking excuse.

Speaker 3:          01:00:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       Anyways, not saying they're all like that. Cause I know a lot of cool people that are in fucking Aa, but like, um, I really think that if you're, if you're an alcoholic, that when you're drinking your life just like falls apart. It really does. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:00:57       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:00:59       I mean I wake up, hung over for flights and it sucks. And I definitely am not a casual drinker. I'm definitely a fucking binge drinker and I know that I shouldn't be doing that shit. But if I actually had a real fucking job, that's my biggest problem is I don't have a fucking job.

Speaker 6:          01:01:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:27       So like I have to tell you like when,

Speaker 3:          01:01:31       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:32       You know, when I'm like really fucking busy and I have shit to do, I don't really drink. But the thing that like right now it's fucking Tuesday, it's nine in the morning. I'm sitting here in my fucking pajamas and I could just sit here for the rest of the, for the rest of the Goddamn week. I don't have anything to do. I mean, if I wasn't so fucking responsible, patting myself on the back, I mean there's a bunch of shit that I could just put off to next week and, and I could just sit here drinking non fucking stop. So that's the problem. My problem is my fucking free time. So, um, I'm gonna I, I respect the fact that you're trying to help me. Um, my wife, my wife on the hand, uh, I've told her a bunch of times saying, I am I an alcoholic. She goes, God, Bill, you're not an alcoholic.

Speaker 1:          01:02:25       You're not a fucking alcoholic. So I would think that she would know she lives with me, but I appreciate it. Um, and all these going to say the whole time as he's in denial Elo, the Loyola bug. And Excel. You know what alcoholics, you'd like the like Madonna, Madonna always just did over the top shocking stuff, you know what I mean? And then if you'd been like Madonna, that music videos sucked and then they get to hide behind. Well all I was looking for was the reaction. It's art. Art is just, you know, you can't judge it and blah blah. No, that fucking steaks.

Speaker 7:          01:03:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       So there you go. Um, I don't know. Listen, I'm open to the idea. If I am an alcoholic, but there's no fucking way I'll ever be able to go to a meeting. There's no way I'm not going to go down there and just not fucking laugh my balls off. Listening to your, your, your fucking stories that would make Keith Richards go. Jesus Christ. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:03:22       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:24       I know a guy that fucking, he drank so much. He did a face plant, his fucking teeth. One of his teeth bucket went through his lower lip. All right. Any woke up the next day with his fucking lips looking like a goddamn duck bill. Any, any Jew immediately grabbed the fucking, you know, a 40 ouncer it put a straw in it so he could keep drinking as the alcohol. Most of it was going in his mouth. Part of it was going through the hole that was in his face.

Speaker 7:          01:04:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:02       As much as my moral is, I am, I'd be like, all right, you know what, I'm going to take a fucking year off at this point. You know, so whatever. I sir, I actually, I think that there's different degrees of abusing alcohol. I definitely abuse it. Admittedly, I'm wrong and it's definitely gotten not a control, but I'm like a habit guy. Like if I'm working out, I'm fucking working out like a maniac. If I'm sitting around and I'm eating bad food, I eat bad food like a fucking maniac, but not to the point of like someone that has addiction. Like I, I'll lead bad to the point I put on 1520 pounds. I don't have to be cut out of my house. I don't balloon up a hundred fucking pounds the way somebody who's addicted to food would.

Speaker 4:          01:04:49       All right.

Speaker 1:          01:04:52       And I'll go out and I'll go on a fucking booze binge. It'd be like, I got to knock this off. What the fuck am I doing? I got to knock this off and I'm just kind of able to do it. And uh, I feel like I have to apologize to you that I'm able to do that. I'm sorry. I look like I'm done right now. I will have no problem going.

Speaker 4:          01:05:17       I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       As long as I fucking want to go, you know, it's not like I'm never going to have a glass of wine with a great fucking meal again. But, um, I dunno, whatever. I appreciate your, uh, your concern. But, um, I am going to be sober now just out of vanity because I got this new fucking diet right. And the Dean del Ray was telling me about. And when I do that, when I, when I'm on his diet and if I just go for a fucking walk around the block with my lovely daughter, I do that a couple times a day and I'm not drinking and I'm not eating sugar or anything like that. I barely have to work out and, uh, and I, the fucking, the everything just falls off you. Um, and it's the easiest way to stay in shape and I fucking hate working out.

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       So, um, that's way more appealing to me then. Um, you know, as much fun as, as I had over the last fucking week. I mean, it's way more appealing at my age, you know, and plus I got a kid, you know, I've got to have a kid and I can't be like, fucking, I just can't do it. I just can't do it. I can't have it in my fucking life and that's it. So I don't need to go down there and do all of that bullshit. All right. I'm, I'm a comedian. All right. I don't like groups. All right, lady. Who's bad at arguing? Uh, dear Billy. Backward balls backwards. False. Uh, I'm actually a 15 year old girl. Oh, Jay z.

Speaker 1:          01:06:57       The fuck who the f Andrew, you'd try to get me in trouble here. Uh, so I guess you couldn't say really say that. I'm a lady. Oh my God, this is already creeping me out yet. But I love your podcast and listen to a 24, seven because I feel like balanced needs, oh, balance needs to be restored to the world. After all the females listening to Dr Phil and loose women have gotten a slightly fucked up view on things. Um, I respect that you're not going to let mainstream media have the only say on the truth. In other words, what you're saying is you like to hear my opinion. I'm not always right, but you'll listen to it. I appreciate that. All right. [inaudible] my whole life, the 15 years of my life, Jesus Christ, that this shit in my house said for 15 years I've been meaning to get to it. Um, your whole life is 15 years. That's incredible. Uh, my whole life I've been bad at arguing either I say the wrong thing at the wrong time or I focus on the wrong point or I'm easily manipulated by guilt trips, et cetera. Uh, whatever it is, I can never get it right or stand my ground. For example, I have this one friend who is literally three.

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       I was the literal, a literal three year old on the inside. I thought you said you were hanging out with a three year old. I was like, this is getting even more creepy. Um, I can't say shit to her without her crying. One time she wanted some of my food, but I told her that I hadn't had breakfast and couldn't share that day. She said to me, you're [inaudible], you're so mean. What the fuck is your problem? What? Yeah, you got, you get that person out of your life.

Speaker 1:          01:08:44       I just gave her some food cause I hate it when people think bad about me. But inside I was like, bitch, what? It took me like two hours to realize that she didn't even think I was mean. She just wanted the food and she knew how to get it. Oh my God. You know, something. Your thought process that it took me till I was 37 to realize that you're way ahead of the curve here. What's your realizing for the first time in your life is that this people out there that are not good people. See. So what I did was I, I, I went out into the world where you are as a 15 year old and existed as that person til about 37 before I actually started to examine human behavior.

Speaker 3:          01:09:31       And, um,

Speaker 1:          01:09:33       yeah, so what, where you are right now is when you first start to realize that there's these constant life. Um, what's going to happen is like two or three days later, or an hour later after the moment, you're going to be like, oh fuck yeah. She said Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And that cause she meant that it's cause she, she wanted x, y, and Z. Well, the more you do that, the more you're going to be able to be in the moment and you're going to catch people in the moment. And then once you're able to do it in real time, people aren't going to be able to fuck with you anymore. And then when, and then the only thing you'll have to learn how to do is the judgment. Is this worth me?

Speaker 3:          01:10:14       You know,

Speaker 1:          01:10:16       applying this skill in real time. Like yesterday, that guy who turned around and yelled, fuck you at Bart, nick and all that. There was like four of us wanting him overtime. Rosebowl not even worth engaging. We all just stared at him and then he didn't know what to do. He yelled, fuck you. And then he turned around and he felt good. He said, fuck you to four guys. We didn't do anything. He feels good in secure around his wife, you know, and nobody got kicked out. Nobody had to fight or whatever. And then there's other times when you actually say something back, somebody who's, I'll read the rest of this, but um, right out of the gate, you're being too hard on yourself, right? Most of the girls in my class are pretty weak physically and it happens to be that as a girl, I have unnaturally broad shoulders, excuse the pun, a and weigh about two pounds more than most of them. The fact is hard to ignore when you're staring at their can faces while the giggle behind their hands. I have violent tendencies, which I'm working on, but I know I can beat the shit out of them and that makes it so much harder to verbal, verbally argue.

Speaker 3:          01:11:22       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:11:22       they're much better at it than me. So even when I'm right, I lose and I always end up wanting to just uppercut, send an upper cut straight to their fucking skull.

Speaker 3:          01:11:32       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:11:35       Whatever. All right. I would love a few pointers as to what to do in an argument and how to tell them when I'm being manipulated before I start latching onto the fucked up mind game.

Speaker 3:          01:11:48       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:11:48       Of doing things. Some advice would be great. Thanks a lot and go fuck yourself. Ps, me and my sister have a huge disagreement agreement because it's my personal opinion that guys, whoever, girlfriend should still be able to go to strip clubs and have a good time without their girlfriend getting mad. My sister says that for me to say that I must have no respect for myself and we'll end up with a piece of shit guy. Jesus. Those are two extreme opinions and my right, or do I have some sort of self respect issues that I'm not aware of yet? All right, let me comment on the first fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          01:12:24       All right?

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       Kids are mean. Kids bullied, they gang up on you. You never should resort to physical violence, all right? But what she gotta do is you got to fight fire with fire. So what you have to do, all right, is nobody's perfect. So you have to find that fucking thing,

Speaker 3:          01:12:43       all right?

Speaker 1:          01:12:45       You have to find that fucking thing,

Speaker 3:          01:12:47       all right?

Speaker 1:          01:12:49       And you just get them with that,

Speaker 3:          01:12:52       all right?

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       And then they, they know will hurt their feelings, especially if they're good looking popular people. You can really fucking get to them all right? Like, here's something that I do that I learned to do after years of arguing with people after my shows. You know, if somebody came up to me and was like, Hey, let me tell you, sent it that stuff he said about where and you're gonna fucking get Gaga. And as they yelled, all of that, I used to try to argue my points going, well, hey, you know, it's just jokes. I also made fun of people in that hurricane. You didn't get offended by that. You know what I learned to dope when someone was given, when they were giving me shit, I would just go, hey, you got something between your teeth. That's what I would say. Even though they didn't.

Speaker 1:          01:13:38       And then they would be so fucking mortified, they walk away and then they'd be gone. Like you know, you know, sucking on their teeth and shit and she should just shut them the fuck up. So you need to find your version of that. Okay? So what I would do is I would really study them. All right? And what you gotta do is you just got to find something that's wrong with them. Maybe their ear lobes are too big. And I know this is very immature and this is, this is super fucking mean. And that is an adult. I shouldn't tell you to do this. Cause adults go with those people. They're not your real friends. You don't need to stoop to their level and they give you all this fucking air quote, mature advice, but you know what? That doesn't help you when you go back into the shit the next day.

Speaker 1:          01:14:20       Tell a teacher, none of that Shit fucking works. All right? Because those fucking evil fucking consequate terrible parents are going to find the time they're going to find you. So that's what I would do. All right? There's no way. One of them doesn't have a slightly crooked nose. There's no way one of them's titty. Is it a little bit bigger than the other? Or maybe they had nipples point down this something fucked up about their chin. If you know you got to fight fire with fire, if they're talking about you fucking shoulders, all right? First of all, laugh at it. Learned to laugh at yourself. All right, let's look at me. I'm an old freckled ball, redheaded count, okay? In all of those things should really end any dream that I ever had in life. But if you just roll with it, if you steer into it, and if I just be an old bald, redheaded con then, then w w what can you do to me?

Speaker 2:          01:15:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:23       You just, you got to get comfy. So I would get more comfortable with yourself. All right? And uh, I'm sure your shoulders are fine and all of that stuff. And when they make fun of your shoulders, laugh, and then I would say, yeah, my shoulders are as fucked up as your crooked Teddy's or just you somehow you laugh at your shit and then you fucking, you get them.

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       It get them. Just tell them you just go. Do you once, you know, just tell them they got bad breath. You got any, some I don't. You'll find, I wish, you know what you could have if he just could have sent me a picture of him, I would have helped you out. But then I would've gotten in trouble because you're teaching them to bully Bababababa. You know, all of these people who want to, who want to fix problems with five minutes on fucking doctor Phil, by the way, did I call it? You see that big scandal over there now granted and is sitting until proven guilty. All doctor Phil fucking bringing the guests up a notch there. All right, I punched a girl. Woe is another one. Hey Bill, like your input on a situation. Uh, I was recently, I was recently at a concert, some drunk skank accused me of stealing her friend's phone.

Speaker 1:          01:16:39       Uh, I told her you got the wrong guy, her and her fuck her. And her father friend tried to wrestle my phone away from me and I pushed them off. Then she sucker punched me in the eye, big bruise bloody I and our friend snatched my phone out of my pocket due to work there. Came up and I told them what happened. He didn't seem to believe and was clearly buddy buddy with the girls. So they go off and we're giggling around, giggling around. I don't want that. That means after a few minutes I go up to a, to a Fatso. Oh, I go up to Fatso and tell her to give me my phone back. She realized it was mine in handed it over. As I went to walk away, scag number one in a Douche bag, boyfriend accosted me again and grabbed me. I punched both of them in the face and then security escorted me out. I think I was justified to hit her in this case. What? Say you then go fuck yourself. Uh, yeah, I see. I see. I don't have a problem with any of that. I don't, no problem. Someone gets physical with you, you know, you take one punch to the eye, you're all your physically fucked up. You didn't do anything wrong. Some point you got to defend yourself. All right. God bless you. I think he showed remarkable restraint to only hit them both once.

Speaker 1:          01:18:07       That was an easy one. I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even concerned about it. Not at all. And in fact, you probably made both of them better people. Hopefully. Probably not. But you know, if I will, you know, when you get punched in the face, you know, if you're an adult, at some point you gotta be looking at yourself going like, all right, did I do something there? If you didn't, then you're like, all right, this person's an asshole and I needed to have them out of my life. But you know, if you did, you got to be that guy and that was kind of shooting my mouth off there. Right? That's what I would do. Um, all right, got two girls pregnant help. Uh, dude, I can't help you. Um, there's no help for this. Uh, I buckled down for the next fucking 18 years.

Speaker 1:          01:18:49       All right. Hello Bill. I have a big problem and I'm hoping that you and the lovely Nia can help out with it. All right, let me start by saying that I don't live in a trailer is something I'm a normal 26 year old guy. I was dating this girl and we broke up a couple months ago when we broke up. A couple of weeks later, I met this little Hottie, I started hooking up with her and then I got a call a couple of weeks ago. My Ex is three months pregnant with my child and she's keeping it. I then broke things off with the hottie. Well, guess what? I knocked her up to buddy. Ah, did you ever take a health class? Do you know how to fucking to help people get pregnant? Neither one knows the other is pregnant and I have no idea what to do. I broke things off with the Hottie to work on being there from my ex and the kid.

Speaker 1:          01:19:35       I want to be there for her and help her out with all the prenatal stuff. It'd be a great dad. Now it seems my life is not going to be that way. The other girl wants to have the baby too. I use protection with this girl, but not enough, I guess. What does that mean, dude? If you use a condom, I would get a maternity. Uh, first of all, I would make both of them subject to it. Okay. Because you broke up for a couple of months, right? Get a maternity test times to do not give either one of them a fucking dime or else, you know, in some states, the second you start paying, that kid is yours. That's the first thing I would do personally, I would do it was tell both of them you situation. The second thing I would get more, make more both of them get a fuck. Is it a maternity tests? A paternity test. I said maternity, paternity test. They go, oh, Jesus. Um, the other girl wants the other baby to blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 3:          01:20:30       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:20:33       my ex was on birth control yet I still knocked her up. If I had to be with one of them, it would be the new girl because she is hotter. I'm a pig, sue me. And we also like a lot of the same things. What should I do? I'm so sick in an exhausted of worrying about this. I just want to do the right things. Thank you. And Go fuck yourself. Well, I would tell both of them what's going on. I would get a paternity test, not a maternity tests. Get a paternity test and make sure those are your kids. And I would, if you want to be with the Hottie, be with the hottie.

Speaker 1:          01:21:06       There you go. And then I would stay in the life of the other one. That's what I would do. And I would s fucking get a vasectomy or cut up a garden hose because whatever the fuck you're using is not working. I'm all right. That's the podcast. Oh, it's a long, one hour and 20 minutes here. Happy new year to everybody. Uh, good luck to Ya. Um, I apologize to anybody in Aa or whatever the fuck it is. Um, and that's it. I'm sipping my tea, going to go eat healthy. All right. And I will go back to booze at some point if I fucking want to, cause I don't think I have a problem. All right, that's it. Uh, I'll check in on you on Thursday.
