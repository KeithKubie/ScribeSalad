00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.550
The Emoji and Colorizer Textfields have
some minor differences in behavior.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.770
For example, in the Emoji text field,

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.990
if there's text,
it clears when editing begins.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.510
So, it's not possible to edit existing
text after you switch to a different

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.890
text field.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.710
Also, the return key in the Emoji
text field doesn't hide the keyboard.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.770
The Colorizer doesn't clear
text when editing begins.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.480
So, it's possible to edit existing text.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.800
And, in the Colorizer text field,
the return key does hide the keyboard.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.260
So, given what you know about
the two delegates in the protocol,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.510
which methods do you think
the two delegates implement?
