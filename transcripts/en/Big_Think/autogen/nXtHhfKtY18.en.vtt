I think we've lived in every kind of

I think we've lived in every kind of
 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.870
I think we've lived in every kind of
society and for a lot of our existence

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880
society and for a lot of our existence
 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.330
society and for a lot of our existence
as human beings we've lived in fairly

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340
as human beings we've lived in fairly
 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.970
as human beings we've lived in fairly
egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980
egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies
 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.609
egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies
but we've also lived in very

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619
but we've also lived in very
 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.800
but we've also lived in very
hierarchical Turin ears as well so we

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810
hierarchical Turin ears as well so we
 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.019
hierarchical Turin ears as well so we
clearly can can manage to exist in both

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029
clearly can can manage to exist in both

and develop all kinds of different

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040
and develop all kinds of different
 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.770
and develop all kinds of different
societies why hierarchy seems to matter

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780
societies why hierarchy seems to matter
 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.660
societies why hierarchy seems to matter
why status differences matter so much

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670
why status differences matter so much
 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.610
why status differences matter so much
and so the gap between rich and poor

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620
and so the gap between rich and poor
 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.310
and so the gap between rich and poor
matters is because as human beings were

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320
matters is because as human beings were
 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.220
matters is because as human beings were
very sensitive to social relationships

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230
very sensitive to social relationships
 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.240
very sensitive to social relationships
you know we have an involved psychology

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250
you know we have an involved psychology
 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.770
you know we have an involved psychology
that makes us very aware of how others

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780
that makes us very aware of how others
 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.430
that makes us very aware of how others
judges if you think about it some of the

judges if you think about it some of the
 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.060
judges if you think about it some of the
most difficult things to do or the most

most difficult things to do or the most
 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.560

potentially embarrassing situations

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570
potentially embarrassing situations
 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.119
potentially embarrassing situations
we're in are those where other people

we're in are those where other people
 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.149
we're in are those where other people
can judge us negatively something rather

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159

hopefully thousands of people and they

hopefully thousands of people and they

might think I'm doing a good job or a
 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.800
might think I'm doing a good job or a
bad job and being aware of that I can

make us very feel very embarrassed be

we're looking at societies where the

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689
we're looking at societies where the
 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.810
we're looking at societies where the
social distances between people are

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820
social distances between people are
 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.350
social distances between people are
bigger as they are in more unequal

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360
bigger as they are in more unequal
 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.670
bigger as they are in more unequal
societies there's just more potential

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680
societies there's just more potential
 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.429
societies there's just more potential
for all of us to feel that we're judged

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439
for all of us to feel that we're judged
 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.590
for all of us to feel that we're judged
negatively by others and to feel that

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600
negatively by others and to feel that
 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.929
negatively by others and to feel that
our status really matters that it's

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939
our status really matters that it's
 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.740
our status really matters that it's
really important

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.920
social evaluative threat yes that's a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
social evaluative threat yes that's a
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.130
social evaluative threat yes that's a
term psychologists use and there are two

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
term psychologists use and there are two
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.440
term psychologists use and there are two
psychologists who looked at all the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
psychologists who looked at all the
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.120
psychologists who looked at all the
studies that other researchers have done

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
studies that other researchers have done
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.190
studies that other researchers have done
on what kind of stresses most reliably

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200
on what kind of stresses most reliably
 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.990
on what kind of stresses most reliably
raise our cortisol levels what kind of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
raise our cortisol levels what kind of
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330
raise our cortisol levels what kind of
stress is most reliably stress us and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
stress is most reliably stress us and
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.120
stress is most reliably stress us and
they usually do this kind of work by

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130
they usually do this kind of work by
 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.070
they usually do this kind of work by
inviting students into a laboratory and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
inviting students into a laboratory and
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.740
inviting students into a laboratory and
asking them to do unpleasant tasks they

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
asking them to do unpleasant tasks they
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.930
asking them to do unpleasant tasks they
might ask them to solve math problems or

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
might ask them to solve math problems or
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.060
might ask them to solve math problems or
to write about an unpleasant experience

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070
to write about an unpleasant experience
 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.850
to write about an unpleasant experience
or be videotaped doing something and the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
or be videotaped doing something and the
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.460
or be videotaped doing something and the
question these researchers asked work

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470
question these researchers asked work
 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.910
question these researchers asked work
which kind of stress is most reliably

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920
which kind of stress is most reliably
 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.010
which kind of stress is most reliably
raise our stress hormone levels and they

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020
raise our stress hormone levels and they
 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.440
raise our stress hormone levels and they
found it was ones which contain a social

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
found it was ones which contain a social
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.650
found it was ones which contain a social
evaluative threat so it's not so much

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660
evaluative threat so it's not so much
 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.870
evaluative threat so it's not so much
having to do math problems it's having

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
having to do math problems it's having
 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.850
having to do math problems it's having
to read out your real marks at the end

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
to read out your real marks at the end
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.380
to read out your real marks at the end
and your scores and share them with

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
and your scores and share them with
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.620
and your scores and share them with
other people it's tasks in which other

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
other people it's tasks in which other
 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.990
other people it's tasks in which other
people can judge you negatively that

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
people can judge you negatively that
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.130
people can judge you negatively that
most reliably make you feel stressed

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140
 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.320
well in our modern societies we don't

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330
well in our modern societies we don't
 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.050
well in our modern societies we don't
really need to consume more stuff for

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060
really need to consume more stuff for
 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.400
really need to consume more stuff for
basic survival we consume we shop we

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410
basic survival we consume we shop we
 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.380
basic survival we consume we shop we
want to earn more money to show our

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390
want to earn more money to show our
 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.300
want to earn more money to show our
status and so owning things that

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310
status and so owning things that
 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.460
status and so owning things that
demonstrate that you know we're keeping

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470
demonstrate that you know we're keeping
 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.270
demonstrate that you know we're keeping
up keeping up appearances and show that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280
up keeping up appearances and show that
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.699
up keeping up appearances and show that
we're a valued member of society that's

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709
we're a valued member of society that's
 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.640
we're a valued member of society that's
that's why we consume so much and in

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650
that's why we consume so much and in
 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.270
that's why we consume so much and in
more unequal societies that competition

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280
more unequal societies that competition
 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.559
more unequal societies that competition
for status is more important and so in

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569
for status is more important and so in
 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.390
for status is more important and so in
more unequal societies there is a

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400
more unequal societies there is a
 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.820
more unequal societies there is a
stronger drive towards status

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830
stronger drive towards status
 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.160
stronger drive towards status
competition and consumerism all of those

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170
competition and consumerism all of those
 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.839
competition and consumerism all of those
things matter more you know it matters

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849
things matter more you know it matters
 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.240
things matter more you know it matters
more to earn more money not because you

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250
more to earn more money not because you
 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.970
more to earn more money not because you
need more money for basic things but

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980
need more money for basic things but
 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.160
need more money for basic things but
because you need to sort of show your

because you need to sort of show your
 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.289
because you need to sort of show your
