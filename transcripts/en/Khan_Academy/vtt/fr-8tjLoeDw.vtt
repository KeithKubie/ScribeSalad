00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.240
Problem number six.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.430
Let f be defined by
f of x is equal to--

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.360
and we have two cases.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.790
When x is less than or equal
to 0, f is 1 minus 2 sine of x.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.920
When x is greater than 0,
f is e to the negative 4x.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.570
Show that f is
continuous at x equals 0.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.770
So for something to be
continuous at x equals 0,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.730
let's think about
what has to happen.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.570
So if I have a function
here-- So that is my x-axis.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.710
And let's say this is my y-axis.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.790
And we care about what
happens at x equals 0.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.690
So x equals 0 there.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.220
And let's say that
this is our function.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.009
So maybe our function maybe
looks something like this.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.550
I don't know.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.100
Well, this one in
particular probably

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.183
looks something like this.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.100
This one in particular
might look-- who knows.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.075
And then it might look
something like that.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:54.700
And the particulars
are that important.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.700
We just have to think
about what they're asking.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.780
In order for it to
be continuous here,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.740
so the limit as we
approach 0 from the left

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.750
should be equal to the
value of the function at 0.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.170
So the limit of f of x should
be equal to f of 0, which

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.210
should be equal to the
limit as we approach

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.420
from the right, which
should be equal to the limit

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.550
as we approach 0 from the right.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.650
So that should be
equal to the limit

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.080
as x approaches 0 from
the right of f of x.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.000
And the reason why this matters
is, if this wasn't the case,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.670
if f of 0 wasn't the
same as the limit,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.024
then we might have a
gap right over there.

00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:41.065
So you could have limits.

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:43.410
So you could have a
situation like this,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.500
where you have a gap
right over there.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.480
And then it looks
something like that.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.680
So the two limits from the
left and the right both exist,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.070
and the limit at that
point would exist.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.280
But if the function itself does
not equal that value there,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.610
if it equals something
else, then the function

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.880
would not be continuous.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.920
So that's why the
limit has to be

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.780
equal to the value of
the function in order

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.390
for it to be continuous.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.750
So let's think about
whether all of these things

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.459
equal each other.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.041
First of all, let's just think
about the value of the function

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:13.790
there.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.940
So remember, we're doing part a.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.240
F of 0 is equal to-- we're
going to use this first case,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.110
because that's the case for
x is less than or equal to 0.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:32.480
So f of 0 is going to be
equal to 1 minus 2 sine of 0.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.850
Well, sine of 0 is
0, 2 times 0 is 0.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.310
So this whole thing is 0.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.170
1 minus 0 is 1.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.180
Fair enough.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.050
Now let's think about the
limit as x approaches 0

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.480
from the left-hand side.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.840
So as we approach 0 from the
left-hand side of f of x.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.960
So as we approach 0 from
the left-hand hand side,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.980
we're dealing with values
of x that are less than 0.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.330
So once again, we're dealing
with this first case up here.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.700
So this is the limit
as x approaches 0

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.540
from the left-hand side
of 1 minus 2 sine of x.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.560
Now, sine of x is continuous.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.690
It's a continuous function.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.760
So this is going to be the same
thing as 1 minus 2 sine of 0,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.670
which we've already figured out,
which is exactly equal to 1.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.611
So this is equal to 1.

00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:26.860
So the value of the limit
as we approach from the left

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.735
is the same as the
value of the function.

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:30.860
Now let's do it for as we
approach from the right--

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.720
as we approach from values
of x greater than 0.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.750
So let's think about the
limit as we approach 0

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.540
from the right of f of x.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.040
So here, we're
dealing with values

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.650
of x that are larger than 0.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.350
So we're dealing with
this case right over here.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.600
So that's going to be the
limit as x approaches 0

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.570
from the right of e
to the negative 4x.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.430
And for the x's that we care
about, or actually in general,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.630
this is a continuous function.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.930
This is a continuous function.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.980
So this is going to
be the same thing as e

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.210
to the negative 4
times 0, which is

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.500
just e to the 0,
which is just 1.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.880
So this, once again,
is equal to 1.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.580
So the function is equal to
1 at that point, the limit

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.530
as we approach from
the left is equal to 1,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.440
and the limit as we approach
from the right is equal to 1.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.540
So the function is
continuous there.
