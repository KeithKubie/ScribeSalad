00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.109
Our last example involves
a company called D2Hawkeye,

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.430
a medical software
company founded in 2001.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.420
The company combined
data with analytics

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.800
to improve quality and cost
management in health care.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.570
In 2009, the company was
analyzing 20 million people

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.690
monthly.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.310
It is impossible for humans to
sift through patient records

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.210
and assess quality and
cost without algorithms.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.590
This motivated the approach
that D2Hawkeye took.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.740
Let us discuss the data
that D2Hawkeye utilized.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.100
Health care industry
is data rich,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.530
but data may be hard to assess.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.320
It is often unstructured
and unavailable.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.790
The company used insurance
data regarding procedures,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.790
prescriptions, and diagnosis.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.470
It further defined
new risk factors

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.030
based on doctor's insights.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.349
For example, obesity
and depression.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.870
Finally, it used
demographic information,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.330
like gender and age.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.990
What were the analytics used?

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.280
The goal was to predict
future heath care costs,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700
and identify high-risk
patients to be

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.940
prioritized for intervention.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.510
The company created
interpretable models

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.780
for doctors to
analyze and verify.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.260
This led to significant
improvements

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.259
over just using
historical costs.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.110
So what is the edge?

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.289
The analytics used led to
substantial improvement

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.350
in D2Hawkeye's
ability to identify

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.300
patients who need
more attention.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.900
The approach allowed
expert knowledge

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.830
to identify new variables and
refine existing variables.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.630
Further, it allowed the
ability to make predictions

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.729
for millions of patients
without manually

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.480
reading patient's files.
