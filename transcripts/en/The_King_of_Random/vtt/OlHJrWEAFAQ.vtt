00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
Hey what's up my friends, happy Easter

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.020
today we are going to be dipping chocolate Easter eggs

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.500
but we are going to be doing it with a "King Of Random" twist

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.380
Now for this video I went down to the grocery store

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.640
and picked up a bunch of these Cadbury Creme Eggs that come out this time of year

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.680
and the purpose of this video is really to have fun,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.340
but there are 3 main experiments I'd like to try today

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.920
The first experiment is freezing a Cadbury Creme Egg in liquid nitrogen,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.660
and cutting it open to see what it looks like

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.360
The second experiment is taking one of these Black Cat fireworks,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.380
sticking it inside and letting it off

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.840
And for the third experiment we're going to take another one of those firecracker Creme Eggs and

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.340
soak it in liquid nitrogen

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.520
just to see if it'll work

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.300
So I picked up the classic Creme Eggs, but I also noticed they had a caramel variety as well

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.860
So to get started, let's crack them open, just to see the difference between these two

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.600
Uh, these things are sticky!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.720
There we go

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.300
Oh, the caramel isn't quite as sticky

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.180
That's nice

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.780
So I got these thing unwrapped, and at first glance, they look nearly identical

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.760
So for our next step, why don't we take a utility knife

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.080
to cut along the seams to cut these things open and see how they compare inside

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.060
Ooo! Look at that! Ooo, Wow!

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.960
Very Cool!

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.700
Hmm, it cracked right open

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.120
more like broke open, haha

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.420
Love my job!

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.780
So there's there's the difference guys,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.700
so the first one looks more like an egg, got the egg white, with the yellowish yolk in the center

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.080
and I'm not sue if that's actually a yolk shape originally, or if it's just globed in there

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.540
But this other one surprises me, I was expecting this to be more of the egg white with, uh, caramel yolk center

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.200
But you can see that whole thing is filled entirely with caramel

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.500
and it'll be interesting to see what caramel does after it's been cryogenically frozen

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.200
Cool! So now that we know these things are supposed to look like on the inside, let's get dipping them in liquid nitrogen

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.040
For this experiment I'm just using a standard  Styrofoam glass

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.480
Surprisingly, Styrofoam is a very, very, good insulator, much better than plastic that would just crack and spill the nitrogen

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.620
and even better than glass that would boil quite a bit of it off, and I'm still able to hold it without much difficulty

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.200
All right, here we go for the first dip, and for this one, I think were going to keep the wrapper on

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.180
Living on the edge

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.480
All right, here we go!

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.940
When I dunk, you dunk, we dunk, and we have contact

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.400
Haha! Look at all the heat

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.200
It's like bubbling and foaming

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.440
Make sure we don't spill any over the edge there

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.080
There we go

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.880
Now I'm going to let that soak for about a minute, so it has a chance to freeze

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.160
all the way through

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.980
and when it comes out, I imagine it's going to be rock hard, it's not going to be very easy to cut through

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.560
So in the meantime I'm going to go grab a bench vise and a hacksaw so we can get the leverage we need to chop this thing open and see what it looks like inside

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.540
Ok, cool, guys, we're pushing up on almost three minutes now, hpefully that's enough time for this

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.460
I'm going to take this out,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.020
and look, as soon as it comes out, it looks completely clean, no problem. But instantly you can see it starts frosting over, and I can actually hear the chocolate cracking a little bir as well. So,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.260
before this thing warms up too much, let's get over to the bench vise, and chop it open with our hacksaw

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.800
Alright, going into the bench vise now, I'm going to try and line this up so it goes along the seam

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.100
the best we can

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.880
luckily it hasn't started frostbiting my fingers too much

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.720
Oh, shoot!

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.740
Hahaha

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.960
Dang it! This is harder than I thought

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.880
Yeah, ok. So maybe we should just break these things open

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.700
I'm so tempted to put that in my mouth right now, I don't know if I should

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.660
So update, guys

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.300
The bench vise is a little bit too much pressure for this thing, so for this one, we're going with the good old hammer and chisel

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.580
Cool

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.280
Set that guy right there, hold that with my knee, and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.820
Wow! Well, I think either way, these things just crumble, but you can get a pretty good visual on what's inside there

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.960
I was hoping there was actually like, uh, yellow egg yolk inside there, but you can

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.640
see it's really just dispersed throughout the white, almost like it was just injected and smeared around

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.720
So I'm a little bit dissapointed in the findings, guys. But I can't say I'm surprised.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.820
I was hoping we'd find a little yellow packet,as like one round ball on the inside

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.980
But we still got our caramel egg, so let's o ahead and crack that open, just for fun

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.280
Doesn't seen like the liquid nitrogen has affected the foil at all, it peels right off without problem

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.220
Oh, wow!

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.380
If you look at the chocolate, you can see it's made some interesting patterns, you can see maybe that's the coco butter, it's kind of pushed out to the surface

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.920
Of course, it's frosting over pretty quick

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.980
But you can see little cracks on the chocolate as well

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.760
It's giving it kind of a ornate look

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.480
Now just for fun, let's go ahead and crush this in the bench vise

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.480
Just going to take this nice and slow

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.220
listen closely

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.160
Oh that didn't take anything at all

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.740
Easy!

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.020
Looks like there's an air bubble in here, it's very smooth and shiny

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.640
and down here, almost resembles like a geode, like little crystals

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.860
A little bit of little chunk of frozen caramel there

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.140
How does it taste?

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.940
It's like sticking to my tongue a little bit

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.620
Wouldn't want to leave that on too long

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.620
Very crunchy. The chocolate doesn't taste as good. It tastes a little more waxy than normal. How bizzare

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.280
So that was kinda fun, let's move on to the experiment I'm more looking forward too, that is a firecracker in a Cadbury Creme Egg

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.960
Now this here is a single stand of Black Cat firecrackers

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.420
These are the ones you just light off, and they all go off in series. But I'm going to extract one of  these individually and drill a small hole in the top of the egg

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.440
and push it down inside, then light it off to see how it reacts

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.780
Let's do that next

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.720
yeah, got the yolk on that one

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.420
It's a sticky bomb!

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.440
So, here's what we got guys, we've got a chocolate Creme Egg with a firecracker stuck down inside

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.560
We're going to stick this down on this acrylic base that I made, light it off, and run away. We've got about one second to get some good distance. Let's go

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.260
*POP*

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.900
Whoo!

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.040
Haha! Oh look at that!

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.660
*SLOW MOTION POP*

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:06.000
What?! Look at the inside of that egg, It's like thoroughly blended. The white and the orange together to make a new mix

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.320
and I think it mixed with some black powder because that's kind of got a burnt orange look to it now

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.920
There's the cardboard casing still in there, kinda blasted out of one side didn't it?

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.080
Ok, that was pretty cool, let's do that again

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.680
*POP*

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.620
Whoa!

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.320
That was fast!

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.880
So it blasted out the top, and then the egg ended up face down, and you can tell the cardboard in there

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.800
That one went off a lot quicker than I was expecting

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.800
So that was actually kinda fun. I ran probably a lot further away than  I needed too, but it worked

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:41.540
It comes out pretty gooey and half this thing blew off, so I'm really interested to see now what difference it'll make if this is frozen solid

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.380
How much more dangerous is that going to be with shards of frozen chocolate shooting out in every direction?

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.340
Can't wait to find out

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.800
Hoo!

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.640
It got me

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.260
Cheers!

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.500
I think for this experiment, I'm going to try the caramel variety

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:09.500
So quick update guys, I'm giving this thing about two and a half minutes to soak, so it should be sufficiently firm for our demonstartion

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:16.200
The question on my mind though, is will black powder even ignite at such low temperatures, or did we just waste our time?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.920
Let's go light it off and find out!

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.000
All right, here we go, nitrogen egg grenade, take one

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.040
It stopped

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.540
What the heck

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.520
That's kind of dissapointing

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.620
The fuse burnt out, but the firecracker didn't go off

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.380
What the heck

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.200
Is that going?

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.780
I can't tell if that's the vapor from the nitrogen, or if that's the smoke from the fuse

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:55.060
The fuse is burned away on these, but the cartridge is still inside, so for kicks, let's go ahead and crack these things open, and see what it looks like

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.820
There we are

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.640
Here's our firecracker

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.960
Oh wait! That's weird, It must've cracked off the bottom there

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.780
It still looks edible

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.820
*Crunching noises*

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.000
Crunchy!

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.140
Yep.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.220
There's our cartridge completely unscathed

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:29.060
All right, so, interesting. Two times we lit these things off, and two times the fuse burned down, but then stopped without any kind of igniton

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.640
So, I'm going to take one of these firecrackers here, soak it in liquid nitrogen by itself and see if we can get it to go off

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.880
If it doesn't, then I think our idea of nitrogen egg grenades is probably a dud, let's see what happens

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.340
Hot vs cold, which is going to win?

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.380
Look at that, ok. So these things won't blow up

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:59.940
All right, we're going to get a little bit gutsy here, see if we can do them all at the same time. Here we go!

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.340
*POP*

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.860
Woah, they worked!

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.560
What the heck

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.400
Ok, I wasn't expecting those to actually go off, and the fact that they did makes me wonder if we shouldn't try our last three

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.020
and see if we can have any success with those

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.940
Why are those working, and those didn't?

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.740
What the heck?!

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.380
all right, let's make the magic happen

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.500
*POP*

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:27.700
It worked! Oh thank goodness, it worked. What was the difference. That's so interesting

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:37.440
Look at this! The acrylic base is still attached, we've got the bottom of the egg frozen to it, and then you just got this half stand of firecracker stuck there in the middle

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.180
That looks crazy! That's going to be cool to see into slow-mo.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.240
Oh, gosh

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.680
Yeah, that was a lot better than the first one

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:52.740
The combustion was a lot more complete and the explosion took out most of the egg, it wasn't just like some it flopped over sideways

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.440
I mean that was a direct hit and shatter in every different direction

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.460
That was very satisfying

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.060
I'm really glad that worked

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.300
The question is if we can get it to do it again

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.020
Please work, please work, please work

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.120
Whoa! The fuse burned down incredibly fast

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.540
Okay, I'm taking a propane torch to it

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:21.300
Now, if this does go off, that's going to be molten chocolate spooring everywhere

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:33.320
Well, I'm calling that a mostly fail. Yeah. *POP* Oh, there it goes! Hahaha! Took long enough

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.520
So is was kind of interesting. Let's stop and recap some of the things we did here today

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.860
We started off by opening some Cadbury Creme Eggs to see what they look like when they''re gooey on the inside

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.260
Then we tried freezing them in liquid nitrogen to see if we could get them to hold their shape before they cracked them open

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.820
But it turns out there isn't actually a yolk on the inside them after all, it's just randomly sprayed together

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.500
Next, we tried sticking a firecracker down inside one of the Creme Eggs which was very satisfying, but most of the energy came out of the top

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.880
So we tried freezing our Creme Egg grenades in liquid nitrogen to see if that'd create a more dramatic effect

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.360
We found two things. apparently the fuse to the firecrackers that come off the strips aren't very reliable.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.780
Sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't. When they do work, the results are fantastic.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.220
it worked!

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.740
and when they don't, It's a little discouraging.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:22.240
But I still have a strip full of firecrackers, and two more frozen eggs, so for one grand finale, let's roll them all together

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.800
and light them all off

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:35.860
*CONSECUTIVE POPPING*

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.440
That's awesome!

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.880
Well, that's it for this set of experiments guys, happy Easter, and I'll see you in the next video. Talk to you then

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.260
Oh and our eggs still survive
