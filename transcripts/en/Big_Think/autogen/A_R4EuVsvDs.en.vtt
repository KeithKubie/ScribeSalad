science that are very important and
 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.290
science that are very important and
they're described nowadays and what's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300
they're described nowadays and what's
 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.750
they're described nowadays and what's
called critical thinking your ability to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760
called critical thinking your ability to
 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.360

negative ideas of nots so with that said
 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.190
negative ideas of nots so with that said
the other idea in critical thinking is

the other idea in critical thinking is

all of us how would you go about proving
 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.380
all of us how would you go about proving
that how would you show that it's true

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390
that how would you show that it's true
 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.100
that how would you show that it's true
how would you show before and after

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110
how would you show before and after
 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.780
how would you show before and after
before the life force after the life

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
before the life force after the life

okay but after somebody's dead they
would be dead whether there's a life

flows through is the life energy but it
hasn't been proven so you can't prove a

them something then there'll be another

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360
them something then there'll be another

experiment where you have to move away

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620
experiment where you have to move away
 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.939
experiment where you have to move away
from him or her well if you move toward

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949
from him or her well if you move toward

them your tendency is to like that other

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169
them your tendency is to like that other

people better than if you're required to
 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.909
people better than if you're required to
move away from them so they set up a

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919
move away from them so they set up a
 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.610
move away from them so they set up a
test so that these two ideas are

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620
test so that these two ideas are
 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.499
test so that these two ideas are
independent that what you're trying to

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509
independent that what you're trying to
 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.480
independent that what you're trying to
accomplish and moving toward that person

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490
accomplish and moving toward that person
 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.760
accomplish and moving toward that person
are independent of whether or not you're

are independent of whether or not you're
 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.270
are independent of whether or not you're
moving going this way or that way and

the expression that's popular right now

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690
the expression that's popular right now
 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.570
the expression that's popular right now
is embodied cognition this is to say

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580
is embodied cognition this is to say
 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.149
is embodied cognition this is to say
something you do with your central

nervous system commanding my hand to
 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.029
nervous system commanding my hand to
move towards your way is somehow affects

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039
move towards your way is somehow affects
 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.820
move towards your way is somehow affects
what you feel like your brain and the

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830
what you feel like your brain and the
 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.439
what you feel like your brain and the
rest of your nervous system are not

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449
rest of your nervous system are not
 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.520
rest of your nervous system are not
independent so

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530
independent so
 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.770
independent so
when you move towards somebody you like

when you move towards somebody you like
him or her more if you move away you

him or her more if you move away you
 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.520
him or her more if you move away you
like him or her less by a little bit by

like him or her less by a little bit by
 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.460
like him or her less by a little bit by
a measurable repeatable amount so it

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470
a measurable repeatable amount so it
 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.620
a measurable repeatable amount so it
could be that this idea of spirituality

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630
could be that this idea of spirituality
 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.410

it's cool idea maybe you'll become a

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320
it's cool idea maybe you'll become a

it's cool idea maybe you'll become a
neuroscientist and figure it out and

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970
neuroscientist and figure it out and
 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.160
neuroscientist and figure it out and
dare I say it

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.170
dare I say it
