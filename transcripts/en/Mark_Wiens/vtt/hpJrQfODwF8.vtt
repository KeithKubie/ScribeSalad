00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
- Good morning!

00:00:00.953 --> 00:00:01.790
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.050
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Chanthaburi, Thailand.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.470
And Chanthaburi, it's about 250 kilometers

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.160
southeast of Bangkok on the coast.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.230
It has a unique mix of cultures here

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.890
and some amazing food.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.542
And so today we're gonna go

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:20.490
on a Thai street food tour of Chanthaburi.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.970
We're also gonna explore some of the sites

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.579
and I'm gonna share it all with
you in this video right now.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.162
(upbeat music)

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.196
(speaking foreign language)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.550
We're starting off at the morning market

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.490
and there's just an abundance
of fresh ingredients here.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.910
You can find ingredients
for anything you want

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.620
but there's lots of seafood

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.130
and this is one of the greatest places

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.963
to start your morning.

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:47.610
There's also a lot of pre-cooked food.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.410
So we're gonna start eating very soon

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.450
but before we start eating
I just wanna tell you,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.840
this is gonna be an entire video series.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.256
We are eating our way through
the eastern part of Thailand.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.380
And eastern Thailand, along the coast,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.400
there are some very unique dishes

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.950
which I think are very underrepresented,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.200
even in Bangkok, they are hard to find.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.660
And so we're gonna be uncovering,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.810
we're gonna be sampling.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.190
I'm gonna be sharing with you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.560
some of the lesser known Thai dishes

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.750
from the eastern regions of Thailand.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.820
And so we're starting off in Chanthaburi.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.210
We're gonna proceed on to Trat

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.580
and then go to some of the islands

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.640
and I'm gonna share it all
with you in this video series.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.501
So make sure that you are subscribed.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.964
Turn on your bell notification

00:01:25.964 --> 00:01:29.325
so you get the next
notification of the next video

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:32.502
and okay, let's go to eat breakfast.

00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:36.169
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.790
We're gonna start off
with some khao niaow bing,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.380
which is just grilled sticky rice

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.890
but I could smell it
and it just looks cool.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.890
She has little triangles of
neatly folded banana leaves

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.120
filled with sticky rice and
we got it stuffed with taro.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.250
But yeah, it smells really good.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.190
Okay, let's have a bite.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.910
You take out the little bamboo toothpicks

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.290
and then you unwrap,

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:06.450
unwrap it revealing the sticky rice.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.460
But I love the smell of
roasted banana leaves.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.350
And you can see it's kind
of gummy, it's all molded.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.100
Oh, it's so hot and steaming

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.590
and then there should be some
taro in the center there.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.820
Oh, yeah.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.870
That just slow roasts on
the grill so it remains hot.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.800
What I like most about this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.050
is that you have the sweetness

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.510
and I think there is some
coconut milk in there

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.050
but it's contrasted by some saltiness.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.422
And then you've got the gooey sticky rice

00:02:33.422 --> 00:02:35.846
but at the same time because
it's slow roast on the grill

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:37.910
you have some crunchy edges

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.860
and the whole packet is just smoky too.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.899
Fantastic.

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:47.566
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:52.710
The gai yang, the grilled chicken here

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.590
looks and smells so good
that we cannot pass it by.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.792
So we're getting some grilled chicken

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:58.700
but after that we've decided

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.670
that we're gonna walk a little
ways outside of the market

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.720
to the old town to eat a
special type of noodle dish.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.520
It's fresh right off the grill.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.060
It's hot, it's glistening.

00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:19.920
It's really hot.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.530
Oh.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.510
Oh.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.940
Oh, the juiciness of that.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.773
And as she grills it,

00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:27.990
she just continuously bastes it

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.870
with some kind of oil sauce
that's extremely tasty.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.540
Oh, that's some really good gai yang.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.577
And they sell just chicken non-stop.

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:39.160
(upbeat music)

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.940
That is extraordinarily juicy.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:56.358
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.020
Just outside the market

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.660
we've stumbled into a lady
from her motorbike food cart.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.175
She is selling sen chan.

00:04:05.175 --> 00:04:08.170
It's one of the well known
noodle dishes of Chanthaburi

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.022
and she was actually
just, I didn't know this.

00:04:10.022 --> 00:04:12.430
She just explained to us that sen chan,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.160
so sen means noodle, chan
is short for Chanthaburi.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.350
So it's the noodles of Chanthaburi.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.829
So this is something you have to eat.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.910
As soon as you walk past,

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.740
you can smell the aroma of the noodles.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.670
It has this sweet chili aroma

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.560
coming from this entire cart.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.613
This entire area actually.

00:04:29.613 --> 00:04:32.950
So I'm just gonna post
up right here on her cart

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.960
and sample this.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.860
But you can see there's
some little crabs in here.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.200
She adds on some bean
sprouts and some chives.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.403
Mmm!

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.842
Oh.

00:04:46.842 --> 00:04:48.550
Oh, that's delicious.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.820
I mean that is sweet enough

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.320
that you could actually call it a dessert.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.820
But at the same time it is
quite well balanced with flavor.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.500
She makes it all traditional style.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.090
For the sweetness she adds in palm sugar

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.740
as well as tamarind.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.640
But what I really notice

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.750
is you can really taste
the garlic in there.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.360
And you've got that salty sweet contrast

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.560
and additionally the noodles,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.890
they have that really wonderful

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.635
gummy texture without being mushy

00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:14.460
and you can eat the whole crab.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.750
So I'll try a crab next.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.720
Oh yeah.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.890
That has a crunch to it.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.650
That tastes like exaggerated
crab flavor and I like it.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.346
Tastes like crab eggs.

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:28.929
(upbeat music)

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.050
I gotta say, it's a little,

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.242
I mean it's very sweet for me.

00:05:36.242 --> 00:05:38.380
But it is really good.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.440
I like that balance of flavor.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.820
I love that garlic

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.320
and I like the texture of the noodles.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.831
And she is just awesome too.

00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:47.748
(bright pop music)

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.350
One of the greatest charms
of being in Chanthaburi

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.435
is exploring that Chanthabun,
the riverside community.

00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:00.090
Yeah, the streets are just charming.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.170
The old buildings, the
old wooden buildings,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.251
the mix of Thai-Chinese

00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:07.386
and even some European architecture.

00:06:07.386 --> 00:06:10.090
But we're gonna explore this area more.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.863
But first we're gonna go eat some noodles.

00:06:12.863 --> 00:06:16.530
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:23.554 --> 00:06:26.510
The restaurant is right
within the riverside community

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.120
and it's called Je Eat

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.170
and she specializes in
a mix of seafood noodles

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.010
and so we ordered one with noodles

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.630
which is called Kuey Teow Tom Yam Thale

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.470
which is Tom Yam noodles
with a mix of seafood

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.353
and then we also got,

00:06:38.353 --> 00:06:41.370
I think the same thing
but rice on the bottom

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.580
instead of noodles as well.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.430
And what I like is that she
designs it so beautifully

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.550
and lays out the seafood.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.790
The most notable seafood

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.950
on the plates is called goong

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.120
which is in English they're mantis prawns.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.070
She has already them peeled

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.903
but they look like,

00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:02.800
they definitely look like alien shrimp

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.020
if you see them raw.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.120
It looks delicious and just a
blanket of different seafood

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.510
covering the rice and noodles.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.320
I gotta try a mantis prawn first.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.153
Oh, yes.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.453
Mmm!

00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:19.140
Oh!

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.160
Oh, that's incredible.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.320
It's been actually a long time

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.880
since I've had a mantis prawn.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.460
It does have a similar taste to a shrimp

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.500
but it's more like succulent.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.760
It's not quite as muscular.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.960
It's a little softer.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.820
Kind of like a cross
between a shrimp and crab.

00:07:35.533 --> 00:07:36.366
Oh.

00:07:39.073 --> 00:07:40.812
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:44.400
It's sour, it's nutty from peanuts.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.820
You get a little bit of,

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.170
it's balanced with sweetness as well.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.950
A little bit of chili flakes.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.200
Stir this around.

00:07:55.753 --> 00:07:56.586
Oh man.

00:07:56.586 --> 00:07:58.486
This is a really good bowl of noodles.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.410
Okay, I'll get another.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.243
What shall I get?

00:08:02.243 --> 00:08:05.356
Oh, some of that crab plus
some noodles on this bite.

00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:08.273
(bright pop music)

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.820
The rice, actually this
is extremely beautiful.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.840
So there's rice on the bottom

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.290
and again that same mix of seafood

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.890
and then it's served with a
seafood sauce on the side.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.990
And I'm going straight for
that mantis prawn again

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.380
with crab, with a little
bit of everything.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.598
Oh, yes.

00:08:25.598 --> 00:08:28.515
(bright pop music)

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.510
Those mantis shrimp are fantastic.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.750
I like it with that sauce too.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.180
You've got the fresh chilies in there.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.510
Oh yeah, I think I like the rice version

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.887
better than the noodles.

00:08:43.887 --> 00:08:46.804
(upbeat pop music)

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:48.880
Oh yeah.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.080
That's nice and fresh.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.970
That's muscular.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.736
That's my favorite kind of popsicle.

00:08:58.736 --> 00:09:01.653
(bright pop music)

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.830
That was a delicious meal.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.790
I especially liked the mantis shrimp.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.800
Those mantis prawns, they're so succulent.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.990
And actually conveniently
right around the corner

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.800
is one of the main catholic churches.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.970
It's one of the main iconic
landmarks of Chanthaburi.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.090
This entire riverside community,

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.100
you'll notice that it has a
real Thai-Chinese feel to it

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.700
but not only is there
a big Chinese influence

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.573
and Chinese came especially to trade

00:09:35.573 --> 00:09:38.620
and to do commerce in this region.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.290
What's also fascinating is that

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.230
there's a Vietnamese
influence in this area

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.710
and additionally there's also influence

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.810
from French and Portuguese.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.069
So Chanthaburi is really
a mixing melting pot.

00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:53.986
(bright pop music)

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.600
This is one of the biggest
catholic cathedrals

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.050
in all of Thailand

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.150
and it was inaugurated back in 1909.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.000
Built by the French in a
very brief period of time

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.160
when they occupied this region.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160
But now from what I was just reading

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.360
is that most of the people in this area

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.370
have a Vietnamese descent.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.610
You can't go inside right now

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.040
but it's just nice to walk around

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.240
to get a view of the cathedral,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.210
walk around this public square

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.490
and in the evening especially,

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.230
people come here just to hang out,

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.190
kinda just stroll around the square

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.983
and it's a very nice environment.

00:10:28.983 --> 00:10:31.900
(bright pop music)

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.260
There are so many amazing

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.200
old wooden buildings in this community,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.860
some of them are a little bit abandoned

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.640
like this one right here.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.240
But others of them are still occupied,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.960
people live within them still.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.670
They're nicely renovated

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.620
and others have turned into
souvenir shops or little cafes.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.310
But it's really pleasant.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.674
Check out this building right here.

00:10:57.674 --> 00:11:00.204
This is one of my favorites.

00:11:00.204 --> 00:11:03.871
(speaking foreign language)

00:11:15.439 --> 00:11:16.823
So I'm just walking past.

00:11:16.823 --> 00:11:18.450
He watches our videos

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.840
and they are making some fish cakes.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.680
In Thai they are called tod man

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.080
but this one is a unique version

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.965
because there's something
called krawan on top of it,

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:29.480
kinda plastered into it

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.430
and krawan, I believe that
it's the cardamom stems

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.560
but it's an amazing herb ingredient.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.130
Okay, I can't wait to try this.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.170
Mmm.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.820
Oh.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.210
Oh, it's fantastic.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.240
That's all fish.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.930
I love the spongy texture.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.780
There's definitely some
red curry paste in there.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.870
It's got that really smoky flavor.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.430
- Thank you so much.
- Very good.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.450
And that krawan comes in really nicely.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.700
It's such a pungent herb.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.182
Yeah, it's delicious.

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:09.607
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:09.607 --> 00:12:11.258
That was some really
good grilled fish cakes.

00:12:11.258 --> 00:12:12.606
Thank you.

00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:15.189
(upbeat music)

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.450
I've been walking around
for at least an hour.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.630
I think it's time for lunch

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.870
but Micah and Ying have
gone back to take a nap.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.230
I'm gonna go to,

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.802
if you ask anybody

00:12:28.802 --> 00:12:32.180
what restaurant to eat
local food at in Chanthaburi

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.910
this is one of the number
one recommendations

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.727
and I'm gonna go meet Songkram,
he's from Chanthaburi.

00:12:37.727 --> 00:12:40.220
We're gonna go have lunch together.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.940
Songkram.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.480
So just one street parallel
to the walking street,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.540
the whole riverfront community,

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.970
is this is one of the most

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.730
legendary restaurants in Chanthaburi,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.920
it's called Chantorn Pochana.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.920
And they have some unique dishes.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.300
I'm excited to try the food here.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.530
I really wanna experience
and share with you

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.760
some of the unique rare to
find elsewhere in Thailand

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.280
dishes of Chanthaburi.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.320
Say hello to Songkram.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.153
- Hello.

00:13:10.153 --> 00:13:11.410
- All the food looks fantastic

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.570
but the number one dish

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.060
I was really looking forward to trying

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.740
at this restaurant specifically,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.640
also in Chanthaburi is massaman durian.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.000
And so massaman is a very common dish

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.170
but it's also a fusion dish

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.170
because it has Persian origins

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.960
mixed with Thai ingredients.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.090
You can smell the spices
coming off of here

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.270
but normally it's just made with chicken

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.780
or another type of meat

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.840
and no durian is usually involved

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.910
but in Chanthaburi this is
one of the signature dishes

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.070
with durian in it.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.240
Look at that rich nutty oily sauce.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.373
Oh, big chunks of chicken but ah, yeah.

00:13:44.373 --> 00:13:46.650
I have to try one of the chunks of durian.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.793
Mmm!

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:55.283
Oh, wow.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.100
Oh, that's incredible.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.010
It doesn't really have
any of the characteristics

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.650
of a ripe durian.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.920
It's much more potatoey

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.920
but at the same time it's a
lot more creamy than a potato.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.680
Almost like taro but it's
not dry at all either.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.640
And the massaman here is
actually fantastic as well.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.560
It does have a sweet taste to it

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.770
but you can really taste the undertone

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.920
of the dry spices in there.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.340
The cumin, there's probably
some turmeric in there,

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.330
the coriander.

00:14:32.015 --> 00:14:34.242
That is a stunner.

00:14:34.242 --> 00:14:35.580
Oh.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.530
Oh, the creaminess of that durian.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.490
The next dish is called
gaeng moo chamuang.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.010
And this is also a very
local, very popular dish,

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.470
but it's not that common outside
of this region of Thailand.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.926
And chamuang is a leaf.

00:14:50.926 --> 00:14:54.420
In English it is the cowa garcinia leaf.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.036
I think that's the scientific name

00:14:56.036 --> 00:14:58.610
but that's the leaf
that's used in this curry

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.410
and okay, let's put some of
this on our rice and try it.

00:15:07.528 --> 00:15:08.361
Mmm.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.446
Oh.

00:15:10.446 --> 00:15:12.220
You immediately get

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.000
an initial sweet and sour taste.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.430
I think what I love most are those leaves

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.140
and the texture of the leaves.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.559
You know how spinach has that kinda slimy

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:25.700
really soft texture to it?

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.680
These leaves are exactly
opposite of spinach.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.510
They have a little crunch to them.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.960
You can taste that they're cooked

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.610
but at the same time they don't get mushy

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.890
or soggy or slimy at all.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.010
They remain crunchy.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.250
The next dish and this is the dish

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.240
I'm most looking forward to trying.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.780
This is one of my favorite dishes

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.590
from this region of Thailand.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.660
This time they made it with fish,

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.740
stir fried up with krawan.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.610
And krawan is, it's a local herb.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.910
I believe that it's the stems
or the stalks of cardamom.

00:15:55.616 --> 00:15:57.560
And also there's just
a ton of herbs in here.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.200
It's a beautiful, beautiful dish.

00:16:05.126 --> 00:16:06.652
Oh yeah.

00:16:06.652 --> 00:16:07.597
Oh.

00:16:07.597 --> 00:16:09.310
Oh wow.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.143
Mhmm.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.090
Oh, I love that krawan.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.370
They have a texture like bamboo shoots

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:19.307
but they're like worlds of
flavor more than bamboo shoots.

00:16:19.307 --> 00:16:22.030
They have kind of a ginger flavor,

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.322
kind of a lemongrass flavor.

00:16:23.322 --> 00:16:25.150
A mix of all those.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.220
And oh, it's good.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.920
You've got the soft fish in there.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:33.850
I absolutely love it.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.750
And this one is called saeng wa

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.270
and it's minced up shrimp.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.103
There are shallots in there.

00:16:39.103 --> 00:16:40.340
It's like a dipping sauce

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.360
for all the vegetables that surround it.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.120
This is just a gorgeous mixture though.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.970
Look at all that.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.220
Oh.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.247
Oh.

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.260
Oh, I love it.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.430
Oh, that's so good.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.690
Now, I'm not totally sure

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.170
but I think that is not lime juice

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.510
but rather kaffir lime juice

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.780
which is not used all that
commonly anymore in Thai cuisine.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.100
I mean the leaves are used immensely

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.008
but the actual fruit, I think that,

00:17:13.008 --> 00:17:15.910
I think that's the juice from
the fruit of the kaffir lime.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.700
It has a more mellow sourness to it.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.340
But kind of like a deeper citrus flavor.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.173
Oh, it's so good.

00:17:23.173 --> 00:17:24.430
You've got the bits of shrimp in there.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.630
You've got all the fine lemongrass.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.130
You've got the shallots.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.110
Mmm.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.530
It's vibrantly refreshing.

00:17:31.273 --> 00:17:32.923
Oh.

00:17:32.923 --> 00:17:34.908
That's extraordinary.

00:17:34.908 --> 00:17:36.720
Yeah, it's really really good.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.750
Next up, for the soup tom rakam

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.220
and this one also has
krawan, the stems in it.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.300
There's fish, look at that fish.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.430
But yeah, rakam is a sour fruit

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.100
which is similar to snake fruit

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.570
and they add it to this as well.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.670
This looks incredible.

00:17:54.458 --> 00:17:57.375
(bright pop music)

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.170
This is the rakam, pieces of it.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.630
It's a very sour fruit.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.840
There are chilies in here

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.550
and then also the krawan.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.800
That's all krawan in there.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.760
So I'll take a little bit of,

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.230
let me try to get a
little bit of everything,

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.980
with the chili, some of the fish,

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.980
some of the krawan, and some
of the rakam all together.

00:18:19.451 --> 00:18:22.368
(bright pop music)

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.983
Mmm!

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.360
The sourness from that rakam,

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.240
almost like a fermented sourness

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.170
and you taste that krawan,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.009
the gingery lemongrass flavor

00:18:38.009 --> 00:18:41.490
and the broth is so clean and pure.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.310
Wow, wow, that's impressive.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.310
And the final dish is gaeng pa pla

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.810
and this is really one
of my favorite dishes

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:48.643
in all of Thailand.

00:18:48.643 --> 00:18:49.670
I know I say that a lot.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.980
This really is one of my standards.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.010
Something, if I see it on a
menu, I can't help but ordering.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.527
Jungle curry with fish.

00:18:56.527 --> 00:19:00.970
It's just always spicy,
it's loaded with herbs.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.410
It has all the components
of a flavor overdose.

00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.030
Yeah.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:11.863
Mmm.

00:19:11.863 --> 00:19:12.990
It's a little bit spicy.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.170
I love that entire stock of
little green peppercorns.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.400
That bumps up the flavor.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.790
What's great about this curry also

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.060
is that it's a water-based curry

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.510
so it doesn't feel heavy.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.590
It feels light, it feels healthy.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.150
You taste about 25 different herbs

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.530
and chilies going on in there.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:32.363
It's so good.

00:19:32.363 --> 00:19:33.215
Yeah, jungle curry.

00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:34.620
It's one of the greatest.

00:19:39.671 --> 00:19:42.940
It's just a harmony with rice.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.140
All the food is really good.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.756
I think we've now tried all of them.

00:19:46.756 --> 00:19:49.673
(bright pop music)

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.450
That's extraordinary.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.062
The kaffir lime flavor, it
will blow your taste buds.

00:19:58.062 --> 00:20:00.979
(bright pop music)

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.650
From now on, all massaman
curry should include durian.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.730
What an absolutely impressive meal.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.164
That was delicious food.

00:20:22.164 --> 00:20:24.480
What stands out to me,

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.160
what I'm still pumped
up about is that krawan,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.680
those cardamom stems

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.680
which were in a couple
of different dishes.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.840
What an ingredient.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.010
It's so good.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.630
That's something you
need to seek out to eat

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.810
but also the durian massaman.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.100
Oh man, that was good.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.520
Those chunks of durian
in there were fantastic.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.950
Thanks to Songkram for
coming out for lunch.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.550
Songkram, he watches our videos

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.819
so he sent me a message
when we came to Chanthaburi.

00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:51.240
And he's actually a police.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.805
So he's really cool.

00:20:52.805 --> 00:20:56.472
(speaking foreign langauge)

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.610
It's something nobody misses

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.730
when they come to the old town Chanthaburi

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.040
is this very old ice cream spot.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.370
In English they call it rocket ice cream.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.850
And they make popsicle style ice cream,

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.660
old style ice cream, ice cream bolan.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.630
I got a flavor that is the,

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.280
I think it's the original flavor.

00:21:37.917 --> 00:21:39.420
Mmm!

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.060
So the ice cream is in the center

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.030
and then the topping is on the outside.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.060
It's like an icicle topping
coating the ice cream.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.960
That flavor is almost like
a roasted, almost like a,

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.450
it tastes almost like a cola.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.053
It's interesting.

00:21:58.053 --> 00:21:59.860
It's definitely something you
have to try when you're here.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.110
And right across the
street is our friend Pian.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.140
He has a retro clothes shop.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.440
If you need some vintage clothes,

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.300
definitely check out his shop.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.026
Overalls, tank tops.

00:22:13.026 --> 00:22:15.609
(upbeat music)

00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:25.134
(speaking foreign language)

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.000
This stall is very well
known for their kluay tab

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.480
which are grilled bananas.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.340
And normally they kinda crunch them down

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.930
and then mix them with syrup.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.710
So she is just roasting up tons of bananas

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.680
over a, it's a very low fire.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.650
So you can feel, you
can see all the action.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.590
So it's a very even heat, low heat.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.260
But she just continually
rotates the bananas

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.620
until they are cooked and
then puts them in a bag,

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.480
chops them up and mixes
them with the syrup

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.930
and this is a very well known place.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.520
This is one of the must eat things

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.870
when you're in Chanthaburi.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.800
Oh, yeah.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.034
Oh, that's sweet.

00:23:06.034 --> 00:23:09.640
It's almost like a caramelly
sweetness in that syrup.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.990
But the banana's wonderful.

00:23:11.986 --> 00:23:15.183
The banana is sweet but
sour at the same time.

00:23:15.183 --> 00:23:17.766
(upbeat music)

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.710
Okay, the kluay tab was excellent.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.140
Whoa, the heat is roasting
hot this afternoon

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.282
and we are jumping in the car to go to,

00:23:29.282 --> 00:23:30.330
Songkram.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.148
- Yep?
- Where are we going?

00:23:32.148 --> 00:23:34.050
- Chumchon Nong Bua.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.080
- Chumchon Nong Bua.
- Nong Bua.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.913
Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

00:23:36.913 --> 00:23:39.800
Is it a--
- It's about a snack.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.260
A weird snack.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.690
- Ah, okay.

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:46.350
Interesting snacks.
- Yes.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.830
But it's very good.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.447
- Okay, that's the next destination today.

00:23:51.447 --> 00:23:54.530
(upbeat dance music)

00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:00.080
That was only about a 15 minute drive

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.670
all the way from the
center of Chanthaburi,

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.430
but this market is
called Chumchon Nong Bua.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.260
And I actually don't
really know much about it

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.930
but it is an old community.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.760
They're known for interesting snacks.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.240
And again it's just kind of
a pleasant charming community

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.107
to walk around and snack.

00:24:19.107 --> 00:24:22.774
(speaking foreign language)

00:24:34.675 --> 00:24:36.190
I didn't know this until a few minutes ago

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.040
but the main snack that
we came here to eat

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.060
is called khanom koey ling.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.991
The direct translation of this dessert,

00:24:43.991 --> 00:24:46.429
and I apologize in advance,

00:24:46.429 --> 00:24:49.560
but it is called monkey penis snack.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.510
She takes the batter which
is made from sticky rice

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.260
and mix it into little worm shapes

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.410
and then drops them into the hot water,

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.090
boils them until they're finished

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.140
and then she strains them

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.020
and then they go in a bath of coconut

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.410
and get bathed in coconut.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.280
So coconut covers them
and that's the snack.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.960
This is something you won't
find elsewhere in Thailand.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.810
This will be my first time to try it.

00:25:15.842 --> 00:25:16.957
Mmm.

00:25:16.957 --> 00:25:18.807
Yeah, that's like sticky rice batter.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.728
Kinda chewy and gummy

00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:24.070
and then what I love is
just that crust of coconut.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.290
That is unsweetened so far

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.360
but they do give you a whole

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.120
little tub of sugar to add to it.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.106
You can add as much sugar as you like.

00:25:32.106 --> 00:25:35.773
(speaking foreign language)

00:25:45.773 --> 00:25:47.478
(laughing)

00:25:47.478 --> 00:25:48.542
Okay.

00:25:48.542 --> 00:25:50.292
Okay, hold this note.

00:25:51.746 --> 00:25:53.996
(laughing)

00:25:56.665 --> 00:25:57.498
Mmm.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.940
The sugar has that nice
sesame nuttiness to it

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.510
and that's both sweet and salty.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.380
Well that was a first for me.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:10.676
That is one of the more explicitly
named Thai sweet snacks.

00:26:10.676 --> 00:26:11.630
But it's pretty good.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.541
You should definitely try
it when you come here.

00:26:13.541 --> 00:26:16.624
(upbeat dance music)

00:26:21.536 --> 00:26:25.203
(speaking foreign language)

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.180
Next up, we're stopping for some ice cream

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.700
and they have fruits

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.460
that look remarkably
similar to the real thing.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.760
We got, of course I had
to go with the durian.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:38.883
Oh, it's cold.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.080
Mmm.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.159
Mmm.

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:42.992
Oh.

00:26:42.992 --> 00:26:44.410
Oh, that's awesome.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:46.230
Oh, it's so good.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:51.230
Yeah, that's like extra creamy,
sweet cream frozen durian.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.250
There's no second questioning
what type of fruit this is.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.300
You know immediately.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.011
Mmm, excellent.

00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:05.678
(speaking foreign language)

00:27:09.733 --> 00:27:10.640
The owner is just explaining to us.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.990
She makes it here but she
actually sells it in Bangkok

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.080
to some of the retail
stores where they resell it.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.300
But she uses 100% durian.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.190
There's no sugar in it.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.900
It's just all sweetness from the durian

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:21.810
and then some milk in there

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.210
and then freezes it back in form,

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.400
back in durian nugget shape.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.690
It's just a small market,

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.960
very low key, very relaxing, friendly,

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.900
and some very very unique snacks

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.740
that you won't find
anywhere else in Thailand.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.620
A pretty cool place.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.227
I desperately needed an
iced coffee right now.

00:27:40.227 --> 00:27:43.144
(bright pop music)

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.990
I'm at that stage right now

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.090
where I could sip up this
entire cup in one gulp.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:50.300
Oh, that's refreshing.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.310
That's what I needed.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.870
We're on our way next to,

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.360
it's a temple, also a monument

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.217
which is a little further
down the road from here.

00:27:58.217 --> 00:28:01.134
(bright pop music)

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.950
That again was about a 15 minute ride

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:13.260
and we have arrived to King
Taksin the Great's shipyard.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.120
But there's a ship here, there's a beach,

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.570
there's kind of an area,

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.975
kind of a park area and a shrine.

00:28:18.975 --> 00:28:21.892
(bright pop music)

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.800
This is a monument and a tribute
to King Taksin the Great.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.680
He came to this area, to this shipyard

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.230
and this is where he assembled his armies

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.320
and his troops and his navy.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.034
And so now, it has this
really peaceful feel to it.

00:28:38.034 --> 00:28:40.109
It's really nice to visit.

00:28:40.109 --> 00:28:43.026
(bright pop music)

00:28:48.737 --> 00:28:50.810
I think I'm gonna end the
video for today right now.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:51.643
From here we're just gonna

00:28:51.643 --> 00:28:53.610
drive back to Chanthaburi, the town.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.710
And we need to take a little rest.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.393
There's been a lot of food already today

00:28:57.393 --> 00:28:59.770
and it's been really good.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.490
Chanthaburi, it's a quiet city.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.790
It's quite a peaceful province as well

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.090
but it really offers you some rewards.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.430
I will have all the information below

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:10.990

and the food we ate.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.250

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.360
We're gonna meet up with Uncle Tom

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.650
who's known for his gigantic oysters.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.540
