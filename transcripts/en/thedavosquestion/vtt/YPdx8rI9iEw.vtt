00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.550
&gt;&gt; Absolutely and it's really important that
we get the right role models.We need to celebrate

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.420
our scientists, our educators, and the people
who are really improving the lives of every

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.460
one today.And we have a great example actually
today. Out of more than a million students

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.619
around the world entered into Intel Science
and Education Fair, a Jordanian pair, two

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.220
students, 16 and 17 had won one of the grand
prizes. Now they basically went to the US

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.110
and they presented their paper on how to generate
electricity out of scrap metal and exhaust

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.560
fumes which sounds pretty exciting to me and
I think those are the type of people that

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.620
we need to look at as role models. How can
we really move to the next generation doing

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.230
something really exciting for all our people?
Thank you.
