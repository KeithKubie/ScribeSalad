00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.530
Have you ever wondered, what gives eyes their color? The short answer to this

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:12.760
question is that Melanin, a pigment, is deposited in the Iris of the eye to give

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.840
the apparent color. Soon after birth, Melanocytes,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.900
the same type of cells that confer skin

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.930
pigmentation. Begin to synthesize and deposit melanin pigment.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.120
Now, if we look at the iris here,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.470
we'd have to zoom in to see the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.620
melanocytes here. And there's a special structure within

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.290
the melanocyte cell called the Melanosome that synthesizes

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.520
and deposits this melanin pigment. Now, normally the kind

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.800
of pigment that's produced is very dark pigment.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.980
And if there's an abundance of this dark melanin,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.910
then the cell layer is thick. Most incoming

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.120
light is absorbed and the eyecolor will appear brown.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.220
On the other hand, it is only a little pigment and the thin layer of

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.400
cells, then little light is absorbed. And the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.239
eye will appear blue. All intermediate shades reflect

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.670
variations on this theme. The amount of

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.610
melanin produced combined with the thickness of the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.720
cell layers affecting how much light is reflected

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.540
or absorbed. While Eye Color is polygenic and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.250
affected by several different genes. OCA2 or OCA2 plays the largest role.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.100
[UNKNOWN]

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.415
with a fully functioning OCA2 produce a lot of dark

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:30.590
[UNKNOWN]

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.048
pigment, which results in brown eyes.

00:01:33.048 --> 00:01:34.189
[UNKNOWN]

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.620
without a fully functioning OCA2 produce almost

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.570
no pigment, resulting in blue eyes. When the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.350
OCA2 gene's function is reduced by other mutations,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.130
various eye colors from blue to hazelcan result.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.370
Based on this, I want you to rate the following OCA2 variations on a scale from

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.645
Brownest to Bluest. You're going to use the numbers

00:01:57.645 --> 00:01:59.311
one, two, and three to rank these three

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.320
options, one being the brownest and three being

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.812
the bluest, and two being in the middle.

00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:04.352
[UNKNOWN]

00:02:04.352 --> 00:02:08.130
two copies of a silent mutation in OCA2, two copies of a nonsense mutation

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.150
in OCA2. And one copy of a

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.100
Mutation in the OCA2 promoter that reduces transcription.
