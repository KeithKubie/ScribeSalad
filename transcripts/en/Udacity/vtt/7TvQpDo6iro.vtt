00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.521
Given 5x + 4 is &lt; 14 and 3x- 2 x
the quantity x + 1 is greater than or

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:12.640
equal to -5 find the solution set for
x..

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.400
This is another compound inequality.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.530
This time the inequalities
are joined by "And".

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.420
When a compound inequality has an and
that means the solution

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.730
set only contains numbers that
satisfy both inequalities.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.710
There are more requirements
of the solution set.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.770
So, this is the less inclusive of the
two kinds of compound inequalities or

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.940
is the more inclusive.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.710
So skipping a few steps this
simplifies 2x is less than 2.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.310
And this one simplifies to x is &gt; or
equal to -3.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.370
Since these are joined by an "And"
statement we need to find the set of

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.600
numbers that is true for both x is &lt; 2
and x is greater than or equal to -3.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.460
On our number line,
we can show x is less than two like this

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.590
x is greater than negative three will
look like this the solution set here is

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.100
everywhere that the two graphs overlap,
so here to here.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.690
The part of the number line that I
just circled Is everywhere where x

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.380
is less than 2 and
x is greater than or equal to -3.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.700
This solution set can also be written
like this which reads -3 is less than or

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.200
equal to x, which is less than 2.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.340
Make sure all of this
is in your notebook.
