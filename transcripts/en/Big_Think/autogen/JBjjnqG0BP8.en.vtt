in the really old days people had to

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480
in the really old days people had to
 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.810
in the really old days people had to
write their code directly to work on the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820
write their code directly to work on the
 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.730
write their code directly to work on the
hardware they Rock load and store

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740
hardware they Rock load and store
 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.650

instructions to get stuff in and out of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660
instructions to get stuff in and out of
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.810
instructions to get stuff in and out of
memory and they played about with bits

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820
memory and they played about with bits
 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.360
memory and they played about with bits
and bytes and stuff you could do pretty

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.370
and bytes and stuff you could do pretty
 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.339
and bytes and stuff you could do pretty
good work with that but it was very

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349
good work with that but it was very
 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.210
good work with that but it was very
specialized then they figured out that

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
specialized then they figured out that
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.849
specialized then they figured out that
you could build languages fit for humans

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
you could build languages fit for humans
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.329
you could build languages fit for humans
for specific areas like they built

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339
for specific areas like they built
 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.700
for specific areas like they built
Fortran for engineers and sciences and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
Fortran for engineers and sciences and
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.950
Fortran for engineers and sciences and
they built COBOL for for businessmen and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960
they built COBOL for for businessmen and
 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.950
they built COBOL for for businessmen and
then in the mid 60s a bunch of

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960
then in the mid 60s a bunch of
 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.280
then in the mid 60s a bunch of

a language that sort of is fit for

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
a language that sort of is fit for
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.530
a language that sort of is fit for
humans for all domains not just linear

humans for all domains not just linear
 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.260
humans for all domains not just linear
algebra and business and they built

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
algebra and business and they built
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.300
algebra and business and they built
something called Simula and that's where

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310
something called Simula and that's where
 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.940
something called Simula and that's where
they introduced the class is the thing

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950
they introduced the class is the thing
 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.700
they introduced the class is the thing
you have in the programs represent a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
you have in the programs represent a
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.640
you have in the programs represent a
concept in in your application world so

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
concept in in your application world so
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.289

if you're a mathematician the matrix

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
if you're a mathematician the matrix
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.060
if you're a mathematician the matrix
will become a class if you're a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
will become a class if you're a
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.310
will become a class if you're a
businessman a personnel record might

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
businessman a personnel record might
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.279
businessman a personnel record might
become a class in telecommunications a

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289
become a class in telecommunications a
 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.700
become a class in telecommunications a
dial buffer might become a class you can

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
dial buffer might become a class you can
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.249
dial buffer might become a class you can
represent just about anything as a class

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
represent just about anything as a class
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620
represent just about anything as a class
and they went a little bit further and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
and they went a little bit further and
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.419
and they went a little bit further and
represented relationships between

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429
represented relationships between
 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.480
represented relationships between
classes any hierarchical relationship

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
classes any hierarchical relationship
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.080
classes any hierarchical relationship
could be done as a bunch of classes so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
could be done as a bunch of classes so
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.789
could be done as a bunch of classes so
you could say that a fire-engine is a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
you could say that a fire-engine is a
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950
you could say that a fire-engine is a
kind of a truck which is a kind of a car

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
kind of a truck which is a kind of a car
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.719
kind of a truck which is a kind of a car
which is a kind of a vehicle and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
which is a kind of a vehicle and
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.319
which is a kind of a vehicle and
organize things like that this became

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
organize things like that this became
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.029
organize things like that this became
known as object-oriented programming

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039
known as object-oriented programming
 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.300
known as object-oriented programming
also in some variants of it as data

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
also in some variants of it as data
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.719
also in some variants of it as data
abstraction and and my idea was very

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
abstraction and and my idea was very
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.989
abstraction and and my idea was very
simple to take the ideas from simular

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999
simple to take the ideas from simular
 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.879
simple to take the ideas from simular
for general abstraction for the for the

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:55.889
for general abstraction for the for the
 

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:57.859
for general abstraction for the for the
benefit of sort of humans representing

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
benefit of sort of humans representing
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.249
benefit of sort of humans representing
things so humans could get it with the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259
things so humans could get it with the
 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.969
things so humans could get it with the
low-level stuff which at that time was

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
low-level stuff which at that time was
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.489
low-level stuff which at that time was
the best language for that was C which

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499
the best language for that was C which
 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.060
the best language for that was C which
was done at Bell Labs by by Dennis

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070
was done at Bell Labs by by Dennis
 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.550
was done at Bell Labs by by Dennis
Ritchie and take those two ideas and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
Ritchie and take those two ideas and
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620
Ritchie and take those two ideas and
bring them together so that you could do

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630
bring them together so that you could do
 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.240
bring them together so that you could do
high

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
high
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.430
high
abstraction but efficiently enough and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440
abstraction but efficiently enough and
 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.530
abstraction but efficiently enough and
close enough to the hardware for for

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540
close enough to the hardware for for
 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.830
close enough to the hardware for for
really demanding computing tasks and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840
really demanding computing tasks and
 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.660
really demanding computing tasks and
that was where I came in

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670
that was where I came in
 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.860
that was where I came in
and so C++ has classes like similar but

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870
and so C++ has classes like similar but
 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.540
and so C++ has classes like similar but
they run as fast as C code

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550
they run as fast as C code
 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.559
they run as fast as C code
so the combination becomes very useful

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569
 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.229
yeah I say if I have to characterize

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239
yeah I say if I have to characterize
 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.619
yeah I say if I have to characterize
c-plus prices strength it comes from the

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629
c-plus prices strength it comes from the
 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.170
c-plus prices strength it comes from the
ability to have abstractions and have

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180
ability to have abstractions and have
 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.199
ability to have abstractions and have
them so efficient that you can can

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209
them so efficient that you can can
 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.729
them so efficient that you can can
afford it in infrastructure and you can

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739
afford it in infrastructure and you can
 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.330
afford it in infrastructure and you can
access hardware directly as you often

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340
access hardware directly as you often
 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.130
access hardware directly as you often
have to do with operating systems with

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140
have to do with operating systems with
 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.319
have to do with operating systems with
real-time control little things like

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329
real-time control little things like
 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.429
real-time control little things like
cell phones and so the combination is

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439
cell phones and so the combination is
 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.979
cell phones and so the combination is
gives something that is good for for

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989
gives something that is good for for
 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.580
gives something that is good for for
infrastructure in general another aspect

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590
infrastructure in general another aspect
 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.740
infrastructure in general another aspect
that's necessary for infrastructure is

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750
that's necessary for infrastructure is
 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.890
that's necessary for infrastructure is
stability when you build an

stability when you build an
 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.750
stability when you build an
infrastructure it could be sort of the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760
infrastructure it could be sort of the
 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.229

be stable for decade or so because you

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599
be stable for decade or so because you
 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.270
be stable for decade or so because you
can't afford to fiddle with the stuff

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280
can't afford to fiddle with the stuff
 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.309
can't afford to fiddle with the stuff
all the time you can't afford to rewrite

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319
all the time you can't afford to rewrite

it I mean taking one of those ships into
hub or cost a lot of money and so you

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900
hub or cost a lot of money and so you
 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.509
hub or cost a lot of money and so you
need a language that not just good at

two at least C++ is now about three

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
two at least C++ is now about three
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.619
two at least C++ is now about three
decades old and if that's not the case

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629
decades old and if that's not the case
 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.119
decades old and if that's not the case
you have to rewrite your code all the

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129
you have to rewrite your code all the
 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.680
you have to rewrite your code all the
time and that happens primarily with

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690
time and that happens primarily with
 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.230
