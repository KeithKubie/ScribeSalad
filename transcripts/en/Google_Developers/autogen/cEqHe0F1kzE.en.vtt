library with that without you having to
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.060
library with that without you having to
re-release your app so if you push your

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
re-release your app so if you push your
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369
re-release your app so if you push your
app with version 1 of Google Play

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
app with version 1 of Google Play
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.039
app with version 1 of Google Play
services with with AdMob in it and you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
services with with AdMob in it and you
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.140

know that mom makes changes and pushes

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
know that mom makes changes and pushes
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.080

out a v2 onto those devices your app

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
out a v2 onto those devices your app
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000
out a v2 onto those devices your app
will start running v2 and take advantage

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
will start running v2 and take advantage
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.950
will start running v2 and take advantage
of the the latest fixes to the library

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960
of the the latest fixes to the library
 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.780
of the the latest fixes to the library
so you should update to Google Play

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
so you should update to Google Play
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.220
so you should update to Google Play

automatic platform updates which will be
 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.690
automatic platform updates which will be
a huge advantage we'll also just give

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
a huge advantage we'll also just give
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.400

you better api as we've totally revamped
a lot of the API to do things the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300
a lot of the API to do things the
 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.330
a lot of the API to do things the
Android way hopefully you'll find them

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
Android way hopefully you'll find them
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060
Android way hopefully you'll find them
better and more intuitive and then this

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
better and more intuitive and then this
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.140
better and more intuitive and then this
will also be the platform of choice

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
will also be the platform of choice
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.910
will also be the platform of choice
going forward so we won't continue the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
going forward so we won't continue the
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.310

all of our new changes will go to the
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.210
all of our new changes will go to the
Google Play services library so we hope

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
Google Play services library so we hope
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.860
Google Play services library so we hope
that you can upgrade so you can keep

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870

with the latest updates that we have so
now we're going to talk about how to

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190
now we're going to talk about how to
 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.580
now we're going to talk about how to
migrate from the old library to the new

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
migrate from the old library to the new
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.630

Google Play services API s so previously

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640
Google Play services API s so previously
 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.740
Google Play services API s so previously
when integrating the library you just

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
when integrating the library you just
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.080
when integrating the library you just
had a jar and you would put that jar

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
had a jar and you would put that jar
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.810
had a jar and you would put that jar
into the libs folder for AdMob 6 for 1

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
into the libs folder for AdMob 6 for 1
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.270
into the libs folder for AdMob 6 for 1
below and Google Play services you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
below and Google Play services you
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.320
below and Google Play services you
actually have to integrate the Google

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330
actually have to integrate the Google
 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.509
actually have to integrate the Google
Play services library project and then

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519
Play services library project and then
 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.859
Play services library project and then
reference that project into your

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
reference that project into your
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.350
reference that project into your
application so there's a there's a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
application so there's a there's a
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.150
application so there's a there's a
difference there and then you'll also be

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160
difference there and then you'll also be
 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.970
difference there and then you'll also be

have to worry about that when updating
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.100
have to worry about that when updating
your app so now I'm going to talk about

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
your app so now I'm going to talk about
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.760

you created the ad view and the
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.060
you created the ad view and the
constructor you'd pass the activity

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070
constructor you'd pass the activity
 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.500

needs to take the activity context so

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830
needs to take the activity context so
 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.650
needs to take the activity context so
you just create a new ad view with your

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660
you just create a new ad view with your
 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.690
you just create a new ad view with your
activity context and then they're set ad

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700
activity context and then they're set ad
 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.900
activity context and then they're set ad
unit ID and set ad size methods to set

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910
unit ID and set ad size methods to set
 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.990
unit ID and set ad size methods to set
the ad size and pass your edudentity

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000
the ad size and pass your edudentity
 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.920
the ad size and pass your edudentity
note that these should only be called

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930
note that these should only be called
 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.990
note that these should only be called
once if you do it again you'll get an

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000
once if you do it again you'll get an
 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.060
once if you do it again you'll get an
illegal State exception but there should

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070
illegal State exception but there should
 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.620
illegal State exception but there should
be no reason you have to call it more

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630
be no reason you have to call it more
 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.480
be no reason you have to call it more
than once when you create an ad request

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490
than once when you create an ad request
 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.490
than once when you create an ad request
you will no longer be creating this ad

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500
you will no longer be creating this ad
 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.380
you will no longer be creating this ad
request and then adding a test device or

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390
request and then adding a test device or
 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.970
request and then adding a test device or
doing these other changes directly to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980
doing these other changes directly to
 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.220
doing these other changes directly to
the ad request instead we've moved to

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230
the ad request instead we've moved to
 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.400
the ad request instead we've moved to
the Builder paradigm so you'll create an

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410
the Builder paradigm so you'll create an
 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.590
the Builder paradigm so you'll create an
ad request builder everything you'll do

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600
ad request builder everything you'll do
 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.240
ad request builder everything you'll do
will be done to this builder the builder

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250
will be done to this builder the builder
 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.880
will be done to this builder the builder
is an immutable object so everything you

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890
is an immutable object so everything you
 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.800
is an immutable object so everything you
do to it will actually be creating a new

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810
do to it will actually be creating a new
 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.360
do to it will actually be creating a new
builder so you won't be able to mess

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
builder so you won't be able to mess
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.530
builder so you won't be able to mess
things up in the middle of running your

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540
things up in the middle of running your
 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.330
things up in the middle of running your
application and then once you've

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
application and then once you've
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.980
application and then once you've
actually made all of your changes of the

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990
actually made all of your changes of the
 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.720
actually made all of your changes of the
builder for example adding a test of ice

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730
builder for example adding a test of ice
 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.670
builder for example adding a test of ice
then you actually build a builder to

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680
then you actually build a builder to
 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.729
then you actually build a builder to
create the ad request we should also

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739
create the ad request we should also
 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.650
create the ad request we should also
note that the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660
note that the
 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.199
note that the
identifier to get test ads on emulators

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209
identifier to get test ads on emulators
 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.540
identifier to get test ads on emulators
changed from ad request test emulator to

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550
changed from ad request test emulator to
 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.570
changed from ad request test emulator to
ad request a device ID emulator next

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580
ad request a device ID emulator next
 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.920
ad request a device ID emulator next
we'll talk about creating a new ad

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930
we'll talk about creating a new ad
 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.710
we'll talk about creating a new ad
listener object so we changed the ad

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720
listener object so we changed the ad
 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.450
listener object so we changed the ad
listener object previously in the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460
listener object previously in the
 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.490
listener object previously in the
standalone SDK the ad listener object

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500
standalone SDK the ad listener object
 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.620
standalone SDK the ad listener object
was an interface so you would extend

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630
was an interface so you would extend
 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.900
was an interface so you would extend
your activity with this ad listener

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910
your activity with this ad listener
 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.340
your activity with this ad listener
object and implement all of these

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350
object and implement all of these
 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.470
object and implement all of these
methods in order to track what's going

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480
methods in order to track what's going
 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.840
methods in order to track what's going
on now in the new Google Play services

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850
on now in the new Google Play services
 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.790
on now in the new Google Play services
version we have an abstract class and

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800
version we have an abstract class and
 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.190
version we have an abstract class and
you'll be able to actually just create

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200
you'll be able to actually just create
 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.990
you'll be able to actually just create
that an ad listener object on the fly

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000
that an ad listener object on the fly
 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.300
that an ad listener object on the fly
override the methods that you need and

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310
override the methods that you need and
 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.270
override the methods that you need and
leave all of the rest alone one thing to

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280
leave all of the rest alone one thing to
 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.980
leave all of the rest alone one thing to
note is that we've changed the error

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990
note is that we've changed the error
 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.830
note is that we've changed the error
code so now the error code is just an

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840
code so now the error code is just an
 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.450
code so now the error code is just an
integer and you'll have to create a new

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460
integer and you'll have to create a new
 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.890
integer and you'll have to create a new
method in order to extract meaning from

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900
method in order to extract meaning from
 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.560
method in order to extract meaning from
that integer the other thing is that

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570
that integer the other thing is that
 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.590
that integer the other thing is that
we've changed all of the names of the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600
we've changed all of the names of the
 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.080
we've changed all of the names of the
methods so on receive add is now on add

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090
methods so on receive add is now on add
 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.960
methods so on receive add is now on add
loaded on fail to receive add is now on

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970
loaded on fail to receive add is now on
 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.890
loaded on fail to receive add is now on
failed on add fail to load and all of

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900
failed on add fail to load and all of
 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.580
failed on add fail to load and all of
these changes are just one-to-one you it

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590
these changes are just one-to-one you it
 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.530
these changes are just one-to-one you it
shouldn't be difficult to change from

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540
shouldn't be difficult to change from
 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.820
shouldn't be difficult to change from
one to the other and then all of the

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830
one to the other and then all of the
 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.410
one to the other and then all of the
methods name will be more consistent

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420
methods name will be more consistent
 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.890
methods name will be more consistent
with the Android way of doing things so

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900
with the Android way of doing things so
 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.730
with the Android way of doing things so
now I'm going to talk about the

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740
now I'm going to talk about the
 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.920
now I'm going to talk about the
implementation of an ad listener and

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930
implementation of an ad listener and
 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.090
implementation of an ad listener and
setting it on the ad view

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100
setting it on the ad view
 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.940
setting it on the ad view
so when we had the interface your class

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950
so when we had the interface your class
 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.260
so when we had the interface your class
that implemented the ad listener would

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270
that implemented the ad listener would
 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.780
that implemented the ad listener would
have to implement all of the method the

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790
have to implement all of the method the
 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.000
have to implement all of the method the
add event methods in that interface and

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010
add event methods in that interface and
 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.370
add event methods in that interface and
then finally called a view dot set add

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380
then finally called a view dot set add
 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.930
then finally called a view dot set add
listener with the object that

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940
listener with the object that
 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.420
listener with the object that
implemented the add listener and Google

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430
implemented the add listener and Google
 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.190
implemented the add listener and Google
Play services we use an abstract class

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200
Play services we use an abstract class
 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.440
Play services we use an abstract class
and so you can actually just call a bead

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450
and so you can actually just call a bead
 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.690
and so you can actually just call a bead
set add listener and create a new add

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700
set add listener and create a new add
 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.660
set add listener and create a new add
listener and inline like a sub class and

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670
listener and inline like a sub class and
 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.180
listener and inline like a sub class and
just override the events that you care

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190
just override the events that you care
 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.030
just override the events that you care
about so in this example we have on add

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040
about so in this example we have on add
 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.620
about so in this example we have on add
loaded and on add failed to load

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630
loaded and on add failed to load
 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.630
loaded and on add failed to load
implemented but we don't have to

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640
implemented but we don't have to
 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.150
implemented but we don't have to
implement the rest of the methods here

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160
implement the rest of the methods here
 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.320
implement the rest of the methods here
next we'll talk about creating an ad

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330
next we'll talk about creating an ad
 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.990
next we'll talk about creating an ad
view in XML previously you were able to

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000
view in XML previously you were able to
 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.760
view in XML previously you were able to
do everything in the XML if you wanted

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770
do everything in the XML if you wanted
 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.120
do everything in the XML if you wanted
to have a very simple ad view now we'll

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130
to have a very simple ad view now we'll
 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.439
to have a very simple ad view now we'll
have to actually write a little bit of

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449
have to actually write a little bit of
 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.210
have to actually write a little bit of
code but first let's talk about the

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220
code but first let's talk about the
 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.909
code but first let's talk about the
changes in the XML so the main changes

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919
changes in the XML so the main changes
 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.969
changes in the XML so the main changes
in the XML are that you'll have to you

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979
in the XML are that you'll have to you
 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.830
in the XML are that you'll have to you
won't be able to use add test devices

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840
won't be able to use add test devices
 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.950
won't be able to use add test devices
and add load on create in your XML so

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960
and add load on create in your XML so
 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.270
and add load on create in your XML so
you'll have to add a test device in the

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280
you'll have to add a test device in the
 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.400
you'll have to add a test device in the
code and you also won't be able to just

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410
code and you also won't be able to just
 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.230
code and you also won't be able to just
load an ad on create in the XML you'll

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240
load an ad on create in the XML you'll
 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.120
load an ad on create in the XML you'll
have to remove those attributes the

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130
have to remove those attributes the
 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.800
have to remove those attributes the
other thing to notice is that you'll

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810
other thing to notice is that you'll
 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.640
other thing to notice is that you'll
have to change your name space from libs

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650
have to change your name space from libs
 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.240
have to change your name space from libs

going to talk to you about the changes
 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.430
going to talk to you about the changes
in the code yep so that changes in the

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440
in the code yep so that changes in the
 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.469
in the code yep so that changes in the
code for the XML LabVIEW and Google Play

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479
code for the XML LabVIEW and Google Play
 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.990
code for the XML LabVIEW and Google Play
services is you'll have to grab the add

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000
services is you'll have to grab the add
 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.839
services is you'll have to grab the add
view from the XML creating new ad

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849
view from the XML creating new ad
 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:12.420
view from the XML creating new ad
request via the Builder pattern and call

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430
request via the Builder pattern and call
 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.000
request via the Builder pattern and call
load ad with that ad request as Amy

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010
load ad with that ad request as Amy
 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.219
load ad with that ad request as Amy
mentioned in 6.4 that one there was

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229
mentioned in 6.4 that one there was
 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.080
mentioned in 6.4 that one there was
actually no code required if you had

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090
actually no code required if you had
 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.850
actually no code required if you had
used the load on create attribute to be

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860
used the load on create attribute to be
 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.150
used the load on create attribute to be
true but also note that if you want to

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160
true but also note that if you want to
 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.040
true but also note that if you want to
do anything more complicated like set an

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.050
do anything more complicated like set an
 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.320
do anything more complicated like set an
ad listener you'll still need to write

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330
ad listener you'll still need to write
 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.930
ad listener you'll still need to write
some code in both either 6:41 for Google

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940
some code in both either 6:41 for Google
 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.330
some code in both either 6:41 for Google
Play services and that hasn't changed

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340
Play services and that hasn't changed
 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.439
Play services and that hasn't changed
now we'll talk about the add view

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449
now we'll talk about the add view
 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:37.649
now we'll talk about the add view
lifecycle methods so previously in the

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:37.659
lifecycle methods so previously in the
 

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:40.290
lifecycle methods so previously in the
standalone SDK we only had V dot destroy

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:40.300
standalone SDK we only had V dot destroy
 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.469
standalone SDK we only had V dot destroy
now we have add V destroy Abdullah pause

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:43.479
now we have add V destroy Abdullah pause
 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:46.770
now we have add V destroy Abdullah pause
and add be resumed these methods are all

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:46.780
and add be resumed these methods are all
 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.529
and add be resumed these methods are all
allow you to destroy pause or resume a

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:49.539
allow you to destroy pause or resume a
 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:50.969
allow you to destroy pause or resume a
webview so this gives you a little bit

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:50.979
webview so this gives you a little bit
 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:52.860
webview so this gives you a little bit
more control over what's actually going

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:52.870
more control over what's actually going
 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.700
more control over what's actually going
on in your life cycle and I'm going to

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:56.710
on in your life cycle and I'm going to
 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.159
on in your life cycle and I'm going to
talk about passing extras to AdMob you

00:07:59.159 --> 00:07:59.169
talk about passing extras to AdMob you
 

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:00.689
talk about passing extras to AdMob you
can do things like set the background

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:00.699
can do things like set the background
 

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:02.610
can do things like set the background
color and text of your ad and that would

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:02.620
color and text of your ad and that would
 

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.490
color and text of your ad and that would
be done through extras so in 641 you

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:05.500
be done through extras so in 641 you
 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.960
be done through extras so in 641 you
would create the new ad request you

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:06.970
would create the new ad request you
 

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.700
would create the new ad request you
would create a new AdMob adapter extras

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:08.710
would create a new AdMob adapter extras
 

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.390
would create a new AdMob adapter extras
object and pass the occult add extra and

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400
object and pass the occult add extra and
 

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.520
object and pass the occult add extra and
pass like key value pairs for like

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:14.530
pass like key value pairs for like
 

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.040
pass like key value pairs for like
background color and text for example

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.050
background color and text for example
 

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.330
background color and text for example
and then call set Network extras with

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:18.340
and then call set Network extras with
 

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.140
and then call set Network extras with
that object

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.150
that object
 

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.909
that object
in Google Play services it's done a

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:20.919
in Google Play services it's done a
 

00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:22.950
in Google Play services it's done a
little bit differently you have an AdMob

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960
little bit differently you have an AdMob
 

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.750
little bit differently you have an AdMob
extras instead of an AdMob adapter

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:24.760
extras instead of an AdMob adapter
 

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.120
extras instead of an AdMob adapter
extras and it accepts a bundle which you

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.130
extras and it accepts a bundle which you
 

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.590
extras and it accepts a bundle which you
have to create before you create the

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:28.600
have to create before you create the
 

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.960
have to create before you create the
AdMob extras class um so you create a

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:30.970
AdMob extras class um so you create a
 

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.899
AdMob extras class um so you create a
new bundle put string on your key value

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:33.909
new bundle put string on your key value
 

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.740
new bundle put string on your key value
pairs create the AdMob extras object and

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:37.750
pairs create the AdMob extras object and
 

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.690
pairs create the AdMob extras object and
then finally when you're creating the ad

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:39.700
then finally when you're creating the ad
 

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.760
then finally when you're creating the ad
request using the Builder pattern you

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:41.770
request using the Builder pattern you
 

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.740
request using the Builder pattern you
just call add Network extras with those

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:43.750
just call add Network extras with those
 

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.740
just call add Network extras with those
extras and build in so we know we've

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:46.750
extras and build in so we know we've
 

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.900
extras and build in so we know we've
made a lot of changes to the SDK so

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:48.910
made a lot of changes to the SDK so
 

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.240
made a lot of changes to the SDK so
there's been a couple questions we're

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.250
there's been a couple questions we're
 

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.440
there's been a couple questions we're
going to address three of the most

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:52.450
going to address three of the most
 

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.840
going to address three of the most
frequently asked questions the first one

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:54.850
frequently asked questions the first one
 

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.240
frequently asked questions the first one
is does Google Play services support

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.250
is does Google Play services support
 

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.550
is does Google Play services support
existing mediation adapters the answer

00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560
existing mediation adapters the answer
 

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.710
existing mediation adapters the answer
is yes we've made sure that none of your

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720
is yes we've made sure that none of your
 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.540
is yes we've made sure that none of your
mediation should break so if you upgrade

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:03.550
mediation should break so if you upgrade
 

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.519
mediation should break so if you upgrade
the Google Play services today all of

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:05.529
the Google Play services today all of
 

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:07.010
the Google Play services today all of
your mediation should work as expected

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:07.020
your mediation should work as expected
 

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.260
your mediation should work as expected
the mediation adapters will be the same

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:10.270
the mediation adapters will be the same
 

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.970
the mediation adapters will be the same
for a long time in the future if we do

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:11.980
for a long time in the future if we do
 

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.579
for a long time in the future if we do
iterate on mediation and expect

00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:14.589
iterate on mediation and expect
 

00:09:14.589 --> 00:09:16.710
iterate on mediation and expect
mediation adapters to update we still

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720
mediation adapters to update we still
 

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.990
mediation adapters to update we still
plan on supporting legacy mediation for

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000
plan on supporting legacy mediation for
 

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.450
plan on supporting legacy mediation for
quite a while in the future the next

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:21.460
quite a while in the future the next
 

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.710
quite a while in the future the next
question you guys have had is will

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720
question you guys have had is will
 

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.840
question you guys have had is will
Google Play services API is work on

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:24.850
Google Play services API is work on
 

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.030
Google Play services API is work on
devices without Google Play services

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040
devices without Google Play services
 

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.540

installed and it does the only

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:30.550
installed and it does the only
 

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.980
installed and it does the only
difference is that you won't get to take

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:31.990
difference is that you won't get to take
 

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.290
difference is that you won't get to take
advantage of the auto updates so if you

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.300
advantage of the auto updates so if you
 

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.630
advantage of the auto updates so if you

question is if Google Play services is

00:09:59.699 --> 00:09:59.709
question is if Google Play services is
 

00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:02.040
question is if Google Play services is
compatible with the old standalone AdMob

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.050
compatible with the old standalone AdMob
 

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.250
compatible with the old standalone AdMob
SDK the answer is no unfortunately this

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:05.260
SDK the answer is no unfortunately this
 

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.140
SDK the answer is no unfortunately this
was a side effect of trying to keep

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.150
was a side effect of trying to keep
 

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.960
was a side effect of trying to keep
mediation compatible with the new SDK

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:08.970
mediation compatible with the new SDK
 

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.480
mediation compatible with the new SDK
however you should expect DFP and search

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:12.490
however you should expect DFP and search
 

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.810
however you should expect DFP and search
ads for apps and everything else now in

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:15.820
ads for apps and everything else now in
 

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.810
ads for apps and everything else now in
the new Google Play services SDK so you

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:18.820
the new Google Play services SDK so you
 

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.490
the new Google Play services SDK so you
shouldn't lose any of that functionality

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:20.500
shouldn't lose any of that functionality
 

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.660
shouldn't lose any of that functionality
I should be able to upgrade everything

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:21.670
I should be able to upgrade everything
 

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.090
I should be able to upgrade everything
to Google Play services the other thing

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:24.100
to Google Play services the other thing
 

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.860
to Google Play services the other thing
is if you are working with a library

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:25.870
is if you are working with a library
 

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.370
is if you are working with a library
that's dependent on the old SDK then we
