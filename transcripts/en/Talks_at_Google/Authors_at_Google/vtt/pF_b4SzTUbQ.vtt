00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.640
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, David, for many years, was
a senior editor for Internet technology at

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.690
Fortune Magazine and he did a number of cover
stories on Internet giants and tech giants,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.460
like Microsoft and IBM and Intel. And David's
latest project is an inside look, with the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.320
support of Facebook's executives, at Facebook
and it's something that I'm sure you're all

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.320
familiar with.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.440
Facebook, as we know, started in Mark Zuckerberg's
dorm room and in the last six years has really

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.230
skyrocketed to a site that has over five hundred
million members worldwide. So, David has written

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.760
a book that gives us an inside look at not
only Facebook and the evolution of that company,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.380
but how the concept of connecting people is
really changing the world. So, without further

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.489
ado, please welcome David Kirkpatrick. Thank
you.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.489
[applause]

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.310
&gt;&gt;David: I also wrote one of the very first
pieces about your company in October of 1999,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.730
which resulted when Larry and Sergey were
on a road trip without any PR person at all.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.659
They sat down with me in a conference room
and was telling what this thing is and it

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.139
was one of the very first pieces that kinda
put the stake in the ground that what Google

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:27.450
was doing was significantly different and
extremely youthful. So, yeah, I've been writing

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.069
about tech for a long time and--

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.270
[clears throat]

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.969
a lot of people, if you ask, "Why did I want
to write a book about Facebook?" And--

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.459
[clears throat]

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:44.009
it really rose from all the history I had
of writing about Google and Microsoft and,

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.909
and other companies that are closely related.
And, and recognizing at moderately early point,

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.450
that Facebook was s-, s-, unusual, first of
all. Just plain unusual.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.639
And I still think Facebook is extremely unusual
in a number of respects, many, several of

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.419
which are not fully enough understood, although
I hit on them pretty hard in my book. So,

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:11.221
its part of the reason, I think, I wrote the
book was to try to emphasize that Facebook

00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:17.720
is a truly unusual company. I would say that
also applies to Google, obviously. But there,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.590
there are many things about Facebook that
even Google doesn't exactly echo, or Facebook

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.519
doesn't echo Google, since Google was the
predecessor.

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.099
And we can talk about those maybe more in
the Q&amp;A; although I'm sure I'll hit on some

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.180
of them as I go through this. But, so, in
addition, so Facebook, when I first started

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.530
looking at it in the summer of 2006, was pretty
much stereotyped by me and by everyone as,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.489
more or less, a plaything for kids. And I
thought of it that way, too. And kids being

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.719
in college students, by that point they were
also being used a lot in high schools and

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.849
I honestly hadn't given in that much thought,
even though there was some minor awareness

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.000
in the back of my mind that it had kind of
been coming on moderately strong.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.829
I'm based in New York, so I think if I had
been out here, I might have been slightly

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.310
more aware of it at that point. Anyway, so
a PR person for Facebook called me in August

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.040
of '06 and said did I want to meet Mark Zuckerberg?
And I said, "Yes, of course, why not?" I mean,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.280
I knew he was interesting. I knew something,
you know I had met with a lot of CEOs of tech

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.641
companies at that time and throughout the
time of my work at Fortune, and I don't work

00:03:31.641 --> 00:03:32.989
at Fortune anymore, by the way.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:41.090
So, I, I joined him for lunch at an Italian
restaurant in Midtown on, I think it was September

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.120
6th, 2006. And that date is somewhat significant,
if that's the correct date, but whatever day

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.659
it was, it was significant because it was
at the very height of the newsfeed controversy.

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:54.659
And--

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.659
[audience member clears throat]

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.560
it had only been a few days earlier that the
newsfeed had launched and those of you who

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.749
are students of Facebook will recall that,
you, you may think they've had a privacy controversy

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:14.219
recently, but in September of 2006, ten percent
of all their members were actively protesting

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.999
the change they had just introduced.

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:22.190
Now, they only had nine million members, but
close to a million of them were actively protesting

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.750
the introduction of the newsfeed. Now that,
in retrospect, seems kind of odd, considering

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.240
that anyone who uses Facebook knows that the
newsfeed is kind of its central feature without

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.000
which it would, more or less, feel pretty
useless.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.590
However, when it was introduced, the members
did not like it and even all those, there

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.760
was hardly anybody to be found who liked it
in its first days. So, there was this huge

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760
protest underway--

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.060
[clears throat]

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.100
have lunch with Zuckerberg, he walks into
the restaurant, he'd been up most of the night

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.330
before writing his famous letter of apology
to his members, in which he was announcing

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.900
that they were making changes and adding some
relatively minor, but, by the way, privacy

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.700
tweaks that allowed you to have a little more
control of how the newsfeed data flowed inside

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.130
Facebook.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.260
But what was really amazing to me, particularly
in retrospect, once I sort of digested what,

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.330
what had happened, was that he didn't even
really want to talk about the controversy.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.280
He treated it as, more or less, a minor matter.
He wasn't focused on it in our meeting whatsoever.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.450
He was focused entirely on the long term view;
the big picture significance of the service

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.040
that he was creating. How it was here for
the duration, how it was about to launch only

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.780
a few weeks after that for all adults of any,
people of any age over 13, so that hadn't

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.790
quite happened. It was still just for students
of high schools and colleges at the time when

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.340
I met him, but they did what they called "open
registration" in, about three weeks later.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.690
They did delay it a few weeks because of all
the controversy over the newsfeed, but especially

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.090
in retrospect, after I was thinking about
the meeting and, and paid more attention to

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.970
what was happening in the controversy, I,--
I. just-- in the days after I, I had lunch

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.300
with him, I, it, it, it struck me very strongly
that it was extraordinary that he was not

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.160
feeling the slightest bit burdened by this,
this whole problem.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.360
And as time passed that seemed even more extraordinary
and, and looking back I think it's very indicative

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.990
of the way Mark Zuckerberg thinks. And I also
really felt that he was a leader and a and

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:47.680
a thinker and a big picture visionary of a
sort that really doesn't come along very often

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.140
in the technology industry. And I, I do have
the privilege; somebody can move my coat and

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.180
somebody can sit there, by the way, if you
wanna fit more people in.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.480
But I, I knew Bill Gates pretty well. I talked
to Larry and Sergey, I mean, I knew the people

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.950
who did this kinda stuff and he seemed to
me like one of th-, the greats of the order

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:13.410
of magnitude of those people, you know? And
it was, really, --the scope of the vision,

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:21.080
the v-, --big picture way of thinking and
the ambition. Now, at that time, you couldn't

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:28.050
say that he had executed on it to a superbly
impressive extent at this point, you'd have

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.530
to give him credit for that, I think'd say.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:35.840
And he still, more or less, thinks primarily
about the long term and the big picture, by

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.880
the way, which is kind of interesting and
in fact, I think if you were to really get

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.990
inside his head, wh-, which I have done a
tiny bit in recent weeks about what just has

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.610
happened with the changes they announced at
f8 a; and the intr-, the reaction that the

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:59.490
world had; and the, the privacy advocates
had; and Chuck Schumer and, and Al Franken

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.930
and the other Senators who wrote letters to
Facebook had,. dDespite all that, in his head

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:10.330
it's a minor perturbation in a much bigger,
long term thing, you know? Yes, he took a

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.330
few steps back.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:16.450
Five steps forward, half a step back is kinda
the way I think about the way he operates

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.200
in these situations. He doesn't really surrender
very much and he didn't really surrender very

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.840
much recently, just as he didn't in the newsfeed
controversy. I mean, what he did was he basically

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:34.110
changed and made a significant percentage
of the data that had been forcibly exposed

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:41.590
on Facebook opt in,. nNo, no, he gave you
an opt out. That's what he did, which wasn't

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.080
even available for things like hiding your
friends list, right?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.800
But, in reality, the number of people who
were gonna use, take that option and use the

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.090
opt out is infinitesimal in the scale of the
500 million users of Facebook that they have

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:01.870
roughly at the moment. Growing a million a
day, thereabouts, I mean, people at Google

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.850
probably aren't as in need of being told some
of the basics about Facebook, as most of the

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:11.910
audiences I speak to, but we can talk about
the numbers and all that stuff if you want.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.740
I mean, Facebook's growth is extraordinary.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.900
Facebook's social penetration in countries
around the world is extraordinary. It is predominantly

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.200
not an American service, just in case you
hadn't focused in on that, even though there's

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:35.280
130 million Americans on Facebook. There are
500 million. And in countries like UK, Canada,

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.090
little countries like Iceland, big countries
like Turkey and Indonesia.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.980
The percentage of users, if you put people
who are on the Internet, is much higher than

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.640
it is in the United States. Like, in the UK
and Canada, the percentage of the total population

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.270
that's on Facebook is substantially higher
than in the United States; in the --40 per-,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:58.940
mid for-, mid to low, --low to mid 40s of
a percent of a total population of everybody

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:06.020
from age zero to dead, whereas the United
States, it's only, only, like 34, 35 percent,

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.170
something like that, of all people.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:14.671
But then, in a country like Indonesia, only
maybe ten percent, fifteen percent of the

00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:20.540
population is even on the Internet. Almost
all of them are on Facebook and that's more

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:26.240
or less true in an awful lot of countries
that many Americans, I mean, don't, don't

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.760
think much, or nearly enough, about. And Turkey
is a good example. I think Tur-, --I think

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:38.860
now, --Indonesia might have just become Facebook's
third largest country after the US and the

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.760
UK. It was formerly Turkey, so those countries
are especially interesting. I don't even know

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.310
exactly why it's those countries that have
picked up so much, but I will say that those

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.960
are the kinds of countries that Facebook is
most targeting right now for its growth, which

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.850
is the whole world, the most populist countries,
regardless of where they are.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:06.480
And actually my, my very lengthy outline of
my talk here has global down at the bottom,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.970
--but since I'm talking about that, --one
of the things that is interesting to think

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:18.690
about with Facebook is, now if you look at
what is Mark Zuckerberg's personal goal for

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.960
his service and what is the strategic direction
that Facebook, itself, considers itself to

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.670
be pursuing.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:34.520
One aspect of it is a word that they do actually
use, which is "ubiquity." And, it's a somewhat

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.220
hubristic notion for most companies, although
probably not for yours,. bBut there are not

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.180
too many companies that it wouldn't be hubristic
even to talk about such a thing, but at Facebook

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.170
it is certainly not, considering that in six
years they've already gotten about a third

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.320
of all the people in the world who are on
the Internet to use this thing actively.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.620
But the vision is to basically provide, and
so let me just talk about the vision and then

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:06.380
I'll get back to a, a global point. Facebook's
strategy is long term, not really to get the

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:13.900
whole world using Facebook, but to transform
itself into infrastructure. So that all the

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.710
changes that they announced at the recent
FAf8 Conference in which their platform was,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:25.140
effectively, for the first time, very aggressively
extended to s-, the, to be usable by sites

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:31.660
and, and, and, --and, --and partners outside
of Facebook's own confines. That was very

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.630
strongly indicative of the company's long
term strategic direction.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:40.120
Their goal, I mean, fir--, I don't think they
believe, --I don't think Mark Zuckerberg believes

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:47.330
that he can really win, or even really survive,
by competing with all of the competitors that

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:53.110
are inevitably gonna target him over time
as his company gets such massive footprint

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:58.029
in scale in terms of usage. Like, the company
they think about a lot right now, for example,

00:12:58.029 --> 00:12:59.470
is Foursquare, you know?

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:04.470
This kinda thing scares them because little
companies with really good ideas that do related

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:11.370
things can come on extremely quickly and get
a lot of enthusiasm really fast and in the

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:17.530
long run, --the sort of legacy problem, --the
thing that you could argue is, has been in

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:25.480
the process of killing Microsoft for ten years,
is gonna, --if Facebook just stays facebook.com,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.420
--it will kill it at some point. That's, --to
me, --a given. However, and I think that's

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:36.710
a given to them, too, and to Mark in particular.
However, they have a unique opportunity--

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:37.710
[clears throat]

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.940
because of their scale and because of the
nature of what they do and because of the

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:48.310
fact that they have uniquely convinced people
to make Facebook into an identity repository

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:54.779
for personal data and a repository for connectivity
for the "social graph," as they call it, the

00:13:54.779 --> 00:14:01.100
network of relationships among your friends;
the friends of any member of Facebook.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.370
That is their core asset;. tThe fact that
they have convinced you to put your data in

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:12.020
there and to articulate your friend relationships.
And so,, the strategy is to turn the whole

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.421
thing into infrastructure, to go beneath the
surface of the Internet, you know?

00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:20.880
And if there's any other commercial company
that's ever succeeded at anything like that,

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:27.020
it is your own, although, Google still operates
kind of above the surface of the Internet

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:33.460
with a website, but in reality, the nature
of its use is almost, arguably, infrastructural

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:39.649
just because of the overwhelming ubiquity
practically of people who do use the service.

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:43.120
But I don't think, I don't know whether Google
has ever actually thought of it quite this

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.830
way and I don't think it's quite as appropriate,
but in, in Facebook's case, they believe that

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:55.660
if they can effectively extend their platform
for the usage of anyone, my website, your

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:04.960
personal website, cocacola.com, usgov, dot
gov, whatever,. any, a Any entity, then they

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:11.040
have a unique set of assets that are truly
valuable employed anywhere on the Internet

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.580
in order to bring your friend relationships
with you and turn any experience social.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:22.930
And it, to really extend that to the ultimate
extent, if you believe, --as I do, --you know,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.160
it's ar-, it's obvious to probably most of
you, the Internet is becoming a mobile device

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.640
phenomenon. The Internet is increasingly going
to be with us everywhere. I mean, I used Google

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.420
Maps like three times on my way here.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.870
And, and that's, that's, , I actually probably
use Google more on this device now than on

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:45.890
my laptop, --which is my other computer, --which
now that I have an iPad and this and it, I

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.050
mean, I actually really do use the laptop
less. The mobile things, alright, this is

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:54.589
not, —this is not surprising to you, but
anyways. So, but if you think of it that way

00:15:54.589 --> 00:16:00.120
and you take, take these devices a few more
steps in their logical evolutionary direction,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.750
I haven't stood in line for the iPhone4 yet,
but I will. And then I'll get the smaller

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:10.330
one and the faster one and the one that you
guys do with HTC or whatever, and the world

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.330
will, I believe.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:16.470
So, if that's true then, basically, this thing
Facebook wants to do, which is to be a, a

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:21.430
tool that partners with you wherever you go
on the Internet, it's gonna be everywhere

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.040
you go. It's gonna be your whole life, potentially.
That's the goal. I mean, I'm sure that's the

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.620
goal, Google thinks about, too, and you're
doing a pretty good job of it. But Facebook,

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:41.180
--Facebook would like to be a, --a tool that
you employ regardless of what you're doing.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.300
Period.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.810
And, --I know, I, some, on--one way I try
to explain that in terms of, "What would that

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:54.030
mean?" you should be able to and you should
will and Google's working on aspects of this,

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:58.970
too, just walk down the street, turn your
device on or just glance at your device, which

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:04.610
will probably always be on and learn whether
there's anything in the vicinity that was

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:09.879
of interest to your friends. Not to mention
any of your friends that might be in the vicinity.

00:17:09.879 --> 00:17:13.689
If you choose to have that kind of information
given to you, it will be trivially easy to

00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:18.600
provide that to you in the architecture that
we're building in the Internet and that Facebook

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.600
is a key, critical component of, in my opinion.
And because they are the ones who have those

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.600
friend connections.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.230
OKOk, so, that's the goal. That's the dr-,--
and, --and so they don't think they can compete

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:36.799
as a website. And their str-, , their corporate
strategy is to diminish their role as facebook.com

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:41.989
website and to transit their role to the far
more defensible, strategic position of being

00:17:41.989 --> 00:17:46.789
infrastructure, which nobody but them could
do currently. And therefore, they wannat to

00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:53.080
get, --as quickly as possible, --to that place
where they are, where they are underneath

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.750
the surface doing a unique set of functions
that no one else could tr-, mimic.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.299
[beeping noise]

00:17:59.299 --> 00:18:05.269
And in a minute, if I don't f-, f-, remember,
remind me to talk about the policy and governmental

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:09.659
implications of that because I find them quite
interesting. aAnd there's not a slam dunk

00:18:09.659 --> 00:18:14.429
that they're gonna get from here to there.
However, OKok, going back to the global point,

00:18:14.429 --> 00:18:22.710
if their goal is global ubiquity, there is
one fundamental problem I think. I think it's

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:27.550
interesting to think about probably especially
for you here at Google, that they have to

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:33.820
solve, and that is China. bBecause China is
where the world's largest mass of Internet

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:40.169
users reside. aAnd if Facebook seeks to be
in-, infrastructure for the Internet, you

00:18:40.169 --> 00:18:44.480
can't succeed at that if the largest group
of Internet users aren't using you.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:50.730
And so, Mark even said at a speech he gave
this week, I think he said Russia, China,

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:56.639
Japan, and one other country, --I forget which
one it was, --are their primary strategic

00:18:56.639 --> 00:19:01.499
growth targets right now and basically, their
primary strategic targets. But it's interesting

00:19:01.499 --> 00:19:05.009
that even he says that, considering Facebook
doesn't even operate at all in China right

00:19:05.009 --> 00:19:10.489
now. It's turned off by the government. Or,
no, it isn't turned off by the government,

00:19:10.489 --> 00:19:13.179
well, maybe it is, but Facebook hasn't even
really tried.

00:19:13.179 --> 00:19:18.289
At one point maybe they had, I don't know,
75 thousand, 100 thousand users in China.

00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:23.110
Not millions, I don't believe. Now, only people
that use Facebook in China are government

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:27.710
employees and maybe 20 thousand of them or
30 thousand, but Facebook's effectively not

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:34.200
used in China. Their, their dilemma here is
not at all dissimilar to yours, which is it's

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.160
a company committed to the free flow of information.
How do you operate in a country that is not

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.850
committed to the free flow of information?

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.690
That is the largest company in the world on
the Internet and I wish you luck in resolving

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.769
that problem and to them, too. But I will
just tell you that's something they're thinking

00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:56.909
about right really hard at Facebook. So, lemme
see how much time I've already eaten up, but

00:19:56.909 --> 00:20:04.820
I wanna wrap it fairly soon. But, just let
me quickly say what I think Facebook does

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:14.809
that makes it different. I see it as a viral
communications tool that, in some ways, can

00:20:14.809 --> 00:20:19.340
be defined as the next phase of communication
beyond email.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:24.539
That's an extreme statement in some peoples
opinion, but I believe there's something fundamentally

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:31.859
different about the way that Facebook's communications
architecture was designed, which allows you

00:20:31.859 --> 00:20:38.351
to, --essentially, I mean, --basically they
turned people into RSS feeds kind of, to think

00:20:38.351 --> 00:20:41.470
of it technically. And, and that was new.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.379
That was very, very new and it was putting
out the newsfeed that enabled them to do that.

00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:51.929
And, and, another aside, I'm a big aside guy.
I'm not a very linear thinker, but it's an

00:20:51.929 --> 00:20:52.929
irony.

00:20:52.929 --> 00:20:57.539
All the comparisons between Twitter and Facebook
and how Facebook took so much from Twitter

00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:02.239
a couple years ago; a year and a half, two
years ago. And they more or less tried to,

00:21:02.239 --> 00:21:07.100
to co-opt their business by building, which
they failed to do, --by the way, --but they

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.009
certainly took the features and put them in
Facebook.

00:21:10.009 --> 00:21:14.109
But in reality, Twitter borrowed enormously
from Facebook in its fundamental design from

00:21:14.109 --> 00:21:19.889
day one because Facebook pioneered this notion
of a feed about people, which Twitter is also

00:21:19.889 --> 00:21:26.840
built around. That was a huge innovation that
Facebook, Zuckerberg, pioneered in, in September

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.720
of 2006, when I met him.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:35.669
So, but what it does, --if I, the way I look
at it is, --all communication between people

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:41.520
pretty much, certainly ordinary people, before
Facebook came along was based, were based

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:47.850
around an outbound effort to communicate.
So, I would send a letter to you, a telegram,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:52.889
make a phone call, make an outbound effort
to communicate. Facebook doesn't require that.

00:21:52.889 --> 00:21:59.749
Facebook sets up a scenario where people subscribe
to one another and all you do as a user is

00:21:59.749 --> 00:22:05.809
act. You just say, "I'm going to the bathroom,"
or one of these banal things that people ridicule

00:22:05.809 --> 00:22:12.559
Facebook for containing. oOr you say, "I've
joined the group protesting the, the MousaviMusabi

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:17.200
had the election stolen from him or whatever
in Iran." But you just do something and then

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.350
that is transmitted algorithmically and by
the software to whoever has subscribed to

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.029
you by saying they're your friend.

00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:29.029
And I, I call that, in a certain sense, automating
communication in a way that it has never been

00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:33.549
automated before. And I, I assert in the book
and, and people in here know a lot more than

00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:38.239
I do about certain things, but I say it's
the fir-, --it's to me, --the introduction

00:22:38.239 --> 00:22:42.690
of automation to communication for the first
time. And, and interestingly, I don't think

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.790
Zuckerberg thinks of it that way.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:48.470
He doesn't actually think of Facebook as communication,
which is interesting, but that's a more complicated

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:55.350
conversation. I don't even fully understand
why. But, sSo Facebook has this, this automated

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.309
way of, of disseminating information about
people, which I think is, was essentially,

00:22:59.309 --> 00:23:03.159
fundamentally new and again, required the
newsfeed.

00:23:03.159 --> 00:23:08.529
And it, it takes advantage of this extraordinary
virality that occurs because of the connectivity

00:23:08.529 --> 00:23:12.429
that, of, the, the, that they set up in the
social graph, so that information, when it

00:23:12.429 --> 00:23:18.860
is welcomed by a group, can spread with extraordinary
rapidity between communities of, throughout

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.840
communities. And you see that in something
like the, the role that Facebook played in

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.419
the election of Barack Obama.

00:23:25.419 --> 00:23:30.549
It was very, very reinforcing to learn that
your friends had joined a group supporting

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:33.840
him, therefore it was easy for you to join
a group supporting him and the fact that you

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:39.700
did was conveyed automatically to your friends
and then that's a very rapid process of, based

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.100
on network effects and all that, that Facebook
was very-- u-, I, not uniquely, --but very

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.250
powerfully, in its part of its system enables.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:53.059
And the other thing about Facebook that, that,
here's a little thing, and there's not time

00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:58.559
to talk about everything in any individual
talk, but if you ask, "Why did Facebook succeed

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:04.419
when MySpace, Friendster, others failed?"
There's a number of reasons. The biggest,

00:24:04.419 --> 00:24:09.389
single reason is that Facebook was based on
genuine identity from the beginning.

00:24:09.389 --> 00:24:16.690
So, it was your real name and your real friend
relationships, in--, in, more or less--, your

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:22.070
real social graph. Facebook can be gamed,
I mean, I was on this Ronn Owens radio show

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:26.860
yesterday and the engineer was, the producer
was telling me how his wife set up a Facebook

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.779
page for their dog, which has seven hundred
friends.

00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:31.279
[laughter]

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:36.200
And that does happen. And also, people create
Face-, fake personas to play Farmville and

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:42.119
other games, or Mafia Wars more than Farmville,
but so, there's a lot of fake identities in

00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:47.779
Facebook, but that's still not primarily what
its used for and its pretty good at pushing

00:24:47.779 --> 00:24:53.700
its users towards being authentic and, and
nothing that preceded it ever did that well.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.720
Friendster tried and totally failed. MySpace
didn't even try.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.960
But a lot of the things that Facebook makes
possible, the thing I was talking about when

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.100
you're walking down the street, you couldn't
do that if you didn't have genuine identity

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.350
and genuine friend relations. It would be
pointless. I mean, I don't care what some

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:15.679
handle who I don't even know the person behind,
liked about the store I'm walking by or didn't

00:25:15.679 --> 00:25:19.250
want to drink the water at this drinking fountain
and then that kind of thing is what I think

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.759
you're gonna be able to know.

00:25:20.759 --> 00:25:30.659
But, so I'm going quickly, but I feel like
you guys can probably handle that. So, another,

00:25:30.659 --> 00:25:36.659
so the book is called, "The Facebook Effect."
It is the inside story. It's very much a history

00:25:36.659 --> 00:25:41.179
of the company and it's a really fun business
book to read. Aand it, it's funny because

00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:45.269
it's a real business book and I really think,
and a lot of people tell me, it's really fun

00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:50.590
to read because the anecdotes that emerge
from the story of a company founded by a bunch

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.919
of 19 year olds are pretty frickinfreaking'
amazing.

00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:57.929
I mean, it's just, especially the role of
Sean Parker, who was one of the great, the

00:25:57.929 --> 00:26:03.720
fou-, great,great figures in Facebook's history,
who was truly an iconoclast great figures

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.249
in Facebook's history, who was truly an iconoclast
and, and brought his iconoclastic sensibility

00:26:06.249 --> 00:26:11.669
to Facebook and it's still very, very much
manifest in the product designed today. And

00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:17.409
he's the one that allowed Mark to acquire,
by the way, the, the ability, this absolute

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:22.619
control he has, where he controls three out
of five board seats and nothing can be done.

00:26:22.619 --> 00:26:29.659
At your company, there's a lot of power rested
in the c-, founders, but I don't know of any

00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:35.490
big company where there's one guy who absolutely
cannot be removed, cannot be deposed, three

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:39.850
out of five board seats, no matter what, Zuckerberg
will be there if he wants to be there. He

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:45.019
will squash anything he does not want to see
happen. That's it. Period.

00:26:45.019 --> 00:26:51.169
And Sean Parker, architect of that in the
very early days. And anyway, so, back to the

00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:57.029
effect. When I call it the Facebook effect,
even though it's a history, what I really

00:26:57.029 --> 00:27:02.580
am trying to imply is that Facebook has this
very interesting range of effects in the world,

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:17.869
which are in politics, government, media,
marketing, identity, personal relations, etc.

00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:23.000
And the politics is one that I find particularly
interesting, and it happens that Mark Zuckerberg

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.491
is also quite obsessed with., Aand the book
begins in a way that I think a lot of people

00:27:28.491 --> 00:27:35.159
find surprising. It's not a Facebook scenario.
It begins in the bedroom of a 32 year old

00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:40.059
computer programmer, in the middle of the
night in Barranquilla, Columbia, in January

00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:47.009
2008, who was just fed up with the FARC guerrillaguerilla
movement, killing and kidnapping his countrymen

00:27:47.009 --> 00:27:51.370
over the previous decades. Aand there was
a little, a recent story of really abusing

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:56.159
a small child that, and he's a very sensitive
kid, he's a real sensitive soul, this guy,

00:27:56.159 --> 00:28:00.369
Oscar Morales. And, and he just got fed up
and he's a computer guy, so he knew how to

00:28:00.369 --> 00:28:04.779
make a Facebook page and do some good graphics
and he did that at 3 AM, went to bed, and

00:28:04.779 --> 00:28:07.779
he sent an invitation to all his friends to
join the group. And in the morning, he had,

00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:13.669
I think, 1200 members of the group when he
woke up. And he only had 150 friends or something

00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:18.140
like that, so that got his attention and then
he went to the p-, beach that day and came

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.720
home and there were, I don't know, I forget
the number, 4000 friends or something like

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.979
that. And, and I love this quote, he says,
"I decided to stop going to the gym and just

00:28:26.979 --> 00:28:30.450
focus on." and a month to the day, after that,
he created it.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.799
There was a, a demonstration on the streets
of Columbia of ten million people, with a

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:39.910
simple message. "FARC: Stop killing, stop
kidnapping, no more lies." And it was very

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:45.049
simple and it, it really just was the message
that was poised to be received by the country

00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:50.889
at that time and it was Facebook that enabled
it to happen. So, that kind of thing happens

00:28:50.889 --> 00:28:56.841
in a lot of places. I think the actual impact
of it is still hard to say at the moment,

00:28:56.841 --> 00:29:01.210
but it is the feeling of members of Facebook
that if they're upset about anything, whether

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:06.389
its political or nonpolitical, Facebook is
a very good place to say that. aAnd, and the

00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:11.039
message can spread very rapidly. aAnd that
has a lot of political implications. The effects

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:16.320
in marketing, etc., are things could talk
about cause they're very big., bBut I've sort

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:22.850
of already talked about the future. Zucker-,
I mean I think I've kind of hit on the main

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:29.129
points that I, I, I like to, to, to, to highlight
and I'd love to hear your comments and questions,

00:29:29.129 --> 00:29:32.570
so let's go right to a dialogue. I think you
have to go over there to the mic in order

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.299
to talk in any form because--

00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:35.499
[audience chatter]

00:29:35.499 --> 00:29:37.889
there's people from at like three or four
other locations that are watching this.

00:29:37.889 --> 00:29:38.889
[clears throat]

00:29:38.889 --> 00:29:47.090
&gt;&gt;memberman in audiencemale #1: Hey, there.
So, I work in the PR department and full disclosure

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:53.210
I answer a lot of questions about Facebook
all the time. One thing that kinda bothers

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.940
me about it, and you touched on this earlier,
is that if Facebook, strategically, wants

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.039
to be the social plumbing under everything--

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:01.851
&gt;&gt;David: OKOk, that's a good way to put it,
yeah.

00:30:01.851 --> 00:30:02.851
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #1: they wanna
own that social--

00:30:02.851 --> 00:30:03.851
&gt;&gt;David: Social plumbing, I like that, yeah.

00:30:03.851 --> 00:30:05.349
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #1: every time
you wanna reference that, you ping their API,

00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:06.349
you get it back--

00:30:06.349 --> 00:30:07.349
&gt;&gt;David: Uh-huh.

00:30:07.349 --> 00:30:09.279
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #1: but the problem
with that is, is they're owning something

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:16.940
that belongs to me, right? I own my address
book, I know the little black book, and that's

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.940
something that I carry with me.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:18.940
&gt;&gt;David: Right.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.940
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #1: If I wanna
export my Gmail contacts--

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.940
&gt;&gt;David: Mm-hmm.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.940
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #1: I can do that,
but with Facebook, it's somehow telling me

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.940
that I don't own the set of relationships
between me and other people.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:23.940
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.340
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #1: And so there
seems to be some kind of tension between the

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.130
data that I own about myself and their strategic
vision.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.989
&gt;&gt;David: Well, technically speaking, during
the Terms of Service controversy of a year

00:30:33.989 --> 00:30:37.929
or so ago, they altered that and they don't
technically claim to own your data anymore,

00:30:37.929 --> 00:30:44.789
although they did before that. They, they
do in practical fact, control your data.

00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:48.890
And they don't let you export it nearly so
easily as most other services do. I wouldn't

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:55.700
be surprised if begin to allow that going
forward, just because of the many policy implications

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.659
and legal implications of their ambition.
that, I think, they're gonna have to move

00:30:59.659 --> 00:31:05.049
in a number of respects, toward a more opt-in
architecture rather than the opt-out architecture,

00:31:05.049 --> 00:31:10.529
which is really one of the reasons they've
had so much difficulty on the privacy front.

00:31:10.529 --> 00:31:18.620
So, I think it's a legitimate point and the
thing is it's, it's "user beware" and that's

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:24.179
the thing you have, I mean, it's just on practical
terms, the members on Facebook don't pay anything,

00:31:24.179 --> 00:31:28.469
they like using it and they put that stuff
in there because they get benefits from it.

00:31:28.469 --> 00:31:33.659
If that stopped being the case, they would
remove their data and Facebook's great challenge

00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:38.229
is to make sure they continue to feel that
trade-off is worth it.

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:42.919
And so far there's no question they've succeeded
at that., b But from a intellectual point

00:31:42.919 --> 00:31:47.869
of view, you're point is totally justified
and I think that that kind of thing is just

00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:52.769
starting to sink in on the world. Aand how
the world responds and how Facebook responds

00:31:52.769 --> 00:31:57.999
to the world in that regard is very important.
And, so that's, that's all I'd say about that.

00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:01.940
B, but I wanna say one other thing before
I go to the next question about Google because

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.119
I meant to do that in, in my talk.

00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:09.659
Facebook and Google's relationship and connectivity
and, and, and the comparison between the two

00:32:09.659 --> 00:32:13.679
is really, really fascinating. And has anybody
here actually read my book already, by the

00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:16.659
way? Well, I think you have a great opportunity
in the future. Anyway--

00:32:16.659 --> 00:32:17.659
[laughter]

00:32:17.659 --> 00:32:21.849
you read it, oh good. Well, you know that
the last chapter is a lot about Google, right?

00:32:21.849 --> 00:32:26.109
And, and it, it, just quickly, I think it's
worth mentioning and I'm sure some of you

00:32:26.109 --> 00:32:32.349
will have reactions to some of this, but Facebook
is a problem for Google in a number of respects.

00:32:32.349 --> 00:32:37.330
Three primarily, primary respects, in my opinion.
I mean, and it, if I were you, I would say

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:40.779
it's probably your single biggest problem
in terms of competitively. And which is why

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:44.899
I think it's not wrong that so many people
are sitting in this room trying to get to

00:32:44.899 --> 00:32:50.289
the floor because if you if , if, if the leaders
of Google and the people who are making policy

00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:53.919
decisions about Google and, and where Google's
going,. I If you don't focus on what Facebook

00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:58.369
is doing to alter the landscape in which you
operate, you're naive. And you're not naive

00:32:58.369 --> 00:32:59.369
at all in this company.

00:32:59.369 --> 00:33:04.380
So, here's the three ways that I think Facebook
is a problem for Google. I think the number

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:11.979
one way is that Google's corporate mandate
and mantra is to search all the worlds' information.

00:33:11.979 --> 00:33:18.779
And Facebook is aggregating the largest quantity
of digital information that anybody is aggregating

00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:24.580
at the moment, I believe., cCertainly of any
commercial company, and the vast majority

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.509
of it is not visible to you.

00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:31.309
Therefore, if you're trying to search everything
on the Internet, it's not a good thing that

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:38.849
the biggest growing piece of the Internet
data universe is invisible to your crawling

00:33:38.849 --> 00:33:44.509
tools. There's an irony in that, by the way,
which is that almost everything Mark Zuckerberg

00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:49.369
has been doing recently that he's getting
in trouble for would help you with that problem

00:33:49.369 --> 00:33:53.019
because he wants everyone to use the everyone
privacy setting.

00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:57.779
And this the really, wait, Mark Zuckerberg
is not an easy person to, he's not, he's not

00:33:57.779 --> 00:34:04.269
easy to intuitively understand cause he's
very principled, very intellectual and not

00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:08.819
a business minded person by instinct. He is
trying to change the world more than he's

00:34:08.819 --> 00:34:12.649
trying to make money and that is always a
controversial statement, but that is the case

00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:17.200
about him. I think, at least for most of the
history of Google, that same thing was true

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.069
about Larry and Sergey and probably to a larger
degree is still true.

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:25.049
I mean, Google's so much more mature of a
company that's it's much harder to maintain

00:34:25.049 --> 00:34:29.419
that, that attitude than it is for Mark at
Facebook, but anyway, so Marks trying to make

00:34:29.419 --> 00:34:34.169
everyone make all their information visible,
which if that succeeded then Facebook wouldn't

00:34:34.169 --> 00:34:39.429
have that problem. But at the moment, most
users of Facebook are still hiding a lot of

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:43.679
their data. I don't even know the percentage.
A very rapidly growing percentage of data

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:47.700
inside Facebook is searchable by anyone, so
that's good.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:55.710
The second thing is that Facebook is the most
targetable medium in history because it is

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:02.620
full of user identified data. The users volunteer
data about themselves, which is very different

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:08.140
from the way DoubleClick and other systems
identify people's interests and behavior,

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:12.470
wh-, wh-, what I call, what is logically called
inferential reasoning.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:16.869
You observe people and figure out what they
probably are, want and who they probably are.,

00:35:16.869 --> 00:35:21.329
bBut it's far better to have them just tell
you and in Facebook's case, they do.

00:35:21.329 --> 00:35:25.589
Therefore, to the degree Google's in the advertising
business, which of course it is, Facebook's

00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:31.530
a problem because if that kind of advertising
works well, --which there are some signs that

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:36.500
its beginning to work better and better in
their universe--, you've gotta get even better

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:41.730
at the inferential stuff or else you've gotta
get access to volunteered data.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:47.550
And then the third piece, which is closely
related to the second one, is that Google's

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:54.609
business, in large part through AdSense, is
a ad, ad distribution business and ad network

00:35:54.609 --> 00:36:00.750
business. Aand Facebook has not gone into
that business yet. But if you dovetail this

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:06.770
commercial stuff with what I said before about
their strategic goal of becoming infrastructure,

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:11.760
and the Facebook connect system and the like
button and all that stuff and just imagine

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:17.089
what happens when, not if, but, in my opinion
when, they begin to distribute advertising

00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:22.220
using that same infrastructure with all of
the user reported data behind it, so then

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:28.790
they begin to compete with AdSense on any
website by telling the website, "We know who

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:35.339
that person is and what they say they're interested
in." Not what we've guessed and then they,

00:36:35.339 --> 00:36:39.790
they depri-, on you, they can split the revenue
in a lot of different ways with that partner

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:46.119
site and target people with extraordinary
accuracy. Aand so those are three big challenges

00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:50.779
for Google that I just didn't wanna get out
of here without saying clearly, so go ahead.

00:36:50.779 --> 00:36:57.390
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #2: Hello. So,
apo-, I guess in advance I'll apologize for

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.700
this question and I totally understand if
you don't really wanna talk about it from

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:06.990
a personal or a legal kinda point of view,
but what do you think, personally, is wrong

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:12.700
with Facebook? Whether it's from a technical
or a political or just kind of an overall

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.270
like, phil-, philosophical point of view.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:18.420
&gt;&gt;David: Well, there's plenty of things that
are wrong with the way it's moving and with

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:23.680
the decisions it's making. I mean, I am, as
you could probably tell, something of an enthusiast

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:29.750
about its significance. Aand because I've
been an enthusiast or a believer in its significance

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:36.270
for a long time, I, I sometimes sound like
I'm a cheerleader, is a word that Michael

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:40.740
Errington used to me in private, which he
did not use in his very two-sided review of

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.750
my book the other day, although he did say
you should read it, by the way, in case you

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.480
didn't notice that.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:52.880
But, I mean, I think Facebook has not wrestled
with the fundamental question of how they

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:59.920
can function as a commercial enterprise? I
mean, basically, their ambition is highly

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:09.990
questionable from a policy point of view.
Why should a company own identity infrastructure?

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:15.700
That, in history of mankind to the degree
such things existed, that has been a governmental

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.700
function.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.609
Now, the argument that you could rebut that
with, and this is why, I mean, I don't think

00:38:21.609 --> 00:38:26.670
Facebook is evil or not evil. I think there's,
things are nuanced in my mind, I'm a journalist

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:31.950
and I'm not a, I'm also, I've never been a,
I'm not really a classic blogger type who

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:35.750
makes these extreme statements just to see
what people think. I really look at the world

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.880
in a fairly nuanced way. I don't think Google
is evil or not evil, either. But, although

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.260
I did write a piece once saying Google is
not evil. But anyway,--

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:47.400
[laughter]

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:54.970
so, the problem with the, with the problem,
if you call that a problem is that Facebook

00:38:54.970 --> 00:39:00.480
really is enabling people to do new things
that probably could not be done if they hadn't

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.930
emerged and people like that. That's why they
have a million new users a day coming in there

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.840
and they have 500 million active users.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:12.609
I mean, arguably, they're providing something
that people like. And it's impossible to imagine

00:39:12.609 --> 00:39:16.200
that governments could ever have invented
it. I mean, governments are clueless about

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:23.890
this stuff. So, you could legitimately ask,
maybe should Facebook in some future scenario

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:33.560
possibly be regulated by the ITU or, I don't
think so, necessarily, but believe me, the

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:37.940
ITU is gonna start wondering in a few years
if they don't start wondering soon, that someone

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:42.619
at Facebook, who I was talking to yesterday,
said, "You know if you keep talking like this

00:39:42.619 --> 00:39:45.910
the government officials might start regulating
us sooner rather than later." I said, "Well,

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:53.430
you know, that's the breaks." But I think
this regulation thing is real and you're encountering

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:57.170
it. Look at the 40 countries, however many
countries, how many countries are now suing

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.820
you because of the, the street view cameras?
I don't know.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.050
[man speaking in background]

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.680
Thirty states, fifteen countries, thank you.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.680
[laughter]

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:09.589
So, you're encountering it already, right?
And, and nobody's gonna argue Google's not

00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:15.550
a good thing for the average user, but there's,
these, these nuanced situations when you acquire

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.589
these incredibly complex, complexedambitious,
successful systems that are deployed in the

00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:20.410
hundreds of millions, bring about tons of
issues., ambitious, successful systems that

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:26.060
are deployed in the hundreds of millions,
bring about tons of issues. I think, I don't

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:30.750
think of wrong or right, but I'll tell you
a huge challenge that I think Facebook faces,

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.529
which is Mark Zuckerberg's personality.

00:40:33.529 --> 00:40:38.760
And I think this company faced the same challenge
and, and they solved it by hiring Eric Schmidt.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:44.920
Mark is a geek, computer scientist type person
and that's the way he sees the world, through

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:50.069
the product and engineering lens. And he's
basically inclined to solve every product,

00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:55.829
problem by redesigning the product. And that's
a fine thing and it's worked pretty well.,

00:40:55.829 --> 00:41:00.420
Bbut if you watched his DSpeech or you've
read a lot of the commentary about him recently,

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:06.500
you can't deny that that's not the only thing
he has to do. He has to become an ambassador,

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:14.390
a policy expert, a policy articulator, a front
man, a marketer, in a way that he's probably

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:19.460
personally uncomfortable to be and, and maybe
not capable of being.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:24.539
Although, knowing how much he's matured in
the f-, mere six years since he's run this

00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:30.240
thing, I would not put it past him at all
that he could become that person. But he's

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.819
not that person now, which is why he totally
screwed up at D, so from Facebook's point

00:41:34.819 --> 00:41:37.720
of view, Mark Zuckerberg's personality is
a problem.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.720
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #2: Thank you.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:48.950
&gt;&gt;David: Not, not necessarily a long term
problem. It could be resolved, but right now

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.960
I think he's got to get better at something
he doesn't like to do.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.839
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #3: Hi. So, one
of the things I've been wondering is Facebook

00:41:55.839 --> 00:42:00.490
doesn't seem to pick its battles very much.
It's competing with Zynga, the payment platform,

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:05.480
it's competing with Foursquare and Gowalla
and the location of mobile services, its competing

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:12.119
with Google on user attention, it's competing
with Open Web advocates about what, who owns

00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:13.849
information. What do you think is the psychology
behind that? Why--

00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:19.430
&gt;&gt;David: Well, I would say most of those competition
are inadvertent. I mean, honestly, it's not

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:23.700
seeking to compete in that way with any of
those players, certainly not with Google on

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.859
attention. By that logic, you'd say if you
get it successful you've made the mistaken

00:42:27.859 --> 00:42:31.500
decision to compete with Google, I mean that's
a very, talk about hubris, I'm sorry, but

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:36.299
that's not a very logical point, I'm sorry.
But anyway, Facebook is just doing what it's

00:42:36.299 --> 00:42:43.119
doing and, and in order to achieve what they
think they wanna do, which is to provide all

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:50.030
these services to the users based on identity
and the social graph, they, they have to go

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.329
into identity based information.

00:42:52.329 --> 00:42:58.029
Now, it, will they buy Foursquare or build
something to compete with it? That's unknown.

00:42:58.029 --> 00:43:03.890
I actually think they do pick their battles.
That's why they really just wanna be infrastructure.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:08.230
That's what I tried to say before. They don't
really think they can win those battles the

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:14.240
way you described them in general, u. Unless
they become a service that you just use and

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.589
that nobody effectively can compete with.

00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:24.150
I mean, and that's, that's a complicated and
challenging idea, but it's kind of an, you

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:27.980
could say that Facebook's gamble is kind of
all or nothing. Butnothing, but maybe not.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:32.119
bBecause they could build this ad network
and they could still be facebook.com and they

00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:36.720
could be around for a long time because they've
got a lot of critical mass.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.019
When you talk about, I mean, each one of those
things is very different, also. I mean, the

00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:47.250
Zynga issue, it's not like, this thing of
Facebook credits is really what you're asking

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:53.200
about and Facebook credits are, if you don't
know, Facebook'sFacebooks got this new business,

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:58.430
which is selling its users a credit for a
dollar and giving these partners 70 cents

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:05.240
and the partners are primarily game companies.
And the money is primarily used to buy virtual

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.750
goods in games and game tools.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:15.460
And the thing that's two sided about that--,
even for Zynga--, is that even though Zynga

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:20.859
doesn't wanna give 30 percent to Facebook,
it wants those people to be spending money

00:44:20.859 --> 00:44:26.510
inside Farmville. aAnd they're generally in
Facebook more inclined to spend their money

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:32.940
on Facebook than they are on Zynga because
if you buy a dollars worth of credit on Facebook,

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:38.329
you can use it in Zynga and you can also use
it at CrowdStar or another platform.

00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:42.880
It's a, it's a currency that can be used across
the network and if you buy it only from Zynga

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.130
then you're stuck to use it in Zynga and that,
and, and if you think that digital currency

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:52.290
has a l-, future--, which I do--, I think
Facebook'sFacebooks well positioned to be

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:56.630
a player in that arena, so they're not making
a mistake at all to try and get in that business.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:45:02.060
But specifically with Zynga, they had secret
negotiations, they came to a concord, Zynga's

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.339
got a lot better deal than they had before,
would be my guess.

00:45:05.339 --> 00:45:10.710
Zynga has leverage over Facebook because it's
its largest advertiser, but at least it was

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:18.420
last year by all accounts. But this issue
of, I would say the most interesting part

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:23.299
of your question, which had a lot of pieces,
actually, was this issue of how does it relate

00:45:23.299 --> 00:45:30.020
to its platform partners? And does it compete
with them or does it only help them? And I

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:36.089
think in technology platforms, generally,
there's never, it's never black or white.

00:45:36.089 --> 00:45:40.920
I mean, Microsoft did a very, very good job
on balance, serving as a platform and creating

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:48.010
this incredible pro developer culture and
enabling all these applications to emerge.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:52.950
You guys haven't done as much of that as I
would have expected you to do by now, by the

00:45:52.950 --> 00:46:01.839
way, but you're doing some of it, certainly.
And Face-, any, this, there's really a devils

00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:05.980
bargain, you could say, that a lot of companies
are faced with right now, which is, do you

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:09.911
build on top of the Facebook platform and
get this viral growth potential, which is

00:46:09.911 --> 00:46:17.059
incredibly powerful, at the price that you
are effectively dependentdependant on Facebook's

00:46:17.059 --> 00:46:19.250
future decisions?

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:25.089
And, and possibly at risk that they might
choose to go into your business and just render

00:46:25.089 --> 00:46:29.010
you irrelevant overnight. And that's the kind
of thing that Foursquare and Gowalla are in

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.869
that position right now, that if Facebook
does do location based, in a way that analogous

00:46:33.869 --> 00:46:39.600
to what those companies are doing, then they'll
probably have a hard time going forward.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600
[audienceaudicence member coughs]

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:44.930
But Facebook doesn't really want to kill them
because those two companies are built on the

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:52.430
Facebook platform and that's basically how
they get users. So, ecosystem management on

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:59.640
F-, technology platforms is a very challenging
managerial and business issue, which I find

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.930
fascinating. I've written about it a lot over
the years and I, I don't think it's black

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:12.369
or white., bBut its' a, it's a really good
question that's almost unanswerable. Nobody's

00:47:12.369 --> 00:47:16.210
lined up, should I just keep talking?

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:17.210
[laughter]

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:21.619
Nobody has questions or comments? Do we get
questions or comments from the other locations

00:47:21.619 --> 00:47:23.190
or do they just have to be mute?

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.190
[woman answers]

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:28.369
They're mute? But do they get, do they have
the technical ability to ask questions?

00:47:28.369 --> 00:47:30.289
&gt;&gt;woman: No, not at this--

00:47:30.289 --> 00:47:34.140
&gt;&gt;David: OKOk, let's see how much more time
we have.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.289
&gt;&gt;woman: Five minutes.

00:47:35.289 --> 00:47:40.269
&gt;&gt;David: You've been sated with Facebook information?
Did I, what did I, come on, somebody in here

00:47:40.269 --> 00:47:42.710
must think I said something that was totally
full of shit.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:43.710
[laughter]

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:47.480
Am I entitled to say that word? Can, could
somebody just tell me what you disagree with

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.330
about the things that I've said? Yeah. You
gotta go to the mic, though, I'm sorry.

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:52.330
[laughter]

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:53.829

00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:58.970
&gt;&gt;David: I know, complain to your colleagues,
what can I say?

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:02.850
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #4: Just that
you keep saying that Facebook is very unique.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:07.680
You can only do things on Facebook and this
thing wouldn't have any Facebook and you give

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.700
an example in Columbia. I don't think that's
true. I think Facebook is one way to do that

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.789
thing, but it probably would have happened
some other way--

00:48:13.789 --> 00:48:14.789
&gt;&gt;David: It might have.

00:48:14.789 --> 00:48:16.640
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #4: and it's not
that Facebook has capabilities that are hard

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:23.569
to replicate or technically interesting. You
can be social using a flare gun, you know?

00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:24.569
If you have to.

00:48:24.569 --> 00:48:25.569
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:26.799
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #4: So, I think
you're just seeing trends in society emerging

00:48:26.799 --> 00:48:29.099
at a time when this thing came out of the
tool people could use and--

00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:30.140
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:35.589
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #4: it's not gonna
be sticky cause you can't do things elsewhere.

00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:38.000
&gt;&gt;David: Well, yeah, but you could also say
there was always a library so why did you

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.579
need Google? I mean, i-, i-, it's, I mean,
when things are automated and, and when digital

00:48:43.579 --> 00:48:49.130
technology is brought to a human task and
it's faster, it often becomes fundamentally

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:53.440
different, in my opinion. So, you could do
social things with a flare gun, but the fact

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:59.330
that you can do them with digital tools that
are so much more efficient, is often-- in

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:01.039
my opinion--, fundamentally different.

00:49:01.039 --> 00:49:04.681
So, we differ on that perhaps, but certainly
with Twitter you can do a lot of things that

00:49:04.681 --> 00:49:10.509
you do in Facebook. The thing I think is so,
one of the things I think was really unique

00:49:10.509 --> 00:49:14.670
about Facebook, or is unique about it, which
kinda, I think goes to your point, is that

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:21.869
Facebook draws in users to do very quotidian
things, meaning to communicate with their

00:49:21.869 --> 00:49:27.289
friends about going to the mall. That's how
people start using it, or to connect with

00:49:27.289 --> 00:49:31.520
high school girlfriend, to speak in my generation.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:36.930
But once they're in there, these other capabilities,
Oscar Morales joined Facebook to communicate

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:41.900
with his high school friends, and that's a
fact, right? But then he got in Facebook and

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:47.920
he kind of just stumbled on the fact that
it has this ability to create a group and

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:52.000
that it would also, and therefore, allow him
to make a political statement.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:58.119
And that is different than a lot of the other
ways it might have emerged, which probably

00:49:58.119 --> 00:50:03.730
would have had to be a little more willful.
That would be, I do probably, books are often

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:08.890
written by some degree of overstatement, in
fact, I hardly imagine a book that wasn't.

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:14.990
So, obviously, in order to make a point, sometimes
I oversimplify and I don't deny that. But

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:21.950
I think in general, Facebook is different
in many of its qualities and capabilities

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.279
than anything that has preceded it, I do.

00:50:24.279 --> 00:50:26.470
&gt;&gt;membermaleman in audience #5: Since you
mentioned Twitter, could youprevious comment

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:30.290
on the relationship between Twitter and Facebook.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:34.690
&gt;&gt;David: Sure, I think Twitter is a hugely
important business and, and system, not so

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:40.920
much a business obviously, but, yet, but they're
not the same in the way they're often compared.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:44.810
I mean, Twitter isn't really a social network
by the classic definitions of social networks

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:50.079
because you don't articulate a connection
between two people in Twitter, you subscribe

00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:55.470
to an entity, which is tweeted. And that is
a hugely valuable thing, but it's not like

00:50:55.470 --> 00:51:01.771
what Facebook does which primarily creates
bi-directional contact, connections. And I

00:51:01.771 --> 00:51:05.970
don't think most of the journalists who have
written about Twitter versus Facebook fully

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.109
understood that.

00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:13.039
So , so, the interesting thing about the Twitter
versus Facebook competition, which is, is

00:51:13.039 --> 00:51:18.910
a real competition, is Facebook did get really
terrified of Twitter at a certain point in

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:23.039
time. Primarily because just how fast it was
growing at that point. And they said, "Well,

00:51:23.039 --> 00:51:28.130
if it's growing that fast, maybe it's doing
something we should do." And they are paranoid,

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:32.140
and so they really did, based, first they
tried to buy it, according to all accounts.

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:36.579
I think you guys have thought about that a
few times. Maybe you still should. In fact,

00:51:36.579 --> 00:51:40.319
almost everywhere I go, somebody says, "Google
should buy Twitter." Whatever that's worth,

00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:47.690
I don't know if that's right. But then Facebook
basically did copy much of whaet's in Twitter.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:52.619
But whets interesting about that to me, is
that even though in Facebook, you can do a

00:51:52.619 --> 00:51:56.870
lot of the functions that Twitter offers,
in many ways, better than the ways you can

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:57.870
do them in Twitter.

00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:05.059
Like, a Facebook page, which is much like
an, a, a, a hash tag identity in Twitter,

00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:09.710
is actually a more functional environment
in many respects to do that kind of thing.

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:17.980
But what's very interesting to me is that
still the most authentic, powerful, respected,

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:25.240
intellectual, interesting voices, are primarily
using Twitter for that kind of one to many

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:31.880
messaging. And that's a problem for Facebook.
And I don't think Twitters going away. I don't

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.359
think no matter what Facebook does in any
near term scenario, Twitter is going away.

00:52:36.359 --> 00:52:42.170
But there are a lot of things that I've heard,
Twitters growth has slowed, so it doesn't

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:44.309
threaten Facebook the way it used to.

00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:49.630
And now Facebook is so much bigger than Twitter,
even relatively more than it was when they

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:54.789
first got paranoid about it, I think, maybe
not relatively., bBut Facebook is double,

00:52:54.789 --> 00:53:00.460
more than double the size it was when they
first worried about Twitter, right? It was

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:04.079
probably, when they first worried about Twitter,
it would've been like the beginning of 2009,

00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:09.590
8, I dunno.

00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:12.950
And they've grown several hundred million
since then, so I think they're maybe a little

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:18.769
more relaxed about it, but they watch that
company very closely. And, and if I were at

00:53:18.769 --> 00:53:24.000
Facebook, I would really be strategically
thinking very hard, "How do I get those really

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:31.920
credible voices, why is it that when Medvedev
came to Google, the photo of him was doing

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.670
his first tweet or whatever it was?" Was it
here that he did that? He did it on his trip

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:39.390
to Silicon Valley, right? Medvedev was, there
was a photograph of him in the paper tweeting

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:44.859
for the first time. That's a problem for Facebook.
They would've liked to see him doing a Facebook

00:53:44.859 --> 00:53:52.109
message for the first time. So, it's a big,
really good question and a really big issue,

00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:57.080
but not as understood as it ought to be in
my opinion.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:02.550
&gt;&gt;presenter: Great. So, let's give David a
round of applause. Thank you so much.

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:03.550
[applause]

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:04.550
&gt;&gt;David: Thank you all very much.

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:04.551
