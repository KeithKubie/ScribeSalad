1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,520
Weird. And to your point about going up
and cleaning up, clean out, you know,

2
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:08,180
an impoverished area at least then you'd
get to meet the other people. Yeah.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,030
People outside of your circle in your
bubble. I mean the amount of times, Hey,

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:15,980
when you talk to people about Muslims,
LGBT, whatever it is, and you think, oh,

5
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:17,970
it's because you've never met anyone,
right.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,450
You've actually never met anyone
that is x, y or zed, which is, I'm,

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,620
I moved to Brooklyn five years or six
years ago and I moved to Clinton Hill,

8
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:28,740
Fort Greene and I got a few friends that
had been there forever and I said, let,

9
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:30,420
this probably sounds like a
really stupid thing to say,

10
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:35,070
but it feels kind of segregated here. And
they were like, Duh. Of course it does.

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,950
And I couldn't believe it.
You know,

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,750
I'd grown up on the spike
Lee movies and I mean,

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,960
I guess they do show a kind of
segregation, but I thought, you know,

14
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:46,080
this was the place where everyone
lived together on the same,

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,130
I went to each others,

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,820
but then he goes and restaurants and I
lived on the dividing line between the

17
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:54,810
bit that was getting gentrified and the
projects you go two blocks that way,

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,570
pretty much all black.
You got three blocks that way.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,660
Pretty much all white with yoga studios
and Boujee coffee shops and pet spars

20
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,470
and,
and the two communities just did not mix.

21
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:08,490
It wasn't necessarily they hated each
other or they just did not make different

22
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:10,490
language, different everything. Right.

23
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:15,060
This is Utopian perception that there
is a place where everybody's cool. Yeah.

24
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,980
Yeah.
And I thought it might be New York,

25
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:21,270
it might be Brooklyn or it's
probably the only place that's close.

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,770
Right. At least it has the reputation for
it. Yeah. Because at least in Brooklyn,

27
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:28,120
people walk around. I mean, yeah, but,

28
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,170
but talking about the amazing pieces
of journalism over the last few years,

29
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:34,920
there's Nicole, Hannah Jones wrote, wrote
a piece about New York school system,

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,790
public school system,

31
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,230
the most segregated school system
in America when New York really,

32
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,060
and she had to get her daughter into a
public school. And the choice was the,

33
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,270
the very good,
well supported school in the gentrifying,

34
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:52,620
mostly white area or the bad failing
public school in the non gentrified,

35
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:55,380
mostly black area where her
kids education might suffer.

36
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,230
And I think I'm remembering
correct correctly,

37
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,600
but her and her husband had a real
fight about it cause she said, no,

38
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:01,550
we got to put our kid in the,

39
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:05,670
in the bad failing school and help it
get better and it's gonna take years and

40
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,290
our daughter may suffer in the short term,

41
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,440
but that's what we have to do if
we're living in this neighborhood. Um,

42
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,380
it's an incredible piece.
Wow. Yeah. That's a, the, the
real conflict as a parent.

43
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,040
Do you have children? No.
When you're possible each. Oh
yeah. I'm sure. Right. You're,

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,870
when you're thinking of your children,
you're,

45
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:24,330
you're always thinking of their safety,

46
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:26,190
you're always worried about them
and you want to protect them.

47
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:30,150
So putting them in a situation where they
wouldn't be as protected is never your

48
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,570
first instinct. Oh, she, she was in,
in town hall meetings where, you know,

49
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:37,920
progressive white liberal parents who
would be very left wing on every other

50
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:38,754
issue.

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,300
We're really fighting to make sure their
kid went to the good majority white

52
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:45,360
school. Um, and you know, they
want a bit of diversity but not,

53
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,620
not too much diversity. Right.
They want a black friend. Yeah,

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,190
yeah, yeah. That's when
people think of Brooklyn,

55
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:57,660
they do think of it as being like the
most diverse place. Yeah. And it's, yeah,

56
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,420
I mean, street by street segregated
it land is pretty diverse.

57
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,820
Atlanta is interesting, you
know, because Atlanta has, um,

58
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,770
a lot of, there's a,
there's a lot of um, pose.

59
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,730
It's a lot of everything in Atlanta,

60
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,840
but it's a very black city and a lot of
ways, but it's also a very white city.

61
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,070
You see a lot of black and white people
hanging out together and clubs and bars

62
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:25,030
and restaurants and stuff. And it's
really like much closer to like a 50,

63
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,740
50 split than a lot of places,

64
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,980
at least in some of the neighborhoods
that I've been to when I got back to

65
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,680
London. That's why. That's one of the
few things. Um, I'm proud of about,

66
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,750
about London and certainly New York.

67
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:38,800
It said it's not a big deal for a group
of friends, a family, and trying to be,

68
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,620
to be genuinely mixed.
He sites that

69
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,690
you would know.
Um,

70
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,660
I'd ask you is that because London didn't
experience slavery the way the United

71
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,620
States did? Um, yeah, I mean
obviously we have a, you know,

72
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,080
colonial history, right? Of course.

73
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,410
But that wasn't in the country
itself for a very long time.

74
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:04,060
We've had a huge Pakistani Bangladeshi,
Jamaican community and it's, it's,

75
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,350
you know,
I mean here,

76
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:09,010
if you have black friends or you date
a black girl or you know, it's, it's,

77
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,450
people think you're trying to prove your
work right there. It was just normal,

78
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,300
normal [inaudible] in London.
I'm not saying England, London.

79
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,850
I experienced that when
I was in London as well.

80
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,810
It seems like way more integrated.
Yeah. Yeah. That, and that's, I mean,

81
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,980
still five, six years after
I moved to New York, it's,

82
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:30,280
it's still a surprise every day to
reinforce a different animal. Now,

83
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,200
New York is so fucking expensive.
It's so strange. And, uh, my friend,

84
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,530
uh, Judah who, uh, Judas Freelander
who lives there, said he's,

85
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,860
he's lived there for a long time
and he's like, it's so changed.

86
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,700
It used to be like a lot of artists and
a lot of creative people. And he goes,

87
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:48,340
it's now tell finance people
like every go to finance.

88
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,970
Everybody just wants the most expensive
suit and the most expensive watch.

89
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,120
And they live in this
ridiculously expensive apartment.

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,340
And I thought that went out in the 80s.

91
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:02,050
I thought that was like Wall Street and
Michael Caine still very much exists.

92
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,950
That's still prevalent.
