Janiero it's like they don't have a lot

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140
Janiero it's like they don't have a lot
 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.330
Janiero it's like they don't have a lot
of experience with engineering they're

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340
of experience with engineering they're
 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.550
of experience with engineering they're
just makers or hackers or people who

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560
just makers or hackers or people who
 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.380
just makers or hackers or people who
maybe do software and they're dabbling

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390
maybe do software and they're dabbling
 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.449
maybe do software and they're dabbling
and doing some hardware and so they may

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459
and doing some hardware and so they may
 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.860
and doing some hardware and so they may
need a little bit of help kind of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870
need a little bit of help kind of
 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.860
need a little bit of help kind of
getting started in how to use these

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870
getting started in how to use these
 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.570
getting started in how to use these
electronic parts in their projects and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580
electronic parts in their projects and
 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.180
electronic parts in their projects and
so what we did is we had this huge like

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190
so what we did is we had this huge like
 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.880
so what we did is we had this huge like
vast amount of documentation and we

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890
vast amount of documentation and we
 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.589
vast amount of documentation and we
wanted to do a really good job and

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599
wanted to do a really good job and
 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.750
wanted to do a really good job and
having that documentation be easily

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
having that documentation be easily
 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.630
having that documentation be easily
he's defined we wanted to integrate

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640
he's defined we wanted to integrate
 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.929
he's defined we wanted to integrate
photos and videos and side-by-side and

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939
photos and videos and side-by-side and
 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.160
photos and videos and side-by-side and
the photo notes and all the things that

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170
the photo notes and all the things that
 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.649
the photo notes and all the things that
make documentation for electronics

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659
make documentation for electronics
 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.199
make documentation for electronics
really really good I mean a lot of times

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209
really really good I mean a lot of times
 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.300
really really good I mean a lot of times
for documentation for software it's just

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310
for documentation for software it's just
 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.920
for documentation for software it's just
screenshots and text and that's okay but

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
screenshots and text and that's okay but
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.020
screenshots and text and that's okay but
with hardware you really want to show

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
with hardware you really want to show
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.059
with hardware you really want to show
videos and wiring diagrams and so we

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069
videos and wiring diagrams and so we
 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.390
videos and wiring diagrams and so we
developed our own web application that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
developed our own web application that
 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.009
developed our own web application that
once on the Adafruit servers called the

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019
once on the Adafruit servers called the
 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.289
once on the Adafruit servers called the
learning system and it's kind of like

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299
learning system and it's kind of like
 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.110
learning system and it's kind of like
bootstrap II and what it does is it

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
bootstrap II and what it does is it
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.960
bootstrap II and what it does is it
allows us to do back-end design

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970
allows us to do back-end design
 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.270
allows us to do back-end design
integration with our store so that you

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280
integration with our store so that you
 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.210
integration with our store so that you
know for example if a tutorial uses a

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220
know for example if a tutorial uses a
 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.670
know for example if a tutorial uses a
microscope or an Arduino or Raspberry Pi

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680
microscope or an Arduino or Raspberry Pi
 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.710
microscope or an Arduino or Raspberry Pi
those will get automatically tied

those will get automatically tied
 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.599
those will get automatically tied
together and so people can find the

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609
together and so people can find the
 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.789
together and so people can find the
tutorials really easily they can just go

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799
tutorials really easily they can just go
 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.379
tutorials really easily they can just go
through our shop and say well I've got

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389
through our shop and say well I've got
 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.539

can you tell us a little bit about your
 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.369
can you tell us a little bit about your
favorite wearables project and how we

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379
favorite wearables project and how we
 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.729
favorite wearables project and how we
might get started with one sure I really

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739
might get started with one sure I really
 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.439

like wearables I've been doing wearables

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449
like wearables I've been doing wearables
 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.750
like wearables I've been doing wearables
for a really long time was that the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760
for a really long time was that the
 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.909
for a really long time was that the
wearables group in the Media Lab many

many many years ago and we were working

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859
many many years ago and we were working
 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.439
many many years ago and we were working
on like strapping computers to our

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449
on like strapping computers to our
 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.000
on like strapping computers to our
bodies and stuff and that was kind of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010
bodies and stuff and that was kind of
 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.979
bodies and stuff and that was kind of
fun although really big and kind of

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989
fun although really big and kind of
 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.080

every item that you own or wear could

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050
every item that you own or wear could
 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.900
every item that you own or wear could
potentially be a platform and so

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910
potentially be a platform and so
 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.999
potentially be a platform and so
literally your platform could be your

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009
literally your platform could be your
 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.409
literally your platform could be your
platform that's right

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419
platform that's right
 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.450
platform that's right
let's hope trees have lots of space on

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460
let's hope trees have lots of space on
 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.219
let's hope trees have lots of space on
them you can tons of electronics in

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229
them you can tons of electronics in
 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.379
them you can tons of electronics in
their batteries like some energy

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389
their batteries like some energy
 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.420
their batteries like some energy
scavenging too even maybe make some

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430
scavenging too even maybe make some
 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.860
scavenging too even maybe make some
local power supplies to actually make

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870
local power supplies to actually make
 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.089
local power supplies to actually make
that work yeah sure so so one other

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099
that work yeah sure so so one other
 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.860
that work yeah sure so so one other
question that I that I'm really

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870
question that I that I'm really
 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.899
question that I that I'm really
interested in so a lot of times where

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909
interested in so a lot of times where
 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.240
interested in so a lot of times where
we're carrying these devices and we're

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250
we're carrying these devices and we're
 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.760
we're carrying these devices and we're
maybe not thinking how we can build on

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770
maybe not thinking how we can build on
 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.649
maybe not thinking how we can build on
them or how we can create them ourselves

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659
them or how we can create them ourselves
 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:47.430
them or how we can create them ourselves
so there seems to be this disconnect

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440
so there seems to be this disconnect
 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.580
so there seems to be this disconnect
between building and consuming can you

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590
between building and consuming can you
 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.370
between building and consuming can you
tell us a you know how we might get more

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380
tell us a you know how we might get more
 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.350
tell us a you know how we might get more
connected with our devices by building

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360
connected with our devices by building
 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.270
connected with our devices by building
on them or kind of your general thoughts

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280
on them or kind of your general thoughts
 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.730
on them or kind of your general thoughts
on that kind of era or this era of our

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740
on that kind of era or this era of our
 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.540
on that kind of era or this era of our
lives sure I think that especially now

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550
lives sure I think that especially now
 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.330
lives sure I think that especially now
it's it's hard to buy electronics that

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340
it's it's hard to buy electronics that
 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.740
it's it's hard to buy electronics that
are hackable unless you're actually

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750
are hackable unless you're actually
 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.420
are hackable unless you're actually
looking for that you used to be able to

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430
looking for that you used to be able to
 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.240
