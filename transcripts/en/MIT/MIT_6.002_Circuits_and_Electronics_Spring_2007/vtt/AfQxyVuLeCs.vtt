00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
So, one question to ask
ourselves is,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.922
what is engineering?
How do we define,

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:15.033
what is engineering?
Well, the definition I like to

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:22.366
use is one put forth by Steve
Senturia, one of our professors

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:28.111
who is now retired.
He defined engineering to be

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:35.195
the purposeful use of science.
All right, so what is 6.002

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:38.123
about?
So, 6.002 is a first course in

00:00:38.123 --> 00:00:41.620
engineering.
And I like to view 6.002 as the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.954
gainful employment of Maxwell's
equations.

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:48.858
Many of you have seen Maxwell's
equations before.

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:52.762
Most of you should have.
And they are hard stuff.

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:57.397
6.002 is all about teaching you
how to simplify our lives,

00:00:57.397 --> 00:01:02.870
make things simple.
So, if you can gainfully employ

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.407
Maxwell's equations,
gainfully employ the facts of

00:01:07.407 --> 00:01:11.111
nature to build very interesting
systems.

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:15.277
So let me show you how the
transition is made.

00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:20.185
So, there's a world around us,
nature, so we made some

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:24.259
observations in nature.
We make measurements,

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.000
and we can write down large
tables of measurements.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.539
So, for example,
we can take objects and measure

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.230
the voltage across them,
and look at the resulting

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.447
current through the elements.
So, we may end up getting a

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:44.158
bunch of values such as
[CHALKBOARD].

00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:48.150
So, we start out life with
making measurements on what

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.012
exists.
And we build a bunch of tables.

00:01:51.012 --> 00:01:54.025
Now, we could directly take
these tables,

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:57.112
and based on observations of
these tables,

00:01:57.112 --> 00:02:01.255
we could go ahead and build
very interesting engineering

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:06.000
systems that help us out in
day-to-day lives.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.561
But that's incredibly hard.
Imagine having to resort to a

00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:14.064
set of tables to do any kind of
useful work.

00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:18.300
So what we do as engineers,
we first layer a level of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.233
abstraction.
We look at all the data,

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:25.876
and somehow layer abstraction
such that we can simplify or

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:30.438
much more succinctly put in a
simple equation or a simple

00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:35.000
statement what these numbers are
telling us.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.695
OK, so for example,
our physics laws,

00:02:37.695 --> 00:02:41.739
so laws of physics for example
are simply abstractions,

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.782
the laws of abstractions.
So, these sets of numbers can

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:48.553
be codified by Ohm's law,
for example,

00:02:48.553 --> 00:02:51.323
V is equal to RI,
the voltage current,

00:02:51.323 --> 00:02:54.243
relates to the resistance of
the object.

00:02:54.243 --> 00:02:58.736
So, V is equal to RI is a law
that succinctly describes a set

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:02.106
of experiments,
and replaces a large number of

00:03:02.106 --> 00:03:06.000
tables with a very simple
statement.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.977
You could call this the law,
or you could call it an

00:03:09.977 --> 00:03:13.253
abstraction.
OK so you see laws of physics,

00:03:13.253 --> 00:03:16.763
call them abstractions of
physics if you like.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:21.130
Similarly, there are Maxwell's
equations and so on and so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.158
forth.
So, this is what is.

00:03:23.158 --> 00:03:27.526
This is what's out there.
OK, and a law as an abstraction

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:31.192
describe the properties of
nature, as we see it,

00:03:31.192 --> 00:03:35.728
in some succinct form.
Now, if you want to go and

00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:38.321
build useful things,
we could take these

00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:40.847
abstractions,
take Maxwell's equations,

00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:43.373
and go and build things.
But it's hard.

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:44.969
It's really,
really hard.

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.227
And what you learn in,
at MIT is this place is all

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:51.484
about simplifying things.
Take complicated things,

00:03:51.484 --> 00:03:55.340
build layers of abstraction,
and simplify things so that we

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.487
can build useful systems.
Even in 6.002 we start life by

00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:04.965
making a huge leap from
Maxwell's equations to a couple

00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:09.609
of very, very simple laws.
OK, I'm going to show you that

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.502
leap that we will make today.
So, the first abstraction that

00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:18.399
we layer is called the lump
circuit abstraction.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.712
OK, in the lump circuit
abstraction, what we do is we

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:27.687
make a set of simplifications
that allows us to view a set of

00:04:27.687 --> 00:04:32.000
objects as discrete or lumped
elements.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.136
So, we may, I will define
voltage sources.

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:38.732
We'll define resistors.
We'll define capacitors,

00:04:38.732 --> 00:04:41.715
and so on.
OK, and I'm going to make the

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:46.000
jump, and show you how we make
the jump in a few minutes.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.748
So, on that sort of
abstraction, we then layer yet

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.344
another abstract layer.
And let me call that the

00:04:53.344 --> 00:04:56.021
amplifier abstraction.
OK, remember,

00:04:56.021 --> 00:05:00.000
here we are absolutely down and
dirty.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.514
We are setting the probes,
measuring objects,

00:05:02.514 --> 00:05:05.371
and building huge tables.
We abstracted things into

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.714
simple laws, and life got a
little better.

00:05:07.714 --> 00:05:11.142
OK, I'm going to show you can
abstract things further out and

00:05:11.142 --> 00:05:14.171
build discrete objects,
and, you could build even more

00:05:14.171 --> 00:05:17.428
interesting components called
amplifiers and begin playing

00:05:17.428 --> 00:05:20.171
around with amplifiers.
OK, so when you are using

00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:23.542
amplifiers, you don't really
have to worry about the details

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:26.399
of Maxwell's equations.
OK, I'll give you some very

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:29.257
simple abstract rules of
behavior for an amplifier,

00:05:29.257 --> 00:05:32.228
and you can go build very
interesting systems without

00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:35.428
really, really knowing how
Maxwell's equations applies to

00:05:35.428 --> 00:05:40.000
that because you will be working
at this abstract layer.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.545
However, since you're
engineers, and you are good at

00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:47.160
building such systems,
it's very important for you to

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.401
understand how we make this leap
from the laws of physics into

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.946
some of our very primitive
engineering abstractions.

00:05:54.946 --> 00:05:58.491
So, once we make the amplified
abstraction in 6.002,

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:02.315
by the way, 6.002 starts here.
We start from the laws of

00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:06.000
physics and then proceed all the
way out.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.822
So, once we talk about
amplifiers we will take two

00:06:10.822 --> 00:06:12.988
pads.
On the amplifier,

00:06:12.988 --> 00:06:18.204
you will build the next
abstraction called the digital

00:06:18.204 --> 00:06:21.748
abstraction.
OK, and with the digital

00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:27.653
abstraction, we will build new
elements such as inverters and

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:31.000
combinational gates,
OK?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.033
So, notice we are building
bigger, and bigger things,

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:38.988
which have more and more
complicated behavior inside

00:06:38.988 --> 00:06:42.867
them, but which are very simple
to describe, right?

00:06:42.867 --> 00:06:47.288
So, following the digital
abstraction, we will superimpose

00:06:47.288 --> 00:06:51.166
the combinational logic
abstraction on top of that,

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:54.889
and define functional blocks
that look like this:

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:56.905
some inputs,
some function,

00:06:56.905 --> 00:07:01.468
some outputs.
The next abstraction on top of

00:07:01.468 --> 00:07:06.488
that will be the clock digital
abstraction, where we will have

00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:10.274
some notion of time introduced
into the system.

00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:14.635
There will be a clock,
and this will be some function.

00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:19.738
And there will be a clock that
introduces time into the sort of

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:23.029
logic values that functions
operate upon.

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:26.650
Following that,
the next level of abstraction

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:32.000
that we build is called
instruction set abstraction.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.187
OK, now you begin to see things
that consumers get to look at.

00:07:37.187 --> 00:07:42.375
Can someone give me an example
of, or name an instruction set,

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:45.521
or instruction set abstraction?
Bingo.

00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:48.413
So, x86 is one set of
abstractions.

00:07:48.413 --> 00:07:51.219
And in fact,
in many universities,

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:55.046
education could well start just
by saying, OK,

00:07:55.046 --> 00:07:59.554
here's an abstraction.
These are the x86 instructions,

00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:02.898
OK?
Some MIT gurus have designed

00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:05.203
this awesome little
microprocessor,

00:08:05.203 --> 00:08:07.033
OK?
So you just worry about,

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:11.305
you take this abstraction layer
here, the assembly instructions,

00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:14.220
and you go and build systems on
top of that.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.016
OK, so this is an abstraction
layer called the x86 layer.

00:08:18.016 --> 00:08:20.322
There are other abstraction
layers.

00:08:20.322 --> 00:08:24.254
In 6.004, you will learn about,
I believe, the alpha or the

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:29.000
beta, OK, and various other
abstractions at this point.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.798
So, 6.002 kind of goes until
here.

00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:36.715
6.002 takes me from the world
of physics all the way to the

00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:40.700
world of interesting analog and
digital systems.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.516
OK, 004, the course on
computation structures,

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:48.925
will show you how to build
computers all the way from

00:08:48.925 --> 00:08:53.079
simple digital objects all the
way to big systems.

00:08:53.079 --> 00:08:56.386
Following that,
you learn about language

00:08:56.386 --> 00:08:59.947
abstractions,
Java, C, and other languages,

00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:05.139
and that's in 6.002.
And there are several other

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:08.625
courses that will cover that.
Following this,

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:12.112
you learn about software system
abstractions,

00:09:12.112 --> 00:09:16.153
and software systems,
you will learn about operating

00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:18.926
systems.
Any example of an operating

00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:22.491
system abstraction that people
know out there?

00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:23.918
What's that?
Linux.

00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:26.849
What else?
I'm just wondering how long

00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:32.000
I'll have to go before I hear
what I want to hear.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.016
[LAUGHTER] OK,
so we have a bunch of software

00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:37.278
systems.
So, if we have a bunch of

00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:39.883
software systems,
these are nothing but

00:09:39.883 --> 00:09:42.762
abstractions.
Linux simply implies a set of

00:09:42.762 --> 00:09:45.846
system calls that the programs
must adhere to.

00:09:45.846 --> 00:09:48.451
Windows is another set of
system calls.

00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:50.987
That's it.
And see how much money they

00:09:50.987 --> 00:09:54.072
made out of it?
OK, it's all about abstraction

00:09:54.072 --> 00:09:56.403
layers, that all start from
nature.

00:09:56.403 --> 00:09:58.596
All right?
Build abstraction upon

00:09:58.596 --> 00:10:01.681
abstraction upon abstraction
upon abstraction,

00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.000
and someone out here are lots
of dollars.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.330
OK, so based on these
abstractions,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.032
we can then build useful things
for human beings.

00:10:14.032 --> 00:10:18.342
We can build very useful
things, video games,

00:10:18.342 --> 00:10:24.122
so we can send space shuttles
up, and a whole bunch of other

00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:27.159
systems.
But it's based on these

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:32.141
abstraction layers.
What's unique about education

00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:34.799
at MIT?
What's unique about 6.002 and

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:36.571
EECS?
Is to my knowledge,

00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:41.149
there are not many other places
in the world where you will get

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:45.727
an education in everything going
all the way from nature to how

00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:49.567
to build very complicated analog
and digital systems.

00:10:49.567 --> 00:10:53.924
OK, we will show you layer upon
layer upon layer upon layer,

00:10:53.924 --> 00:10:57.763
peel away the onion until you
are down to raw nature,

00:10:57.763 --> 00:11:00.052
OK, through Maxwell's
equations.

00:11:00.052 --> 00:11:02.046
So, 6.002, 004,
this is 033,

00:11:02.046 --> 00:11:07.107
OK, 6.170, and so on.
OK, the whole EECS is about

00:11:07.107 --> 00:11:11.165
building abstraction layers,
one on top of the other.

00:11:11.165 --> 00:11:14.521
So that's one path.
There's the analog path.

00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:18.580
The analog path would take an
amplifier, and build an

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.312
abstraction layer called the
op-amp.

00:11:21.312 --> 00:11:25.448
See how similar they all look?
You know the amplifier,

00:11:25.448 --> 00:11:29.585
the inverter of the digital
world, and the operational

00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:34.268
amplifier in the analog world,
just different ways of looking

00:11:34.268 --> 00:11:39.749
at the same devices.
So, to build an analog system,

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:43.689
to build an operational
amplifier, and then,

00:11:43.689 --> 00:11:48.454
here we go end up building a
whole bunch of different

00:11:48.454 --> 00:11:51.752
interesting analog system
components.

00:11:51.752 --> 00:11:56.517
OK, and these components might
look like oscillators.

00:11:56.517 --> 00:12:02.358
They might look like filters.
OK, they look like power

00:12:02.358 --> 00:12:08.549
supplies, a whole bunch of very
interesting abstract components,

00:12:08.549 --> 00:12:13.855
which pulled together can then
give you the next set of

00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:17.196
systems.
And these systems might be

00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:22.797
toasters, or say for example
other analog systems like the

00:12:22.797 --> 00:12:28.398
various control systems for
various power plants and so on

00:12:28.398 --> 00:12:31.150
and so forth,
and ultimately,

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:36.477
fun and dollars.
OK, so 6.002 is about going

00:12:36.477 --> 00:12:39.965
from physics all the way to this
point.

00:12:39.965 --> 00:12:43.636
We will build interesting
analog systems,

00:12:43.636 --> 00:12:48.775
and take you up to interesting
digital system components,

00:12:48.775 --> 00:12:54.281
from which 004 will take you
all the way to building computer

00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:57.677
architectures.
So that, in a nutshell,

00:12:57.677 --> 00:13:03.000
kind of gives you a feel for
the space of EECS.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.057
OK, this chart here is almost a
vignette of what EECS at MIT is

00:13:08.057 --> 00:13:11.401
all about.
And this is the world according

00:13:11.401 --> 00:13:14.419
to Agarwal, because he's
teaching 002.

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:18.009
OK, so this is 6.002,
and the rest of EECS is

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:22.006
somewhere out there.
OK, so I'm going to do now is

00:13:22.006 --> 00:13:26.410
throughout this course;
I want you to think about which

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.943
part in this vignette we are in.
So, right now,

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:33.707
I'm going to start here and
take you here.

00:13:33.707 --> 00:13:37.483
OK, and as you get closer and
closer, things get simpler,

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.101
and simpler,
and simpler.

00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:42.202
Still, the final abstractions
are pedal, brake,

00:13:42.202 --> 00:13:45.235
steering wheel.
I mean, that's the abstraction

00:13:45.235 --> 00:13:48.337
to play a game,
right, four or five very simple

00:13:48.337 --> 00:13:51.235
interfaces, and that's all you
need to know.

00:13:51.235 --> 00:13:54.000
And everybody in the world can
play stuff.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.561
So remember,
this stuff is complicated.

00:13:56.561 --> 00:14:00.000
This stuff is very,
very simple.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.294
OK, and the more we build
abstractions and come to this

00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:05.490
side, things get simpler and
simpler.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.150
So, a large part of what I'll
cover today is make the biggest

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.834
simplification.
The biggest simplification we

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:15.067
will make his go from Maxwell's
equation to some very,

00:14:15.067 --> 00:14:18.544
very simple algebraic rules.
OK, I did Maxwell's equations

00:14:18.544 --> 00:14:19.886
myself.
And I tell you,

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:22.814
they were very interesting
stuff but complicated.

00:14:22.814 --> 00:14:25.681
I can't imagine building
efficient systems using

00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:30.788
Maxwell's equations.
So, let's take an example,

00:14:30.788 --> 00:14:34.434
OK?
So, let's say I have a battery.

00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:39.368
Just switch to page three of
your course notes.

00:14:39.368 --> 00:14:43.443
And let's say I connect that to
a bulb.

00:14:43.443 --> 00:14:49.127
OK, and this is a wire.
And, the battery supplies some

00:14:49.127 --> 00:14:53.739
voltage, V, and I ask you a
simple question.

00:14:53.739 --> 00:14:57.600
What is the current through the
bulb?

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:05.000
OK, so here is something that I
can build using objects.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.572
I can pick a round from stores
and so on.

00:15:07.572 --> 00:15:11.365
And I can collect them up in
this way, and ask the question,

00:15:11.365 --> 00:15:12.780
what is the current,
I?

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.509
Now, if all you've done is
learn about Maxwell's equations,

00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:19.274
you can roll up your sleeves
and say, ah-ha!

00:15:19.274 --> 00:15:23.004
The first step is to write down
all of Maxwell's equations,

00:15:23.004 --> 00:15:26.026
and you can say,
del cross E is minus del and go

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:28.791
on, and on, and on,
OK, and write out all of

00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:32.521
Maxwell's equations and say,
now how do I get from there to

00:15:32.521 --> 00:15:35.216
here?
OK, it's very good.

00:15:35.216 --> 00:15:37.266
You can do it.
OK, you can do it,

00:15:37.266 --> 00:15:39.891
but it's very complicated.
OK, so instead,

00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:42.709
what you're going to do is take
the easy way.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:46.551
So, what I want to remind you
is that this course is actually

00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:47.960
very easy.
OK remember,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.610
we're going to be building
abstraction upon abstraction to

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.812
make your lives easier.
If you think your lives are

00:15:54.812 --> 00:15:57.822
getting more complicated,
then you are not using

00:15:57.822 --> 00:16:02.097
intuition enough.
OK, just remember the big I

00:16:02.097 --> 00:16:04.661
word.
It's all about making things

00:16:04.661 --> 00:16:07.147
simple.
OK, so let me give you an

00:16:07.147 --> 00:16:10.177
analogy.
So, suppose you have an object.

00:16:10.177 --> 00:16:13.052
OK, and I apply a force to the
object.

00:16:13.052 --> 00:16:16.704
It's an analogy,
OK to get some insight into how

00:16:16.704 --> 00:16:19.656
to do this.
So, I say here's an object.

00:16:19.656 --> 00:16:22.997
I apply a force,
and I ask you the question.

00:16:22.997 --> 00:16:27.581
What is the acceleration of the
object when I apply a force,

00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:31.000
F?
So, how would you do it?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.984
OK, and eighth,
or ninth, or tenth grader can

00:16:33.984 --> 00:16:36.019
do this.
OK, they would ask me,

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:39.750
what's the mass of the object?
OK, I ask you what is the

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.599
acceleration?
You would turn around and ask

00:16:42.599 --> 00:16:44.905
me, what is the mass of the
object?

00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:47.551
I tell you, the mass of the
object is M.

00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:50.671
And then you say,
oh sure, A is F divided by M,

00:16:50.671 --> 00:16:52.571
done.
It's as simple as that.

00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:56.708
OK, I could have gone into all
kinds of differential equations

00:16:56.708 --> 00:17:02.000
and so on to figure that out,
but you asked me for the mass.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.527
And you gave me the answer,
A is F divided by M.

00:17:05.527 --> 00:17:08.004
So, you ignored a bunch of
things.

00:17:08.004 --> 00:17:10.631
You ignored the shape of the
object.

00:17:10.631 --> 00:17:14.384
You ignored its color.
You ignored its temperature.

00:17:14.384 --> 00:17:17.987
OK, and you ignored the soft or
hard or whatever.

00:17:17.987 --> 00:17:20.915
OK, you ignored a whole bunch
of things.

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:25.493
You were focused on one thing.
OK, you're focused on its mass.

00:17:25.493 --> 00:17:29.547
And, it turns out that the
process really was developed

00:17:29.547 --> 00:17:34.545
from a set of simplifications.
That is called,

00:17:34.545 --> 00:17:40.008
does anybody remember this?
Point mass simplification.

00:17:40.008 --> 00:17:44.440
OK, so, in physics,
you've done this before.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.902
OK, you've simplified your
lives by viewing objects as

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:55.261
having a mass at a point,
and force is acting at that

00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:58.869
point.
OK, M is that property of the

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:02.270
object that is of interest to
you.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:06.908
This process is called,
in physics, point mass

00:18:06.908 --> 00:18:14.347
discretization.
OK, now using an analogy,

00:18:14.347 --> 00:18:24.608
and I'm going to show you a
similar simple process to do the

00:18:24.608 --> 00:18:31.562
problem with the light bulb.
OK, so take my light bulb

00:18:31.562 --> 00:18:32.000
again,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.882
And I focus on the filament of
the light bulb.

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:48.341
OK, all I care about is the
current flowing through the

00:18:48.341 --> 00:18:50.967
light bulb.
OK, I don't care about whether

00:18:50.967 --> 00:18:53.594
the filament is twisted,
whether it's hot.

00:18:53.594 --> 00:18:57.309
I don't care about its shape.
I don't care about its color.

00:18:57.309 --> 00:19:00.000
All I care about is the
current.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.381
OK, so to do that,
what we can do here at a very

00:19:03.381 --> 00:19:07.985
high level is since we just need
the current and don't care about

00:19:07.985 --> 00:19:12.230
a bunch of other properties,
we will simply replace the bulb

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.107
with a discrete object called a
resistor.

00:19:15.107 --> 00:19:19.136
So the discrete object is a
resistor, much like the point

00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:23.525
mass simplification that we did
earlier that replaced the bulb

00:19:23.525 --> 00:19:27.697
filament with a object called a
resistor, a discrete object

00:19:27.697 --> 00:19:31.906
called a resistor.
Or a lump object called

00:19:31.906 --> 00:19:37.044
resister, and put a value next
to it just like the mass for the

00:19:37.044 --> 00:19:39.447
object, a resistance value,
R.

00:19:39.447 --> 00:19:44.668
OK, now what I can do is in the
same manner, replace the battery

00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:49.723
with an object called a battery
object, and connect that here,

00:19:49.723 --> 00:19:52.127
the voltage,
V, applied to it.

00:19:52.127 --> 00:19:56.602
V falls across the resistor,
and I get my I simply from

00:19:56.602 --> 00:20:01.080
Ohm's law as we divide by R.
So, notice here,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.592
to replace this complicated
bulb, this really twisty,

00:20:04.592 --> 00:20:07.834
weird old thing with this
discreet thing called a

00:20:07.834 --> 00:20:11.954
resistor, and its only property
of interest was its resistance

00:20:11.954 --> 00:20:14.993
value, R, direct analogy to what
we did there.

00:20:14.993 --> 00:20:18.505
So, since R represents the only
property of interest,

00:20:18.505 --> 00:20:21.274
we can simply ignore all the
other things.

00:20:21.274 --> 00:20:24.246
So, notice here,
we've done things the simple

00:20:24.246 --> 00:20:25.394
way.
And remember,

00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:28.973
in EE, in the electrical
engineering, we do things the

00:20:28.973 --> 00:20:33.208
simple way.
OK, we could go the hard route

00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:37.035
and do Maxwell's equations,
and get PhD's in physics,

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:38.728
and so on.
But out here,

00:20:38.728 --> 00:20:42.703
we are looking to do useful,
interesting systems in the

00:20:42.703 --> 00:20:46.751
simplest way that we can.
OK, we do things a simple way.

00:20:46.751 --> 00:20:51.241
All right, so we just did this,
and boom, I found out what the

00:20:51.241 --> 00:20:54.185
current was.
Now, I cheated a little bit.

00:20:54.185 --> 00:20:58.233
I've cheated a little bit.
R is a lumped abstraction for

00:20:58.233 --> 00:21:01.989
the bulb.
So, you look at this resistor

00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:04.322
here.
That is simply a placeholder.

00:21:04.322 --> 00:21:08.164
It's a stand-in for this
complicated thing called a bulb.

00:21:08.164 --> 00:21:11.182
It's a discreet object.
It's a lumped object,

00:21:11.182 --> 00:21:14.956
and represents the bulb.
Now, so most of 6.002 will take

00:21:14.956 --> 00:21:17.151
off from here,
OK, and that's it.

00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:20.101
To very simple stuff,
like V is equal to IR,

00:21:20.101 --> 00:21:23.669
it's a simple high school
algebra to take off in that

00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:25.933
direction.
But before we go there,

00:21:25.933 --> 00:21:30.049
it's important to understand,
why was it that we were able to

00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:34.529
make the simplification?
OK, we did something else.

00:21:34.529 --> 00:21:37.000
Something's going on under the
covers here.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.470
On the one hand,
I say let's use Maxwell's,

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.588
and then I jump out and say,
hey, we can just use this

00:21:42.588 --> 00:21:45.176
simple thing.
I did something that allowed me

00:21:45.176 --> 00:21:48.352
to go from here to here.
And you need to understand why

00:21:48.352 --> 00:21:51.235
I did that and how I did that.
Understand it once,

00:21:51.235 --> 00:21:54.411
and then you won't have to need
that information again.

00:21:54.411 --> 00:21:58.058
You just need to understand it.
So, let's take a closer look at

00:21:58.058 --> 00:22:02.000
the bulb filament,
and look at what we really did.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.297
So, here's my filament,
A, and let's say that the

00:22:08.297 --> 00:22:12.758
surface area here,
I label that SA,

00:22:12.758 --> 00:22:17.875
and the one down here SB,
my voltage, V,

00:22:17.875 --> 00:22:23.124
applied there,
and this is what I call my

00:22:23.124 --> 00:22:28.897
black box that I've replaced
with a resistor.

00:22:28.897 --> 00:22:33.882
Notice that,
in order for this to work,

00:22:33.882 --> 00:22:40.995
V and I need to be defined.
So I needs to be defined,

00:22:40.995 --> 00:22:45.146
and V needs to be defined.
OK, if I give you a random

00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:49.855
object, and I don't tell you
anything else about the object,

00:22:49.855 --> 00:22:54.645
it's not clear I can do that.
OK, if it's a much more general

00:22:54.645 --> 00:22:58.716
situation, I have to write down
Maxwell's equations,

00:22:58.716 --> 00:23:01.509
and this is what I would write
down.

00:23:01.509 --> 00:23:05.900
Write down J dot dS as a
function of the coordinate here

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.769
integrated over the area minus,
OK, I would have to start from

00:23:10.769 --> 00:23:15.000
there from one of Maxwell's
equations.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.616
All right, notice that this
becomes IA, and this becomes IB

00:23:19.616 --> 00:23:23.278
in our simplification.
But, if I don't tell you

00:23:23.278 --> 00:23:26.621
anything else,
you have to start from here.

00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:31.000
You will have some varying
current here by point.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.866
You might have some other
current coming out here because

00:23:34.866 --> 00:23:38.111
I may have some charge buildup
happening inside.

00:23:38.111 --> 00:23:41.150
If charge is building up inside
the filament;

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.464
then I would have to put del q
by del t out here,

00:23:44.464 --> 00:23:48.607
right, the current in minus the
current out must equal charge

00:23:48.607 --> 00:23:51.161
buildup.
Whoa, where is this and where

00:23:51.161 --> 00:23:53.026
is that?
So this is reality.

00:23:53.026 --> 00:23:55.788
This is really,
really what I have to do.

00:23:55.788 --> 00:24:00.000
But how did I get there?
How did I get there?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.118
The key answer is,
as engineers,

00:24:02.118 --> 00:24:05.740
when in doubt we simplify.
Remember, we are engineers.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:09.020
Our goal in life is to build
interesting systems.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.343
OK and some are motivated by
money.

00:24:11.343 --> 00:24:15.307
OK, so our goal is to build
interesting systems and do good

00:24:15.307 --> 00:24:18.109
to humanity.
So, as long as we can build a

00:24:18.109 --> 00:24:20.091
good light bulb,
we are happy.

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:23.986
So what we can do is we can
say, look, all I care about is

00:24:23.986 --> 00:24:26.856
building interesting systems.
So I can say,

00:24:26.856 --> 00:24:32.025
hey, this stuff is too hard.
Let's make the assumption that

00:24:32.025 --> 00:24:36.075
all the systems that we will
consider will have this thing be

00:24:36.075 --> 00:24:37.696
zero.
OK, in other words,

00:24:37.696 --> 00:24:41.409
if I take a complete object,
if I take an element like a

00:24:41.409 --> 00:24:44.717
resistor or a capacitor,
the box around the entire

00:24:44.717 --> 00:24:48.970
element, OK, and I want to just
deal with those systems in which

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.345
this thing is zero.
You can come and beat me up and

00:24:52.345 --> 00:24:53.763
say, but why?
Why not?

00:24:53.763 --> 00:24:57.004
Why am I doing this?
And I am saying the world is

00:24:57.004 --> 00:24:58.759
arbitrary.
I'm an engineer;

00:24:58.759 --> 00:25:04.276
I want to build good systems.
By making this simplification,

00:25:04.276 --> 00:25:07.463
I eliminate this squiggle
thing, and so on.

00:25:07.463 --> 00:25:11.940
I don't want to deal with it.
I want to make my life simple.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.672
So this is gone to zero
because, why?

00:25:14.672 --> 00:25:19.149
Because I have said that in the
future I will only deal with

00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:21.956
those elements for which this is
true.

00:25:21.956 --> 00:25:26.585
I'm going to discipline myself.
I'm going to discipline myself

00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:32.452
to only deal with those systems.
OK, Maxwell is turning around

00:25:32.452 --> 00:25:36.089
and, you know,
mad at me and all that stuff,

00:25:36.089 --> 00:25:39.388
but tough.
So this, what I've said about

00:25:39.388 --> 00:25:43.701
making a simplification here,
and this is one of the

00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:48.014
simplifications I'm making.
And I give a name to the

00:25:48.014 --> 00:25:51.651
simplification.
And that's called the lumped

00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:55.626
matter discipline.
OK, so I'm saying I will only

00:25:55.626 --> 00:26:00.616
deal with elements for which if
I put a black box around it,

00:26:00.616 --> 00:26:06.260
this is going to be true.
And if this is going to be

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.173
true, then notice,
there is no charge buildup.

00:26:10.173 --> 00:26:13.043
Current in must equal current
out.

00:26:13.043 --> 00:26:15.217
Ah-ha!
So this becomes IA.

00:26:15.217 --> 00:26:16.956
This becomes IB.
Yes.

00:26:16.956 --> 00:26:20.173
OK, I can now deal with IA's
and IB's.

00:26:20.173 --> 00:26:24.000
And IB and IA are equal because
this is zero.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.130
Notice that there is a whole
bunch of depth here in the jump

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:33.275
from here to here.
As MIT graduates,

00:26:33.275 --> 00:26:37.325
you really, really need to
understand why it is that we

00:26:37.325 --> 00:26:40.325
made that jump,
and then go and use that,

00:26:40.325 --> 00:26:43.849
and do cool things.
All right, this allows us to

00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:46.700
define I.
We have a unique I associated

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.525
with an element for the current
through the element.

00:26:50.525 --> 00:26:55.099
We still have to worry about B,
and I won't go through that in

00:26:55.099 --> 00:26:57.575
detail.
The course notes have some

00:26:57.575 --> 00:27:02.000
discussion of that and so does
the textbook.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.076
So V, AB is defined when del
phi B, the rate of change of

00:27:07.076 --> 00:27:11.880
magnetic flux is zero.
So, if I take the element and I

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.774
take any region outside the
element, this must be true.

00:27:16.774 --> 00:27:20.038
And you say,
why should that be true?

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:23.482
That's not true in general.
Absolutely.

00:27:23.482 --> 00:27:28.195
It's not true in general.
But I, because I choose to,

00:27:28.195 --> 00:27:33.000
I going to deal with only those
elements.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.055
I will discipline myself.
But these are only those

00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:39.111
elements for which this is true,
and this is true.

00:27:39.111 --> 00:27:42.479
I'm going to limit my world.
I'm going to create a play

00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:44.599
field for myself.
You want to play;

00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:47.156
follow my rules.
OK, and that's called the

00:27:47.156 --> 00:27:50.587
lumped matter discipline.
So once you say that I'm going

00:27:50.587 --> 00:27:54.079
to adhere to the lump matter
discipline, and this is true

00:27:54.079 --> 00:27:56.886
inside your elements.
This is true outside the

00:27:56.886 --> 00:27:59.006
elements.
You can define VA and VB,

00:27:59.006 --> 00:28:03.835
and good things happen to you.
OK, let me show you a few

00:28:03.835 --> 00:28:06.845
examples of lumped elements.
But remember,

00:28:06.845 --> 00:28:10.736
a large part of what we're
doing is based on these two

00:28:10.736 --> 00:28:13.526
assumptions.
And to just go through the

00:28:13.526 --> 00:28:17.124
background on that,
I would encourage you to go to

00:28:17.124 --> 00:28:21.382
chapter 1 of your course notes
and read through just as how

00:28:21.382 --> 00:28:23.805
this came about,
that comes about.

00:28:23.805 --> 00:28:28.136
So, by doing that by adhering
to a lumped matter discipline,

00:28:28.136 --> 00:28:32.627
we can now lump objects.
We could lump a bulb into a

00:28:32.627 --> 00:28:34.316
resistor.
OK, so to be clear,

00:28:34.316 --> 00:28:36.908
a certain number of lumped
objects, and now,

00:28:36.908 --> 00:28:40.345
the universe is going to be
comprised into lumped objects.

00:28:40.345 --> 00:28:42.575
OK, so before this,
when he went home,

00:28:42.575 --> 00:28:44.565
we talked about eggs,
and omelets,

00:28:44.565 --> 00:28:46.313
and light bulbs,
and switches,

00:28:46.313 --> 00:28:49.569
but once you come to MIT,
and after you've taken 6.002,

00:28:49.569 --> 00:28:52.523
you begin talking about lumped
elements, you know,

00:28:52.523 --> 00:28:55.900
resistors, voltage sources,
capacitors, little inky-dinky

00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.000
objects that follow the lumped
matter discipline.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.290
OK, they stick to very simple
rules, and the math that you

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.827
have to do to analyze them is
incredibly simple.

00:29:07.827 --> 00:29:11.064
What could be simpler than V is
equal to IR?

00:29:11.064 --> 00:29:15.655
So, let me give you an example
of interesting lumped elements,

00:29:15.655 --> 00:29:20.021
and then show you a couple of
really nasty lumped elements.

00:29:20.021 --> 00:29:21.000
OK.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.259
OK, so what you see out here,
so we characterize lumped

00:29:33.259 --> 00:29:35.941
elements by the VI
characteristics.

00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:39.254
OK, you apply voltage,
measure the current.

00:29:39.254 --> 00:29:43.435
OK, so what I can do is I can
plot I here, and V here,

00:29:43.435 --> 00:29:48.010
and see what it looks like.
OK, I can characterize elements

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.875
by their VI relationship.
And there are a bunch of

00:29:51.875 --> 00:29:56.213
elements that I can create based
on the VI relationship.

00:29:56.213 --> 00:30:00.000
So let me show you a few
examples.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.903
So for the resistor,
since V is directly

00:30:02.903 --> 00:30:05.732
proportional to I,
and R is a constant,

00:30:05.732 --> 00:30:08.709
I get a straight line.
That's the I axis,

00:30:08.709 --> 00:30:11.389
the V axis, and this is the
resistor.

00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:14.590
What I actually have is a
variable resistor,

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.791
so I'm going to change the
resistance value,

00:30:17.791 --> 00:30:20.694
R, and the curve will also
change slope.

00:30:20.694 --> 00:30:24.491
OK, I changed the value of R
because it's a variable

00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:30.000
resistor, and the changes slope
because my R is different.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.545
OK, next, let me go to a fixed
resistor, and this guy here on

00:30:34.545 --> 00:30:37.803
the screen to your left is a
fixed resistor.

00:30:37.803 --> 00:30:41.742
And you see that its IV
characteristic is a line of a

00:30:41.742 --> 00:30:44.318
given slope, 1 by R,
and that's it.

00:30:44.318 --> 00:30:46.666
I can't change it.
Number three,

00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:51.060
I have another lumped element
called a Zener diode that you

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.772
will see in the fourth week of
this class, and the

00:30:54.772 --> 00:30:58.560
characteristics for the Zener
diode look like this:

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.743
IV.
If my voltage goes across the

00:31:01.743 --> 00:31:04.809
Zener diode goes up slightly,
the current shoots up.

00:31:04.809 --> 00:31:07.875
But if the voltage becomes
negative I don't have any

00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:11.122
current flowing into it until
the voltage passes on the

00:31:11.122 --> 00:31:14.428
threshold, at which point my
current begins to build up.

00:31:14.428 --> 00:31:17.194
OK, so I can increase the
voltage a little bit,

00:31:17.194 --> 00:31:20.200
and it can show that the
current starts building up

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.304
again.
So that's another interesting

00:31:22.304 --> 00:31:24.408
lumped element called a Zener
diode.

00:31:24.408 --> 00:31:26.993
Let's switch to the next one
called a diode.

00:31:26.993 --> 00:31:30.000
So a diode looks like this:
IV.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.555
As the voltage across the diode
becomes positive,

00:31:33.555 --> 00:31:35.777
around .6 volts,
or thereabout,

00:31:35.777 --> 00:31:40.222
the current begins to shoot up.
But when the voltage is below

00:31:40.222 --> 00:31:44.074
that threshold of .6,
then my current is almost zero.

00:31:44.074 --> 00:31:47.185
It's another lumped element
called a diode.

00:31:47.185 --> 00:31:51.555
And you will begin using these
elements in your 002 lives to

00:31:51.555 --> 00:31:55.037
build interesting systems.
The next example is a

00:31:55.037 --> 00:31:57.777
thermistor.
A thermistor is a resistor

00:31:57.777 --> 00:32:02.000
whose resistance varies with
temperature.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.238
OK, so this is a very expensive
little hairdryer,

00:32:08.238 --> 00:32:14.736
and what I'm going to do is
blow some hot air at my

00:32:14.736 --> 00:32:22.404
resistor, and you're going to
see that its value is going to

00:32:22.404 --> 00:32:27.342
change depending on how much I
heat it.

00:32:27.342 --> 00:32:32.541
So as it cools down,
let me cool it down,

00:32:32.541 --> 00:32:38.000
so you can see it's coming
down.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.638
I can zap it again.
I could do this all day.

00:32:41.638 --> 00:32:45.107
This is so much fun.
OK, so that's another

00:32:45.107 --> 00:32:49.507
interesting lumped element.
As the temperature rises,

00:32:49.507 --> 00:32:53.653
its resistance changes.
The next thing is called a

00:32:53.653 --> 00:32:56.276
photo resistor.
It's a resistor.

00:32:56.276 --> 00:33:00.000
It used to be a resistor;
Lorenzo?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.810
Oh OK, that's fine.
So this is a photo resistor.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:08.189
And notice that it almost
behaves like an open circuit.

00:33:08.189 --> 00:33:12.243
But what I'm going to do is
shine some light on it.

00:33:12.243 --> 00:33:16.216
When I shine light on it,
it begins to conduct and

00:33:16.216 --> 00:33:18.810
becomes a resistor of some
value.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.378
There you go.
OK, so that's a photo resistor.

00:33:22.378 --> 00:33:25.459
So now I'm going to show you a
battery.

00:33:25.459 --> 00:33:30.000
Notice we did talk about
batteries before.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.697
I'll show you a battery.
So before you show a battery,

00:33:33.697 --> 00:33:36.976
just thinking your own minds,
what should the IV

00:33:36.976 --> 00:33:39.558
characteristic of a battery look
like?

00:33:39.558 --> 00:33:41.790
IV.
A battery supplies a constant

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.162
voltage.
You know your little cell,

00:33:44.162 --> 00:33:45.906
the AA battery,
1.5 volts?

00:33:45.906 --> 00:33:49.465
So, think of what the IV
characteristic of a battery

00:33:49.465 --> 00:33:53.232
should look like for three
seconds before it shows you.

00:33:53.232 --> 00:33:55.604
This is the one I showed,
Lorenzo?.

00:33:55.604 --> 00:34:00.000
It's a straight line.
This is a good battery.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.955
It's a straight,
vertical line,

00:34:01.955 --> 00:34:05.474
but says that the voltage is
1.5 volts, or thereabouts.

00:34:05.474 --> 00:34:08.928
No matter what current it
supplies as an ideal voltage

00:34:08.928 --> 00:34:12.578
source, it has a fixed voltage,
V, and no matter what the

00:34:12.578 --> 00:34:15.837
current going through is.
Now, I'll show you a dud,

00:34:15.837 --> 00:34:18.313
a bad battery,
and this is what the bad

00:34:18.313 --> 00:34:21.441
battery looks like.
So, many of you have had your

00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:24.700
car batteries die on you.
When you go to the store,

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.763
they check your batteries.
They use exactly this

00:34:27.763 --> 00:34:32.000
principle, that dead batteries
have resistance.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.257
By the way, you see slopes
here.

00:34:34.257 --> 00:34:38.626
You're thinking of resistance.
OK, they can use this property

00:34:38.626 --> 00:34:41.466
to figure out that your battery
is dead.

00:34:41.466 --> 00:34:44.160
So that's a dead battery.
And finally,

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.509
let me show you a bulb.
We started with a bulb,

00:34:47.509 --> 00:34:51.004
and so I need to end,
OK, we started with a bulb,

00:34:51.004 --> 00:34:55.373
so I need to end with a bulb.
And what you will see is that a

00:34:55.373 --> 00:34:57.922
bulb simply behaves like a
resistor.

00:34:57.922 --> 00:35:02.000
Its IV curve is going to look
like this.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.823
OK, notice this is my bulb.
And guess what,

00:35:04.823 --> 00:35:08.722
it behaves like a resistor.
It's a very interesting kind of

00:35:08.722 --> 00:35:11.680
resistor, so I won't go into
details for now.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.773
But notice its IV
characteristic behaves like a

00:35:14.773 --> 00:35:17.260
resistor.
OK, so those are some pretty

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.890
standard lumped elements.
You deal with a lot more sets

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:23.378
of lumped elements,
switches, MOSFETs,

00:35:23.378 --> 00:35:26.672
capacitors, inductors,
a bunch of other fun stuff.

00:35:26.672 --> 00:35:29.899
But before we do that,
what I wanted to tell you,

00:35:29.899 --> 00:35:34.000
don't go berserk on this
abstraction binge.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.126
Too much of anything is bad for
you.

00:35:36.126 --> 00:35:39.710
So what I'm going to show you
is, abstractions or models are

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:43.112
only valid provided you work
within a set of constraints.

00:35:43.112 --> 00:35:46.635
Notice, we have already had
this tacit handshake which said

00:35:46.635 --> 00:35:49.915
that we follow the discipline.
Even after we follow the

00:35:49.915 --> 00:35:53.621
discipline, there are ranges to
how well physical elements can

00:35:53.621 --> 00:35:55.626
behave like ideal lumped
elements.

00:35:55.626 --> 00:35:58.481
OK, for example,
what we will do is show you the

00:35:58.481 --> 00:36:02.381
resistor.
And it's going to look like a

00:36:02.381 --> 00:36:04.845
resistor.
And I'm going to keep

00:36:04.845 --> 00:36:07.473
increasing the voltage around
it.

00:36:07.473 --> 00:36:10.758
OK, what's going to happen at
some point?

00:36:10.758 --> 00:36:14.700
I just keep doing that.
If it's an ideal element,

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.821
if you're a theorist,
you say, oh yeah,

00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:22.091
the curve will keep extending
until I reach infinity.

00:36:22.091 --> 00:36:26.608
But this is a practical
resistor, so people out here can

00:36:26.608 --> 00:36:31.536
cover your eyes or something.
OK, so you're abstraction can't

00:36:31.536 --> 00:36:36.154
predict that.
All it says is the current is

00:36:36.154 --> 00:36:38.605
an amp.
It can't predict the heat,

00:36:38.605 --> 00:36:41.428
light, or the smell.
In the laboratory,

00:36:41.428 --> 00:36:45.514
even, you get the smell.
You know what somebody has just

00:36:45.514 --> 00:36:47.965
done.
So that's one example of the

00:36:47.965 --> 00:36:50.342
lumped abstraction breaking
down.

00:36:50.342 --> 00:36:54.725
So, if I really believe that my
own BS, anything is a lumped

00:36:54.725 --> 00:36:56.731
element.
So here's a pickle.

00:36:56.731 --> 00:37:02.386
A pickle is a lumped element.
I can choose it as a lumped

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:05.832
resistor.
But this is a very interesting

00:37:05.832 --> 00:37:09.279
lumped resistor.
Don't try this at home.

00:37:09.279 --> 00:37:14.669
This is a standard pickle into
which you are pumping 110 V AC.

00:37:14.669 --> 00:37:18.204
I promise you,
this is a standard pickle.

00:37:18.204 --> 00:37:23.241
So, it has a fixed resistance,
but your lumped abstraction

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:27.306
cannot predict the nice light
and sound effect.

00:37:27.306 --> 00:37:32.079
OK, so the last two or three
minutes what I want to do,

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:35.348
so remember,
don't get carried away by

00:37:35.348 --> 00:37:39.560
abstractions.
There are limits.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.498
OK, you can't predict
everything.

00:37:42.498 --> 00:37:45.436
OK, that's the smell of a
pickle.

00:37:45.436 --> 00:37:49.842
OK, so let me give you a
preview of some upcoming

00:37:49.842 --> 00:37:55.442
attractions, and show you one
more quick simplification in the

00:37:55.442 --> 00:37:58.655
last few minutes.
So what we can do,

00:37:58.655 --> 00:38:03.980
once we build these lumped
elements, we can connect them in

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.997
circuits.
OK, so I can build a circuit,

00:38:07.997 --> 00:38:10.959
of the sort.
So here's a voltage source with

00:38:10.959 --> 00:38:14.403
a bunch of resistors.
I can connect them with wires

00:38:14.403 --> 00:38:18.743
and build a circuit of the sort.
One interesting question we can

00:38:18.743 --> 00:38:21.498
ask ourselves is,
under the lumped matter

00:38:21.498 --> 00:38:24.667
discipline, what can we say
about the voltages?

00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:28.524
OK, if I go around the loop,
provided my world adheres to

00:38:28.524 --> 00:38:32.175
the lumped matter discipline,
what can I say about the

00:38:32.175 --> 00:38:36.750
voltages around this loop?
Ah-ha, Maxwell again,

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.333
right?
So, I can write Maxwell's

00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:42.166
appropriate equation to solve
that.

00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:47.333
OK, voltages have something to
do with E and your integral of E

00:38:47.333 --> 00:38:50.250
dot dl and all of that stuff,
right?

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:54.666
So this is the appropriate
Maxwell's equations to use.

00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:58.000
And I want to find out what
happens here.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.833
Now remember,
under LMD, I made the

00:39:00.833 --> 00:39:04.465
assumption.
OK, my world,

00:39:04.465 --> 00:39:09.199
my playground,
has del phi B by del t being

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:13.032
zero.
The rate of change of flux is

00:39:13.032 --> 00:39:16.978
zero.
So, under these circumstances,

00:39:16.978 --> 00:39:21.599
I can write this.
I can break up this line

00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:28.476
integral into three parts across
the voltage source and across

00:39:28.476 --> 00:39:34.000
the two resistors and write that
down.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.205
OK, and then when I can do,
is now that the right-hand side

00:39:38.205 --> 00:39:42.773
is zero, I can simply take this.
And I know that E dot dl across

00:39:42.773 --> 00:39:45.601
this element is simply VCA.
This is VAB,

00:39:45.601 --> 00:39:49.226
and this is VBC equals zero.
OK, so when I make the

00:39:49.226 --> 00:39:53.794
assumption that del phi B by del
t is zero, and I go around this

00:39:53.794 --> 00:39:58.000
loop, apply Maxwell's equations,
what do I find?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.881
I find that the sum of the
voltages, VCA plus VAB plus VBC,

00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:06.416
is zero.
That's fantastic.

00:40:06.416 --> 00:40:11.690
So now, I could say hasta la
vista to this baby here.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:17.369
And I can focus on this guy and
say, Maxwell's equations,

00:40:17.369 --> 00:40:22.743
this thing with squiggles and
dels and all that stuff,

00:40:22.743 --> 00:40:28.726
can be simplified to the sum of
the voltages across a set of

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:34.000
elements in a loop in a circuit
is zero.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.055
OK, and this is called
Kirchhoff's first first law,

00:40:39.055 --> 00:40:40.875
KVL.
OK, similarly,

00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:46.032
in recitation section,
you'll see the application of

00:40:46.032 --> 00:40:51.492
Kirchhoff's current law,
which comes from this be equal

00:40:51.492 --> 00:40:57.458
to zero, and all the currents
coming into a node being zero.

00:40:57.458 --> 00:41:02.817
So, KVL and KCl directly come
out of the lumped matter

00:41:02.817 --> 00:41:06.963
discipline.
And you can use those to solve

00:41:06.963 --> 00:41:08.229
circuits like this.
