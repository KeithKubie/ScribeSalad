00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Alright so several months ago we took a deep dive and learned exactly how bird wings work.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.980
And it was pretty cool, so go check it out if you want, but, a couple of you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.980
had the audacity to ask me how bat wings work and I didn't know the answer.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.980
So you hear that behind me right? It's a waterfall. It's called Blowing Wind Cave, and there are thousands

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.980
of bats overhead right now flying to the river to eat for the night. You see those little

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.980
dots? They're all bats... All of them.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.980
That's pretty crazy isn't it? So here's the deal. I'm gonna send you to the Peruvian Amazon rainforest with

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.980
ignorant Destin from several months ago, and a Phantom high-speed camera. So go

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.980
make observations and when you get back, me and you are gonna talk about bat-wing biomechanics by looking

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.980
at data from Brown University's bat wing wind tunnel

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.980
It's amazing. I'll see you on the flip side. This is worth your time. I'm going to the cave.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.980
So bats... Amazon rainforest, they live everywhere.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.980
They live in the top of hollow trees, like this one, which

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.980
I can understand because right now I'm about, oh I don't know, 30

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.980
40 feet off the ground? Here's Phil. Phil what kind of tree are we in?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.980
(Phil) We are in a strangler fig, which means that basically

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.980
the figs start off as a vine, and then strangle the tree that used to live in this hollow space

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.980
(Destin) Here, I'll hand this off to you.
(Phil) Cool.
- There's some high speed

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.980
video we're gonna shoot of bats that live near a lake nearby, so we're gonna go check that

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.980
out. Right now, let's just try to get video of this. Getting Smarter Every Day.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.980
See em?
- Oh yeah nice!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.980
- There he is... You don't like me being here do you?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.980
Oh man!

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.980
The joker just peed in my mouth. Stop. I need to clarify, that was

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.980
a lie. The bat didn't actually poop in my mouth. He pooped towards my mouth and

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.980
it was deflected by my moustache and then it hit me on the mole here. So, good thing I had a moustache.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.980
That's cool.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.980
Our guide Gerson grew up in the area so he knew the exact log that bats like to hang out

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.980
on. So that's where the bat is huh?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.980
[music]

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.980
So how do

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.980
bats fly differently than birds? That's the question I want to answer here.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.980
So when I started researching the topic, several papers lead me to the real

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.980
life dynamic duo Dr Kim Breuer, who's an engineer, and Dr Sharon Swartz who's a biologist.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.980
They work together at Brown University school of engineering animal flight

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.980
wind tunnel to unravel the mysteries of bat flight. Now most people's knowledge of how bats fly

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.980
stops at echo location, but I want to go much further than that. If you look back at the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.980
high speed you'll notice that when the bat strikes the other bat in the head his entire body starts to roll

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.980
to one side. Now at first blush it looks like he might be countering the aerodynamic lift

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.980
of that open wing by rolling his body. But if you look at this footage that I captured

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.980
of macaws, you can see when one of the macaws strikes another one in the head, he doesn't

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.980
roll his body like the bat does. Now what's the difference in the bat and the macaw?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.980
The answer is mass. Bats have 12-20% of their entire body weight

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.980
in each one of their wings. This means that inertial forces play a much bigger role

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.980
in bat flight than they do in bird flight because birds are much lower than that. If you think about it,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.980
the ability to react against their own wing mass allows bats to do maneuvers that birds

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.980
can't. For example, go from full speed flight to an upside down and sideways

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.980
twist in order to gently grab the top of a cave. Don't let this freak you out

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.980
There's this place I like to go where owls will drop their prey and they decompose.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.980
What's so cool about that is the soft tissue will decompose in the same position as it usuallt

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.980
is relative to the bones. Now on this duck that means we can check out the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.980
wing structure really well. Look at this. You can see the major bones here.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.980
What I think's cool is you can see that there's no bones that go down into the wing. Bats have

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.980
an entire hand built into the wing. That means a bat has a lot more precision

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.980
control over the shape of the wing relative to a bird who basically just has a few major

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.980
joints and the ability to pitch each individual feather. So when you use a wind tunnel typically you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.980
put a model right in the middle and then you'll measure the airflow over the surfaces of the model.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.980
But what do you do if your model is actually a bat and it can fly wherever it wants? How do you know where to measure?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.980
Well the answer is you put dots on the model, or in this case a bat.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.980
Using multiple camera angles and a little math researchers track the position of each individual dot

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.980
and can recreate a simulation of how the finger joints in the wing open and close

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.980
the wing. This doesn't answer our airflow question though.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.980
(Son speaking, unintelligible)
That's right. Particle image

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.980
velocimitery is a pretty interesting way of measuring a flow field, so right now at springtime

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.980
in Alabama and there's pollen all over my driveway. So as my son pours this water

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.980
out, if you look you can see this pollen moving along with the water. It's pretty awesome

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.980
because it lets you see things in the flow that you couldn't see before like this little vortex.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.980
This is exactly what the researchers are doing with the bats. They put

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.980
particles in the wind tunnel and then they illuminate the particles with a laser. They then take these images

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.980
and calculate the local vorticity omega. By plugging 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.980
omega in and integrating over a defined area you can get circulation, or gamma. Gamma goes

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.980
into one last equation and there you have it. The lift generated by a bat wing while in flight.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.980
Imagine how useful this could be if you're doing something awesome like oh...

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.980
I don't know... Developing a robotic bat wing. Yep.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.980
That's happening. So did I answer your question? Bats have more mass in their wings

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.980
so they maneuver using inertia. They're more agile than birds, they can even hover.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.980
They control their wing geometry better so on the back stroke instead of delaminating

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.980
the wing they umbrella fold and slide the wing along their body. Heck they even

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.980
fly before they can fly. They're mammals, their moms carry them. Here's a question for you in the comments.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.980
Some bats have tail membranes and some don't. So how do you think that affects flight?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.980
So big thanks to Dr Breuer and Dr Swartz for letting us use your research video. I think

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.980
a good way of ending this would be to couple that with some music that Gordon wrote that reminds me

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.980
of Castlevania. Quick warning though, there's a little nightmare fuel in this. Anyway, I'm Destin,
