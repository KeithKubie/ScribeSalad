00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:32.010
- We are the paradoxical ape, bipedal,
naked, large brain, long the master of

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:40.339
fire, tools and language but still trying
to understand ourselves. Aware that death

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:49.739
is inevitable, yet filled with optimism.
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.108
we empathize and deceive, we shape the
future from our shared understanding of

00:00:57.108 --> 00:01:04.328
the past. CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines to exchange

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:11.231
insights on who we are and how we got
here, an exploration made possible

00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:14.377
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:02:26.794 --> 00:02:31.170
- Thanks very much and thanks to all of
you for coming. It's wonderful to be here

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.200
and talk to such an incredible audience. I
thought I'd start off by posing a question

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.640
that I think is particularly relevant to
all of us thinking about language

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.860
evolution. And that's, what's so special
about language? In a sense, the goal of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.090
evolutionary linguistics, is to try and
explain the origins of the special

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.130
properties of language. And there are two
that I want to focus on today. And in

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.570
fact, Roger started with one of them. So
first off, I want to highlight structure.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.768
Language has a highly unusual and rich
systematic structure

00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:16.618
in the way it's put together.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.100
So when I say the phrase two boots, you're
able to relate the acoustic wave-form that

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.880
hits your ears and to this rather cute
picture of my son's shoes on this slide.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.030
Now, how are you able to do that? You are
able to do that because of the special

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.410
structure that language has. The signals
that we produce are constructed sequences

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.160
of these meaningless elements, we call
them phonemes. So these different phonemes

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.750
are put together in different ways, we
organize them in different ways to make up

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.850
the sounds of our language and sequences.
But furthermore, these meaningless

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.000
elements are themselves put together to
make morphemes, the meaning-carrying

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.390
elements of language.
And these are put together to construct

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.950
meaningful holes. So you understand what
two boots means because you understand

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.900
these ways in which language recombines
elements. And it's because of this

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.240
recombination, because we can endlessly
recombine elements of these two different

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.160
levels, that we are able to talk about
anything. So we're able to constantly

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.930
reproduce completely new utterances with
the happy expectation that everyone can

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.460
understand this. This is an incredible
feat and remarkably, it seems to be unique

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.870
to our species. So that was one of the
special features of language structure.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:55.050
So next up, the other one I want to talk
about is learning. So we are able to use

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.970
language because we have learned both how
to produce the signals in our language and

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.750
we've also learned, perhaps even more
remarkably, what the signals in our

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.060
language mean. So we're able to use
language meaningfully because we've

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.200
observed language being used around us as
we grow up. Again, this combination of

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.390
learning, this signal and learning the
meaning seems to be unique in nature. What

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.774
I'm particularly interested in, is the
fact that this is a very

00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:26.761
particular kind of learning.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.230
When we learn language, we're learning
from the product of other people who've

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.620
gone through the same learning process.
So we learn from the observation of the

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.590
output of other learners. So this is
something that I call iterated learning.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.830
It's a particular and relatively unusual
process in nature. So what iterated

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.230
learning means is that the language I
speak, I learned by observing language

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.990
being produced by my parents and the
language I produce is going on to affect

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.160
the language that my son and
daughter are acquiring.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.090
So what this means is that we have this
process of cultural transmission of

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.780
language through this mapping from
external production of language and some

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.060
internal representation of language. And
what this means is that language is

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.260
evolved. So this is a kind of cultural
evolution. Language itself is an

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.040
evolutionary system in its own right. What
I want to suggest today is that these two

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:40.320
features, structure and iterated learning
are related to each other. And in fact,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.280
what I want to claim is that language
structure is the inevitable consequence of

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.080
the fact that language is a culturally
evolving system.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:57.030
So I want to try and pose it onto this
question affirmatively, that cultural

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.430
evolution can explain why language has the
structure that it does. So how on earth

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.690
could we go about answering this question?
This is one of the challenges of doing

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.470
evolutionary linguistics, is how on earth
do you study it scientifically? There are

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.560
lots of ways and you're going to hear
about a lot of them today. One of the ways

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:22.490
that we pioneered my lab in Ettenberg, was
to try and recreate language evolution,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.590
the cultural evolution of
language in the experiment lab.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.640
So I'm going to show you how we do that.
I'm going to give you two examples of two

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.960
experiments that we've done. It will give
you a flavor of the way in which we can

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:39.810
study cultural evolution of language in
the lab. So generally, how do we do this?

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:45.380
What we did is, we brought together two
kind of expanded experimental techniques

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.270
from two different areas. One was a
paradigm from psycholinguistics called

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.930
artificial language learning, where we get
participants into the lab and teach them

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:01.860
miniature languages, and then test them.
And another technique from experimental

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.400
anthropology, I guess you'd call it
transmission chain paradigm and this is a

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:12.020
way people study the process of cultural
evolution in various different domains. So

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.930
we just plug in those two together. So
I'll talk you through in general, how it

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.370
works, and then I'll give you the two
specific examples. So first off, we bring

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.100
our participants into the lab and we ask
them to learn a miniature language. And

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.580
so, this is a very, very small miniature
artificial language that we've created. So

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.210
we might have them in the lab for an hour,
maximum, and then we test them. So we get

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.395
them to produce utterances in this
miniature language.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.870
At this stage, this is the standard
paradigm artificial language but the twist

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:53.750
we put on it is that we used the output of
that participant when we test them, to

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.540
form the language that the next
participant in the lab is going to learn

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.160
from. And then, we take the output of that
second participant and use that to form

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.630
the input training data for the third
participant in the lab and so on. So, we

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:13.680
create a chain of transmission of this
miniature language and watched how it

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.980
evolves as it passes from participant to
participant in our experiments.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.152
What we typically do is we start with
language in scare quotes

00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:28.790
that is random and unstructured and
doesn't have these structural properties

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.210
that we're interested in. And then we want
to see if those structural properties

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.060
emerge through this process of
transmission over these artificial

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.390
generations that we've created in the lab
experiments. Okay, so that's the general

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:51.500
structures of this experimental approach,
and I'm going to give you two examples. So

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.470
here's the first example, this is a joint
work with Hannah Cornish and Kenny Smith,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.680
picture there, and this is our first
experiment, the first experiment that we

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.810
did in our lab. And so this,
as you can see, 2008, this is

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.910
a relatively recent approach that we've
been taking here. And what we wanted to do

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.461
is look for this emergence of
compositional structures.

00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:17.330
Compositional structure is the idea that
you can put words together to make

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:22.350
meanings. So the meaning of a whole
expression is made up of the meanings of

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.195
parts of that expression. So I wanted to
see if we could get back to

00:10:26.195 --> 00:10:30.322
emerge in these lab experiments.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:37.460
So what participants did, so we have this
kind of experimental chain of participants

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.480
and what the participants were asked to do
was learn a miniature language, and the

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.650
language was made up of these weird
meanings, which were just colored shapes

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:52.570
that were moving in different ways. And we
had three colors and three shapes and

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.110
three different types of movement. So
three, times three, times three, that

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.990
makes 27 different possible meanings
in this language.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:06.140
So when I say miniature language, I really
mean miniature. These pictures, these

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.680
meanings were paired with strings of
syllables and these were just made up at

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.480
random by the computer. This is a
completely unstructured arbitrary

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:20.790
language, every single meaning was given a
different label. And each participant was

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:26.870
trained on half of the language but then
was tested on all of the meanings.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:32.480
So they were trained on half of the
meanings, but then were asked to produce

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.920
strings of syllables for all of the
meanings when we tested them. And then

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.310
there I put then forms of input for the
next participant in the lab. And again, we

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.350
took a random half of the first
participant to train the second one and

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.320
then test the second one and then take
another random half of their language to

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:59.990
train the third participant and so on down
the chain. So what happens?

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:06.280
Well, what we find is that the people are
absolutely terrible at this task. So, this

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:13.260
graph shows error and it's rather a
forgiving measure of error, an error of

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.190
one would mean that you've got not a
single character, not a single letter

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.810
right, in the target word.
An error of zero

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.240
means you got everything right. And
what you see here is four different runs

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.490
of the experiment and each point on this
graph is a different participant. So, the

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:33.100
first participant in the lab had a really
terrible time. In fact, nobody got a

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:40.850
single word exactly right, it's empty,
absolutely awful. By the end, however, the

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:46.190
participants in the later generations in
these chains, some of them were getting

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:53.440
everything exactly right, including the
meanings that they weren't trained on.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.770
So they were successfully guessing the
correct label for meanings that we didn't

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:05.400
even train them on. So how on earth is
that happening? Well, I'll show you what

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.050
the languages look like as they evolve. So
here's an initial random language, for

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:15.870
example, this table, the word manikin is
the word for a blue square that's moving

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:21.400
horizontally. Now, bear in mind, you're
trained in half of this language, imagine

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.840
if I blanked out half of these words and
then I asked you to reconstruct the

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.460
missing words, then you'd have no hope.
You couldn't possibly get it right because

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.930
this is random. So, if you didn't know
that that word was miniki, there's no way

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.910
you could guess it. So that's why they're
doing so badly. And this is what that same

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.049
language looks like ten generations later.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:50.970
So now you see how the participants are
doing this. So, now, if I blanked off half

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.750
of those words, you'll be able to
successfully guess what the missing words

00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:01.140
were. For example, the word poi now refers
to all spiraling objects.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.430
So this language has evolved to become
more easy to learn but it's evolved in a

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:11.850
very, very slightly disappointing way from
our point of view. So it's evolved just by

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:19.190
jettisoning words in a particular way, so
that these words refer to particular

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.490
sections of the set of meanings. So why is
it happening? In fact there's some

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.910
versions of the experiment we go down to a
single word for all things.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.530
So, clearly, we need something else in
this experiment. We need some kind of

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:38.550
pressure to be expressive as well as
learnable for the language. I can't go

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.880
into the details, we don't have time, but
what we essentially did was we added in a

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.920
filter on the output of each participant.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.380
So we threw out items that were ambiguous
before we passed it on to the next

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.520
participant. None of the participants
could be aware that we were doing this

00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:00.090
manipulation. So we ran the whole
experiment again with this extra hidden

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:06.800
step and we got completely different
results. So, here's again, another initial

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:13.300
language again, completely random. And
now, ten generations later, it looks quite

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.160
different. Now, what I've done here is I
added in hyphens to make it easier for you

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.860
to see, but the participants don't get to
see these hyphens, right.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:28.260
What you see here is that different parts
of the signals correspond to different

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.940
parts of the meanings. So for example,
this n prefix means the black things, the

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:41.550
r prefix means red things, a plo suffix
means something that's bouncing and so on.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:45.490
So this is the compositionality we're
looking for and it emerged down to this

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:51.340
process of cultural transmission. So
structure seems to emerge spontaneously

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.740
from this process of cultural evolution.
Now, a couple of obvious worries that you

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.700
might have, so firstly, perhaps the
participants in our experiment are kind of

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.980
deliberately thinking, "Well, this
language is rubbish, here's how we can fix

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.900
it up, we'll add some structure."
Well, you don't think that's what's

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.670
happening because, bear in mind, these two
different runs of experiment are very

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.820
different languages but the participants
couldn't know which condition they were

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.100
in. Now, the possible objection is, "Well,
okay that they already speak a language. "

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.760
In fact, all of our participants spoke
English. So, it's not surprising that they

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.730
gradually changed the system to be one
that looks more like a language. Well,

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.620
that's a valid worry, so we've recreated
all of this experiment in a computer

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:43.170
simulation, where we can know that our
computational participants don't have a

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:48.940
pre-existing language and we get the same
results. So that's my first example.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.890
The second example, and we wanted to move
away from this starting point with these

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.650
random strings because that seems to be a
bit weird, where do they come from? And

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:05.110
instead, we start from potentially much
more natural starting point, one of

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:10.760
gestural pantomime. And we wanted to see
if we could evolve structured, something

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.530
that looks like a structured sign
language, miniature structured sign

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.234
language out of the initial state that was
iconic pantomime.

00:17:17.234 --> 00:17:21.149
And this is joint work with Kenny Smith,
Katya Brumifer, and Erica Cartmill.

00:17:22.018 --> 00:17:27.120
So here's how the experiment works. So, in
this version of the experiment, the

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:34.550
meanings now are videos of a bouncing
ball, so here's one. That's the things

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:39.740
that have to be conveyed and the signals
are manual gestures made to a video

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:48.750
camera, so, something like this. And the
initial language in this experiment was

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.370
improvised one off pantomimes that we got
people into the lab and just said, "Okay

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.480
can you give the pantomime that
corresponds to this video?"

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:01.660
Participants are trained on 12 out of the
16 videos, but asked to produce gestures

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.800
for all 16. And then the
same process of this

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:11.560
diffusion chain, transmission chain we
supplied. So we'd see how the gestures of

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.450
all of the generations. I'll just show you
the four sets of meanings, it's a little

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:21.840
bit alarming when you see it. So these are
all the different videos tied together,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.360
and what you can see here is there is
different paths in which the ball moves

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.570
along, so flat, sloping, in an S shape, or
in a circle. And there are different

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:36.090
manners that the ball might be bouncing or
rolling or spinning or giving this

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:41.740
nightmarish, gesturing motion. So that's
the set of meanings they have to convey.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.010
This is what the initial pantomimes look
like for all the participants we got in

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:52.550
just to do one off the gestures for these.
And what you see here is there's a huge

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:58.070
range of different strategies that people
use to produce these meanings.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.390
There's an enormous diversity in
strategies here. So what we were

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.515
interested in, some of them are more
successful than others.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:12.240
What we're interested in is how do these
strategies evolve down generations. So

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.970
here's our first participant who saw 12 of
these and then produced a gesture for each

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:23.450
of them. Now, it looks more systematic
because it's one person, so they all look

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.850
a little bit more similar. In fact,
there's still a lot of diversity here if

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:33.000
you look at the handshake used to convey
the ball and so on, there's still a lot of

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:37.880
diversity. And much later in the same
chain, we have this participant.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:45.700
Now, it's looking much more systematic.
There is, if you look at handshake for

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.830
example, it's now very similar across all
the different videos and there are

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.870
particular kinds of systematicity we're
interested in. So here's an example from

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:59.620
another chain, which I particularly like,
and have a look at what she's doing here

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:05.220
to convey the ball moving.
So she signals the ball and says the

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.740
manner and then the path. So she separated
out two aspects of this meaning

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.360
compositionally into two different parts.
And indeed, another interesting thing that

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.910
she does here, she self-corrects. She
says, "Oh no, I got it wrong" and watch

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:26.000
again, she'll do it again. This indicates
that at this point in this evolution of

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.790
language, she's seeing that there's a
right and wrong answer, it's become

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:35.310
grammatically. Just to summarize these,
then I'll be done. So over time, the

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:41.180
gestures in this language become less
pantomimic and more conventional. And we

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.900
can actually measure this, we can show the
systematic structure emerges over

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.011
generations in this experiment.

00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:52.050
And interestingly, the separation of
manner and path, mirrors what we can see

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:57.760
in real emerging sign languages. So this
is work by Anne Senghas and colleagues,

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.800
looking at how in Nicaraguan sign language
and emerging sign language we get the

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:08.200
separation of manner and path emerging
over generations, over cohorts. So, final

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:16.340
conclusions, I want to argue that language
is an evolutionary system in its own right

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:21.730
and because of this, languages adapt and
they adapt to path more easily from

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:27.910
learner to learner. And linguistic
structure is the solution that cultural

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.470
evolution finds the problem at being
learnable. So it's an inevitable

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.480
consequence of the way language is
transmitted and we can and indeed we

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.323
should study this process in the
experiment lab. Thank you very much.

00:21:54.127 --> 00:21:57.251
- Thank you and thank you very much for
the invitation to join you today.

00:21:58.909 --> 00:22:02.926
As speakers of English when we
hear constructions like get 'em

00:22:02.926 --> 00:22:09.350
bring 'em, take 'em, we analyze those
as a verb and a pronoun, get them or get

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:14.630
him, bring them or bring him. This
analysis is supported by the fact that we

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:20.620
read and write, we rarely see the informal
forms written so usually the formal forms.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.780
And through schooling, which generally
tell us to use the formal forms and to

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.870
leave the others alone but we also know
when it's appropriate to use which style

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:36.920
in which context. We're now going to move
to a different context where speakers

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.372
heard those constructions but
analyze them differently.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.370
When Australia was colonized, there were
about 250 languages spoken by indigenous

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:52.780
people. The speakers of the Australian
languages and the English speakers had to

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:59.090
learn to communicate with each other very
quickly. Usually, the English speakers

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:03.000
didn't learn much of the Australian
languages. The onus was on the indigenous

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:10.500
people to learn as much English as they
could to get by with. So let's imagine

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.010
that English speakers were using the
informal constructions a lot when they

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.828
were speaking, take 'em over there,
bring 'em back, constructions like

00:23:18.828 --> 00:23:21.777
that we use all the time
without thinking about it.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.710
The speakers of the Australian language
who hadn't yet learned English, identify

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:34.390
the pattern in what they are hearing. When
they heard verbs like get, bring, take,

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:39.770
they frequently heard something like mm,
occurring after the verb but they didn't

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:45.490
hear that when the verb was something like
walk, which doesn't have a direct object.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:51.520
So they came to analyze the mm that we
would think of as a pronoun as being a

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.070
grammatical element that attaches to a
transitive verb, it's a verb with an

00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:02.860
object but not to verbs like walk and run.
They didn't have literacy or schooling to

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.780
influence their analysis, they just made
this analysis from identifying patterns in

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:13.610
the language being spoken to them and what
they heard around them. So the transitive

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:21.810
mm or the transitive marker is a new
structure that came into that system that

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:25.760
was not the same as the structure that was
already in English and it was not in the

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:32.270
Australian languages either but we can see
where it came from. But the Australian

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:38.950
languages did influence that structure in
abstract ways. The form of in, is clearly

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:44.420
from English, but there are other
influences from the Australian languages,

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.595
I've just listed a few of them here.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.420
One is, for example, the inverse
languages, when you have a transitive verb

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.760
construction, it's a different
construction from an intransitive verb.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.370
So those speakers learn to pay attention
to the transitivity of the verb in every

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:09.760
clause because that was required by the
grammar. So it made sense to them based on

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.100
their first languages to have a different
construction for a transitive versus an

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:20.470
intransitive verb. In addition, there were
rules for words and the sound systems

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:25.510
within the language that the Australian
verbs didn't suit very well and the new

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.400
analysis suited them better.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.920
So for example, words in Australian
languages often, at least two syllables

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.360
long, if you have a short verb, adding the
transitive marker, made it longer and

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:42.200
conformed more to the rules of the first
languages. Similarly, words in Australian

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:47.310
languages in that area didn't usually end
with a cluster of consonants at the end of

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:52.610
the word. So again, adding that marker
made the word shape conform more to the

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:58.820
type of word that speakers of those
languages were used to. The in structure

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.477
is a good example of some
characteristics of a pidgin.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.650
The word forms come mostly from the
language spoken by the socially-dominant

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:14.040
group, which we call the lexophile
language but a lot of the structure and

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.950
word meanings come from the other multiple
languages that were being spoken by the

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:26.200
creators. In addition, reanalysis take
place such as what we've just seen through

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:32.270
pattern finding processes and second
language learning processes. A pidgin is a

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:38.300
means of intergroup communication, you use
it to speak to people whose language you

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:44.290
don't know, and all of those speakers were
still using their own first languages when

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.634
I spoke to people within the same group.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.920
The pidgins spread throughout Australia as
English speakers spread throughout

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:59.760
Australia. And in each place, there were
Australian languages and those speakers

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:06.900
were contributing features to the new
system. Indigenous people were brought

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.560
together in groups and needed to interact
with speakers of many other languages with

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:17.050
whom traditionally, they wouldn't have
interacted much or at all. So they all

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:21.607
needed a way to speak to each other.
And this system was a good

00:27:21.607 --> 00:27:24.142
system to build on in order to do that.

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:29.940
As speakers needed to talk about more and
more topics with each other, more and more

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:36.310
elements were added from English and also
from the Australian languages. Varieties

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:42.985
of Northern territory Creole were derived
from interactions of this kind.

00:27:42.985 --> 00:27:44.839
Here's an example,

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:52.159
[foreign language]

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:56.960
And you can see there the transitive
marker on the verb which came in via

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.058
pidgin. There's another interesting
element there which is been,

00:28:01.058 --> 00:28:05.026
meaning past tense. Again, the form is
from English, have been

00:28:05.026 --> 00:28:10.490
had been but there's another
reanalysis there named simple past tense,

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:17.710
it's not part of the have been or had been
construction. Research suggest that

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.790
there's more than one developmental path
for Creole language, but this is one

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:27.160
tested path. Again, the word forms come
mostly from the socially-dominant

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:31.740
language, English but much of the
structure in the word meanings come from

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.690
the other input languages. In this case,
there was an earlier pidgin that fed into

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:42.680
the Creole. Reanalysis took place through
pattern finding and second language

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:48.080
learning processes and the system expanded
and developed.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:54.910
There was a prior pidgin that was used for
intergroup communication. A creole is the

00:28:55.090 --> 00:29:00.930
first language of its speakers and is a
full language. This variety of creole

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:05.270
continued to develop and stabilize,
probably often until about the 1940s and

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:11.890
1950s and it currently has several
varieties. We'll turn now to another kind

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:16.890
of context language in another setting in
Australia. This is in a small ball pre-

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:22.780
community in the Northern territory. In
this community, speakers over about the

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.840
age of 35, mostly speak Warlpiri, their
traditional language but they also code

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.490
switch into a varieties of English
and Creole.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:37.640
Code-switching is switching between
languages in a single conversation. And by

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.620
aboriginal English there, I mean English
with elements of the indigenous languages

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:49.520
and elements of Creole in it. Younger
speakers, younger adults and children,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:55.100
speak in a new way which systematically
combines elements from those sources which

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.670
we call light Warlpiri. Children learn to
speak this language from when they first

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:04.370
begin to talk. As they grow older
they also produce

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:12.020
Warlpiri and then code switch into the
English-based varieties. The children now

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:17.130
learn light Warlpiri and Warlpiri from
there. We'll look at a little background

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.967
structure of the contributing languages
before we look at the

00:30:20.967 --> 00:30:22.585
structure of light Warlpiri.

00:30:22.585 --> 00:30:37.917
[foreign language]

00:30:38.434 --> 00:30:42.577
- As you can see there, Warlpiri is a
suffixing language. A lot of the

00:30:42.577 --> 00:30:48.556
grammatical functions are indicated
through suffixes on words. We can also see

00:30:48.556 --> 00:30:52.792
here the difference between the transitive
and intransitive construction that I

00:30:52.792 --> 00:30:56.976
mentioned earlier that the pidgin creators
paid attention to.

00:30:57.766 --> 00:31:02.906
The word therefore, child, she's doing the
chasing and the monster who's doing the

00:31:02.906 --> 00:31:08.010
taking, have a suffix on them that doesn't
occur on nouns when there's an

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:13.747
intransitive verb like walk. So it's in
that way that these constructions are

00:31:13.747 --> 00:31:19.250
quite different. And in contrast,
varieties of English and Creole indicate

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:23.889
grammatical functions, mostly through
separate words and with fairly fixed word

00:31:23.889 --> 00:31:30.713
order. So how do these languages combine
in this new system like Warlpiri?

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:46.868
[foreign language]

00:31:46.868 --> 00:31:53.312
- You might notice that there are English
verbs that come and go. Much of the verb

00:31:53.312 --> 00:31:58.336
system of light Warlpiri is from
aboriginal English and Creole verb

00:31:58.336 --> 00:32:02.870
structure, but not entirely. If you look
at example three, there's

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:09.280
actually a Warlpiri verb stem but it has
the Creole transitive marker on it. So the

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:16.410
overall structure is derived from those
languages. You can say that the Warlpiri's

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:24.440
suffixing. So we have the verbal structure
mostly from aboriginal English and Creole

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:30.930
but we have all of the noun structure
retained from Warlpiri. But in the verbal

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.888
structure, there were also innovations
which are indicated in green

00:32:34.888 --> 00:32:41.779
The wim and the yum and they're what we're
most interested in today. This pattern of

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:46.500
verbal structure from one source and noun
structure from another source is fairly

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.701
unusual in the world's languages.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:55.010
The differences between Warlpiri and light
Warlpiri are in the verb and auxiliary

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:59.740
structure which have these clearly
different forms that the underlying

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:07.410
abstract structure is more complicated. So
the wim and yum, constructions which are

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:13.980
the innovations are part of an overall
system, much of which already existed in

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:19.370
Creole and aboriginal English. You can see
there that for each word, there's a

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:25.720
pronoun element like we, you, a, which is
from I and then there's another element,

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.350
which mostly means time.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.010
So where did this wim and yum construction
come from? We know that it's not something

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:41.420
that comes from English. Well, it seems
that the mm came from English, I'm, like

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:48.190
the form but there's also an mm in the
aboriginal English and Creole pronouns in

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:55.620
and them. Through this process of creating
this structure, they will reanalyze, so

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:02.910
that, instead of being a pronoun on 'em or
them, there were a new structure where

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.093
they would divide it into two parts.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:14.360
Aboriginal English and Creole has this
past mark have been and that really occurs

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.080
in light Warlpiri. So instead of using
that, what has happened, is that the

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:27.730
speakers have taken the past meaning from
been and overlaid it on the mm element

00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:34.520
from aboriginal English and Creole, such
that they have this new structure where

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:40.600
the mm is a separate morpheme with it's
own meaning that means present or past or

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:46.090
non future and then that is regularized
across the system, and you have a new

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.876
paradigm. Another example.

00:34:51.353 --> 00:34:55.694
[foreign language]

00:34:55.694 --> 00:35:00.944
- That was some kids playing a card game
for me and using that structure there.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:07.400
So what are the influences on the new
structure? Again, we see that the words

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:12.810
shape or form comes from the varieties of
English or Creole but the structure and

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:20.290
the meaning comes from multiple sources.
In Warlpiri, the auxiliary has a structure

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:24.897
where there's a time element, which is the
kah meaning present

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.160
and a pronoun element. And
you can say that all through the system

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.390
these are affixes, they're not separate
words.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:37.560
So I think that this underlying structure
of wanting a time element and pronoun

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:45.550
element affixed together with part of the
influence that fade into the new system.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:50.920
In Warlpiri, the verb and the auxiliary
forms combine in different kinds of

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:57.280
constructions to give the same kinds of
semantic readings as we find in light

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:03.533
Warlpiri. So in the final column, those
three meanings of non-future, future,

00:36:03.533 --> 00:36:09.357
and disiterative are exactly the
categories that we find in light Warlpiri.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:14.450
But they're not structural categories in
Warlpiri, they're semantic categories. And

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:20.760
again, have been overlaid onto the forms
in light Warlpiri. So how did the whole

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:27.260
language come to be? They were through a
two-step process when the adult groups who

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:34.760
are now about 35 years old were children,
I think that other adults spoke to them in

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:41.290
what is known as a baby talk register and
in that register, they code-switched a lot

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:45.450
and they code-switched in a particular
pattern. So it would be something like

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.870
this, where there will be a Warlpiri
sentence but they would insert a Creole

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.516
pronoun and verb into that sentence.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:37:00.600
And that is the pattern that the children
then conventionalized by analyzing it as a

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:06.250
single system. At the same time, they
added the innovations that we've just been

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:11.910
talking about. That group of children, who
I think do this maybe when they were

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:17.100
three, four or five, certainly before they
were teenagers, they then grew up, had

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.960
children of their own, and so now those
children learn that language as one of

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:29.280
their first languages along with Warlpiri
and that's their primary language.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.835
The path to this language is a
little different.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:37.040
It wasn't created for intergroup
communication. It was created within one

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:41.620
group of people in one community and it's
only spoken within that group of people in

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:46.200
that community. The speakers were
multilingual, there was a lot of

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:52.210
code-switching, it was directed to very
young children in a particular pattern.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:56.300
They then conventionalized it and
re-analyzed some of the input that they

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:02.900
were hearing and then regularized their
analysis to create new paradigms.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:08.260
From English and Creole, we get words and
a lot of verb structure. From Warlpiri we

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:15.740
get words, the noun structure and also
abstract verbal structure. And this new

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:23.080
system is the first language of the
current generations. So, what we've been

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:28.350
able to see, almost in real times, is a
new language developed and an innovative

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:34.980
structure in that language, through a
two-step process. Adults had their fairly

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:39.280
systematic code-switching in the speech
that they were directing to children and

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:44.060
then the children had a very creative role
in conventionalizing their input and

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.914
adding the innovations.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:51.650
The overall structure is unusual because
it combines the noun structure from one

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.900
type of language with the verb structure
for another. And there are these

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:02.390
innovations which are interesting in that,
we can see exactly where they've come

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:06.690
from, we can see exactly where the
re-analysis would have taken place and we

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:11.291
can see that at the end of that
reanalysis, there is a new construction.

00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:13.970
Thank you.

00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:32.110
- If you go to Nicaragua today, you can
see these deaf children hanging out in

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:37.490
their school playground using a rich
natural sign language to communicate. And

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:43.070
40 years ago, this language didn't exist,
40 years ago, deaf children in Nicaragua,

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:48.360
children just like these kids, didn't have
the ability to communicate effortlessly

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:54.700
with one another like they do. So, how did
this language get into the hands of these

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.285
children? If we think about that, we
really have to think about

00:39:59.285 --> 00:40:00.922
where does any
language come from?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.620
Language is really central to human
nature, it's universal. Not every

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:12.990
community has writing or numbers or even
real but every community, ever human

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:19.070
community has language. Language is not
something we've discovered out there in

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:24.360
the world, language has come, they're a
product from us, humans connecting and

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:30.680
interacting in a social network generation
after generation. So, to see where this

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.810
language came from, I'm going to take you
on a little journey and retrace the path

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.398
of Nicaraguan sign language
up to the present day.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:45.060
When these children arrived at school five
years ago, there were already about 1200

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:50.510
deaf native users of Nicaraguan sign
language and there were hundreds of kids

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:56.480
older than them using this language around
them in their school. These children

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:03.230
learned it from interacting with them.
Now, if we want to know what those

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:10.810
hundreds of kids who were older than that
current day generation of children, what

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:15.730
they looked like, we can look at the kids
who were teenagers at the time when they

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:24.940
entered. So, this first group here entered
the school in the mid 1990s and at that

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:30.810
time, there were about 800 signers of
Nicaraguan sign language and 200 of them

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.261
were at the school at any time.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:40.820
You can see that it's fast, it's fluent,
they can talk about the non here and now.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.560
This is a natural human language that's
used for what human languages are used

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:50.530
for. And if we want to know where they got
their language from we can retrace the

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:56.860
steps of the language further back when
these kids were four and five years old

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:02.220
and ask who were the teenagers then when
they arrived at school?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:10.440
So we can look at the people who were 10
years older than them, when these guys,

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:24.547
these are the cohort that arrived in the
1980s. So when they arrived, there were

00:42:24.547 --> 00:42:30.434
about 400 signers of Nicaraguan sign
language, again, 200 at the school. If you

00:42:30.434 --> 00:42:33.881
have an eye for it, you may be able to see
how, as we're going further and further

00:42:33.881 --> 00:42:39.156
back, the language is a little bit more
deliberate, the feedback is a little more

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:44.214
explicit and the signs are bigger and
more symmetrical than more two-handed

00:42:44.214 --> 00:42:48.510
signs and lots of differences like that. A
lot of the work that I do is to try and

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.974
quantify what those differences are.

00:42:51.881 --> 00:43:01.035
If you wanted to know who they got their
language from, to continue this retracing

00:43:01.035 --> 00:43:08.435
of the steps, when they arrived at the
school, the older people were these people

00:43:08.435 --> 00:43:19.370
who are 45 to 50 years old today and when
these people were four and five years old

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:25.278
in the 1970s and they first came to the
school, there were no signers of

00:43:25.278 --> 00:43:31.973
Nicaraguan sign language and this is where
we reach the end of our retracing. Nobody

00:43:31.973 --> 00:43:37.731
taught these people to sign. The
teachers at the school used Spanish, which

00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:42.789
they couldn't hear and so this is where
Enocell begins with this cohort of 50

00:43:42.789 --> 00:43:46.862
pioneers. They took the gestures and
actions that they observed as raw

00:43:46.862 --> 00:43:49.618
materials and wove them into
a new language.

00:43:50.342 --> 00:43:55.589
So we have this incredible opportunity to
see how languages are born and evolve and

00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:59.863
the role that language learners play in
that evolution and I'm going to start with

00:43:59.863 --> 00:44:04.625
the language of this earliest first cohort
of signers and walk forward to the present

00:44:04.625 --> 00:44:07.319
day. And start with the most
fundamental pieces

00:44:07.319 --> 00:44:12.110
of the grammar that every language has,
the structure of the simple statement. So

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:16.910
arguments and predicates, how do you show
who's doing what to whom? So in English

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:22.380
for example, we use word order to do this.
So if you take a sentence like "A man taps

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:27.100
a woman," and you change the order of the
words "A woman taps a man," you change

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:32.380
who is doing the tapping and who gets
tapped. Now, other languages might stick

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.920
inflectional endings on the end of the
verbs or even on the nouns to show which

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.350
person is the tapper and which the tappee
is. And to figure this out, my colleagues

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:47.590
and I use non-verb materials to illicit
sentences that can compare these different

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:51.148
aspects of the sentence. So, I'll show you
how different signers

00:44:51.148 --> 00:44:53.099
respond to stimuli like these.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:45:01.310
So an event like this giving event or
this tapping event and here is what the

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:05.330
first cohort sentence looks like. They
have a very strict noun, verb, noun, verb

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:12.110
word order. So, to say that a woman taps a
man, you have woman, tap and man tapped.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:16.520
And here's what this looks like when a
first cohort signer signs it. So I want

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:21.610
you to see how he produces that noun,
verb, noun, verb order for signing who

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:28.730
tapped, the sign for woman, which is
produced like this and

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:32.487
who is tapped, his sign for man.

00:45:32.487 --> 00:45:37.370
So, he's going to sign these nouns, man
and woman and in the neutral area in front

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:41.470
of his chest, and note that there is this
movement in the verbs away from and toward

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:45.920
the body the way they can reflect
iconically, the way that movement happens

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.820
in the world but they are centered in the
signer's body. He keeps his body centered

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:59.440
and neutral. And so, here is what it looks
like "woman, tap, man get tapped." So,

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.850
this all very nice and clear and orderly.
But the interesting thing that it wasn't

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:09.110
reproduced this way in the next second
cohorts. So, starting in about 1983 or

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:14.710
'84, the second wave of kids who were
coming in took this direction in which

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:20.060
signs are produced and started giving that
a job in the grammar. And what they did

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.750
was they started modifying where they
produced their signs as a way of showing

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:30.620
who did what to whom. So in this example
in the first panel, we have the words see

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.500
and pay produced in this neutral area in
front of the chest and in the second panel

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:40.160
you can see that the signs have been
modified so the direction is to the left.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:44.980
So, if these signs were together in one
sentence, produced by a second cohort

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:51.160
signer, it would mean that the same person
was both see and paid. So, these

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:55.910
inflections started out with the verbs
like this but soon after, in the mid 80s,

00:46:56.090 --> 00:47:01.960
you can also start producing nouns in
particular locations to link them to verbs

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:06.440
and more recently, you can even use it
just to point to one location or another

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:11.160
to refer to the person associated with
that location. So, now you're using these

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:15.300
locations in space, not to talk about
where something happened but to show who's

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:20.520
involved. So we'll see, here is an example
that a second cohort signer does and you

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.910
can see how these developments
really changed the

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:24.474
basic structure of the sentence.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:32.650
So, here is the woman giving to the man
event and you'll see you get the nouns now

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:37.250
being produced in particular locations
that correspond with the direction of

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:42.790
movement and the verbs to show you what
the object or recipient is. And notice

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:47.280
that with the addition of the special
modification on the signs, we find there

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:52.100
came in changes of the word, so now, the
verbs move to the end of the sentence. So

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.190
you are going to see, first she talks
about, you remember those three people in

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:59.550
that scene? So, she starts talking about
the woman on the right, just looking

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:02.339
straight ahead, then she
touches her chest.

00:48:02.339 --> 00:48:07.280
That's a switch reference device and then
you'll see she does woman, man, your nouns

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:16.550
and then gives, receive your verbs. Woman
look and then self, woman, man, give

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:23.080
receive. And now, if we move to the third
cohort, we're going to see the

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.074
introduction of the space you all use with
points linking the verbs

00:48:27.074 --> 00:48:28.862
with the doer and the done to.

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:33.950
So this an event where a woman pushes
another woman, a woman in a black shirt

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:40.380
and a woman in a green shirt. So he's
going to index the black shirt to his left

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.740
and the woman in green to the right. And
then come the verbs, remember, they're at

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:49.370
the end, push, be pushed and finally,
you'll see this verb respect at the end.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:53.940
And what I love about this example, the
respect sign here, is that even though

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.370
respect isn't something that moves from
one person to another and nor is telling,

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:01.670
here we're going to see the space and the
movement of the verb linking it to the

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:07.030
nouns. So you can say green tells black
that black should show green some respect

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:11.560
and you do that all with one
word using the space.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:22.450
So black, green, push, be pushed, respect,
see. Okay. So, we can measure this

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:28.230
restructuring in many ways and here's one.
If you plot how frequently points are used

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:32.530
in that way that shows who, rather than
where, you get this pattern. So, starting

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:36.400
on the left with home signers who are deaf
people who are never exposed to a sign

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:42.090
language and then the first, second and
third cohorts you can see that they all

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:46.940
use points to where about the same amount
that something stay pretty stable. But

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:51.950
this nominal use, this use that shows who,
that's linking the noun with the verbs,

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:57.600
this has really increased with the second
and third cohorts of signers, so, the

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:01.930
questions of, why this change?
And if children are so good at learning

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:06.460
language and someone has already developed
a perfectly good way to mark subjects and

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.970
objects, why didn't the second cohort just
learn to sign it the same way the first

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:17.830
cohort had been doing it. I mean, it's one
thing to gradually to drop whom from your

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:21.910
English but this is a total restructuring
of the language here. To answer that

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:27.966
question, I think we really need to take
seriously, this idea of

00:50:27.966 --> 00:50:30.326
language as an organism.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:37.140
Language is an organism, so, this isn't
just a metaphor for when we say, a

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:42.750
language is an abstract thing. It's
abstract but it's still real, it's a

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:48.530
bundle of structured material and it's
self-replicating and we each live in a

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:53.340
symbiotic relationship with our language,
like the microbes in our gut. We can't

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:58.040
survive without it and it can't survive
without us. And language changes and

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:04.880
adapts to the humans that host it. So, the
social network of people that learn it and

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:09.580
pass it on are the environment in which
language evolves.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:13.710
Now, the different versions of Nicaraguan
sign language that we see signed by

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:19.000
different age cohorts today represent this
living record of the evolutionary path of

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:24.620
the language. And so, the way that I have
been doing my work, the way I have

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:30.130
described is, I look at this slice today.
If you start with the 1970s with this

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:34.760
figure over to the left and then you have
the first cohort coming in and in the 80s,

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:41.700
the second cohort joins them and then the
third and fourth, we can look at today at

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.217
the difference between the cohorts.

00:51:44.217 --> 00:51:50.650
But we can't forget that the action, the
moment of change, is over there. It's as

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:55.030
we add each new wave and that's where the
language and that's when the language

00:51:55.210 --> 00:52:01.170
reproduces. So the first cohort builds the
language as children in the 70's and then

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:07.290
they pass it on to this next cohort in the
80s and that second cohort acquires it

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:10.654
with some fidelity but they
don't copy it exactly.

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:16.380
And so, on in the 90s and today, and we
know these changes occurred when they're

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:21.080
children because the path is
unidirectional. So, stuff can get passed

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.600
on to later cohorts but not the other way.
It doesn't go back. So, things that adult

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:31.220
initiate or learn, they would be the same
for everyone. And there are things like

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:37.390
that that you see that are the same across
all of the cohorts. But these core aspects

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:40.580
of the grammar how the sentence is
structured, how you do agreement, how you

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.010
show who is doing what to whom. Those
kinds of things, they're changing in just

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:49.019
that one direction and they don't get
passed on back up.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.790
So this chain from one to two then is
where that, where it got reinterpreted as

00:52:55.970 --> 00:53:01.440
who. So to take our question about why
change it, we have to really think about

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:06.660
how languages replicate, what's the
mechanism that copies that code, the rules

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:11.720
and patterns of Nicaraguan sign language
and passes it on to the next iteration of

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:19.860
inner self because just because the
organism that say, 1980s NSL developed

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:26.810
some cool characteristic, doesn't mean you
get to pass it on for free. If we don't

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:30.950
have a really good understanding of the
mechanism of reproduction, what we'll

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:35.890
start to see parallels between development
and evolution that don't actually explain

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:37.589
the nature of the change.

00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:42.990
So, most of us are more familiar with
Lamarc's second law here, this idea that

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:48.260
adaptations made by an organism in
response to its environment get inherited

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.950
by its offspring. So the sons of the
blacksmith must have bigger biceps or the

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:57.510
daughter of the giraffe gets a slightly
longer neck than her mother started with

00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:04.630
but Lemarc also had this first law that,
as much as we developed from simple cells

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:11.320
to complex systems that all organisms have
a natural drive to complexify.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.040
And these are great ideas but they don't
worked out. They don't work out because

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:19.120
now, we know that reproduction doesn't
work that way. You don't just pass down

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:26.240
the useful stuff or the more complex stuff
or the exercised parts. And what we've

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:30.380
learned from Darwin and since Darwin is
that we have to pay attention to

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:35.770
reproduction and selection processes.
Organisms send along everything, they send

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:40.750
down everything, not just the useful stuff
but they do it with variability and noise.

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:44.710
So the environment is what's determining
what will survive.

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:50.210
So now, we really have two evolutionary
processes on really, really different time

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:55.680
scales. We've got human reproduction and
selection on one hand and language

00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.520
reproduction and selection on the other.
It's not that one recapitulates the other,

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:04.920
it's each of them is evolving and is
shaped by the processes of reproduction

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:10.470
and selection. In human reproduction, we
pass on what are the patterns we can learn

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:15.880
and it may be very slowly and very long
ago that more effective and more powerful

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.671
pattern-learning devices would prevail.

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:24.910
But we all came into the world with brains
that are a product of that process. On the

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:29.830
other hand, when language is reproduced,
they send out all these accumulated

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:34.430
symbols and patterns of combinations but
it's a blurry and limited signal

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:39.850
and it's just the output of someone's own
language and it isn't copied perfectly. In

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:44.410
the process of selection, it's not the
useful stuff but the learnable parts of

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:52.570
the language that survive. So what we've
got then, is this co-evolution of humans

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:57.680
and their languages. Each of them is
serving as the environment for the other

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:05.900
and each cannot survive without the other.
The thing is though, that we don't set out

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:11.030
to create languages, to grow languages,
this isn't done with an intention to make

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:17.070
a code. Humans grow languages because our
social connection is so critical. When we

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:22.780
pass a language from one generation to the
next, the goal isn't to create something

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.886
or to organize your message.

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:31.460
The goal is to connect and the drive is a
social one. The idea is to get your

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:35.450
message into someone else's mind and to
understand what message someone else is

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:39.980
sending to your mind. And in that process
of communicating back and forth and

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:44.940
actually forth and forth, that's how we
use the fabric of language with the

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:49.679
machinery of our minds.
So, thank you very much.
