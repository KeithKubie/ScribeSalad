Okay Dr. Tyson, in your opinion, who would be the most

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.800
scientifically accurate and believable

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.689
superhero with superhuman abilities in
relation to real-world physics and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:30.330
counterpoint the most unbelievable and
inaccurate and why. So he is coming

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.690
to us from Brisbane Australia oh cool.
Neil: So I think the most reachable superhero

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.120
that's out there is Batman because he
uses real devices on his utility belt

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.379
and there's nothing there you just
say "oh that can't happen" or "you couldn't

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.550
have done that" or you know. Yeah he's got
some special materials but that's

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.010
okay because his company makes
Chuck: He's a millionaire.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.489
Neil: Yeah, he's a billionaire.
Chuck: And his company is working for the government at

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.000
developing experimental technology.
Neil: And he's got stuff that you don't have.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.920
So for me he's the most
realistic superhero, and Robin as well.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.500
He's just an acrobat in tights, okay.
Chuck: at least that's their cover.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.560
Mmhm, oh you know we know the deal. Hangin' around with that young boy all the time

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.420
Putting him in underwear, living at your house, your big

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.220
billionaire mansion. We know the deal! Oh yes, that's my young ward.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.090
Oh is that what you call him? No,
your young ward. Oh, okay.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.659
Okay, child services won't be calm
because you're a billionaire and you

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.590
have a young ward okay? Let me do that, I
am up on charges.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.340
Neil: I swear I've never thought about it that
way, nor did I ever think that Bert and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.030
Ernie were a gay couple, you know. You know there's a whole... or the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.560
Tinky-Winky was the gay one out of the...
you know. There's a whole

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.220
literature on... Chuck: but right exactly, who and what might be gay.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.239
Neil: Who and what might mean.
So I forgot what I was talking about.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.440
Chuck: So you were saying that he is the most realistic, Batman.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.030
Neil: He's more real than Iron Man because the
energy source that Iron Man is drawing

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.920
from... to concentrate that much energy in
one place, you would basically vaporize

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.220
everything it was touching.
Chuck: And the other thing too is when you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.420
think about Tony Stark having this power
source inside his chest, okay let's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.880
be honest. Let's just hook him up to a
city and forget it because that's

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.540
amazing. Why is this guy flying
around in a suit instead of powering New York

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.480
for free, but go ahead.
Neil: Right, so you can't concentrate energy.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.690
Anything that you've ever used that has
a lot of energy going on with it gets

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.720
very hot very quickly.
That's what energy does. If you fire a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.280
gun enough times the gun gets warm and
can even get too hot to touch,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.890
and cannons in the old days. In fact they

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.760
used cannons firing cannonballs and the
fact that the cannon kept getting hotter

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.560
and hotter to discover and come to an
understanding of how heat worked.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.940
Physicists would say "while you're
fighting this war, can we..."

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.680
Chuck: Can we come in here and measure measure? Neil: Right, measure.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.020
And they thought there was a substance called

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.760
caloric, which was a fluid that would be
heat. And if you put caloric from one thing

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.360
to the other then that thing would be at
a higher temperature, and so there was

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.740
there were early ideas were we were
intellectually sort of machinating how

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.980
this would work. So Tony Stark, well I
think he could wipe the floor with

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.600
Batman. If I had to be one of those
I definitely be Tony Stark.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.310
Chuck: Yeah, because you're both billionaires, so hey why not, right?

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.780
Neil: Well no they're both billionaires.
Chuck: That's what I'm saying. Right yeah the both yeah.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.430
Neil: Pick one. Chuck: Pick the billionaire you want to be.
Neil: Right, right. And so definitely but it's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:58.280
the concentration of energy,
it's not real.
