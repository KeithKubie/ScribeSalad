00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.330
Solar panels have amazing promise, but serious
limitations.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.590
They’re expensive to produce, and it’s
in the name--you need sun to power them.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.219
What if there were a way to make solar panels
cheaper AND functional even in places with

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.530
limited sun?

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.510
And what if I told you the key to this is...bacteria?

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.050
I know!

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.130
Color me surprised--and also green, twice,
because this whole discovery makes use of

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.380
photosynthesis AND E.coli.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.380
Ew.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.800
But first, let’s talk about how solar energy
traditionally works.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.320
A solar panel is made up of subunits, called
photovoltaic (or PV) cells.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.430
For a PV cell to work, it has to generate
an electric current, so each end of the cell

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.070
is made up either negatively or positively
charged material, usually silicon mixed with

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.210
either phosphorus or boron
This creates a pre-existing electric field,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.880
and when this field gets exposed to photons--aka
sunlight--it knocks some electrons loose from

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.880
the silicon.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.880
We talked about this in a video here, silicon
is a semiconductor that’s used in all kinds

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.880
of electronic applications.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.780
Other components of the solar cell then organize
those free-floating electrons into an electric

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.640
current that can either be stored or used.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.470
But now, new work from a team at the University
of British Columbia came at this system from

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.120
a totally different angle: solar cells powered
by E. coli!

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.470
They’ve genetically engineered bacteria
to produce large amounts of a pigment called

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.560
lycopene.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.280
This is a light-harvesting dye that gives
tomatoes their red-orange color, and is ‘photoactive’--

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.370
meaning that, in its native state inside a
plant, it’s extremely effective at converting

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.390
light into energy.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.400
In this case, the lycopene is what’s being
excited by light to release an electron, instead

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.659
of a synthetic material like silicon.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.070
But the bacteria aren’t a semiconducting
material.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.700
For the energy the E. coli have absorbed to
be transferable, the team coated the bacteria

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.240
in titanium dioxide nanoparticles, or TiO2.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.000
Ta-da, these light-absorbing, mineral-coated
bacterial cells are now semiconducting.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.281
They’re then attached to a glass surface
doped with oppositely-charged materials, and

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:03.760
between the lycopene, nanoparticles, and doped
glass, you’ve got yourself an electric current

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.990
induced by light!

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.580
This is a huge leap in bio-hybrid PV technology.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.450
Other technologies have used light-harvesting
bio-based dyes in solar cells, but extracted

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.540
the dye from the bacteria, which is expensive
and difficult.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.749
This new method is cheaper and easier because
it keeps the pigment inside the bacterial

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:25.670
cells, and it uses a new technique to coat
the bacteria in the nanoparticles.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.040
Not only that, but this new experiment also
yielded almost twice the electric output of

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.599
previous bio-based PV experiments.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.239
This gives a whole new meaning to the term
green energy, and if you need me, I’ll be

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.829
cackling to myself about it for the next 15
years.

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.819
Ok let’s address this: I thought E. coli
causes disease, right?

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.060
It’s actually a super common bacteria we
use in research all the time.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.049
There are many strains, most of which can
be found in the intestines of humans and other

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.920
animals, and only some of them or dangerous--most
are really useful and we couldn’t live without

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.489
them in our systems!

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.870
We use E. coli in the lab because it’s easy
and inexpensive to grow, and we can hack its

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.450
genome to get it to produce the protein--or
in this case, pigment--that we want.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.940
These new bacteria-powered, or ‘biogenic’
solar cells are looking promising, not only

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.329
because we’re making gains in how much electric
current they produce, but also because these

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.969
PV cells, unlike synthetic ones made out of
materials like silicon, can produce just as

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.499
much energy output in dim light as in bright
light, because the lycopene is so effective

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:26.530
at harvesting energy from the sun.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.499
Still, there are a few details that need to
be straightened out before these ‘live’

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.050
solar cells are ready for market.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.999
For one, the bacteria die during this process,
so we’ve got to figure out a way to keep

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.620
the poor little guys alive, reproducing, and
producing lycopene through the lifetime of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.010
the solar cell so you don’t have to always
go in and replace the bacteria.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.370
Plus, this prototype currently produces about
25 times less power than a traditional solar

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.420
cell, so the design of the device needs to
be significantly improved before it’s a

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.480
feasible option.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.489
Regardless, this is an exciting way to reimagine
solar panels that work in areas that don’t

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.919
get a lot of sun.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.389
Plant power + bacteria power=my favorite combo
in the WHOLE world.

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.499

check out my previous video on how they may

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:12.030
be controlling your mind.
