00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.100
I now want to refigure out
what this mystery mass is,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.850
but we're going to start using a
little bit more of mathematics.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.240
And mathematics really
are just a language,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.270
symbols for representing ideas,
for representing relationships

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.379
between things.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.250
And so the first
thing I want you to do

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.810
is think about if you can
express a relationship

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.676
mathematically between
this side of the scale

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:24.800
and that side of the scale.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.010
And I'll give you some hints.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.010
We know that they
have equal mass.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.530
So maybe you can
set up some type

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.159
of relationship using an
equal sign, somehow showing

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.299
that this right over
here is equal to that.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:37.090
And I'll give you a
few seconds to do that.

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:41.300
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.140
What do we have on this side?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.010
Well, we have our mystery mass.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.510
And I'll represent
that mystery mass

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.759
by the question mark
right over here.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:51.300
But that's not the
only thing that we

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.520
have on the left-hand side.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.500
We also have these
other 3 kilograms.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.960
So let me write over here.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.020
We'll assume that we're
dealing with kilograms.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.700
So we have the mystery
mass in kilograms

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.800
plus 3 more kilograms.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.469
That's what we have here
on the left-hand side.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.510
Now, what do we have here
on the right-hand side?

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.280
Well, we just have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 kilograms.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.770
So we just have 10.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.770
We just have 10 on
the right-hand side.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.410
And what else do we know?

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.500
Well, we know that this scale
is balanced, that the mass here

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.850
is equal to the mass here.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.990
Because the scale is balanced
the way it's been drawn,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.730
we know that these
two things are equal.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.160
So we have just
set up an equation.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.520
We're using question
mark as our unknown.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.950
We don't know what
this mystery mass is.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.680
If we add 3 kilograms
to it, then we

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.800
see that it has the exact
same mass as 10 kilograms.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.900
Now my question to you is,
what can we do to this equation

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.560
so that we can essentially
solve for the unknown,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.875
so that we can figure
out what the unknown is?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.410
Well, we saw in the
last little problem

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.390
that we had that if we wanted
to figure out this mystery mass,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.290
we had to remove 3
kilograms from both sides.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.677
If we just removed 3
kilograms from one side,

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:15.510
then the scale wouldn't
be balanced anymore.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.400
And we really wouldn't be able
to say that the mystery mass is

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.764
equal to the thing on the right.

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:20.430
In order to say they're
equal, the stuff

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.300
has to actually be balanced.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.580
So in the last video,
we removed 3 of these.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.260
We removed 3 kilograms
from both sides

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.880
in order to keep
the scale balanced.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.020
So mathematically, we'll do
the exact same thing over here.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.730
We will remove 3,
not from one side.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.840
If we remove 3 from
one side, then it

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.610
wouldn't be equal anymore.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.580
We need to remove
3 from both sides.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.560
So we need to remove 3.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.450
We need to subtract 3 from
both sides of this equation

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.830
in order to keep
the scale balanced.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.940
So on the left-hand side,
what are we left with?

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.460
Well, just like over here, we're
left with just the question

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.960
mark.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.690
3 minus 3 is 0.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.580
So on the left-hand side, we're
left with just the question

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.310
mark.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.930
And on the right-hand side,
we're left with 10 minus 3,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.850
which is 7.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.310
And we get the
exact same result.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.360
Question mark is equal to 7.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.860
And if we're dealing
with kilograms,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.320
then this is 7 kilograms.
