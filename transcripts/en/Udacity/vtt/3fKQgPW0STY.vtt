00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the question is how do we find the time.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Actually, sorry that's not the question. Finding the time is easy--we'll just look at the sun.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The real question is how I can keep the time from my local harbor when I go to sail at sea.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What I need is periodicity. I need something that happens at regular intervals.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For example, we're all familiar with the ticking of a clock and that seems like an obvious solution

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but clocks are difficult to make--what else could we use that has a regular periodic nature to it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
One attempted solution to this problem of finding something periodic that we could use

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
as a timekeeper came from our good friend Galileo--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
standing as he always does next to the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now Galileo had invented some incredible telescopes and with these telescopes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
he was able to observe the ring around the planet Saturn, mountains on the moon,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
dark spots on the sun and the planet Jupiter and its four moons,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
each of which orbited around in a predictable fashion.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now of the four discoveries Galileo made with his telescope, which do you think

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
could somehow be used for keeping time at sea.
