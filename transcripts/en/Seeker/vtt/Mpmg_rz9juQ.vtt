00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.410
It may seem silly to even ask the question,
but can plants think?

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.230
Some scientists suggest they do!

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.009
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.749
I know you’re thinking this sounds like
a secret plot to turn you against vegetarians,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:20.320
but plants have the ability to remember and
process information, and even do things like

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.830
count and communicate.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.800
A recent study published in the journal Current
Biology found that venus fly traps track and

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.789
remember the number of times an insect touches
the plant’s trigger hairs, or hairlike mechanosensors

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.590
in the fly trap’s mouth.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.110
When an insect lands on a venus fly trap and
doesn’t move, this single stimulation will

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.590
lead to pretty much nothing.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.170
But if the insect moves a second time within
the next 20 seconds, the venus flytrap will

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.170
shut.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.870
On the third movement sensed, the plant will
begin to ooze out digestive acids and the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.710
more the insect moves, the more acid it will
release.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.530
This is significant because it requires the
venus fly trap to hold onto information and

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.890
essentially remember the number of times it’s
received a specific stimulus and then respond

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.890
appropriately.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.300
If a second movement isn’t detected before
20 seconds, they venus fly trap will essentially

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.300
reset.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.000
This helps it differentiate between rain drops,
wind, and an actual meal.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.270
Now, that sounds like one smart plant.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.440
But it’s not alone.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.320
There are a lot of plants out there that can
do some pretty smart things.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.760
In fact, some may be communicating with each
other.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.130
You may have heard your mother tell you to
put that ripe apple by the green ones in order

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.130
to ripen them…

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.260
well, the reason this works is that when a
fruit like an apple starts to ripen it secretes

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.650
a natural plant hormone called ethylene and
other nearby fruits pick up on this and begin

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.420
to ripen as well.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.780
Acacia trees seem to communicate in a similar
way too.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.220
When antelope graze on them, acacia trees
also release this chemical and other non-affected

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.720
trees pick up on it.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.640
These alerted trees then produce tannins that
make the leaves poisonous to the antelope.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.680
Some plants can even detect these predators
before they bite.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.710
When researchers at the University of Missouri
played sounds of caterpillars munching leaves

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.970
to mustard plants, the mustard plants responded
by releasing mustard oil, which is deadly

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.220
to caterpillars.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.340
The plants did not respond this way to regular
old wind and other sounds, it was specifically

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.080
the sound of caterpillars eating leaves that
caused the mustard plant to defend itself.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.690
With somewhere between 15 and 20 different
senses to absorb and respond to other cues

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.030
from their environment, plants can start to
seem almost as smart as some lower animals

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.890
- this is what Darwin suggests.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.780
So plants can “hear” predators coming,
“smell” when they’re nearby, count the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.750
number of times their leaves are touched.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.040
And they even seem to get clues from their
neighbors about what’s going on to increase

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.890
their chances of surviving.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.430
All these responses and cell to cell communication
are what some scientists go as far as calling,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.920
“intelligent behavior.”

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.701
But how smart do plants seem to you?

00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:44.170
Have you ever kept one as a pet?

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.710

animals, check out Julia and Julian’s video

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.140
What do you think?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.140
Are plants intelligent?

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.520
Or do you absolutely need a brain to be smart?
