amazing professor at Stanford called

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690
amazing professor at Stanford called
 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.720
amazing professor at Stanford called
Robert Sapolsky who in his early 20s

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
Robert Sapolsky who in his early 20s
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.910
Robert Sapolsky who in his early 20s
went to live with a troop of baboons in

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
went to live with a troop of baboons in
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.380
went to live with a troop of baboons in
Kenya and it was his job to figure out

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390
Kenya and it was his job to figure out
 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.840
Kenya and it was his job to figure out
when our baboons most stressed out his

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
when our baboons most stressed out his
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.849
when our baboons most stressed out his
job was to hit them with little

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859
job was to hit them with little
 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.290

tranquilizer darts and then take a blood

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
tranquilizer darts and then take a blood
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.930

test and measure something called

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940
test and measure something called
 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.130
test and measure something called
cortisol which is a hormone that baboons

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
cortisol which is a hormone that baboons
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.509
cortisol which is a hormone that baboons
and us release when we're stressed and

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519
and us release when we're stressed and
 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.590
and us release when we're stressed and
baboons live in this hierarchy so the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
baboons live in this hierarchy so the
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.059
baboons live in this hierarchy so the
females don't interestingly but the men

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:47.069
females don't interestingly but the men
 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:48.619
females don't interestingly but the men
live in a very strict hierarchy so if

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
live in a very strict hierarchy so if
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569
live in a very strict hierarchy so if
there's 30 men number one knows he's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579
there's 30 men number one knows he's
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.099
there's 30 men number one knows he's
above number two number two knows is

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109
above number two number two knows is
 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.079
above number two number two knows is
above number three number 12 knows about

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089
above number three number 12 knows about
 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.910
above number three number 12 knows about
number 13 and that really determines a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
number 13 and that really determines a
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.869
number 13 and that really determines a
lot it determines who you get to have

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
lot it determines who you get to have
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.789
lot it determines who you get to have
sex with it determines what you get to

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799
sex with it determines what you get to
 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:00.379
sex with it determines what you get to
eat it determines whether you get to sit

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:00.389
eat it determines whether you get to sit
 

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:01.789
eat it determines whether you get to sit
in the shade or you're pushed out into

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799
in the shade or you're pushed out into
 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.709
in the shade or you're pushed out into
the heat yeah it's a really really

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
the heat yeah it's a really really
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.690
the heat yeah it's a really really
significant where you are in the in the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
significant where you are in the in the
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.510
significant where you are in the in the
hierarchy and what professor Sapolsky

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
hierarchy and what professor Sapolsky
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.990
hierarchy and what professor Sapolsky
found is baboons are most stressed in

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
found is baboons are most stressed in
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.170
found is baboons are most stressed in
two situations one is when their status

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
two situations one is when their status
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020
two situations one is when their status
is insecure so if you're the top guy and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
is insecure so if you're the top guy and
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.200
is insecure so if you're the top guy and
someone circling which comes for you you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
someone circling which comes for you you
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999
someone circling which comes for you you
will be massively stressed and the other

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
will be massively stressed and the other
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.289
will be massively stressed and the other
situation is when you feel you're at the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
situation is when you feel you're at the
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.510
situation is when you feel you're at the
bottom of a hierarchy you're you're

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
bottom of a hierarchy you're you're
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.459
bottom of a hierarchy you're you're
you're you know you've been kind of

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469
you're you know you've been kind of
 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.429
you're you know you've been kind of
humiliated and what what professor

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
humiliated and what what professor
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.580
humiliated and what what professor
Sapolsky found which i think is really

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590
Sapolsky found which i think is really
 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.630
Sapolsky found which i think is really
noticed and then it was later developed

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
noticed and then it was later developed
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.029
noticed and then it was later developed
by other scientists is when you feel

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039
by other scientists is when you feel
 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.429
by other scientists is when you feel
you've been pushed to the bottom what

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
you've been pushed to the bottom what
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.899
you've been pushed to the bottom what
you do is you show something called its

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
you do is you show something called its
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.020
you do is you show something called its
submission gesture so you baboon z' will

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
submission gesture so you baboon z' will
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.450
submission gesture so you baboon z' will
raise as I say you assume nobody's are

baboon will put its body down physically

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
baboon will put its body down physically
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.630
baboon will put its body down physically
it'll put its head down it will put its

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
