00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.040
Most conversations online about ideology seem
to be like a lame snowball fight, with people

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.970
lobbing tweets, insults, and MS Paint memes
at each other.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.269
And you’re probably wondering “there has
to be a better way!”

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.840
And neuroscience says, there just might be.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.140
Theme song time!

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.120
We're just going to do this next paragraph then.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.760
Let’s use the 1996 original motion picture,
Space Jam as an example.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.240
Now, if you don’t like Space Jam, well,
yeah, of course I’m gonna give you the hands,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.840
because that movie’s fire, and you suck for not believing
what I believe.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.320
If I want you to believe what I believe, I
have to find a better way than that to influence you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.110
and there have been studies done to find the
most effective way to persuade people.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.180
Have you gotten into a fight on Facebook,
brought up a source, and someone STILL refused

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.180
to change their mind?

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.570
Well, a 1979 study had participants with strong
opinions on the death penalty, both for and against,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.280
look at two articles; one backing
up their point of view, the other contradicting it.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.320
And the study found that participants only
agreed with the study that supported their

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.320
stance, further polarizing the groups.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.350
We call this a confirmation bias.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.370
Basically, we only want to believe facts that
help prove that we’re right.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.110
So, if you think Space Jam is trash, which
you absolutely shouldn’t, and I just throw articles

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.030
about the cultural impact, the amazing soundtrack,
and how hard it is to act on green screen

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.430
with people who aren’t Bugs Bunny, then
I probably won’t change your mind.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.320
But why are we like this?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.490
Some researchers think it’s because humans
have developed a reasoning mechanism, not

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.240
to get to the truth but just to convince people
that we’re right because being wrong feels

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.350
like a failure and everyone prefers that victory
of being right.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.130
But there might be a way to combat this.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.240
Mad people get emotionally invested in fights
on the internet, at Thanksgiving, on the internet

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.750
at Thanksgiving, and sometimes (most times)
it doesn’t work out.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.530
Emotion is a powerful tool to change another
person’s mind, but how?

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.490
A Princeton MRI study found that when a group
of people listen to a powerful political speech,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.869
their brains ticked together; there was a
synchronization effect.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.600
Which makes sense, everyone’s attention was on it.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.189
But what was synchronizing?

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.380
Their emotions.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.659
A 2004 study found further evidence when they
had subjects watch 30 minutes of a movie and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.600
their brains synced up at most emotional
beats in the movie.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.020
Humans respond to emotional stimuli, so using
emotions to drive a point home is important;

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.880
our brain’s structure, functions, and expression
are similar, so responsibly sharing my feelings

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.960
on Space Jam while Evanescence’s “My Immortal" 
(a banger) plays in the background, might work.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.380
Positive and constructive ways to persuade
people to your point of view are much easier,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.320
especially when you try to find common ground.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.459
All right, so if common ground and emotional appeal aren’t working, give up, right? I would.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.530
Not exactly.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.400
Say you really care about an issue, particularly
one with social relevance.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.080
Human instinct is to take to the streets and
hope people really care about your issue,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.540
and it’s frustrating when they don’t, right?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.120
Well, it’s all about framing.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.330
In Tali Sharot’s book, The Influential Mind, she uses the example of airline safety videos.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.200
If the video says, “y’all better chill
before this plane crashes!”

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.060
Well, that's dark and bleak and people wouldn't respond
well to that; that’s why preflight safety

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.830
videos are much more lit now, with breakdancers,
rappers, and whatever else will elicit a more

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.879
positive feeling while delivering the same
message.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.370
In a politically polarized time, it’s easy
to sit back on what we believe and not engage

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.020
with other points of view, but I just want
people to remember that our brains are very

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.379
similar to each others, and we all respond
to how information is packaged.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.250
Now, I’m not saying, engage with racists,
sexists, homophobes, Nickelback apologists,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.270
on the internet and don’t engage with
people who make you feel like you’re arguing

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.490
for your right to exist and your humanity.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.480
I’m just saying that while we’re hoping
for progress, we should think about how we

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.480
frame information.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.771
We have a degree of mental elasticity and
the brain has space for change

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.280
if we allow it to.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.200
Remember, we’re not going to win every argument;
sometimes rhyme and reason doesn’t sway someone,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.020
so it’s gucci if you’re like “yeah,
not today” and take care of yourself.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.060
Might I suggest curling up with some popcorn, maybe a chamomile tea and enjoy a delightful romp

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.440
starring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny perhaps?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.540
There's a lot of political noise out there and you might prefer a little bit of silence.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.660
So if you want to know what's better for your brain, noise or silence, check this video out right over here.
