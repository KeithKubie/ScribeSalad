00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.240
Good afternoon everybody! You're an
amazing crowd. Somebody walks up to the

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.960
microphone and it gets quiet. Like you
don't even have to ask, you know, "May I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.100
have your attention please?" So you're
already winners today. I'm very

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.789
excited that we are together this
afternoon because I believe it's

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.029
something really special that we're
doing now. We can save the judgement

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.099
until after this session today, but
events like this are so important

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.470
because they push us to think about who
we are as people, what we stand for as an

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.000
institution, how we must stay connected
to the world and how we can learn from

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.140
each other. And I think you're really
going to enjoy the panel today and we're

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.670
extremely fortunate to have Peter Hart
with us. He is quite famous - he wouldn't

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.800
know it because he wouldn't tell you - he
is a quite famous person, a pollster. He

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.129
works with NBC, The Wall Street Journal,
he has managed some of the most

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.750
difficult town halls. So the fact that
he was willing to work with us at Emory

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.320
to engage in what we're calling
"conversations with America" was quite

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.329
remarkable. I'd like to talk just for
a second about these conversations with

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.579
America. People have asked me, "So it
sounds really interesting but why are we

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.220
doing this?" and I think everybody in this
room I'm gonna assume - and if you

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.729
disagree don't tell me now tell me later -
you know it's so easy, at universities in

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.350
particular, we're all smart people, all
people that are thinking about what's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.680
the evidence for what we're looking at,
we're all people who believe that we

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.149
know how to make a case in an argument.
We talk a lot to each other

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.740
and before we know it we forget what the
rest of the world thinks. And I don't

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.070
know if you ever have had this
experience. I recently have had to take a

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.649
few trips away from Atlanta into more
rural areas of Georgia, North Carolina,

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.600
South Carolina, and I'm not always good at
making sure that I have enough gas in my

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.259
car. So then I find myself at quite
unusual gas stations and two things

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.250
happen: I sort of listen, I'm eavesdropping to what people are talking

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.209
about and  I'm like "boy this is like a
different planet and this is not just

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.020
like a few hundred miles away". The next
interesting exchange is I

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.340
start to pay and I say something and
people look at me as if I am a too alien

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.870
because I don't sound like them at all.
So in all of this we reinforce the notion

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.760
that that we are a part of a very
complex diverse world, and that's why

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.240
we're having these conversations with
America, to really break through the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.750
bubble that we live in and to get a good
sense of what the rest of the world

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.600
thinks. You'll hear a lot more about those
conversations later today as the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.160
panelists talk, as Peter sets it up. And
I'm really not going to say much more

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.910
but I would like to highlight a few
aspects. One of the areas that I'm

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.280
extremely proud of, for us as an Emory
community, is that we are not afraid to

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.870
have difficult conversations, that were
not afraid to tackle sort of the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.580
impossible questions. That we are also
not so arrogant that we know what the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.860
answers are, but we're just willing to
take a risk and challenge ourselves and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.520
thereby really advancing the world,
really helping the world come up with

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.950
some of the complex issues that we have.
As a social scientist and a public

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.080
health expert, I actually have some of
the people in the room know, my COO

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.770
Harris here - he and I have known each
other for a very long time - we have been

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.870
working on addiction for quite an
extensive period of time, but there's

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.650
something that's different about the
opioid epidemic that we currently have

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.610
in the United States. And I'm not gonna
take the time to give you a lecture on

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.570
what I think is different about it, but
some of you might have seen my recent Op-Ed

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.090
piece on CNN, where you can get a
sense of what I'm thinking about. And one

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.030
of the aspects of that, that I just can't
help myself but will have to say. For

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.860
those of you who don't know, I grew up in
the Netherlands. I spent the first three

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.800
decades of my life mainly in Europe and
addiction is all over the world. It's not

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.600
something that happens only in certain
places. But the approach towards people

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.770
who have an issue with addiction, people
who whose habits get out of hand is that

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.820
you can approach it in different ways. So
I come from a culture and I strongly

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.950
believe in a philosophy that if somebody
has a problem - in this case

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.090
with opioids - the last thing we should do
is blame the person and turn him into a

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.400
criminal - him or her into a criminal.
Because at the end of the day addiction

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.950
is a societal problem. It's a problem for
all of us. It's a sign that something is

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.120
wrong in the world in which we live. And
that means that we collectively really

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.040
are responsible for not stigmatizing
people, for thinking about solutions, and

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.060
for having the kind of conversations
that we're going to have a day. So I want

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.030
to thank you for your commitment to
being here, to be part of this

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.110
conversation, to learn from each other,
and I hope that you really will enjoy it.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.160
And I now invite the panel to get going
and for me to get out of the way. Thank

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.000
you very much!

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
[audience applauds]

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.420
President Sterk, thank you very much. I'm
delighted to be here I've been in the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:25.200
public opinion field for for now over 50
years, and I've been taking the NBC Wall

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.100
Street Journal poll for about 30 years
now. And what we, as a society, we've made

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.040
such an unbelievable advancement in so
many areas. Whether it be in terms of

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:45.360
race or religion or in terms of marriage
and all of the other elements, and you

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.190
would say this has been remarkable. But
at the same time we've been doing this,

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.440
what's happened is we've really become
polarized as a society. And it's no

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.060
longer a chance that we talk to one
another and that we've reached an area

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.460
of consensus. And so what Emory has
undertaken here is the importance of

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.370
beginning a conversation, the ability to
be able to talk to one another to figure

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.870
out how you reach a consensus. Because as
you watch with the United States

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.420
Congress just last week, and weekend, and
week out, there is no consensus that is

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.550
being built. And so whether it be the
issue of immigration, which we undertook

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.530
in the fall, or the issue of opioids
which is so important, that we're

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.930
undertaking now, what this is about is
having an understanding and a dialogue.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:44.220
Last year we lost 63 thousand Americans
to opioid overdose at a rate that -

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.450
although there are some hopeful signs
here and there - continues to increase

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.970
around the country. We live in a country
that has six percent of the world's

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:01.410
population. We consume 96 percent of the
opioid medications or opioids produced

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:07.400
in the world. Something is particularly
wrong in this country.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.780
Right now about 230 million prescriptions for
opioids in the US on an annual basis,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.670
enough for every single adult to have a
bottle of pills around the clock for

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.540
three weeks.
That's too much. And we have decreased

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.050
prescribing in the past few years, but
we're at three times what we were in

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.440
1999. So when people say we've
drastically reduced prescribing, no.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.200
The curve was going like this [indicates steep upward direction with hand]

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.200
now it's going
like this [indicates flat outward direction with hand]

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.230
so there's still room to go.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.700
And my concern is that we've primed the
pump and so a lot of people became

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.980
addicted to these prescription pills, and
then have gone on to misuse or use

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.020
heroin and now fentanyl, which we know is
just killing people due to the potency.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:55.620
So we really, you know, got this guideline
to really change practice. It's a

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.950
guideline, it's not a regulation, but it's
really talking about how non-opioid

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:04.770
should be used for chronic pain first, so
that people have evidence-based

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.820
treatment. Because that's what's about -
when you look at long term evidence - for

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.890
opioids for chronic pain it's not there.
For acute pain, sure. Chronic pain, the

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.100
evidence isn't there.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.500
The reason I'm here
is because I'm a parent who lost a child

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.410
to an accidental overdose. It happened
right down the street. It happened

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.720
Thanksgiving of 2013. Laura Hope was a
senior in high school. That's the new

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.340
face of addiction. If you , in my opinion,
and it's not unlike anybody else who has

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:41.010
family around here. But part of her,
she had suffered a jaw injury. A broken

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.450
jaw right here at Decatur High School,
soccer match. She was a varsity

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.980
goalie as a freshman playing against Decatur High, got a boot to the jaw. While all that

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.480
sounds very innocent, it happens in
sports, it's an example of how it might put a

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.920
young person on a path that they might not be able to get off of. And in her case she

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:04.680
was prescribed liquid Lortab. As a
personal long-term recovery at that time,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:10.649
I knew about my issues but I didn't know
the ramifications of a opioid being

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:15.029
prescribed to a person, a young person of
aged 15, what it does to the brain and

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:18.990
how much they like it so fast and they
stay on it. Through statistics it'll say, if

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:24.149
you're exposed to an opioid before 21,
you have 80% chance of a substance use

00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:28.680
disorder. If you make it to past 21
you've got a 80% chance of not

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.690
suffering from addiction, from substance, or opioid - you know prescription

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.000
turning into an addiction. So those are
things that I've unfortunately learned

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.200
in my journey since then.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.200
[audience member] I work with a
program here in Georgia called

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.670
Motherhood Beyond Bars and we teach
prenatal classes at the Department of

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.750
Corrections. The vast majority of the
pregnant women in the Department of

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:58.410
Corrections are there for drug offenses
or crimes related to it. And to me it's

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.370
probably one of the most devastating
views of this crisis, to see a pregnant

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:08.550
woman in prison attire serving time
while she's pregnant and then being

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.930
separated from her baby, and just the
cycle that it creates in these families.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.550
[another audience member] There was a wonderful book called Pain:
The Gift That Nobody Wants by Dr.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:23.670
Bradley and Yancey, and they talk about,
you know when you have leprosy pain, the

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.500
lack of pain is a real problem. You lose
a limb. But I have noticed with our

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.730
patients that they don't want any pain.
Sometimes part of healing and part of

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.720
that pain does promote healing. So I
think a cultural change and a shift in

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.500
how what the expectations of people are
would help.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.660
[another audience member]
What is the rate of patients,

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:47.100
who had legal prescriptions for opiates,
that become addicted? And that's not from

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.290
like family members borrowing or
stealing.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.600
That's patients who have been prescribed
for like a surgery and then after the

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.900
surgery they ended up turning to
something worse or non prescribed opiates.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.780
[panel answers] And what I would tell you is that we don't

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.960
have great data on that. And that's what
the issue is. Like when we look at the

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.170
incidence of new addictions in our
country we can't give you that number. We

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.680
can tell you prevalence rates of
addiction. And a lot of times it depends

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:18.380
too on how long the prescription was for
and the initial strength. And that's what

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.149
we see is makes you more likely to get
addicted. Usually for somebody who's just

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:28.580
on opioids for chronic pain, I
believe the rate is less than 2% that go

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.140
on to get addicted. But when you look at
how many, if you've got 235 million

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.100
prescriptions out there, 2%, then that
number gets big.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.560
So for me, this issue is epiphenomenon of so much.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.600
It's epiphenomenon of our relationship to

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.260
drugs in general. I mean opioids
are scary because they have such

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:54.920
terrible results, but I worry how many of
our students, you know, are on cocaine taking

00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:01.550
Adderall when it's not prescribed, I
worry about that. I worry about why are

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:06.980
so many of Americans feeling so
desperate. What that to me, this

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:13.190
epiphenomenon of a societal illness of 21st century America, that we in a sense

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.579
refuse to address by focusing on other
things, which is not to say that opioids

00:12:16.579 --> 00:12:21.709
aren't as a terrible problem, but I guess
to President Sterk's

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:26.480
earlier point, if we can't see - that there
are actually - this is actually a scream

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.340
for help, we are going to miss the boat
on so much.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.800
[Peter Hart]
It doesn't stop here, this is

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.700
where it should start. It's the beginning
of a conversation, an important

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.020
conversation, so give yourselves a round
of applause and thank you very much for

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.780
going there.
[audience applauds]
