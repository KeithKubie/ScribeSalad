00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.750
- [Instructor] One of the core ideas

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.480
of Thomas Piketty's book
is if the return on capital

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.870
is greater than the growth in economy,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.410
then that could drive inequality.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.183
That could drive inequality.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.410
Inequality.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.490
And inequality is a natural
byproduct of a market

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.987
capitalist economy and
one could argue that,

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:23.462
"Hey, look, some inequality
is going to happen

00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:25.047
"as you grow your economy
and you let people

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:27.217
"be entrepreneurial, and
some people get lucky,

00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:29.247
"some people less lucky,
some people work harder,

00:00:29.247 --> 00:00:31.687
"some people work less
hard, some people are able

00:00:31.687 --> 00:00:33.850
"to allocate capital
well, some people aren't."

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.550
So it all comes into
it, but in extreme forms

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.630
maybe this is bad.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.660
And in particular, maybe
this is bad for democracy.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.170
So bad for democracy right over here.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.300
Maybe too much power starts
to accrue in some ways.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.930
And maybe that and in the worst case

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.370
because that kind of starts
to drive in on itself.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.390
It actually might even
hurt economic growth

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.120
if you don't have enough
consumers or people

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.490
with enough purchasing
power, discretionary income.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.420
Or whatever else.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.540
But what I really wanna focus on here

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.880
is not so much whether these causalities

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.210
are actually there or how much
we should worry about them.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.770
Once again, my point
isn't to give an opinion

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.410
on whether I agree or disagree
with some or all of the book.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.740
It's really just to give you a framework

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.760
because I think the book at least raises

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.576
an interesting conversation
and it gives us

00:01:20.576 --> 00:01:23.290
a lot of I would say
fodder for interesting

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.980
analysis and critical thinking.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.790
And that's really what I
want you to walk away with.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.210
How do you think about these things?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.100
And you just need to
make your own judgment.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.230
So what I wanna do here is at least show

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.660
a circumstance that this might be

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.140
returns on capital being
greater than economic growth.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.770
Can be a reasonable proxy
for rising inequality.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.120
And of course we, you know,
this connection over here

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.010
is even kind of a harder thing

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.420
to necessarily draw the connection.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.293
But even this one isn't
always going to be the case.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.950
And to think about
that, let's just imagine

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.070
an economy where the whole
economy just produces.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.450
It just produces apples.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.430
So let's say the whole
economy right over here,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.730
this is our whole, our entire economy.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.283
And let me copy and paste it.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.930
So copy and paste it.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.130
I'm gonna paste it to show
the growth in the economy.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.060
So let's say in year
one, so this is year one

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.103
right over here.

00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:29.893
Year one, it produced 1000 apples.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.393
1000 apples.

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:38.430
And let's say in year two.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.430
Year two, we have economic growth.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.930
So let me draw that.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.160
So G going from year one
to year two, let's say

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.403
that this is equal to 2%.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.590
So 2% of 1000 would be 20 more apples.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.023
So in year two the economy produces 1020.

00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:04.780
1020 apples, right over there.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.130
Now let's say that in year one.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.410
In year one, of the 1000
apples that were produced.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.870
Let's say that 500 of them,
I'll just split it half.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.100
Let's say 500 of them go
to the owners of capital.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.830
500 to the owners of capital.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.240
Now, what's the owners of capital?

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.470
What do they own and
what's 'cause it's a very

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.570
simple economy that only has one industry

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.088
right over here.

00:03:32.088 --> 00:03:33.400
But the owners of capital
are the people who would

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.550
own the orchard, who own the trees,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.560
who own the machinery, whatever they need

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.520
to pick the apples.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.663
And let's say that the
other 500 goes to labor.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.463
500 to labor.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.840
And let's say that the
value of the capital here.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.383
So the value.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.537
Of capital in apples.

00:03:59.537 --> 00:04:01.440
we're just assuming everything
going on here, is apples.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.380
I guess to buy this apple
orchard, the owner of it

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.130
had to give, let's say 4000 apples.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.720
4000 apples.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.620
So given this, what is the
return on capital in year one?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.670
Well, the return on
capital, I'll just write.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.190
Return on capital.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.620
Capital in year one is going to be.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.230
well, the return is 500 apples.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.290
500 apples.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.390
Divided by the cost,
or I guess we could say

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.410
the value of the capital.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.433
So divided by 4000.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.440
4000 apples.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.260
So that's going to give us five.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.910
Five divided by, assuming
it's five divided by 40.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.860
Which is one-eighth.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.600
So that's going to 12.5%.

00:04:52.388 --> 00:04:54.070
12.5%.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.240
So the return on capital,
at least in year one.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.620
Is greater than.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.070
Well, let's go to year two.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.960
So we can look at the return
on capital in year two.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.653
And compare it.

00:05:03.653 --> 00:05:05.800
And compare it to the
growth right over here.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.090
And so let's just say that
the value of the capital.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.860
That all of it was reinvested.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.930
So now the value of the capital.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.653
Value of capital.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.623
Is now 4000 plus 500 more apples.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.590
So 4500 apples, they
reinvested it in the business.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.180
And they didn't necessarily
use the apples as capital.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.520
But they use those extra
500 apples to go buy

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.600
some more machinery.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.960
Or buy some more land.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.253
Whatever it might be.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.750
And let's say though, that the laborer had

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.520
a little bit of leverage this year.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.970
So in this year, because
the laborer had leverage.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.660
Only 500 still goes to
the owners of capital.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.290
Now this isn't necessarily
going to be the case.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.360
If the owners of the
capital have leverage,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.460
maybe they can negotiate the other way.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.980
But let's say in this situation, still 500

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:56.573
goes to labor.

00:05:58.414 --> 00:05:59.903
Sorry, 500 goes to capital.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.730
Capital.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.820
And here, 520.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.653
520 would go to labor.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.480
520 to labor.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.320
So now what's the return on capital?

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.890
The return on capital now is going to be.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.803
Still 500 apples.

00:06:20.908 --> 00:06:21.823
500 apples.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.523
Divided by 4500.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.833
4500 apples.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.590
Which is going to be equal to one-ninth.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.676
Which is the same thing as, what is that?

00:06:37.676 --> 00:06:38.509
0.99.

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:39.970
So let's see, oh actually 0.1111.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.592
Let me just, one divided by nine.

00:06:42.592 --> 00:06:43.425
Yep, it's 0.11111.

00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:45.810
So it's going to be approximately 11%.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.740
Or let's say 11.1%.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.690
Approximately 11.1%.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.110
Now the whole reason why
I wanted to show that.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.260
Why I did this diagram.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.720
Is that this is a situation where

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.800
R is greater than G.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.800
Our return on capital,
is 12.5% going to 11.1%.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.430
Both of these numbers
are much larger than our

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.640
growth of the entire economy.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.870
But even though that's
happening, you actually

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.317
don't have rising in equality over here.

00:07:12.317 --> 00:07:13.210
In this situation, of course.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.770
I worked the numbers to make this happen.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.480
I could have worked them the other way.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.540
But in this situation it's
not necessarily the case

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.010
that R being greater than
G lead to more inequality.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.730
Now in future videos
I'll do some spreadsheets

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.350
where you see, if R stays
constant at a constant value

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.600
higher than G.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.970
That will lead to inequality.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.010
But the whole reason why I
did this one is to show you.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.160
That just in a given period of
time, R being greater than G.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.330
Doesn't necessarily mean more inequality.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.330
In this case, labor got more of a fraction

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.630
of the total national income.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.150
And once again, the
connection being capital

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:51.310
and labor and income inequality.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.780
Is that, in general the
income that goes to labor

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.830
is more indicative of the
income that might go to the

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.010
lower quartiles of a population.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.920
And the income that goes to capital,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.160
is more indicative of the income

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.345
that might go to the top
percentile or decile.

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:13.090
Because capital tends to be concentrated

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.763
in the top few sections.
