00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.535 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
- Let's start with
the Super Bowl.

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.404 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
It was noticed,
afterwords, after the game

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:08.141 line:0%
that Tom Brady and Robert
Kraft, the team owner,

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.010 line:0%
had an embrace on the field

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.213
and there was a lot of
conjecture over whether,

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:15.615
you know, Brady and Kraft
were kissing on the lips.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.050
People thought that
was a little strange.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
- They look like they were
about to, they both went into a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.122 align:start size:97% position:3%
like, kind of say
something at the same time,

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.158
and I believe that they have,
for sure, kissed on the lips.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.326
At some point.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.728
And that's just,
you know, that's

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:29.996
like a long term
male friendship,

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.232
I'm not even gonna
fault him for that.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.034 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm just like,
where was Papa John?

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.102
You know what I mean?

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.038
You win the Super Bowl,

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.873
you're looking around for Papa

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.674 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if it's
because of the scandal recently,

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:45.078
but Papa John's not there,
and I think when you see

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.614 align:start size:84% position:16%
someone as successful
as Tom Brady,

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:51.317
almost kiss Robert Kraft
on the mouth in front of

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.154 align:start size:94% position:6%
millions of people, you've
got to blame Gisele.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:55.922
- Oo.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.190
- You know what I mean,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.458
Gisele's not taking care
of business, you know.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:01.061
If your husband needs a kiss

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.662
you better give it to him.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:04.230
Or else he's going to Kraft.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.433 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it's just like, no
matter how hot someone is,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.500
no matter how many
millions of dollars

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.235
she makes as a supermodel,

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.404
someone's sick of her
and it's her husband.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:15.208 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Mm when I was googling
this to see the clip,

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.709
cause you know, I
hadn't watched it,

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.678
I wasn't watching TV at
the time, there was also-

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.513 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You love to talk
about that as if like,

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.049
you not doing your job well
is something to brag about.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.386 align:start size:97% position:3%
- There's also a meme out
there, or a kind of a picture,

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.088
which it turns out
is photoshopped,

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.624
but snoops.com had to do
a study of whether Brady

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.359
and Belichick kissed on the lips

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.161
after the Super Bowl
too, cause someone

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.596
kind of combined
a couple pictures-

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.298 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Is snoops.com different
from snopes.com?

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.933
- I don't know, I don't know.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.536 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Is it like snoops website
of conspiracy theories?

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.972
- That would be an
awesome website.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.474
Cause I don't know
if you remember,

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:50.176 align:start size:94% position:6%
there's kind of been a
controversy over the years

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:53.279
that Brady, on his reality show,

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.648 align:start size:84% position:16%
you know, kisses
his kids on the lips

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.219 align:start size:88% position:13%
and people just thought
that was strange

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.255 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then there's been
Super Bowls where

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.891 align:start position:0%
Tom Brady and his dad, you
know, kind of kissed on the lips

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:08.061
and they're just like a
family kiss on the lips,

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.897
that's the family,
way they do things.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:14.400
And they say that's normal
and lots of families do that.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.237
- What's your point?

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.738 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't know, that's
surprising to me,

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.707
all of that that I just
said is surprising to me.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.209 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think love is
love, I'm all for it.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.279
That's like the one thing
I can't fault Brady for.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.282
You know, is it a form
of cheating on his wife?

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.483
Yes.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:34.254 align:start size:88% position:13%
Has he cheated in every
aspect of the game?

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.622
Including pliability.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:38.258
I think pliability is cheating.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.092
I think-

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.294
(laughter)

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:42.762
I think that these
were non-kisses,

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.797 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think it just looked,
like from the camera angle,

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.332
it looks like kisses,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.234
they save it for the shows.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:50.003
You know what I mean,
all that champagne.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.539
You're gonna kiss in the shower.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.573
It's a fact.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.177
Are you telling me no?

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.245
- I mean, I didn't, a lot
of people are down there

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.680 align:start size:88% position:13%
in the locker room
knowing, you would think

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.481
that would come out-

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.916
- How many people-

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.217 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Robert Kraft has a serious
girlfriend, you know,

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.385
I think there'd be a
problem for everybody.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.920
- Still it's Super Bowl night,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.988
53 guys on each roster,

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:11.524 align:start size:88% position:13%
53 guys on the Patriot's
roster plus trainers,

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.159
plus owners,

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.794
someone's kissing in the shower.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.963
(laughter)

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.131
It's statistics.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.202 align:start size:97% position:3%
In fact, if there's one
good thing that came out of

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:25.605 align:start size:97% position:3%
the Super Bowl, besides
the first male cheerleader,

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.774
congratulations
Los Angeles Rams,

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:32.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
to perform the
Super Bowl would be

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:35.281
whoever kissed in the showers.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.517 align:start size:88% position:13%
I think maybe that's why
I'm so mad this year,

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.419
because of the Los Angeles Rams,

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.120
because I live in Los Angeles.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.490
Everyone around LA has
just been head down.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.725
- Yeah (laughter)

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.460
- Trying to figure
out what's going on.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.895
It is-

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.964 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Its a dower mood around
the city right now,

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.233 align:start size:84% position:16%
people having a hard
time recovering.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.102 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Can we please just
move on to the story that

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:59.472
I can get into, that I
can sink my teeth into.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:01.474
- Liam Neeson got into a
little hot water this week

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:04.677 align:start size:94% position:6%
in an interview promoting
his upcoming movie.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:09.916
He said, when looking for
inspiration for the role,

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.885
for the sort of rage
that he needed to feel

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:17.390
he remembered back, decades
ago, when a friend of his

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.591
was raped.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.561 align:start size:84% position:16%
And when that
happened, decades ago,

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.097
he said for weeks

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:27.700
he would go around on walks

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.168
looking for

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:33.239 align:start size:97% position:3%
any black bastard, and that's
using quotes, his quotes,

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:36.909
to come out of a pub and have
a go at him about something

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.811
so that he could kill them.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.079
- Yeah, he wanted to,

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.215
he would walk around
black neighborhoods,

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.751 align:start size:84% position:16%
predominately African
neighborhoods,

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.753
hoping that someone
would step to him

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:50.089
so that he could kill
the man as revenge

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.557
for his friend's rape.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:54.294
And listen, a lot of people are
calling him racist for this-

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.329
- Yeah!

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.563 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He came out
today and clarified

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:58.898
that he was like, I
was kind of admitting

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:00.333
my racism, and then like,

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.968
after walking around
for a couple of weeks

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.903
with this in my head,
I realized I'm wrong,

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:06.606 align:start size:88% position:13%
this is crazy, he
shouldn't have said it,

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:08.775
but I'll say this-

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.544 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He said he was
walking around with,

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start size:88% position:13%
like a bat, essentially,
like a shiv.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.014
- What do you call
it, it's a causic?

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:16.482
- A coosh, a cosh-

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.784 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It was something that I
didn't understand what it was.

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:19.285
- A Cosh.

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.421 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The Irish, and the Irish are
not known for their racism,

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.189
so this was, this
really stood out,

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.191
that Liam Neeson would
say something like this.

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:27.026 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I remember
just after college,

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:29.228
this is probably right
after you'd left Greg,

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:32.732
one of my friends was raped

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:35.835
by a half Pilipino
half Italian man

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.671
and for, I would
say, six months,

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:41.107
every night I would
just walk around

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:45.945
with a can of mace and
a cigarette lighter,

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:50.516
trying to find anyone who was
half Italian half Pilipino.

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.719
And it got to the point
at the end of six months

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.021
that I would just ask people

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.257 align:start size:84% position:16%
if they were part
Italian and Pilipino,

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.926 align:start size:84% position:16%
and hope that someone
would answer me.

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:02.328 align:start size:97% position:3%
And the first person who
answers me would have gotten

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.331
a coosh right across the face,

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.500
but it a, it never happened.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.468
I just love-

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.003
- What is, how do you ask that?

00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:12.205
- Hmm?

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.374 align:start size:84% position:16%
- How do you ask,
how did you ask that?

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.676
- It's exactly the same as it
is in english, surprisingly.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.579
The Pilipino language
is a lazy language,

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.381
they pretty much
just took english

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:24.917
and just used that,

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.452
for the most part.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:29.489
I just think it's like really
funny to be promoting a movie

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:32.859
where you drive a snow
plow and kill people,

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.528 align:start size:88% position:13%
that you would ever
let this be brought up.

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.063 align:start size:84% position:16%
But he brought it
up, no one was like,

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:40.633
hey, did you ever, has any of
your friends ever been raped?

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:43.035
And if so, who did it
and how did you react?

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:45.605
He brought this up
during a press tour

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:48.908
for a movie that,
I mean, unless,

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.143 align:start size:88% position:13%
the only way this
could have been funnier

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.944 align:start size:81% position:19%
is if it'd been
an animated movie.

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.180
(laughter)

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.916
That he went into this for.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:07:00.119 align:start size:97% position:3%
Listen, Liam Neeson's a great
guy, everyone loves him.

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:00.887
- Is he?

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:02.121
- Yes.

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.623
- How do we know
he's a great guy?

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:06.025
- Because you can't be around
this business for this long

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:07.593
without horrible
stories coming out

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:10.096
and remember the time
he was on ESPN live?

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.264
And didn't know what
the hell they were

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.298
talking about for five minutes?

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:13.733
That was amazing.

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:14.567
Do you remember this Erica?

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:15.802
- I don't.

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.503 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Oh my god, the ask him
about like Tim Tebow,

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:19.071
he's like we should start over.

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.674
Like, we're live, what do
you think about Tim Tebow

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.476
and he's like, he's
might as well just be

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.011
speaking French to me right now,

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.046
and they just, there's no
question they can ask him,

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:29.749 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think he only knows soccer,
and Irish soccer at that.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:32.285
- I mean, but the thing
is, okay he said it,

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.821
you're right, he
did initially say,

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:37.790
you know, it taught him
a lesson, basically,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.093
after four to five
times of doing this,

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:43.963
he realized like, what
the fuck are you doing,

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:46.732
like you shouldn't
think like this.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.668 align:start size:84% position:16%
But it's insane that
he thought that,

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:50.703
it's insane that
in the first place

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.205
and I even wondered, like,

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:54.540
is there any chance he's
just making up this story,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.477
to like, be like a
cool actorly story

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.512
about motivation and
then he found himself,

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.514
like, really trapped in a corner

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.149
that he couldn't get out of,
cause he's a crazy person.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.650
- That's possible, and he also,

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.619 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean he was in his twenty's,
early twenty's at the time,

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.855 align:start size:88% position:13%
when you're like stupid
and make mistakes,

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:12.124
very racist mistakes, like,

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:15.127 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm not even going to get
into what pulled in Atlanta,

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:17.530 align:start size:88% position:13%
but when you're in your
twenties, you know,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.299
you don't get a pass, but it's
a little more understanding,

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:21.267
it wasn't like he was like-

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:22.502
- No, no.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.003 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So I was promoting
Love Actually and

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:27.773
I decided to walk around
looking for black people.

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:30.576
- No, no, you don't
get a pass on that,

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start size:97% position:3%
that's like the people that
are giving the pass on,

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:36.849
you know, the group of
kids that, you know,

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:39.685 align:start size:97% position:3%
were going after the Native
American at that rally,

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:40.786
I forget what that, you know,

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.021
what the name of those kids are.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.689
I mean, he was in his twenty's,

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.992
you should not be in
twenty's walking around

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:49.562
with like a stick, just
wanting to beat up some,

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.997
and kill a black person.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start size:97% position:3%
It wasn't like he was
looking for the specific guy

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.237 align:start size:97% position:3%
who raped his friend, he
was just looking for anyone.

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.872
- Yeah, you don't get a pass,

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:03.042
but if you make it
to your seventy's and
you tell the story,

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.278
it's not like oh, this
guy should be fired,

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:06.779
you know what I mean.

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:07.980
Like if those kids make it
to seventy and they're like,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.248
you know I did a
lot of great things

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:11.517
but one time I was
at this rally and

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:13.085 align:start size:84% position:16%
I got in a Native
American's face, like,

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.987
I agree with you
100%, but I think,

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:16.956 align:start size:84% position:16%
when you're, he's
like late seventy's.

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:18.858 align:start size:88% position:13%
- But he's still making
like action movies

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.227 align:start size:84% position:16%
about killing people
with snow plows.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.528
- Still?

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:24.063
He just made the one.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.399
I forgive him and I'm going
to see the snow plow movie.
