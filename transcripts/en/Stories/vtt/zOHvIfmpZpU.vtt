00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.660
LAURA LING: Cirque
Du Soleil's show, Ka,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.560
has been called the
most lavish production

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.620
in the history of
Western theater

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.120
and one of the most
technologically

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.830
advanced shows in the world.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.970
The show features
stunts by performers

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.402
that seem to defy gravity
and put everything at risk.

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.772
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.000
I mean, watching you,
my jaw was on the floor.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.480
I was holding my breath.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.180
Is there a certain rush that
you get being out there?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.365
FRANCISCO ALEGRIA: We feel
the adrenaline, you know?

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:37.490
When we come to the theater
and when you hear the music

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.735
and you see the curtains
open, and you're just ready.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.160
You leave all your personal
[? exploring ?] behind you.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.530
NORIKO TAKAHASHI: People think
my performance is not so hard,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.610
but actually it's very hard.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.548
It's like the bird on
the water, like a swan.

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:56.922
It's very graceful.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.520
But under the water, it's--

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.359
It is like that.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:06.900
FRANCISCO ALEGRIA:
It's just amazing.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.900
There's nothing like it.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.649
NORIKO TAKAHASHI: When
the audience claps,

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.884
I feel I have done
something great.

00:01:14.254 --> 00:01:16.420
LAURA LING: Do you get
nervous when you're up there?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.530
NORIKO TAKAHASHI: Yes, I'm
always nervous for 11 years.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.606
People think you do the
same thing every day,

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.735
but it's different.

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:30.110
GABRYEL NOGUEIRA DA SILVA: I
get butterflies every time I

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.780
go through the curtain.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.750
It's almost like I'm looking
to myself from the audience.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.690
It's risky, but
I love what I do.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.729
We love what we do.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.020
LAURA LING: What are the risks?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.110
What's the level of danger
when you're up there?

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.610
FRANCISCO ALEGRIA:
It's pretty high.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.290
My brother and I, we are
not attached to any safety

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.240
because you have to be free to
be able to do your performance.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.190
Anything could happen
in the blink of an eye.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.960
So you have to prepare
physically, mentally

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.394
to do this kind of performance.

00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:57.810
LAURA LING: Do
people think you're

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.190
crazy that your job is
performing in something

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.357
called "The Wheel of Death"?

00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:02.856
FRANCISCO ALEGRIA:
I think so, yeah,

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.400
because they scream sometimes
when we're doing our routine.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.280
LAURA LING: What you do on
stage has to be so precise.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.360
What is the preparation
process like?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.397
And what is your
ritual to get ready?

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:20.980
GABRYEL NOGUEIRA DA
SILVA: Well I have

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.380
many different little rituals.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.600
One of the things I
do is skipping rope.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.000
I do also juggling balls.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.445
I feel like that connects my
brain to my body completely.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.127
DAN HONG LI: I go
to the training

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:47.670
room and doing warm up, my
Tai Chi and then stretching.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.980
And I started breathing,
like at night, go like inhale

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.260
and then exhale.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.612
Tai Chi gives me a clear
mind and positive energy.

00:02:56.612 --> 00:02:58.820
SABU ALEGRIA: We love playing
football, all the time,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.752
because we are running.

00:03:00.752 --> 00:03:01.960
We sweat.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.690
Every morning this
is like in the Wheel.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.830
You're running.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.525
And sometime, you
need to react quick.

00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:09.900
GABRYEL NOGUEIRA
DA SILVA: I also

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.710
do some of my capoeira moves.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.390
And when there's other people
warming up in the same room

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.020
as me, I try to play with them.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.840
So I think that's the
main goal of my ritual

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.860
is to be connected to the other
people that are around me,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.220
you know, so we can deliver
the final results together.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.910
LAURA LING: So it seems
that for you, it's

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.740
preparation,
preparation, preparation,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.170
preparation every chance you
get before you go up on stage.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.770
You're going through
your routine.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.310
NORIKO TAKAHASHI:
Yes, I knew that.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.970
I can't just go.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.768
If I can trust myself, I
feel more free on the stage

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:58.962
and it makes my
performance better.

00:03:58.962 --> 00:04:00.420
DAN HONG LI: When
I do my makeup, I

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.490
just totally, completely,
like, relax and focus.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.540
I think it's very important.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.030
FRANCISCO ALEGRIA:
When the curtains open

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.822
and you hear the music and you
feel the people, you're ready.

00:04:12.822 --> 00:04:14.030
You know, just automatically.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.135
SABU ALEGRIA: You
hear everything.

00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:15.410
You go.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.510
FRANCISCO ALEGRIA:
You are just focusing

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.028
on what you are going to do.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.110
LAURA LING: Isn't it hard
to leave your stresses

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.130
at the door?

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.980
How do you do that?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.605
DAN HONG LI: When
you come on, then you

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:31.510
have to look forget everything.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.720
LAURA LING: Because you've
got spears thrown at you.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.803
DAN HONG LI: Yes, spears--

00:04:33.803 --> 00:04:41.310
[LAUGHTHER]

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.500
LAURA LING: What do you
love most about what you do?

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.291
GABRYEL NOGUEIRA DA
SILVA: Just the freedom

00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:47.670
that you have on stage
expressing yourself.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.481
It's doing what you love most.

00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:52.230
FRANCISCO ALEGRIA: We
love the performance

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.400
because it makes you feel
special when you're up there

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.025
and when you hear the people.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.060
That's what is
beautiful about it.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.084
[INAUDIBLE] You
love what you do.

00:05:07.084 --> 00:05:09.500
GABRYEL NOGUEIRA DA SILVA:
It's like challenging your body

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.640
to its max, you know, to see
how far you can go with this.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.820
SABU ALEGRIA: I think
Cirque is familia.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.050
I like the circus all my life.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.744
Sometimes my wife says,
you need to stop now.

00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:27.570
You know, I can't.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.600
I can't.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.583
I think Cirque is my life.

00:05:34.312 --> 00:05:36.270
LAURA LING: Be sure to
watch this next episode,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.220
as President Obama's
former speech

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.459
writer talks about his rituals
for writing under pressure.

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:43.250
DAVID LITT: We would
write speeches knowing

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.830
that there are people whose
full-time job is to pick apart

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.600
every single word
the President says,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.960
and, sometimes, just to
take things out of context.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.659
And that can be
incredibly intimidating.

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.450
LAURA LING: Thanks for
watching, and please
