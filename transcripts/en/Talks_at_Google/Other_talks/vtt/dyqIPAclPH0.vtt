00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.779
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Hi, everybody. Thank
you all for joining us today.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.390
Garance DorÃ© began her career as an illustrator
living in

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.309
Paris. And in 2006, she began her blog Une
Fille Comme

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.740
Moi where she publishes her drawings and musings
about

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.420
life. Garance picked up a camera and began
adding

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.272
street-style photographs to her blog and the
rest as they

00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:27.480
say is fashion history. So please join me
in welcoming

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.289
Garance to New York.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.289
[Applause]

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.930
&gt;&gt;Garance: Hi.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.841
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So Garance thank you so much
for coming here. We're

00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:40.710
very thrilled to have you. As we'll discuss
later, we're

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.720
not necessarily known for our fashion sense
at Google.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.940
So this is.
[laughter]

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.720
&gt;&gt;Garance: [laughing] This looks very good.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.850
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Thank you. I know she's talking
about me. Not so

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.550
much some others. [laughter] So Garance, as
an illustrator, you came to

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.600
your blog as a bit of a fashion outsider,
some might say. And now, you

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.070
really positioned yourself, probably unintentionally,
as a really relatable fashion insider.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.330
Can you talk to us a little bit about that
evolution and how that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.330
happened.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.090
&gt;&gt;Garance: Yes, it's a long story. But I try
to make it not too

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.171
long. I open my blog because I was frustrated.
I --

00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:23.270
after studying communication and working as
a -- how do

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.030
you say PR in a cinema which was great but
not very

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.259
fulfilling for me. I had that thing like,
"I want to be

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.930
an artist. I'm frustrated. My life is okay,
but it's

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.330
just okay. My dreams --" and so, I was like,
"okay, I'm

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.380
26 or 27. It's the moment to do something,
because later

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.649
is going to be too late, which is not true,
it's never

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.409
too late. [laughter] But at that time, I was
like, "you have to do

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.170
it now." So I dropped everything. I had a
very good

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.119
friend support system, so I didn't really
feel alone. A

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.759
lot of my friends were artists and everything.
So I

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.649
started to teach myself illustration. That
was my dream.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.880
I had that dream of me, my studio, big windows
and like

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.650
illustrating all day. And so, of course in
the beginning

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.550
my illustrations went horrible and I didn't
get any jobs

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.110
and everything. But little by little by training
myself

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.299
and getting kicked out of magazines and like
editors and

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.310
everything, I ended up getting a few jobs
and started

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.600
like working. And I should have been happy,
but I

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.700
realized that my dream was not that cool.
I mean, I was

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.060
actually like alone all day, because illustration,
even

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.610
if you have big windows which I didn't have,
is very

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.880
lonely job. And the thing is that I had to
send my

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.709
illustration to an artistic director. The
artistic

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.549
director would tell me, "Okay. This lady looks
good, but

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.569
can you make her top more pink and her boobs
bigger. And

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.500
that like this and she should be smiling."
Because I was

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.641
not yet working for Vogue or anything. So
you know it

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:14.420
could be more commercial work. And by the
time I would

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.120
see my work printed in a magazine or a book,
it wasn't

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.620
what I wanted. I thought it looked horrible.
So I was

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.390
very frustrated. At that time, Scott the Sartorialist
--

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.069
I didn't know him at that time, I knew that
blog and I

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.819
was fascinated. Because first I had never
been to New

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.000
York. At that time I was not living in Paris.
I was

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.110
living in the south of France. And I felt
very -- the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.110
only connection I had and at that time there
was really

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.800
no Internet. The beginning. The only connection
to the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.909
world was like through magazines. I would
always buy.

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.250
like, a lot of magazines. Lots everywhere.
So I was

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.060
watching that, "oh my God, this is crazy.
What's

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.329
happening? I can be in New York. I can see
all these

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.510
cool people that" -- and it inspired me to
open my blog.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.250
And so, what I told myself was, "I'm going
to give myself

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.629
a last chance." It had been like two years
since I

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.580
started dropping everything and started taking
on

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.420
illustration. This is going to be my chance
to talk

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.140
directly to the people without having an artistic
director changing my work. It's going to be

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.290
a last
chance to try -- I mean, at that time I was

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.070
taking too
long to illustrate. Like a week to do one

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.970
illustration.
Illustration in a magazine is like 200 Euros.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.830
So, if you
take ten days to do that.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.280
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Yeah, it's not a lot of money.
[laughter]

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.580
&gt;&gt; Garance: You're never going to get anywhere.
No big windows.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.850
So I was like, "I need to learn to draw more
fast. I'm

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.510
going to open a blog and every day I'm going
to post

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.360
something. It comes the weekend, I'm going
to give myself

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.050
an hour because I have a life, you know, one
hour post on a

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.250
blog. Try to be closer to people that have
their real

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.830
feedback. And the only thing I told myself
was that I'm

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.760
not going to say I live in Paris. Because
[laughing]

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.420
Because going to Paris to show my book -- because
at that

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.610
time you would go with your book, you know,
your

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.840
portfolio. Going each time people were like,
"oh, nice

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.830
work; that's cool. We're going to call you.
Oh, you

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:37.590
don't live in Paris? [laughter] Oh, okay.
I'll call you. Bye. Never

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.470
call back. Because there was really that thing
like --

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.110
people, I think, even at that time we were
working with

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.680
e-mail. Because when I started we were still
working

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.470
with like scanning the stuff faxing the stuff.
Internet

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.750
was starting. Working through e-mails and
everything.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.500
But they want to feel like you're here. You're
in the

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.500
same.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.500
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Even the fact that there's technology.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.530
&gt;&gt; Garance: You're in the same world as them.
I didn't know. I

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.580
didn't belong because I was far -- so I was
like no way. Totally

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.940
Parisian. So I was talking on my blog about
myself, never

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.250
mentioning you know how where I was living.
Everything

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.440
was a little vague. But you know. [laughter]
It worked out. And

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.810
so, but of course, so what happened is that
when I opened

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.430
my blog, I don't know -- it took off very
fast, because I

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.080
first started publishing just illustrations
and then I

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.850
realize I like to communicate and exchange
with people.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.600
And so, I started publishing texts and like
three weeks

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.690
later a magazine called me and said, "this
is special.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.650
We want to make a little story about it."
And so, I had

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.400
like a little story in a French magazine,
L'Express, which is pretty

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.240
big. And from that point, you know, I was
like

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.380
legitimate and people would come to the blog
and the

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.020
audience would grow. At that time I had like
2000

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.020
readers.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.789
&gt;&gt; Presenter: After three weeks? After three
weeks? That's extraordinary.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.240
&gt;&gt; Garance: It was very, very fast. I think
what happened was that I was the first one

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.080
to do that mix of fashion and like
telling stories about my life at the same

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.520
time plus
illustration. And my blog was cute. It was

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.140
really like --
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It still is cute, Garance

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.820
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Garance: But I really -- the design was

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.150
as simple as it is
today so that you could see the images. So

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.620
I think it's
a pleasure to come every day and see a new

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.240
-- you know
what? At that time blogs were like -- people

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.210
didn't
really care. That's a blog. She's going to

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.590
put that
image. With my -- you know -- and since the

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.130
beginning I
was like I wanted to look good. And so, I

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.061
think it's
easy to get. Even if they don't read, people

00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:47.990
just come
and check and see there's an illustration

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.690
that's nice to see. So
it took off very fast like that. And it took

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.450
off in
France, because France was very early with

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.160
the blogging
thing. We really had the big movement. Looking

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.600
at
you because you're French. [laughter] And

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.800
so, there was that
movement where like ten, 15 bloggers and we

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.900
were called
fashion bloggers, just because we were women

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.530
and we were
talking about the things we talk about when

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.670
we're with
friends. And so, you know I was called a fashion

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.960
blogger. That's how it started.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.870
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You and Scott -- so Scott Schuman
who, if you don't

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:27.250
know writes -- blogs The Sartorialist, which
is an amazing

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.060
blog here in New York -- based largely in
New York.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.660
She's also in love with him. [laughter] That
smile is not just as a

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.379
fan of his work. You guys were really at if
forefront of

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:41.019
this. I think blogging has changed since you
guys came

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:42.959
on the scene. Especially fashion blogging.
There's a

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:45.750
lot of people who are chronicling daily outfit
choices.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.779
So what do you think of that evolution. It's
really a

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.620
trend, if you can call it a trend since we're
talking about fashion, that you guys really

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.620
started.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.269
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah, I think it's funny. For
a long time, I think

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:02.230
blogging was really about -- it was more like
forums.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.490
You know where you want to communicate with
people and

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:10.889
share your stuff but not really make -- it
was not a way

00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:14.810
to be famous. You know, it was not a way -- you
didn't

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.839
make money or be famous. It was more like
a way to

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:21.810
communicate and make a new circle of friends,
right. And

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.459
so, I mean, for a long time. My blog is like
five years

00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:30.570
and a half. I think for like two years -- of
course I

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.170
started to see, like, I had, like, story in
a magazine and

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.550
another one. So I could see that there was
something

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.209
happening. But for a long time it was more
like -- it

00:09:39.209 --> 00:09:45.330
was a community thing. And with Scott -- Scott
started

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.220
working on style.com and I started to work
with Vogue.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.569
Things like that. And I think it became clear
that it

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:58.199
was a great way to make self-promotion and
at that time a

00:09:58.199 --> 00:10:02.540
new generation of bloggers arrived who, you
know, would

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.670
more maybe think of how could I get myself
out in this world

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.220
which is cool, you know, but how can I show
my work, how

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:15.600
can I show myself? So that was a second -- how
do you

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600
say?

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Wave.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah, second wave of bloggers.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.100
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So do you think that bloggers
such as yourself and Scott, with

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.000
the kind of influence that you've had in the
industry

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.410
which is quite tremendous and I'd like to
talk about that

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.499
in a minute, too. Do you think there's room
for bloggers

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:33.810
to have that type of influence again in the
industry -- in

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.810
fashion.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.560
&gt;&gt;Garance: I'm sure there is. I mean, for
me it's just the

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:45.290
beginning. The only thing is that what is
interesting --

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.749
the fact that I come from that far away place
that is the

00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:55.759
past. [giggles] And is that I really started
doing the blog for

00:10:55.759 --> 00:11:00.019
reasons that were, like, I want to be free.
I want to be

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:04.170
able to talk freely. I want to be able to
share with

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.560
people that -- without the filter -- and Scott
was

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.810
exactly the same. I think he was frustrated
because he

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.699
would see those people in the street and what
he saw in

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:19.399
magazines was totally different. So he made
like that

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:23.130
&gt;&gt;Presenter: that connection

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.170
&gt;&gt;Garance: that link between the people that
were reading magazines. So

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.199
you could see -- there was really--it was
really

00:11:30.199 --> 00:11:33.810
expressing something that was missing. Whereas
now I

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:40.080
think it's becoming a real business, right?
And so, I

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.910
think -- what I still feel that way. I still
feel like I

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.560
want to be in places where other people are
not -- so I

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.441
want to be where, you know, I don't care about
going to a

00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:56.490
show and saying "woo, it's wonderful". I say
it sometimes

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.269
when it's great, but it's not my mission.
I mean,

00:11:59.269 --> 00:12:02.790
magazines are here for that. Now other bloggers
do that

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.720
very well. But I really -- I'm not interested.
I don't

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.449
want to be bored by myself. I'm my first reader.
And

00:12:09.449 --> 00:12:14.209
even if I'm invited to do stuff. Also because
I started

00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:17.810
like when I was older, so I think I have.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:18.810
&gt;&gt; Presenter: 26.
[laughter]

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.990
&gt;&gt; Garance: But yeah I opened my blog when
I was around 30. So

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.459
it's like I feel like I've been frustrated
long enough

00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:29.910
that I don't want to fall back into that thing
and be

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.200
that blog where you go and you're like, "who
is she

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.850
talking for? You know, is she talking for
that brand,

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.010
that advertiser or whatever?" I'm really talking
for

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.069
people that are like me. I hope. That's what
I want to do what I

00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:45.439
want to keep on doing.

00:12:45.439 --> 00:12:48.279
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Do you think there's anything
particular about the

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:51.430
moment when you started, since it was really
at the forefront

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:57.320
of this whole blogging trend, that led to
your success or

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.100
sort of helped kind of propel you.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.920
&gt;&gt; Garance: It's weird. We were trying to
talk about what I was

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.009
going to say today and earlier. And I was
like I think

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:13.180
the thing that I'm still not really -- like,
realizing,

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.220
you know, is that people get attached to a
personality.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.620
For a long time I was, like, what do people
like about my

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.700
blog? Is it the writing? I'm very goofy when
I write. For me, I am not a writer.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.319
Is it the illustrations? Is it the photo?
What exactly

00:13:26.319 --> 00:13:31.749
is it? And I think now I have enough experience
that I

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:35.019
can realize okay maybe it's just a personality.
You

00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:38.160
know, it's a big picture. It's like a little
bit of

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.999
everything. And so, I think that's -- this
and the fact

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:46.579
that my personality is being very easy. You
know, I talk

00:13:46.579 --> 00:13:51.990
about any kind of women's problem and you
know, I don't

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.990
hide anything.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.069
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You're very candid on your blog.
[laughter]

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:59.279
&gt;&gt;Garance: I'm not trying to say that I'm
perfect. And I think

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.199
that's what was missing. In magazines, I would
read

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:05.209
interviews of celebrities. Wow, she really
wakes up at

00:14:05.209 --> 00:14:10.199
five and drinks water with lemon inside and
then she does

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:12.839
yoga before, you know, going.

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:15.470
&gt;&gt; Presenter: She doesn't exercise either.
[laughter]

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:20.490
&gt;&gt; Garance: Doesn't have weight problem and
then goes to get a

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.100
massage and then goes to work. I was like,
wow. But you

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.970
know, and I know that it's not my everyday
life. My

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.009
friend's everyday life. That's what I prefer
to do with

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:31.819
my friends is to talk about real life. That's
what I

00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:35.949
wanted to do with my blog. That's what I wanted
to do in the

00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:37.839
beginning because I thought I was talking
to nobody. I

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:41.629
thought I would never have a reader. So, okay,
I'm going to

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:45.259
talk like I talk to my friends, like I talk
to my sister.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:50.339
And that's what I still do now. I think I
saw that the

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:52.930
audience was growing. And then, one day or
another there

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.699
was like "oh my God so many people are reading
me". And

00:14:55.699 --> 00:15:00.190
then some people come there first time, "I
love your

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.949
blog". This is not possible. You read that
post the

00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:07.779
other day when I was talking about the toilet.
[laughter] I was

00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:15.129
like really? And or, you know, and so, I don't
-- I just

00:15:15.129 --> 00:15:18.749
I'm very good at like putting blinders and
just, you

00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:22.490
know, like today I didn't think about coming
to do a talk

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.670
before five minutes before and then I started
stressing a

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.220
little bit. I'm just like always thinking
I'm talking to

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.689
my friends. I'm talking to them. And that's
it. And I

00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:35.389
think that makes a difference. I'm not taking
-- I don't

00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:37.879
know. People are not an audience. They're
just -- I

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:39.869
feel like it's my friends.

00:15:39.869 --> 00:15:42.839
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Well, so you've been creating
your blog, as you said,

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:46.249
going on six years now which really makes
you a veteran

00:15:46.249 --> 00:15:48.050
of this format which is why you're dressed
in fatigues.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.439
&gt;&gt;Garance: Yes, exactly
[laughter]

00:15:49.439 --> 00:15:54.940
&gt;&gt;Presenter: How has blogging changed over
time for you in the past

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.259
six years.
&gt;&gt;Garance: Um

00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:58.540
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Are you doing anything differently
apart from talking.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.171
&gt;&gt; Garance: I'm doing a lot of things differently
because I want

00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:04.790
to be better all the time. So each time I'm,
like, I'm

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.870
going to work less but be better. It doesn't
work like

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:14.430
that. I feel like I'm busy all the time. The
blog is

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.700
also -- you know, the success of the blog
brought me a

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:23.339
lot of work. So people call me to shoot an
advertising.

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:32.370
Shoot a video of this. There is a lot of things
happening every day. So I am very busy. But

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:37.119
I think,
you know, I'm trying to not change my vision

00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:41.670
and I just
like trying to make it better. Like, you know,

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.829
the photo
for example. For a long time there was no

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:46.689
photo. There
was just illustration. Yeah, but I really

00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:51.319
want to show
those shoes. So I took a camera and tried

00:16:51.319 --> 00:16:55.139
and worked.
And so, I'm trying to make it better, but

00:16:55.139 --> 00:17:00.510
I'm trying to
stay true to myself, which sounds very Queen

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:07.329
of Butter -- like really
like what I'm trying to do. And I love her..

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:08.760
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Presenter: I love her too. She seems very

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.040
nice. I don't believe
that she eats all that stuff that she says

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.040
she eats.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.590
&gt;&gt; Garance: I don't know what she eats. You
should tell me.

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.420
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That cookbook. She says she
eats all kinds of butter and I don't know

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.660
if I'd buy it.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.350
&gt;&gt; Garance: The thing is she wakes up at five
to do yoga.

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:25.949
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Presenter: All right. Some people are genetically

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:28.150
blessed in a
way that I'm not.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.740
&gt;&gt; Garance: That's why we love her. She's
just a dream.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.300
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Exactly. So you talked a little

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.050
bit about this that
people really relate to your personality.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.410
Which I think
is really coming across even in this chat.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.390
I think the way you are on your
blog is how you come across in person. We

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.510
have had a
chance to meet a couple of times in person

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.570
and it comes across very quickly. A lot of
bloggers kind of

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.680
emerged as personalities of their own. And
if you

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.920
contrast that to somebody like Bill Cunningham
which I

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.090
think of as the original sartorialist, riding
around on

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.740
his bike in the streets of New York, like,
very low key

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:05.380
except for that bicycle. With the documentary
about him which just came out.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.540
People didn't really know that much about
him. So it's

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.530
such a contrast to the way you guys are working.
Certainly because of technology making it

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.870
easier to promote yourself
as a personality.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.670
&gt;&gt;Garance: Absolutely
&gt;&gt;Presenter: But I would love to talk about

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.610
that a
little more. Bill Cunningham wasn't sitting

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.740
in front at
fashion week. But you and Scott and folks

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.650
like you are. That's really
changing the industry so much, giving that

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:35.920
relatable outsider, relatable insider, rather,
access in a way that's never been done before.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.750
Can you
talk a little bit about that.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.990
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah, there is two different things.
I think of first

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.020
I've always loved technology and my blog was
cute in the

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.530
beginning also because I knew HTML which sounds
weird but

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.990
I learned myself to do it.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.160
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Do you want to work at Google?
We're hiring in case.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:00.300
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Garance: But I think the thing that even

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:06.290
still now fashion
trends. There's, of course, but like the audiences

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.620
on
Internet are crazy when you compare that to

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:14.550
the magazine.
It's like crazy. And I come from France so

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:18.670
our audiences
in France for magazine it's smaller than America.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:23.130
It's
such a big country. But already at that time

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.320
when I --
before I left, I live in New York for a year

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.750
now and
before I left France, I was looking at the

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.140
-- you know,
the diffusion of the magazine. How do you

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.330
say how many
they sell and they print.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.330
&gt;&gt; Presenter: The distribution?

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.810
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah, this is crazy. I have more
people coming to see my

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:46.050
website than this magazine, that magazine,
than most of them.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:52.110
So I think this is the power of it. And you
know it's as

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.520
simple as that. You know, when you get there
and you're,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.940
you know, able to talk to people directly
and have that

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.140
power -- I mean, I didn't -- it's funny because
for a

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.790
long time magazines came and said, "do you
want to work

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:15.190
with us? Do you want to be our web editor
in chief?"

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.150
Beautiful magazine and stuff. And for a long
time I

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.810
was like I have to do that. This is such a
great

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.890
opportunity for me. I will never have dreamt
of that in

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:29.430
my life before or you know, but each time
I was like you

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.120
know what? I feel like I have a better stuff
where I

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120
am.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.010
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Better platform on your own.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.230
&gt;&gt;Garance: Yeah, I have my media. And again,
I was watching

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:43.110
their audience and I was like I can't leave
my

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.840
beautiful audience that I love and I've created
to go to

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:52.950
a place where there is less audience. And
it's not my

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:57.220
friends like and so, it was hard. I mean,
a lot of times

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.890
I was like, "this is the wrong choice, you're
wrong blah,

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.260
blah, blah". But now I understand it's very
important to

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.051
always follow what you feel. And so, I think
that's why.

00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:11.680
I think the audience is very strong; there
is that and there is the power of

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.731
recommendation. I mean, for a brand. When
I talk -- how

00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:17.570
many times did it happen when I talk about
a pair of

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.930
shoes and two days later they're out of stock.
I think that's a

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:27.610
mix of audiences and also the fact people
feel close to

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.630
me. So if I say "I love that" maybe it means
more than if

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.540
it's a magazine because they have the feeling
they know

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.990
me so I'm their friend.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.490
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It's like getting a recommendation
from a girlfriend.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.830
Versus from Anna Wintour [laughter]
Presenter: Not my friend but she seems very

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.860
friendly I'm sure.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.770
&gt;&gt;Garance: I'm sure. She's friendly, yeah

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:50.760
&gt;&gt;Presenter: She scares the crap out of me.
I'm not going to lie. [laughter]

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.520
It's not like we're hanging out or anything.
But let's

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.280
talk about that. The blog is really -- we
can edit that

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.460
all right? I didn't mean that. She seems very
nice.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.830
I'm sure she's. [giggling] But the blog has
really morphed into a

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.330
business for you. I mean, it's not just a
place to house

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:10.820
ideas and house your illustrations and your
amazing photographs and your musings on life

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.800
as we said
in the beginning. It's really become a place

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.240
where you
can influence trends, where you can sell out

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.240
a pair of
shoes.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.470
&gt;&gt;Garance: Which is something you have to
be very careful with

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.470
I.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.049
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Some people cannot handle that
kind of traffic.

00:22:25.049 --> 00:22:29.120
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah exactly. You're like ha -- maybe
I could do that

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.190
and make money and you know oh just one day
or you know.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.110
So I'm very careful with that.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.390
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So how do you handle that? Because
I would imagine.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.570
It was r it's a wonderful luxury of success.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.810
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yes, it's luxury of success that's
why you have to

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:48.030
stay successful. [giggles] Basically, I just
say no and people are not very

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:52.820
happy when I say no. Now I think we're in
a great moment

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.860
where brands because it's what we're talking
about --

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:01.690
mostly advertisers or people who understand
that you

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.170
can't force -- I mean with Internet now--
you can't force

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.430
your product on the people, it has to come
-- it has to

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:12.500
be smarter than that. So now they totally
understand

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.860
when they say "can you do like edit content".
Which means

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.690
can you talk about my brand in your blog.
Like it was

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.500
from you. And I say this is off limits. I'm
not doing

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.230
that. The content of the blog is not for sale.
But I

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:30.760
can publish something on your blog or I can
-- we can use

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.900
that in a different way. They now start to
understand.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.610
A year ago, they would say okay we're not
working with

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.610
you. Yeah.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.610
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Wow.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.510
&gt;&gt; Garance: Which is fine. I said okay, right..

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.650
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It's not the right partnership
for you, if that's the case.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:45.650
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah exactly.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.100
&gt;&gt;Presenter: No, I mean that important to
maintain that integrity

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.630
especially since you said most of your success
is based

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.110
on people trusting you.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:56.600
&gt;&gt; Garance: Of course. That's the treasure.
And I hope that -- and I think

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.130
there will be other blog -- because now it's
become such

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.010
a business, you know, that, you know, I think.
My blog is

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:08.160
very egocentric. I'm always talking about
myself. But

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.360
in a way it's good. Because I'm not listening
-- I mean,

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.410
I'm listening to the readers when they want
to talk about

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:19.870
a subject, but I'm not -- you know, like,
I'm not

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.960
publishing something to have the most comments
or to have

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.080
my things re-tweeted a lot. Or -- you know,
it always

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.670
comes from "oh my God I want to buy that".
Or "I feel that

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.600
way. I want to talk about it". I don't try
to have my

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.200
content dictated by what the people want.
Or it's very

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.311
easy to stray and go in the wrong direction.

00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:45.600
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And so, how does that contrast
with when you're hired

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.720
by an advertiser or, let's say, by a magazine
to create

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.950
content from them. How do you maintain that
voice that

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.670
people know you for but still fulfill that.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.960
&gt;&gt;Garance: I always try to have a conversation.
And then

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.690
understand I'm very happy now that, if I don't
feel

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:06.370
something, I'm have the luxury of not doing
it. It's a

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.190
choice. You know, so I don't really care about
making

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.850
amounts of super-great money. I feel like
what I have

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:17.010
right now is wonderful. I think I'm more happy
expressing myself and taking pictures and

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.990
illustrating
than having stuff. So, you know, I'm also

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:25.120
-- I can say
no. It doesn't weigh on me. I don't have to

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.960
-- so, but
I try to have a conversation and see what

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.440
would be smart.
I also -- I think I'm good at consulting for

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.110
these brands
and tell them I've been working and I know

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.940
what's going
to be better for your brand -- I mean, not

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.200
your brand but the people you want to reach.
Tell me who you want to reach on the Internet

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.930
and I'll
tell you what's the best way for us to do

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.670
this and to do
that. And they're very happy usually because

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:56.110
this is so
new that, you know, you have to be, like,

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.870
now of course I
see young people coming out. I want to work

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.680
on Internet
and everything. But three years ago people

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.030
were like
working on Internet was not that good. You

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.300
prefer to be
in a magazine. Now people really want to do

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.880
it. So
there's still a lack. People are still looking

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.060
for
advice and feedback. And when you have your

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.290
veteran and [giggles]
you have so much experience, they listen to

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.290
me.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.160
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So what sort of advice do you
give to a big brand.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.710
Something that you're not going to get paid
for. I don't

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:28.630
want to take away from your consulting. [laughter]
What sort of big

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.330
problem do they come to you with? You sort
of think

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.330
through.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.790
&gt;&gt;Garance: A typical problem I think -- different
for every case.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:44.391
Most brands want to be cool and it's not easy.
So they

00:26:44.391 --> 00:26:48.000
want to be cool, but they don't want to change
the way

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.280
they do. I think there are some brands who
-- you know,

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.330
it's interesting. You have to develop like
new

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.450
departments almost. You know, and I think
now there is

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:04.710
very good things happening, like, for example
I look at Kate Spade's Tumblr, for example.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.670
It's interesting because they
really are able to tell. I think brands need

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.250
to tell
their story and to make people dream like

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:15.070
Ralph Lauren said.
He said, "I don't design dresses; I design

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.290
dreams". People don't really care about. They
can find the same

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.790
dress everywhere. And, you know, cheaper maybe.
And

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.650
everything so I think when you go to a store
what you

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.240
want is to buy a part of their cool and their
history and

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.341
what they are and who represents them and
everything.

00:27:30.341 --> 00:27:33.200
And I think that's now taking care of a brand
is doing

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.370
all of that. Even myself I start to think
of myself as a

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.540
brand which feels very weird but you know
for a very long

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.180
time I was trying to keep all my content on
my blog.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.410
People would say hey can you do that for us
and we'll

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.720
publish it on our website. And I was like
you know what?

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:55.080
If I do a content, --if I do a story or pictures
-- I'd rather put it on my blog so thank

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:01.360
you, no. But now with video that you share
and Twitter and Tumblr.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.160
You can really spread the word and it's still
always

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.510
comes back to you which is pretty wonderful.
And I think

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:11.290
for any brand that's the idea. Give a precise
idea of

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.630
what is your dream? What is your dream you're
selling.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:18.560
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So talking about technology,
how has technology in the

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.530
past five, six years changed what you do.
I mean, apart

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:25.040
from adding on a photography element which
is sort of

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.000
that more immediate element. Can you talk
a little bit

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.030
about that.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:33.840
&gt;&gt;Garance: I think -- well, the video, for
example, is also a

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:39.840
good -- it's a good example because blogging
became easy

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.620
when platforms launched blogs that you can
do in two

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.910
minutes. And you know, it's always like the
technology

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:51.910
proceeds, you know, a revolution. Right now
people who

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:55.830
do film have the revolution of the 5g camera
and the

00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:00.380
video that is beautiful like you're doing
a movie for

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.330
almost nothing. And so, you're seeing more
and more

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.400
beautiful movies and that's really. So that's
good --

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.590
and I started doing that. I didn't even know.
I bought

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:12.560
my camera. It was a new version of my camera
and

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.540
suddenly I switched it to video and I was
like, "oh my

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.150
God; this is wonderful". And started filming.
And put it

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:24.370
on my blog. And now people call me to shoot
ads. [laughter] It's

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:29.500
like I always think. Just I love to embrace,
you know,

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.450
what's new and try it. Sometimes it takes
me awhile.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:35.690
Like I don't know; now I'm doing Instagram
for example.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.350
For a long time I was going around it looking
what should

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:42.340
I do. Do I have time to do that. But you know
like I

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.690
never say no. I think it's the moment where
you become

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:49.690
boring, when you say "oh no, that's my thing.
That's how I do it." I always

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.400
change. I like to try something new. Like,
last fashion

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.030
week, I was doing my thing and just doing
my thing-thing

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.930
is like so I was going to the shows, taking
pictures of

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.230
people outside the shows. Of course everything
has

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:07.850
changed so much now. It's very different.
And I was

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:15.160
like "I'm bored." [laughter] "I'm bored."
And so, now we're looking for new ways

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.630
to show fashion week. I want to cover it in
a different

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:20.230
way. I want to be excited all the time. When
I am

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.840
starting to be bored, I don't even imagine
how the people

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.190
who read the blog must feel. If I'm bored
myself, what are

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.710
they going to feel? So it's going to be a
new fight, but

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.980
I love that. Maybe it's going to take me five
more

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.260
fashion weeks to figure out how to show it
in different

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.260
way.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.000
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It challenges you on creativity.
&gt;&gt; Garance: Always, all the time

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.790
&gt;&gt;Presenter: What's next? On that point, fashion
week is right around the corner.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.390
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yes, so. [chuckles]

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.180
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You're ready in your fatigues
to hit the main streets

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.180
of fashion.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.690
&gt;&gt; Garance: I always have wonderful ideas
every morning and then

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.950
making them happen is, you know, so yeah I
mean you know

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.670
for new fashion week I would love to do more
video.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:05.320
That's really I think how I'm going to get
excited and

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.570
then go a little bit outside of that, you
know -- I don't

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.190
want to just report. That's the thing. I want
to tell

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:15.110
stories and I think what's more interesting
than seeing

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:18.700
video show is seeing how do we live our lives
when we

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.480
leave fashion week because it's really funny.
It's

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.780
crazy. Stupid things happen. After two weeks
of fashion

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.250
week, everybody is crazy because you lose
track of what's

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:31.080
real and what's not. If ewe break your heel
it's the end of

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.440
the world. [laughter] Things like that. I'm
okay to like show

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:42.160
that. I'm okay to show when I am totally desperate
because I end up being totally desperate each

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.300
time I end up crying in the third
week. Now I know, when that day happens, I'm

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.720
like "Ooh that's the day". And I
want to share that because on the blog I can't

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.690
really.
It's difficult to communicate that. And also

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:56.860
I think
fashion as a -- you know, if you can just

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.300
show what's
happening and not write -- because when I

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.100
write, it's
really my thoughts. So if I want to make fun

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.280
of somebody
or you know of a situation, it's, you know,

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.660
it becomes
very personal. But if you just show what's

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.780
happening, I
think it can be really funny.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.630
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So people can make their own
fun or not.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.360
&gt;&gt; Garance: [inaudible] Exactly.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.810
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Okay, so we're going to do a
little fill in the blank.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:25.890
I'm going to ask you. With whatever comes
to mind. No

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.890
pressure.
[laughter]

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.669
&gt;&gt; Garance: Are you trying to put pressure
on me.

00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:30.669
&gt;&gt; Presenter: No.

00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:33.220
&gt;&gt;Garance: Did you see her shoes?
[audience responds]

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.520
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Do you want to see my shoes?
I don't think they're on

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.160
camera. Those are cool.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.740
&gt;&gt; Garance: I'm putting my new shoes but look
what you've got

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.580
&gt;&gt; Presenter: I now, I wore them.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:49.110
&gt;&gt; Presenter: : Yeah, this is my shoes moment
more than anything.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:50.110
Style is--

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:53.360
&gt;&gt;Garance: Oh, I have a good one because I
think I came up with

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.870
the idea. Sorry I talk too much. [laughter]
But I realize it's

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:03.080
when you just give up all the thing 'oh I'm
going to be

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.030
Audrey Hepburn style. It's when you just give
up all

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:10.180
that and start just putting together the things
you like.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.650
Even if it doesn't make sense, it will become
your style.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:14.820
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Like that.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.010
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Anna Wintour is -- we're not
picking on Anna Wintour I have nothing but

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.460
love for her. Anna Wintour is--

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.740
&gt;&gt; Garance: I don't know Anna Wintour. I think
she's sweet. I've

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.680
talked to her once and I was very, very stressed.
Dead

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.890
stressed. I wanted to interview her and she
looked at me

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.740
and smiled and answered my question and that
was it.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.990
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So she's curt.
[laughter]

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.900
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Carine Roitfeld?

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.300
&gt;&gt; Garance: She's adorable.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.340
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Adorable?

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.440
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah, she is. Everybody that knows
her will tell you.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.360
She sends me e-mails like "hey I saw your
blog; liked it".

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.530
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That's so cool. I don't know
what I would do if I got

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.970
e-mail from Carine Roitfeld. That would be
pretty neat.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:03.100
&gt;&gt; Garance: I was like, "Hey Carine sent us
an e-mail this morning". Really she's -- she's

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:07.260
a
real inspiration because she's so natural

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.010
and so nice.
And then, you see her and she's like this

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.609
bombshell, so much style. I
rial like her.

00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:16.200
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Mom jeans. Mom jeans are--

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.720
&gt;&gt; Garance: Oh, my God. That's a concept that
I discovered when I

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.349
came to America.

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:22.349
[laughter].

00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:25.129
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You're welcome. Contribution
to fashion. You're welcome

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:27.540
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Garance: You know when you were young,

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.240
because I'm a little bit
old. Because when I was young, old people

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.599
would not wear
jeans. But all those people who wear jeans

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:39.319
today, one day
they're going to wear jeans, right? I don't

00:34:39.319 --> 00:34:42.269
know what to
say about it. I think it's a concept. Yeah.

00:34:42.269 --> 00:34:44.499
Presenter: It's a concept?
[laughter].

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:46.230
&gt;&gt; Garance: It's like mom hair.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.759
&gt;&gt;Presenter: What's mom hair.

00:34:47.759 --> 00:34:52.539
&gt;&gt; Garance: So I was looking -- okay, this
is bad. I was looking

00:34:52.539 --> 00:34:58.369
at the fashion stuff for some -- like ad campaign
thing -- and there was the new -- what's her

00:34:58.369 --> 00:35:01.390
name?
Arizona Muse haircut. She has that haircut

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.069
and for some
reasons all the magazines put it back like

00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:07.430
that. Like the new Isabel Marant ad has it
like that. And it

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:10.749
was like "what's up? Mom haircut?" It's like
a little bit

00:35:10.749 --> 00:35:14.250
up here. Like, a little bit like when you.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.069
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I'm worried about my hair.
[laughter]

00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:22.940
&gt;&gt; Garance: We'll send you all an email with
the Arizona Muse haircut. It's mom hair.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.940
[laughter]

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.480
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That's mom hair with her mom
jeans. She could start a

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.480
new trend.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.480
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.240
&gt;&gt;Presenter: But it's going to be all the
rage.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.109
&gt;&gt;Garance: She's not happy about that.

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:33.860
&gt;&gt;Presenter: New York style is....

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:38.020
&gt;&gt; Garance: It's a very eclectic. What's great
with New York is

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.240
that I don't even miss France because I have
so many

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.779
French friends. The world is here. So everything
--

00:35:45.779 --> 00:35:46.779
it's wonderful.

00:35:46.779 --> 00:35:49.499
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Ironic facial hair is?
[laughter]

00:35:49.499 --> 00:35:51.420
&gt;&gt; Garance: What is that?

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.819
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It's just a New York thing.
You go to Williamsburg. Ironic facial hair,

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:57.580
you know, like a mustache that.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.680
&gt;&gt;Garance: Ohhhhh, so ironic that --
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Ironic facial hair

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.410
&gt;&gt;Garance: I don't know. The whole hipster
thing.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.539
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:08.829
&gt;&gt;Garance: Talking about it right now in my
blog.

00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:12.269
&gt;&gt; Presenter: OK, are you? OK, hipsters are--You
fed into my next one.

00:36:12.269 --> 00:36:14.569
&gt;&gt; Garance: In Williamsburg.

00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:16.319
[laughter].

00:36:16.319 --> 00:36:19.020
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Katie Middleton is--

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:25.710
&gt;&gt; Garance: She is doing a lot of sports,
I think. She's very

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:30.520
tense. [laughter] She looks tense in all the
pictures I see her

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:36.290
walking. Don't you think? No really.
[laughter]

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.590
&gt;&gt; Presenter: She wears panty hose. I heard
from my office mate that apparently

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:42.200
she's bringing panty hose back.. I'm not happy
about this.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.030
&gt;&gt; Garance: What is panty hose?

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.600
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Pantyhose, like nude stockings.
&gt;&gt;Garance: Oooooh.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.950
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I know, right. I'm Indian, they
--

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:49.519
&gt;&gt;Garance: Is she gonna wear the open-toed
shoes?

00:36:49.519 --> 00:36:53.039
&gt;&gt; Presenter: I don't now but I hope not.
I'm worried about this, but apparently there's

00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:56.970
a rumor that nude panty
hose are back because of indicate Kate Middleton.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.430
I didn't
know this until yesterday. For my people,

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:04.890
Indians,
they don't make nude panty hose in my coloring.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.700
So this [inaudible] an
unwelcome fashion trend.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.230
&gt;&gt; Garance: Go to the beach.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:15.269
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Oooo. Interesting. If the whole
Google [inaudible]

00:37:15.269 --> 00:37:16.689
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Fashion trend I hate is

00:37:16.689 --> 00:37:20.480
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You now mine, obviously. Nude
panty hose. But

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.150
what's your most --

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:26.109
&gt;&gt;Garance: I hate? I don't hate any fashion
trend. It's weird. I don't know.

00:37:26.109 --> 00:37:29.089
I'm thinking right now.

00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:32.460
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You can come back to it.
&gt;&gt;Garance: OK

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.259
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Models eat, blank.

00:37:34.259 --> 00:37:36.809
&gt;&gt;Garance: Not a lot. Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Not a lot, OK

00:37:36.809 --> 00:37:38.779
&gt;&gt;Presenter: My favorite show at the Collections
is--

00:37:38.779 --> 00:37:46.259
&gt;&gt; Garance: Oh, Hmm. It's mostly -- like most
of the time, it's

00:37:46.259 --> 00:37:47.259
Prada.

00:37:47.259 --> 00:37:50.589
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I see. And the most surprising
thing about Google to me

00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:55.369
is --
&gt;&gt; Garance: About Google? [laughter] The most

00:37:55.369 --> 00:38:03.319
surprising thing about Google?
Is that I like it. I don't know -- it's like

00:38:03.319 --> 00:38:06.549
it's. It's
the whole subject. Can you do the question

00:38:06.549 --> 00:38:08.599
in a
different way. I'd love to talk about Google

00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:10.779
but it's
like -- I don't know.

00:38:10.779 --> 00:38:13.729
&gt;&gt; Presenter: What would you like us to change.
[laughter]

00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:15.609
&gt;&gt; Garance: To be more pretty.

00:38:15.609 --> 00:38:18.170
&gt;&gt; Presenter: We can't change the home page.
That's our thing.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:22.880
&gt;&gt; Garance: No, but the Google plus and everything.
I think it could

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:28.059
be more like that you can -- like, I love
chrome because

00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:31.260
I can put all my -- you know, I can make it
nicely

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.480
designed and everything.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.200
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Be able to personalize, customize
Google plus.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.839
&gt;&gt;Garance: I like the products and I try them
all and I think

00:38:40.839 --> 00:38:43.380
it's -- there is a a great thing going on.
I like that

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.289
YouTube is looking better. For a long time
I didn't put

00:38:46.289 --> 00:38:50.740
my videos on YouTube because I thought like
the reader is

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:56.359
just depressing. Now it's starting to really
look better. The page reads better. For me

00:38:56.359 --> 00:38:57.569
it's
very important.

00:38:57.569 --> 00:39:00.060
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It's very important here, too.
So I'm glad to hear that feedback.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.160
&gt;&gt; Garance: Google plus is great and everything.
I think people

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:08.110
love when there is a place that looks nice
like my blog

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.110
[laughter].

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.750
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Okay, so before we turn it over
to Q and A, I just

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.179
wanted to get your fashion advice on some
things.

00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:18.570
&gt;&gt; Garance: [laughing] I know you have some
things in your bags.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:22.339
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I have props here. I feel like
Googlers and tech folks in general we kind

00:39:22.339 --> 00:39:26.190
of get a bad rap for being not terribly well-dressed.
We're not

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.940
known for our fashion sense. Although I feel
like this

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.900
crowd is proving that wrong. The cameras can't
see it

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.089
but this is a well-turned out group of Googlers.
I feel

00:39:36.089 --> 00:39:41.019
it's unjustified and I want to put these misconceptions
to rest right here. So I would love for you

00:39:41.019 --> 00:39:45.579
to review some of our
typical fashion choices here at Google. [laughter]

00:39:45.579 --> 00:39:57.200
If that's OK. [inaudible] Okay so first
off, we have -- our standard backpack, which

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.359
you know. [laughter]

00:39:58.359 --> 00:40:01.069
&gt;&gt; Garance: This is not standard. It's like.

00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:02.069
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Well, it's fancy.

00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:03.069
&gt;&gt; Garance: Is it your backpack.

00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:06.630
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It's my colleague's backpack.
I borrowed it for this

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:10.650
demonstration. It's good. It's handy. You
can put your

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:14.640
phone right there tell me what you think.
Be candid.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.650
&gt;&gt;Garance: Should I say something? I like
backpack, but this one doesn't say anything.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.800
I
think you should like.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.559
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It doesn't say girl on the go?
&gt;&gt;Garance: No

00:40:25.559 --> 00:40:26.559
[laughter].

00:40:26.559 --> 00:40:28.200
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Tech girl on the go?

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200
&gt;&gt;Garance: Tech girl on the go.
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Tech girl on the go. That's a

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.839
look.
&gt;&gt; Garance: It's just like people would turn

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:32.839
away from you..
[laughter]

00:40:32.839 --> 00:40:35.550
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You think?
&gt;&gt; Garance: I almost don't want to think

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.970
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Interesting.
&gt;&gt;Garance: yeah

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:44.489
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Wait, I have more. Hold on. So,
when every Googler

00:40:44.489 --> 00:40:51.849
starts, [laughter] we get a hat, because -- we
really do get these.

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:55.240
&gt;&gt; Garance: Oh my God.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.299
&gt;&gt; Presenter: What do you think.
[laughter]

00:40:58.299 --> 00:41:00.589
&gt;&gt; Garance: I don't know what to say. Umm.
That.

00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:05.539
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It has Noogler on it. Nooglers
means "I'm a new

00:41:05.539 --> 00:41:06.539
Googler."

00:41:06.539 --> 00:41:09.000
&gt;&gt; Garance: Oh, that's so cute. I was saying
about Google doing more pretty stuff.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.430
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Isn't that cute? You don't think
this is pretty? This with my

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:17.809
backpack? You don't think I can rock this
look? [laughter] Really?

00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:19.350
The fashion runways of Paris.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.919
&gt;&gt; Garance: Sense of humor is very important.

00:41:21.919 --> 00:41:26.230
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Yeah, we do have a sense of
humor. Some people may

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.230
not think we're funny.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:30.420
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Okay, then obviously these are
taped up, in advance.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.200
&gt;&gt; Garance: OK, these, I totally love.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.031
&gt;&gt; Presenter: These are kind of cool, right?
I borrowed these from

00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:37.339
my colleague Matt and I don't think he's getting
these

00:41:37.339 --> 00:41:39.390
back. Without the tape.
&gt;&gt;There is something written on the side that

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.220
sounds funny
&gt;&gt; Garance: Optimize your life.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.220
[laughter]

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.220
[laughter].

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:48.250
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I don't know. I just work here.
I think these are

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:49.650
kind of cool, right?.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:53.130
&gt;&gt; Garance: What you should do is take out
the lenses.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:54.130
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Why?

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.769
&gt;&gt; Garance: You pop the lenses. Because then
you become a

00:41:56.769 --> 00:41:58.109
hipster. [laughter] Then nothing.

00:41:58.109 --> 00:42:00.609
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Take my tape off?

00:42:00.609 --> 00:42:06.280
&gt;&gt; Garance: You can keep the tape. Take out
the lenses. And then

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.559
that's cool. They're really cool.

00:42:07.559 --> 00:42:10.329
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Even though it says optimize
your life on the size.

00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:12.000
&gt;&gt; Garance: It's ironic.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.249
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It's ironic. Okay. Well, that's
all I have. Thank you for those

00:42:18.249 --> 00:42:22.559
tips. Does anyone have any questions. And
I'm going to

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:24.880
have to repeat your questions, because we
don't have a

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.460
mic for the audience. Yes?

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.630
&gt;&gt; Female #1: [inaudible].

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:34.920
&gt;&gt;Presenter: What are your top tips for new
fashion bloggers.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.430
&gt;&gt;Garance: All right. So I think I gave a
little bit of that

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:41.480
before, but I think aesthetics is very important.
I

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.320
think now it's caught on. A lot of people
try to do

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:50.349
their blog looking good. I think, you know,
try to think

00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:53.579
of what you have to say -- like, what is your
message?

00:42:53.579 --> 00:42:56.690
What do you want to say to the people that
are going to

00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:02.780
read you? And try to really -- in the beginning,
don't

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:07.250
try to make it too fast, too big. You know,
I think it's

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:11.289
very important to fail and to do some crappy
stuff and

00:43:11.289 --> 00:43:14.810
like then decide, "okay, I'm not going there."
Just like

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:18.530
give yourself time -- say, three months. It's
not a long

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:21.200
time to try things and find your voice. It's
very

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.769
important, because people want to have a blog,
but they

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:28.239
don't know what to say. So just try to find
that.

00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:30.599
Sometimes it can be pretty surprising. You
think, "oh,

00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:33.769
I'm going to be a fashion blogger." And end
up talking

00:43:33.769 --> 00:43:37.330
more about food. It's really important. I
think the

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:44.269
media itself will give you something surprising.
So let

00:43:44.269 --> 00:43:46.570
yourself be surprised. You need anything more?
Then I

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:50.789
think you can engage with the people who comment;
like,

00:43:50.789 --> 00:43:54.460
answer them and everything. I think it's very
nice. And

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:58.960
I try to do it still now even if I have not
a lot of time

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.020
and a lot of comments. So I think it's important.

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.809
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That's great. Anybody else?

00:44:03.809 --> 00:44:08.829
&gt;&gt;Female #2: What's your relationship like
with new designers?

00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:11.710
&gt;&gt; Presenter: The question was, "what is your
relationship like with

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.140
new designers?"

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:18.930
&gt;&gt;Garance: I am very interested in new designers.
But I am also

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:24.089
very tough, because I think a lot of new designers
get a

00:44:24.089 --> 00:44:26.880
lot of credit because they're new designers.
And so, I

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.779
try to see through that thing. And really
-- I know that

00:44:31.779 --> 00:44:34.630
it's difficult to put up a collection when
you don't have

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:38.480
a lot of money because it's the beginning.
But what I

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.660
look for is something that will appeal to
me. You know,

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:49.650
and now and in ten years, not just because
it's a young designer. Yeah. I

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.099
think that's my relationship with -- yeah.

00:44:51.099 --> 00:44:52.440
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Any other questions? Yes ..

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.150
&gt;&gt;Female #3: How has moving to New York changed
your perspective

00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:02.890
and maybe what you write about.
&gt;&gt;Presenter: How has moving to New York changed

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:05.490
your perspective
and maybe what you write about on your blog?

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.940
&gt;&gt; Garance: It's really changed so much. I
think it's just the

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.109
beginning when I realize -- I think what is
the most

00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:18.569
important is the way people think is so different
than in

00:45:18.569 --> 00:45:19.569
France.

00:45:19.569 --> 00:45:23.170
&gt;&gt;Garance: In the beginning you're like, "oh,
it's the same; we're such

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:26.799
a global culture and everything." But then
you come here and everyday I

00:45:26.799 --> 00:45:30.549
have to adapt to a new thing. The whole challenge
is to

00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:34.960
restate myself, to hold on to the few things
that make me

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:41.030
French, but still live here and be part of
it. Lots of

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:44.619
change. Really. I could start to say, but
there is so

00:45:44.619 --> 00:45:49.160
much. I'm very happy to be here. I feel like
much more

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.020
open to the world. It's very important.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.470
&gt;&gt; Presenter: We're glad you're here.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:53.640
&gt;&gt; Garance: Thank you.
[laughter]

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:59.839
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Anybody else? I think I saw
some more hands. Yeah.

00:45:59.839 --> 00:46:02.359
&gt;&gt;Female #4: [inaudible].

00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:05.099
&gt;&gt; Presenter: If you didn't live in New York
or Paris, where would

00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:06.099
you want to live?

00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:14.619
&gt;&gt; Garance: That's a very difficult question.
I think London, but

00:46:14.619 --> 00:46:20.990
just because I was born in a very small island.
Took me

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:24.410
a long time to get to Paris. And as you know
I didn't

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:28.790
even -- it was a complicated move. [chuckles]
I didn't tell you how

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:35.489
it happened, but maybe next time. And when
I realized

00:46:35.489 --> 00:46:38.680
how fantastic it is to have everything here
under your

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.890
hand, you know, and being able to meet the
people. It

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:45.180
would be very difficult for me to go back
to a smaller,

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.690
less international place.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:50.240
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Yeah?

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:54.059
&gt;&gt;Female #5: [inaudible].

00:46:54.059 --> 00:47:00.420
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So what's the direction in fashion
blogging that

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.940
really excites you and what's the thing that
leaves you

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:06.210
less excited was the question.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:14.790
&gt;&gt;Garance: I think what's fascinating right
now is the Tumblr system.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:18.280
I'm looking at it every day and I'm like taking
in all

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:23.759
those images and I wonder how people are driven
to do

00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:26.249
this kind of blogs that are not really blogs
because it's

00:47:26.249 --> 00:47:28.609
not even their content. They're just sharing
and

00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:31.789
everybody's happy like that. I don't know
what it means

00:47:31.789 --> 00:47:33.880
and what's really happening with that. There's
a lot of

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.170
fashion blogs that are Tumblr and everything.
But I

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:40.609
think it's pretty interesting to get to a
place where

00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:44.249
everybody can have a place on the Internet
and put

00:47:44.249 --> 00:47:46.509
something there, because it's so easy to get
the content.

00:47:46.509 --> 00:47:49.460
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It's almost like everyone is
an editor.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.789
&gt;&gt;Garance: exactly
&gt;&gt;Presenter: They can edit

00:47:51.789 --> 00:47:52.789
their own.

00:47:52.789 --> 00:47:56.609
&gt;&gt; Garance: It's very interesting. I'm pretty
excited also

00:47:56.609 --> 00:47:59.809
because I love -- have the feeling to be drunk.
I'm

00:47:59.809 --> 00:48:02.329
looking at all and there is -- when I go down
the page

00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:08.079
there is more images coming. And I love that
feeling.

00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:13.450
What makes me less excited is that I would
be

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:17.470
disappointed in the future if fashion blogging
and, you

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:20.369
know, I don't know so much for the rest, became
really

00:48:20.369 --> 00:48:25.710
like magazines. I think it's -- I love magazines,
but I

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:27.950
think it's good to have a different thing
when you come

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:30.910
online and I think right now with the great
work that

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.860
fashion runs are doing and everything it becomes
a little

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.430
more like you have the feeling you're reading
a magazine.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:40.859
You don't really know where the person stands
and if they

00:48:40.859 --> 00:48:44.309
really love the product or if -- I am really
fighting I

00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:47.900
mean for myself of course but I really hope
that we will

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:53.210
still be able to have places where we feel
that it's not

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:57.750
commercial or -- so I'm more worried about
that. And for

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.779
us, it's more difficult, because of course
I'm trying to

00:49:00.779 --> 00:49:05.029
defend my freedom, but more -- everybody's
doing it so

00:49:05.029 --> 00:49:07.339
people are like, "why don't you do it? Why
don't you do

00:49:07.339 --> 00:49:10.489
it like that? We did it with that person with
that

00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:13.119
person." I'm like, "well, not with me." That's
a little

00:49:13.119 --> 00:49:14.490
bit scary for me.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.540
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Anybody else? No? Oh, sorry.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:25.420
&gt;&gt; Male #1: What do you think about men's
fashion? Like Paris and

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:31.390
New York -- men are really interested in fashion
and you

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.759
think like there should be more blogs about
men's

00:49:33.759 --> 00:49:34.759
fashion.

00:49:34.759 --> 00:49:36.970
&gt;&gt;Presenter: The question was about men's
fashion and what you

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:39.350
think about men's fashion and whether you
think there

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:41.430
should be more blogs about men's fashion.

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:46.079
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah, you know I'm very close
to Scott who does a lot

00:49:46.079 --> 00:49:49.309
of men's fashion. I think it's great. I mean,
right now

00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:51.789
I'm actually like on tumbler. There's a lot
of

00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:55.869
interesting men's fashion blogs. There's a
few magazines

00:49:55.869 --> 00:49:59.539
that are very interesting. I think guys are
getting --

00:49:59.539 --> 00:50:02.490
because I think right now. I don't know how
to say it so

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:07.450
it looks -- but there is a way. Like, to be
a -- there

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.920
is a very, like -- I don't know. Like fashion
is not just

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:17.599
like gay men. It's difficult to say that without
appearing terrible. But you know you can be

00:50:17.599 --> 00:50:21.239
a real guy
and love fashion. And for a long time, it

00:50:21.239 --> 00:50:23.599
was not --
because you would put a magazine and it would

00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:26.770
be naked
guys and I know that for my boyfriend, they

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:30.410
don't want to
really see that, right? It's like -- it was

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:35.170
difficult to
buy a men's magazine or look at and see that.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:39.230
And then,
you had of course like -- I don't know in

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.640
France like
where you had a naked girl. I think we're

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.420
a little bit
past that and I think Scott has done a lot

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:49.869
to change
that. We see that now it's Pitti in Florence.

00:50:49.869 --> 00:50:55.660
It's a men's show
and there's a lot of like -- lot of things

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.220
happening
around it. A lot of publicizing. I think it's

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.789
a great
moment for men's fashion. Don't you think.

00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:06.500
&gt;&gt; Male #1: I don't know. I think it's kind
of slow. For

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.920
example, like at Google.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:14.089
&gt;&gt; Presenter: I just wanted to repeat this
for the camera. He's

00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:16.789
saying that at Google. He's about to give
Google as an

00:51:16.789 --> 00:51:20.979
example of men's fashion -- which is just
funny. Oh, as a counter.

00:51:20.979 --> 00:51:27.619
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [inaudible] a shirt, a tie, some

00:51:27.619 --> 00:51:37.250
shoes. Shoes that tie, that look like actual
shoes. I don't know like I think it's like

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:41.447
taking a lot of time. I agree with you but
I don't know.

00:51:41.447 --> 00:51:43.640
&gt;&gt;Garance: Well, I think it's more like you
have to find your

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.180
sources still. You have to find, you know,
go on

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.279
Internet and try to find those ten what sites
are

00:51:50.279 --> 00:51:54.829
actually. But you know Mr. Porter I think
is really

00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:59.329
cool. And really talks about men and how,
you know, so I

00:51:59.329 --> 00:52:02.460
think there is a lot of things to see and
then to live it

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:06.259
in your own way. It will take some time for
guys to

00:52:06.259 --> 00:52:08.839
really, you know, be at Google, for example,
and talk about

00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:10.240
fashion really.
[laughter]

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:16.309
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Take a long time. Maybe that's
a niche for you to

00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:17.599
start. A little unsolicited job advice.

00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:20.950
&gt;&gt;Garance: I have to say it's very -- men's
fashion has been very

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:24.901
inspiring for me lately more than women's
fashion almost.

00:52:24.901 --> 00:52:25.901
I love what's happening.

00:52:25.901 --> 00:52:26.901
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Yes?

00:52:26.901 --> 00:52:27.901
&gt;&gt; Female #6: I think you just talked about
this. I was going to ask you to kind of stay

00:52:27.901 --> 00:52:28.901
on top of the fashion market,
there are so many resources and so many -- a

00:52:28.901 --> 00:52:33.670
lot of
commercials. Hopefully some niche sources

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:44.420
out there. What are your
top line two or three tips -- just to stay

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:49.029
on top of the
fashion show.

00:52:49.029 --> 00:52:52.599
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So the question again for the
camera -- there are so

00:52:52.599 --> 00:52:55.789
many resources out there for fashion information
and what

00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:59.249
are your top two or three tips for how to
do that -- some

00:52:59.249 --> 00:53:01.999
niche resources and some more mainstream resources.

00:53:01.999 --> 00:53:05.839
&gt;&gt; Garance: I think I just gave up the idea
of staying on top of

00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:10.339
it because there is so much. And I don't feel
like it's

00:53:10.339 --> 00:53:17.039
my mission to be on top of it, fortunately.
So, I go with

00:53:17.039 --> 00:53:19.900
the flow. When I want to read about it, I
look. But I

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:25.319
think -- and there is a lot of websites that
do that. Be

00:53:25.319 --> 00:53:32.599
like Fashionologie. You can find the information.
But

00:53:32.599 --> 00:53:35.539
was your question about really staying on
top of that

00:53:35.539 --> 00:53:38.179
information or staying on top as a fashion
blogger?

00:53:38.179 --> 00:53:43.130
&gt;&gt; Female #6: You know, I'm actually interested
in both. More of like a

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:49.219
general question. If you go to like the pubs,
do you look at Vogue or WWD?

00:53:49.219 --> 00:53:53.920
&gt;&gt; Garance: I look at what's interesting to
me. And I really

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:58.069
don't try to say I have to do that. I should.
I should,

00:53:58.069 --> 00:54:02.069
of course, read women's wear daily every morning.
But

00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:04.470
sometimes I just don't feel like it. And I
think I am

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:08.579
not a reporter. I consider myself more as
an artist.

00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:12.829
And so, an artist doesn't need to be on top
of the

00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:17.690
information, but more, you know, say what
he feels. And

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:20.480
I think that's more my mission. And if I started
talking

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.450
about fashion news or really think that I
need to report

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:26.880
on all that. That would be really boring.
First of all

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.799
because I'm not a journalist and I would do
it in in the

00:54:28.799 --> 00:54:31.910
wrong way and second because you can find
that everywhere

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:37.220
now. So that's my answer. [laughs] I'm not
on top of it.

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.259
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Any last questions?

00:54:39.259 --> 00:54:44.880
&gt;&gt; Female #7: Have you considered or are you
considering becoming a

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.549
designer? Because you have so much taste about
what's

00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:50.380
good or not. So why not.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.319
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So the question is have you
ever considered being a

00:54:53.319 --> 00:54:54.319
designer?

00:54:54.319 --> 00:55:01.100
&gt;&gt; Garance: No, I haven't. I think a great
part of becoming, you

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:05.839
know -- I don't know who I am now is saying
no to some

00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:11.469
stuff. And I think you have to pick your battles.
And

00:55:11.469 --> 00:55:14.499
you know like I love communicating. Being
a fashion

00:55:14.499 --> 00:55:17.210
designer, you know, I really respect that
work and I

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:22.270
think it's a lot of learning and a lot of
failing and a

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:25.400
lot of -- and so, I would never -- maybe I
could do like

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.719
a little stuff, because I really feel I should,
but.

00:55:29.719 --> 00:55:31.730
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Not your line.

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:32.920
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yeah.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:36.729
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Well, Garance, thank you so
very much for being here

00:55:36.729 --> 00:55:39.059
and please come back.

00:55:39.059 --> 00:55:41.759
&gt;&gt; Garance: Yes, I will.

00:55:41.759 --> 00:55:42.759
[Applause]

00:55:42.759 --> 00:55:44.459
&gt;&gt; Garance: Thank you
