00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:05.839
This group of asylum seekers is trying to climb

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.591
the fence that divides Mexico and the United States. 

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:12.429
Among them is a 4-year-old girl,

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.305
accompanied by her mother.

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:25.502
Ada and her 4-year-old daughter Monserrat spent seven weeks

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.880
traveling 2,000 miles from Honduras to Tijuana

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.924
mainly on foot. 

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:35.637
Their aim is to claim asylum in the United States.

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.414
Tijuana's government is restricting humanitarian aid

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:06.376
in an attempt to shut down camps like this. 

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:12.132
Migrants like Ada and her daughter don't have access to bathrooms

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.385
or running water, and many have fallen sick. 

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:35.405
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also adds to their despair 

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:40.410
by limiting the number of people who can seek asylum to a few dozen per day. 

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.371
Because of this restriction,

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.542
thousands have to wait for months before they can reach U.S. soil.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.220
Ada's decision to cross illegally

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.015
and turn herself in to Border Patrol 

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.851
may seem like a way to jump the queue.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:09.105
But climbing the fence in Tijuana is a dangerous choice. 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.486
Many migrants are robbed, kidnapped, hurt or even killed in the attempt.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:20.241
And Ada will also risk being separated from her daughter.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.384
The journey from Honduras to the U.S. can be dangerous for anyone, 

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:41.596
but especially for women and children. 

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:46.476
Ada found safety in numbers by traveling with a caravan.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:13.104
After praying inside the tent, the group heads to the border.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.649
Ada embarked on this journey because

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.569
she and her daughter were being harassed by gangs.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:24.115
She is risking everything to save her daughter's life.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:56.022
Their first attempt at jumping the fence is disrupted by journalists. 

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:11.245
But this group is nowhere close to giving up.
