00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.220
Okay, it's about time we pointed out that there

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.880
are traits that aren't very heritable. Meaning that they

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.440
don't have a high heritability. For example, monozygotic twins

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.500
can easily be discordant with regards to religious belief. This

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.840
touches back more on what we discussed in lesson

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.810
one, where we first introduced the idea of traits. And

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.160
we discussed the idea of a learned versus innate

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.860
trait. In this case we're talking about a lower heritability,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.070
meaning that it's more of a learned trait. It

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.670
has more to do with your environmental factors, such

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.860
as which culture a person might be raised in.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.034
So in other words the low concordance rate of religious

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:42.139
belief between a monozygotic twins results in a lower

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:45.212
heritability. So let's think about it again on our

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:48.737
scale of heritability. Religious belief would be down here

00:00:48.737 --> 00:00:51.886
because the variation we see in our population of people

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:54.834
who believe in different things has very little to do

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:57.963
with any kind of genetic factor at all. It's all based

00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:00.505
on how this person was raised, where as the other

00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:03.605
end of the spectrum we have one of the highest heritabilites

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.928
for eye color. Because this is largely controlled by your

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:11.100
genetics. The environment has almost nothing to do with this trait.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.060
And then we could have a trait somewhere in the middle.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.890
Like lung cancer, which we know can be heritable due to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.370
genetic factors. But in the human population, we

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.540
see a lot of variability in this trait.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.970
Due to environmental components, such as cigarette smoking.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.890
So remember, in our journey to better understand complex

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.590
traits. When we use our twin studies to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.380
determine or estimate an amount of heritability. We're

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.900
much better off following up genetically on those

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.290
traits that appear to have a larger genetic component.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.340
Than those that don't.
