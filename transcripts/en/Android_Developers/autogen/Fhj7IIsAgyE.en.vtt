your error messaging consistent and

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:28.890
your error messaging consistent and
 

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.160
your error messaging consistent and
that's actually fairly hard to achieve

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.170
that's actually fairly hard to achieve
 

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.620
that's actually fairly hard to achieve
consistent messaging you need to take a

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:33.630
consistent messaging you need to take a
 

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.680
consistent messaging you need to take a
step back and look at your app at a

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:36.690
step back and look at your app at a
 

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.420
step back and look at your app at a

the network here so let's apply a few of

the network here so let's apply a few of
 

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:57.980
the network here so let's apply a few of
these ideas to our example right we can

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:57.990
these ideas to our example right we can
 

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.170

annoyed users right so let's try to find

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360
annoyed users right so let's try to find
 

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.230
annoyed users right so let's try to find
a way of gracefully degrading that for

a way of gracefully degrading that for
 

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.460
a way of gracefully degrading that for
the sake of the example again let's

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:25.470
the sake of the example again let's
 

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.350
the sake of the example again let's
imagine the simple ticket purchasing

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360

is the first step then we're gonna have

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480
is the first step then we're gonna have
 

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.660
is the first step then we're gonna have

what is the GPU overhead well you cannot
avoid all over draw but lower is better

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.070
avoid all over draw but lower is better
 

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.820

so make my trip which we did mention

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:19.830
so make my trip which we did mention
 

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.190
so make my trip which we did mention
